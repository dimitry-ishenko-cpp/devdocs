DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>io_uring </b>is a Linux-specific API for asynchronous I/O.  It allows
       the user to submit one or more I/O requests, which are processed
       asynchronously without blocking the calling process.  <b>io_uring</b>
       gets its name from ring buffers which are shared between user
       space and kernel space. This arrangement allows for efficient
       I/O, while avoiding the overhead of copying buffers between them,
       where possible.  This interface makes <b>io_uring </b>different from
       other UNIX I/O APIs, wherein, rather than just communicate
       between kernel and user space with system calls, ring buffers are
       used as the main mode of communication.  This arrangement has
       various performance benefits which are discussed in a separate
       section below.  This man page uses the terms shared buffers,
       shared ring buffers and queues interchangeably.

       The general programming model you need to follow for <b>io_uring </b>is
       outlined below

       •      Set up shared buffers with <a href="../man2/io_uring_setup.2.html">io_uring_setup(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>,
              mapping into user space shared buffers for the submission
              queue (SQ) and the completion queue (CQ).  You place I/O
              requests you want to make on the SQ, while the kernel
              places the results of those operations on the CQ.

       •      For every I/O request you need to make (like to read a
              file, write a file, accept a socket connection, etc), you
              create a submission queue entry, or SQE, describe the I/O
              operation you need to get done and add it to the tail of
              the submission queue (SQ).  Each I/O operation is, in
              essence, the equivalent of a system call you would have
              made otherwise, if you were not using <b>io_uring</b>.  You can
              add more than one SQE to the queue depending on the number
              of operations you want to request.

       •      After you add one or more SQEs, you need to call
              <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a> to tell the kernel to dequeue your I/O
              requests off the SQ and begin processing them.

       •      For each SQE you submit, once it is done processing the
              request, the kernel places a completion queue event or CQE
              at the tail of the completion queue or CQ.  The kernel
              places exactly one matching CQE in the CQ for every SQE
              you submit on the SQ.  After you retrieve a CQE,
              minimally, you might be interested in checking the <i>res</i>
              field of the CQE structure, which corresponds to the
              return value of the system call's equivalent, had you used
              it directly without using <b>io_uring</b>.  For instance, a read
              operation under <b>io_uring</b>, started with the <b>IORING_OP_READ</b>
              operation, issues the equivalent of the <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> system
              call. In practice, it mixes the semantics of <a href="../man2/pread.2.html">pread(2)</a> and
              <a href="../man2/preadv2.2.html">preadv2(2)</a> in that it takes an explicit offset, and
              supports using -1 for the offset to indicate that the
              current file position should be used instead of passing in
              an explicit offset. See the opcode documentation for more
              details. Given that io_uring is an async interface, <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
              is never used for passing back error information. Instead,
              <i>res</i> will contain what the equivalent system call would
              have returned in case of success, and in case of error <i>res</i>
              will contain <i>-errno .</i>  For example, if the normal read
              system call would have returned -1 and set <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>EINVAL</b>
              <b>, </b>then <i>res</i> would contain <b>-EINVAL .  </b>If the normal system
              call would have returned a read size of 1024, then <i>res</i>
              would contain 1024.

       •      Optionally, <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a> can also wait for a
              specified number of requests to be processed by the kernel
              before it returns.  If you specified a certain number of
              completions to wait for, the kernel would have placed at
              least those many number of CQEs on the CQ, which you can
              then readily read, right after the return from
              <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a>.

       •      It is important to remember that I/O requests submitted to
              the kernel can complete in any order.  It is not necessary
              for the kernel to process one request after another, in
              the order you placed them.  Given that the interface is a
              ring, the requests are attempted in order, however that
              doesn't imply any sort of ordering on their completion.
              When more than one request is in flight, it is not
              possible to determine which one will complete first.  When
              you dequeue CQEs off the CQ, you should always check which
              submitted request it corresponds to.  The most common
              method for doing so is utilizing the <i>user_data</i> field in
              the request, which is passed back on the completion side.

       Adding to and reading from the queues:

       •      You add SQEs to the tail of the SQ.  The kernel reads SQEs
              off the head of the queue.

       •      The kernel adds CQEs to the tail of the CQ.  You read CQEs
              off the head of the queue.

   <b>Submission queue polling</b>
       One of the goals of <b>io_uring </b>is to provide a means for efficient
       I/O.  To this end, <b>io_uring </b>supports a polling mode that lets you
       avoid the call to <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a>, which you use to inform the
       kernel that you have queued SQEs on to the SQ.  With SQ Polling,
       <b>io_uring </b>starts a kernel thread that polls the submission queue
       for any I/O requests you submit by adding SQEs.  With SQ Polling
       enabled, there is no need for you to call <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a>,
       letting you avoid the overhead of system calls.  A designated
       kernel thread dequeues SQEs off the SQ as you add them and
       dispatches them for asynchronous processing.

   <b>Setting up io_uring</b>
       The main steps in setting up <b>io_uring </b>consist of mapping in the
       shared buffers with <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> calls.  In the example program
       included in this man page, the function <b>app_setup_uring</b>() sets up
       <b>io_uring </b>with a QUEUE_DEPTH deep submission queue.  Pay attention
       to the 2 <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> calls that set up the shared submission and
       completion queues.  If your kernel is older than version 5.4,
       three <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a> calls are required.

   <b>Submitting I/O requests</b>
       The process of submitting a request consists of describing the
       I/O operation you need to get done using an <b>io_uring_sqe</b>
       structure instance.  These details describe the equivalent system
       call and its parameters.  Because the range of I/O operations
       Linux supports are very varied and the <b>io_uring_sqe </b>structure
       needs to be able to describe them, it has several fields, some
       packed into unions for space efficiency.  Here is a simplified
       version of struct <b>io_uring_sqe </b>with some of the most often used
       fields:

           struct io_uring_sqe {
                   __u8    opcode;         /* type of operation for this sqe */
                   __s32   fd;             /* file descriptor to do IO on */
                   __u64   off;            /* offset into file */
                   __u64   addr;           /* pointer to buffer or iovecs */
                   __u32   len;            /* buffer size or number of iovecs */
                   __u64   user_data;      /* data to be passed back at completion time */
                   __u8    flags;          /* IOSQE_ flags */
                   ...
           };

       Here is struct <b>io_uring_sqe </b>in full:

           struct io_uring_sqe {
                   __u8    opcode;         /* type of operation for this sqe */
                   __u8    flags;          /* IOSQE_ flags */
                   __u16   ioprio;         /* ioprio for the request */
                   __s32   fd;             /* file descriptor to do IO on */
                   union {
                           __u64   off;    /* offset into file */
                           __u64   addr2;
                   };
                   union {
                           __u64   addr;   /* pointer to buffer or iovecs */
                           __u64   splice_off_in;
                   };
                   __u32   len;            /* buffer size or number of iovecs */
                   union {
                           __kernel_rwf_t  rw_flags;
                           __u32           fsync_flags;
                           __u16           poll_events;    /* compatibility */
                           __u32           poll32_events;  /* word-reversed for BE */
                           __u32           sync_range_flags;
                           __u32           msg_flags;

                           __u32           splice_flags;
                   };
                   __u64   user_data;      /* data to be passed back at completion time */
                   union {
                           struct {
                                   /* pack this to avoid bogus arm OABI complaints */
                                   union {
                                           /* index into fixed buffers, if used */
                                           __u16   buf_index;
                                           /* for grouped buffer selection */
                                           __u16   buf_group;
                                   } __attribute__((packed));
                                   /* personality to use, if used */
                                   __u16   personality;
                                   __s32   splice_fd_in;
                           };
                           __u64   __pad2[3];
                   };
           };

       To submit an I/O request to <b>io_uring</b>, you need to acquire a
       submission queue entry (SQE) from the submission queue (SQ), fill
       it up with details of the operation you want to submit and call
       <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a>.  There are helper functions of the form
       io_uring_prep_X to enable proper setup of the SQE. If you want to
       avoid calling <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a>, you have the option of setting
       up Submission Queue Polling.

       SQEs are added to the tail of the submission queue.  The kernel
       picks up SQEs off the head of the SQ.  The general algorithm to
       get the next available SQE and update the tail is as follows.

           struct io_uring_sqe *sqe;
           unsigned tail, index;
           tail = *sqring-&gt;tail;
           index = tail &amp; (*sqring-&gt;ring_mask);
           sqe = &amp;sqring-&gt;sqes[index];
           /* fill up details about this I/O request */
           describe_io(sqe);
           /* fill the sqe index into the SQ ring array */
           sqring-&gt;array[index] = index;
           tail++;
           atomic_store_explicit(sqring-&gt;tail, tail, memory_order_release);

       To get the index of an entry, the application must mask the
       current tail index with the size mask of the ring.  This holds
       true for both SQs and CQs.  Once the SQE is acquired, the
       necessary fields are filled in, describing the request.  While
       the CQ ring directly indexes the shared array of CQEs, the
       submission side has an indirection array between them.  The
       submission side ring buffer is an index into this array, which in
       turn contains the index into the SQEs.

       The following code snippet demonstrates how a read operation, an
       equivalent of a <a href="../man2/preadv2.2.html">preadv2(2)</a> system call is described by filling up
       an SQE with the necessary parameters.

           struct iovec iovecs[16];
            ...
           sqe-&gt;opcode = IORING_OP_READV;
           sqe-&gt;fd = fd;
           sqe-&gt;addr = (unsigned long) iovecs;
           sqe-&gt;len = 16;
           sqe-&gt;off = offset;
           sqe-&gt;flags = 0;

       <b>Memory ordering</b>
              Modern compilers and CPUs freely reorder reads and writes
              without affecting the program's outcome to optimize
              performance.  Some aspects of this need to be kept in mind
              on SMP systems since <b>io_uring </b>involves buffers shared
              between kernel and user space.  These buffers are both
              visible and modifiable from kernel and user space.  As
              heads and tails belonging to these shared buffers are
              updated by kernel and user space, changes need to be
              coherently visible on either side, irrespective of whether
              a CPU switch took place after the kernel-user mode switch
              happened.  We use memory barriers to enforce this
              coherency.  Being significantly large subjects on their
              own, memory barriers are out of scope for further
              discussion on this man page.

       <b>Letting the kernel know about I/O submissions</b>
              Once you place one or more SQEs on to the SQ, you need to
              let the kernel know that you've done so.  You can do this
              by calling the <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a> system call.  This system
              call is also capable of waiting for a specified count of
              events to complete.  This way, you can be sure to find
              completion events in the completion queue without having
              to poll it for events later.

   <b>Reading completion events</b>
       Similar to the submission queue (SQ), the completion queue (CQ)
       is a shared buffer between the kernel and user space.  Whereas
       you placed submission queue entries on the tail of the SQ and the
       kernel read off the head, when it comes to the CQ, the kernel
       places completion queue events or CQEs on the tail of the CQ and
       you read off its head.

       Submission is flexible (and thus a bit more complicated) since it
       needs to be able to encode different types of system calls that
       take various parameters.  Completion, on the other hand is
       simpler since we're looking only for a return value back from the
       kernel.  This is easily understood by looking at the completion
       queue event structure, struct <b>io_uring_cqe</b>:

           struct io_uring_cqe {
                __u64     user_data;  /* sqe-&gt;data submission passed back */
                __s32     res;        /* result code for this event */
                __u32     flags;
           };

       Here, <i>user_data</i> is custom data that is passed unchanged from
       submission to completion.  That is, from SQEs to CQEs.  This
       field can be used to set context, uniquely identifying
       submissions that got completed.  Given that I/O requests can
       complete in any order, this field can be used to correlate a
       submission with a completion.  <i>res</i> is the result from the system
       call that was performed as part of the submission; its return
       value.

       The <i>flags</i> field carries request-specific information. As of the
       6.0 kernel, the following flags are defined:

       <b>IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER</b>
              If set, the upper 16 bits of the flags field carries the
              buffer ID that was chosen for this request. The request
              must have been issued with <b>IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT </b>set, and
              used with a request type that supports buffer selection.
              Additionally, buffers must have been provided upfront
              either via the <b>IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS </b>or the
              <b>IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING </b>methods.

       <b>IORING_CQE_F_MORE</b>
              If set, the application should expect more completions
              from the request. This is used for requests that can
              generate multiple completions, such as multi-shot
              requests, receive, or accept.

       <b>IORING_CQE_F_SOCK_NONEMPTY</b>
              If set, upon receiving the data from the socket in the
              current request, the socket still had data left on
              completion of this request.

       <b>IORING_CQE_F_NOTIF</b>
              Set for notification CQEs, as seen with the zero-copy
              networking send and receive support.

       The general sequence to read completion events off the completion
       queue is as follows:

           unsigned head;
           head = *cqring-&gt;head;
           if (head != atomic_load_acquire(cqring-&gt;tail)) {
               struct io_uring_cqe *cqe;
               unsigned index;
               index = head &amp; (cqring-&gt;mask);
               cqe = &amp;cqring-&gt;cqes[index];
               /* process completed CQE */
               process_cqe(cqe);
               /* CQE consumption complete */

       It helps to be reminded that the kernel adds CQEs to the tail of
       the CQ, while you need to dequeue them off the head.  To get the
       index of an entry at the head, the application must mask the
       current head index with the size mask of the ring.  Once the CQE
       has been consumed or processed, the head needs to be updated to
       reflect the consumption of the CQE.  Attention should be paid to
       the read and write barriers to ensure successful read and update
       of the head.

   <b>io_uring performance</b>
       Because of the shared ring buffers between kernel and user space,
       <b>io_uring </b>can be a zero-copy system.  Copying buffers to and from
       becomes necessary when system calls that transfer data between
       kernel and user space are involved.  But since the bulk of the
       communication in <b>io_uring </b>is via buffers shared between the
       kernel and user space, this huge performance overhead is
       completely avoided.

       While system calls may not seem like a significant overhead, in
       high performance applications, making a lot of them will begin to
       matter.  While workarounds the operating system has in place to
       deal with Spectre and Meltdown are ideally best done away with,
       unfortunately, some of these workarounds are around the system
       call interface, making system calls not as cheap as before on
       affected hardware.  While newer hardware should not need these
       workarounds, hardware with these vulnerabilities can be expected
       to be in the wild for a long time.  While using synchronous
       programming interfaces or even when using asynchronous
       programming interfaces under Linux, there is at least one system
       call involved in the submission of each request.  In <b>io_uring</b>, on
       the other hand, you can batch several requests in one go, simply
       by queueing up multiple SQEs, each describing an I/O operation
       you want and make a single call to <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a>.  This is
       possible due to <b>io_uring</b>'s shared buffers based design.

       While this batching in itself can avoid the overhead associated
       with potentially multiple and frequent system calls, you can
       reduce even this overhead further with Submission Queue Polling,
       by having the kernel poll and pick up your SQEs for processing as
       you add them to the submission queue. This avoids the
       <a href="../man2/io_uring_enter.2.html">io_uring_enter(2)</a> call you need to make to tell the kernel to
       pick SQEs up.  For high-performance applications, this means even
       fewer system call overheads.

CONFORMING TO </h2>

       <b>io_uring </b>is Linux-specific.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following example uses <b>io_uring </b>to copy stdin to stdout.
       Using shell redirection, you should be able to copy files with
       this example.  Because it uses a queue depth of only one, this
       example processes I/O requests one after the other.  It is
       purposefully kept this way to aid understanding.  In real-world
       scenarios however, you'll want to have a larger queue depth to
       parallelize I/O request processing so as to gain the kind of
       performance benefits <b>io_uring </b>provides with its asynchronous
       processing of requests.
