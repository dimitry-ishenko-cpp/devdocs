NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd.image-policy - Disk Image Dissection Policy
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       In systemd, whenever a disk image (DDI) implementing the
       <b>Discoverable Partitions Specification</b>[1] is activated, a policy
       may be specified controlling which partitions to mount and what
       kind of cryptographic protection to require. Such a disk image
       dissection policy is a string that contains per-partition-type
       rules, separated by colons (":"). The individual rules consist of
       a partition identifier, an equal sign ("="), and one or more
       flags which may be set per partition. If multiple flags are
       specified per partition they are separated by a plus sign ("+").

       The partition identifiers currently defined are: <b>root</b>, <b>usr</b>, <b>home</b>,
       <b>srv</b>, <b>esp</b>, <b>xbootldr</b>, <b>swap</b>, <b>root-verity</b>, <b>root-verity-sig</b>,
       <b>usr-verity</b>, <b>usr-verity-sig</b>, <b>tmp</b>, <b>var</b>. These identifiers match the
       relevant partition types in the Discoverable Partitions
       Specification, but are agnostic to CPU architectures. If the
       partition identifier is left empty it defines the <i>default</i> policy
       for partitions defined in the Discoverable Partitions
       Specification for which no policy flags are explicitly listed in
       the policy string.

       The following partition policy flags are defined that dictate the
       existence/absence, the use, and the protection level of
       partitions:

       •   <b>unprotected </b>for partitions that shall exist and be used, but
           shall come without cryptographic protection, lacking both
           Verity authentication and LUKS encryption.

       •   <b>verity </b>for partitions that shall exist and be used, with
           Verity authentication. (Note: if a DDI image carries a data
           partition, along with a Verity partition and a signature
           partition for it, and only the <b>verity </b>flag is set (<b>signed </b>is
           not), then the image will be set up with Verity, but the
           signature data will not be used. Or in other words: any DDI
           with a set of partitions that qualify for <b>signature </b>also
           implicitly qualifies for <b>verity</b>, and in fact also
           <b>unprotected</b>).

       •   <b>signed </b>for partitions that shall exist and be used, with
           Verity authentication, which are also accompanied by a PKCS#7
           signature of the Verity root hash.

       •   <b>encrypted </b>for partitions which shall exist and be used and
           are encrypted with LUKS.

       •   <b>unused </b>for partitions that shall exist but shall not be used.

       •   <b>absent </b>for partitions that shall not exist on the image.

       By setting a combination of the flags above, alternatives can be
       declared. For example the combination "unused+absent" means: the
       partition may exist (in which case it shall not be used) or may
       be absent. The combination of
       "unprotected+verity+signed+encrypted+unused+absent" may be
       specified via the special shortcut "open", and indicates that the
       partition may exist or may be absent, but if it exists is used,
       regardless of the protection level.

       As special rule: if none of the flags above are set for a listed
       partition identifier, the default policy of <b>open </b>is implied, i.e.
       setting none of these flags listed above means effectively all
       flags listed above will be set.

       The following partition policy flags are defined that dictate the
       state of specific GPT partition flags:

       •   <b>read-only-off</b>, <b>read-only-on </b>to require that the partitions
           have the read-only partition flag off or on.

       •   <b>growfs-off</b>, <b>growfs-on </b>to require that the partitions have the
           growfs partition flag off or on.

       If both <b>read-only-off </b>and <b>read-only-on </b>are set for a partition,
       then the state of the read-only flag on the partition is not
       dictated by the policy. Setting neither flag is equivalent to
       setting both, i.e. setting neither of these two flags means
       effectively both will be set. A similar logic applies to
       <b>growfs-off</b>/<b>growfs-on</b>.

       If partitions are not listed within an image policy string, the
       default policy flags are applied (configurable via an empty
       partition identifier, see above). If no default policy flags are
       configured in the policy string, it is implied to be
       "absent+unused", except for the Verity partition and their
       signature partitions where the policy is automatically derived
       from minimal protection level of the data partition they protect,
       as encoded in the policy.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIAL POLICIES </h2>
<pre>
       The special image policy string "*" is short for "use
       everything", i.e. is equivalent to:

           =verity+signed+encrypted+unprotected+unused+absent

       The special image policy string "-" is short for "use nothing",
       i.e. is equivalent to:

           =unused+absent

       The special image policy string "~" is short for "everything must
       be absent", i.e. is equivalent to:

           =absent
</pre> <h2>
USE </h2>
<pre>
       Most systemd components that support operating with disk images
       support a <b>--image-policy= </b>command line option to specify the
       image policy to use, and default to relatively open policies
       (typically the "*" policy, as described above), under the
       assumption that trust in disk images is established before the
       images are passed to the program in question.

       For the host image itself <a href="../man8/systemd-gpt-auto-generator.8.html">systemd-gpt-auto-generator(8)</a> is
       responsible for processing the GPT partition table and making use
       of the included discoverable partitions. It accepts an image
       policy via the kernel command line option <b>systemd.image-policy=</b>.

       Note that image policies do not dictate how the components will
       mount and use disk images — they only dictate which parts to
       avoid and which protection level and arrangement to require while
       mounting/using them. For example, <a href="../man8/systemd-sysext.8.html">systemd-sysext(8)</a> only cares
       for the /usr/ and /opt/ trees inside a disk image, and thus
       ignores any /home/ partitions (and similar) in all cases, which
       might be included in the image, regardless whether the configured
       image policy would allow access to it or not. Similar,
       <a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a> is not going to make use of any discovered swap
       device, regardless if the policy would allow that or not.

       Use the <b>image-policy </b>command of the <b>systemd-analyze</b>(8) tool to
       analyze image policy strings, and determine what a specific
       policy string means for a specific partition.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following image policy string dictates one read-only
       Verity-enabled /usr/ partition must exist, plus encrypted root
       and swap partitions. All other partitions are ignored:

           usr=verity+read-only-on:root=encrypted:swap=encrypted

       The following image policy string dictates an encrypted, writable
       root file system, and optional /srv/ file system that must be
       encrypted if it exists and no swap partition may exist:

           root=encrypted+read-only-off:srv=encrypted+absent:swap=absent

       The following image policy string dictates a single root
       partition that may be encrypted, but doesn't have to be, and
       ignores swap partitions, and uses all other partitions if they
       are available, possibly with encryption.

           root=unprotected+encrypted:swap=absent+unused:=unprotected+encrypted+absent
