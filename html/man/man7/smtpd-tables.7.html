NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>smtpd-tables </b>— table API for the smtpd daemon
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>smtpd</i>(8) daemon provides a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
       (SMTPD) implementation, which allows ordinary machines to become
       Mail eXchangers (MX).  Some features that are commonly used by
       MX, such as querying databases for user credentials, are outside
       of the scope of SMTP and too complex to fit in <i>smtpd</i>(8).

       Because an MX may need to provide these features, <i>smtpd</i>(8)
       provides an API to implement <i>table</i>(5) backends with a simple
       text-based protocol.
</pre> <h2>
DESIGN </h2>
<pre>
       <b>smtpd-tables </b>are programs that run as unique standalone
       processes, they do not share <i>smtpd</i>(8) address space.  They are
       executed by <i>smtpd</i>(8) at startup and expected to run in an
       infinite loop, reading events and queries from standard input and
       writing responses to standard output.  They are not allowed to
       terminate.

       Because <b>smtpd-tables </b>are standalone programs that communicate
       with <i>smtpd</i>(8), they may run as different users than <i>smtpd</i>(8) and
       may be written in any language.  <b>smtpd-tables </b>must not use
       blocking I/O, they must support answering asynchronously to
       <i>smtpd</i>(8).
</pre> <h2>
PROTOCOL </h2>
<pre>
       The protocol consist of human-readable lines exchanged between
       <b>smtpd-tables </b>and <i>smtpd</i>(8).

       The protocol begins with a handshake.  First, <i>smtpd</i>(8) provides
       <b>smtpd-tables </b>with general configuration information in the form
       of key-value lines, terminated by ‘config|ready’.  For example:

             config|smtpd-version|7.5.0
             config|protocol|0.1
             config|tablename|devs
             config|ready

       Then, <b>smtpd-tables </b>register the supported services, terminating
       with ‘register|ready’.  For example:

             register|alias
             register|credentials
             register|ready

       Finally, <i>smtpd</i>(8) can start querying the table.  For example:

             table|0.1|1713795082.354255|devs|lookup|alias|b72508d|op

       The “|” character is used to separate the fields and may only
       appear verbatim in the last field of the payload, in which case
       it should be considered a regular character and not a separator.
       No other field may contain a “|”.

       Each request has a common set of fields, followed by some other
       fields that are operation-specific.  The common format consists
       of a protocol prefix ‘table’, the protocol version, the timestamp
       and the table name.  For example:

             table|0.1|1713795091.202157|devs

       The protocol is inherently asynchronous, so multiple request may
       be sent without waiting for the table to reply.  All the replies
       have a common prefix, followed by the operation-specific
       response.  The common format consist of a prefix with the
       operation name in followed by ‘-result’, and the unique ID of the
       request.  For example:

             lookup-result|b72508d

       The list of operations, operation-specific parameters and
       responses are as follows:

       <b>update </b><i>id</i>
               Ask the table to reload its configuration.  The result is
               either ‘ok’ on success or ‘error’ and a message upon a
               failure to do so.

       <b>check </b><i>service id query</i>
               Check whether <i>query</i> is present in the table.  The result
               is ‘found’ if found, ‘not-found’ if not, or ‘error’ and a
               message upon an error.

       <b>lookup </b><i>service id query</i>
               Look up a value in the table for given the <i>query</i>.  The
               result is ‘found’ and the value if found, ‘not-found’ if
               not found, or ‘error’ and a message upon an error.

       <b>fetch </b><i>service id</i>
               Fetch the next item from the table, eventually wrapping
               around.  It is only supported for the <b>source </b>and
               <b>relayhost </b>services.  The result is ‘found’ and the value
               if found, ‘not-found’ if the table is empty, or ‘error’
               and a message upon an error.

       Each service has a specific format for the result.  The exact
       syntax for the values and eventually the keys are described in
       <i>table</i>(5).  The services and their result format are as follows:

       <b>alias        </b>One or more aliases separated by a comma.
       <b>domain       </b>A domain name.
       <b>credentials  </b>The user name, followed by ‘:’ and the encrypted
                    password as per <i>smtpctl</i>(8) <b>encrypt </b>subcommand.
       <b>netaddr      </b>IPv4 and IPv6 address or netmask.
       <b>userinfo     </b>The user id, followed by ‘:’ then the group id, then
                    ‘:’ and finally the home directory.
       <b>source       </b>IPv4 and IPv6 address.
       <b>mailaddr     </b>An username, a domain or a full email address.
       <b>addrname     </b>Used to map IP addresses to hostnames.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Assuming the table is called “devs”, here's an example of a
       failed <b>update </b>transaction:

             table|0.1|1713795097.394049|devs|update|478ff0d2
             update-result|478ff0d2|error|failed to connect to the database

       A <b>check </b>request for the <b>netaddr </b>service for the 192.168.0.7 IPv4
       address which is not in the table:

             table|0.1|1713795103.314423|devs|check|netaddr|e5862859|192.168.0.7
             check-result|e5862859|not-found

       A successful <b>lookup </b>request for the <b>userinfo </b>service for the user
       ‘op’:

             table|0.1|1713795110.354921|devs|lookup|userinfo|f993c74|op
             lookup-result|f993c74|found|1000:1000:/home/op

       A series of <b>fetch </b>requests for the <b>source </b>service that wraps
       around:

             table|0.1|1713795116.227321|devs|fetch|source|189bd3ee
             lookup-result|189bd3ee|found|192.168.1.7
             table|0.1|1713795120.162438|devs|fetch|source|9e4c56d4
             lookup-result|9e4c56d4|found|10.0.0.8
             table|0.1|1713795122.930928|devs|fetch|source|f2c8b906
             lookup-result|f2c8b906|found|192.168.1.7
