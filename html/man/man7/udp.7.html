DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is an implementation of the User Datagram Protocol described
       in RFC 768.  It implements a connectionless, unreliable datagram
       packet service.  Packets may be reordered or duplicated before
       they arrive.  UDP generates and checks checksums to catch
       transmission errors.

       When a UDP socket is created, its local and remote addresses are
       unspecified.  Datagrams can be sent immediately using <a href="../man2/sendto.2.html">sendto(2)</a>
       or <a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg(2)</a> with a valid destination address as an argument.
       When <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> is called on the socket, the default destination
       address is set and datagrams can now be sent using <a href="../man2/send.2.html">send(2)</a> or
       <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> without specifying a destination address.  It is still
       possible to send to other destinations by passing an address to
       <a href="../man2/sendto.2.html">sendto(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg(2)</a>.  In order to receive packets, the socket
       can be bound to a local address first by using <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a>.
       Otherwise, the socket layer will automatically assign a free
       local port out of the range defined by
       <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range</i> and bind the socket to
       <b>INADDR_ANY</b>.

       All receive operations return only one packet.  When the packet
       is smaller than the passed buffer, only that much data is
       returned; when it is bigger, the packet is truncated and the
       <b>MSG_TRUNC </b>flag is set.  <b>MSG_WAITALL </b>is not supported.

       IP options may be sent or received using the socket options
       described in <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>.  They are processed by the kernel only when
       the appropriate <i>/proc</i> parameter is enabled (but still passed to
       the user even when it is turned off).  See <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>.

       When the <b>MSG_DONTROUTE </b>flag is set on sending, the destination
       address must refer to a local interface address and the packet is
       sent only to that interface.

       By default, Linux UDP does path MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
       discovery.  This means the kernel will keep track of the MTU to a
       specific target IP address and return <b>EMSGSIZE </b>when a UDP packet
       write exceeds it.  When this happens, the application should
       decrease the packet size.  Path MTU discovery can be also turned
       off using the <b>IP_MTU_DISCOVER </b>socket option or the
       <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc</i> file; see <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a> for details.
       When turned off, UDP will fragment outgoing UDP packets that
       exceed the interface MTU.  However, disabling it is not
       recommended for performance and reliability reasons.

   <b>Address format</b>
       UDP uses the IPv4 <i>sockaddr_in</i> address format described in <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a>.

   <b>Error handling</b>
       All fatal errors will be passed to the user as an error return
       even when the socket is not connected.  This includes
       asynchronous errors received from the network.  You may get an
       error for an earlier packet that was sent on the same socket.
       This behavior differs from many other BSD socket implementations
       which don't pass any errors unless the socket is connected.
       Linux's behavior is mandated by <b>RFC 1122</b>.

       For compatibility with legacy code, in Linux 2.0 and 2.2 it was
       possible to set the <b>SO_BSDCOMPAT SOL_SOCKET </b>option to receive
       remote errors only when the socket has been connected (except for
       <b>EPROTO </b>and <b>EMSGSIZE</b>).  Locally generated errors are always
       passed.  Support for this socket option was removed in later
       kernels; see <a href="socket.7.html">socket(7)</a> for further information.

       When the <b>IP_RECVERR </b>option is enabled, all errors are stored in
       the socket error queue, and can be received by <a href="../man2/recvmsg.2.html">recvmsg(2)</a> with
       the <b>MSG_ERRQUEUE </b>flag set.

   <b>/proc interfaces</b>
       System-wide UDP parameter settings can be accessed by files in
       the directory <i>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/</i>.

       <i>udp_mem</i> (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This is a vector of three integers governing the number of
              pages allowed for queueing by all UDP sockets.

              <i>min</i>    Below this number of pages, UDP is not bothered
                     about its memory appetite.  When the amount of
                     memory allocated by UDP exceeds this number, UDP
                     starts to moderate memory usage.

              <i>pressure</i>
                     This value was introduced to follow the format of
                     <i>tcp_mem</i> (see <a href="tcp.7.html">tcp(7)</a>).

              <i>max</i>    Number of pages allowed for queueing by all UDP
                     sockets.

              Defaults values for these three items are calculated at
              boot time from the amount of available memory.

       <i>udp_rmem_min</i> (integer; default value: PAGE_SIZE; since Linux
       2.6.25)
              Minimal size, in bytes, of receive buffers used by UDP
              sockets in moderation.  Each UDP socket is able to use the
              size for receiving data, even if total pages of UDP
              sockets exceed <i>udp_mem</i> pressure.

       <i>udp_wmem_min</i> (integer; default value: PAGE_SIZE; since Linux
       2.6.25)
              Minimal size, in bytes, of send buffer used by UDP sockets
              in moderation.  Each UDP socket is able to use the size
              for sending data, even if total pages of UDP sockets
              exceed <i>udp_mem</i> pressure.

   <b>Socket options</b>
       To set or get a UDP socket option, call <a href="../man2/getsockopt.2.html">getsockopt(2)</a> to read or
       <a href="../man2/setsockopt.2.html">setsockopt(2)</a> to write the option with the option level argument
       set to <b>IPPROTO_UDP</b>.  Unless otherwise noted, <i>optval</i> is a pointer
       to an <i>int</i>.

       Following is a list of UDP-specific socket options.  For details
       of some other socket options that are also applicable for UDP
       sockets, see <a href="socket.7.html">socket(7)</a>.

       <b>UDP_CORK </b>(since Linux 2.5.44)
              If this option is enabled, then all data output on this
              socket is accumulated into a single datagram that is
              transmitted when the option is disabled.  This option
              should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       <b>UDP_SEGMENT </b>(since Linux 4.18)
              Enables UDP segmentation offload.  Segmentation offload
              reduces <a href="../man2/send.2.html">send(2)</a> cost by transferring multiple datagrams
              worth of data as a single large packet through the kernel
              transmit path, even when that exceeds MTU.  As late as
              possible, the large packet is split by segment size into a
              series of datagrams.  This segmentation offload step is
              deferred to hardware if supported, else performed in
              software.  This option takes a value in the range
              [<b>0</b>, <b>USHRT_MAX</b>] that sets the segment size: the size of
              datagram payload, excluding the UDP header.  The segment
              size must be chosen such that at most 64 datagrams are
              sent in a single call and that the datagrams after
              segmentation meet the same MTU rules that apply to
              datagrams sent without this option.  Segmentation offload
              depends on checksum offload, as datagram checksums are
              computed after segmentation.  The option may also be set
              for individual <a href="../man2/sendmsg.2.html">sendmsg(2)</a> calls by passing it as a
              <a href="../man3/cmsg.3.html">cmsg(3)</a>.  A value of zero disables the feature.  This
              option should not be used in code intended to be portable.

       <b>UDP_GRO </b>(since Linux 5.0)
              Enables UDP receive offload.  If enabled, the socket may
              receive multiple datagrams worth of data as a single large
              buffer, together with a <a href="../man3/cmsg.3.html">cmsg(3)</a> that holds the segment
              size.  This option is the inverse of segmentation offload.
              It reduces receive cost by handling multiple datagrams
              worth of data as a single large packet in the kernel
              receive path, even when that exceeds MTU.  This option
              should not be used in code intended to be portable.

   <b>Ioctls</b>
       These ioctls can be accessed using <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>.  The correct syntax
       is:

              <b>int </b><i>value</i><b>;</b>
              <i>error</i> <b>= ioctl(</b><i>udp_socket</i><b>, </b><i>ioctl_type</i><b>, &amp;</b><i>value</i><b>);</b>

       <b>FIONREAD </b>(<b>SIOCINQ</b>)
              Gets a pointer to an integer as argument.  Returns the
              size of the next pending datagram in the integer in bytes,
              or 0 when no datagram is pending.  <b>Warning: </b>Using
              <b>FIONREAD</b>, it is impossible to distinguish the case where
              no datagram is pending from the case where the next
              pending datagram contains zero bytes of data.  It is safer
              to use <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, or <a href="epoll.7.html">epoll(7)</a> to distinguish
              these cases.

       <b>TIOCOUTQ </b>(<b>SIOCOUTQ</b>)
              Returns the number of data bytes in the local send queue.
              Supported only with Linux 2.4 and above.

       In addition, all ioctls documented in <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a> and <a href="socket.7.html">socket(7)</a> are
       supported.

ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       All errors documented for <a href="socket.7.html">socket(7)</a> or <a href="ip.7.html">ip(7)</a> may be returned by a
       send or receive on a UDP socket.

       <b>ECONNREFUSED</b>
              No receiver was associated with the destination address.
              This might be caused by a previous packet sent over the
              socket.
