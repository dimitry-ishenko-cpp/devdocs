Description </h2>
<pre>
       The GNU implementation of the <i>man</i> macro package is part of the
       <i>groff</i> document formatting system.  It is used to compose manual
       pages (“man pages”) like the one you are reading.  This document
       presents the macros thematically; for those needing only a quick
       reference, the following table lists them alphabetically, with
       cross references to appropriate subsections below.

       Readers who are not already experienced <i>groff</i> users should
       consult <i>groff_man_style</i>(7), an expanded version of this document,
       for additional explanations and advice.  It covers only those
       concepts required for man page document maintenance, and not the
       full breadth of the <i>groff</i> typesetting system.

       We discuss other macros (<b>.AT</b>, <b>.DT</b>, <b>.HP</b>, <b>.OP</b>, <b>.PD</b>, <b>.SB</b>, and <b>.UC</b>)
       in subsection “Deprecated features” below.

       Throughout Unix documentation, a manual entry is referred to
       simply as a “man page”, regardless of its length, without
       gendered implication, and irrespective of the macro package
       selected for its composition.

   <b>Macro reference preliminaries</b>
       A tagged paragraph describes each macro.  We present coupled
       pairs together, as with <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  An empty macro argument can
       be specified with a pair of double-quotes (""), but the <i>man</i>
       package is designed such that this should seldom be necessary.
       Most macro arguments will be formatted as text in the output;
       exceptions are noted.

   <b>Document structure macros</b>
       Document structure macros organize a man page's content.  All of
       them break the output line.  <b>.TH </b>(title heading) identifies the
       document as a man page and configures the page headers and
       footers.  Section headings (<b>.SH</b>), one of which is mandatory and
       many of which are conventionally expected, facilitate location of
       material by the reader and aid the man page writer to discuss all
       essential aspects of the subject.  Subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) are
       optional and permit sections that grow long to develop in a
       controlled way.  Many technical discussions benefit from
       examples; lengthy ones, especially those reflecting multiple
       lines of input to or output from the system, are usefully
       bracketed by <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  When none of the foregoing meets a
       structural demand, use <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE </b>to inset a region within a
       (sub)section.

       <b>.TH </b><i>identifier section</i> [<i>footer-middle</i> [<i>footer-inside</i> [<i>header-</i>
       <i>middle</i>]]]
              Populate the page header and footer.  Together, <i>identifier</i>
              and the <i>section</i> of the manual to which it belongs can
              uniquely identify a <i>man</i> document on the system.  See
              <i>man</i>(1) or <i>intro</i>(1) for the manual sectioning applicable to
              your system.  <i>identifier</i> and <i>section</i> are positioned at the
              left and right in the header; the latter is set after the
              former, in parentheses and without space.  <i>footer-middle</i>
              is centered in the footer.  The arrangement of the rest of
              the footer depends on whether double-sided layout is
              enabled with the option <b>-rD1</b>.  When disabled (the
              default), <i>footer-inside</i> is positioned at the bottom left.
              Otherwise, <i>footer-inside</i> appears at the bottom left on
              recto (odd-numbered) pages, and at the bottom right on
              verso (even-numbered) pages.  The outside footer is the
              page number, except in the continuous-rendering mode
              enabled by the option <b>-rcR=1</b>, in which case it is the
              <i>identifier</i> and <i>section,</i> as in the header.  <i>header-middle</i>
              is centered in the header.  If <i>section</i> is an integer
              between 1 and 9 (inclusive), there is no need to specify
              <i>header-middle; an.tmac</i> will supply text for it.  This
              package may abbreviate <i>identifier</i> and <i>footer-inside</i> with
              ellipses if they would overrun the space available in the
              header and footer, respectively.  In HTML output, headers
              and footers are suppressed.

              Additionally, this macro breaks the page, resetting the
              number to 1 (unless the <b>-rC1 </b>option is given).  This
              feature is intended only for formatting multiple <i>man</i>
              documents in sequence.

              A valid <i>man</i> document calls <b>.TH </b>only once, early in the
              file, prior to any other macro calls.

       <b>.SH </b>[<i>heading-text</i>]
              Set <i>heading-text</i> as a section heading.  If no argument is
              given, the macro plants a one-line input trap; text on the
              next line becomes <i>heading-text.</i>  The heading text is set
              in bold (or the font specified by the string <b>HF</b>), and, on
              typesetters, slightly larger than the base type size.  If
              the heading font <b>\*[HF] </b>is bold, use of an italic style in
              <i>heading-text</i> is mapped to the bold-italic style if
              available in the font family.  The inset level is reset to
              1; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” below.
              Text after <i>heading-text</i> is set as an ordinary paragraph
              (<b>.P</b>).

              The content of <i>heading-text</i> and ordering of sections
              follows a set of common practices, as has much of the
              layout of material within sections.  For example, a
              section called “Name” or “NAME” must exist, must be the
              first section after the <b>.TH </b>call, and must contain only
              text of the form
                     <i>topic</i>[<b>, </b><i>another-topic</i>]... \- <i>summary-description</i>
              for a man page in English to be properly indexed.

       <b>.SS </b>[<i>subheading-text</i>]
              Set <i>subheading-text</i> as a subsection heading indented
              between a section heading and an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).
              If no argument is given, the macro plants a one-line input
              trap; text on the next line becomes <i>subheading-text.</i>  The
              subheading text is set in bold (or the font specified by
              the string <b>HF</b>).  If the heading font <b>\*[HF] </b>is bold, use
              of an italic style in <i>subheading-text</i> is mapped to the
              bold-italic style if available in the font family.  The
              inset level is reset to 1; see subsection “Horizontal and
              vertical spacing” below.  Text after <i>subheading-text</i> is
              set as an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

       <b>.EX</b>
       <b>.EE    </b>Begin and end example.  After <b>.EX</b>, filling is disabled and
              a constant-width (monospaced) font is selected.  Calling
              <b>.EE </b>enables filling and restores the previous font.

              <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE </b>are extensions introduced in Ninth Edition
              Unix.  Documenter's Workbench, Heirloom Doctools, and
              Plan 9 <i>troff</i>s, and <i>mandoc</i> (since 1.12.2) also support
              them.  Solaris <i>troff</i> does not.  See subsection “Use of
              extensions” in <i>groff_man_style</i>(7).

       <b>.RS </b>[<i>inset-amount</i>]
              Start a new relative inset level.  The current inset
              amount is saved, then moved right by <i>inset-amount,</i> if
              specified, by the <i>indentation</i> amount of the preceding <b>.IP</b>,
              <b>.TP</b>, or (deprecated) <b>.HP </b>macro call if no (sub-)sectioning
              or ordinary paragraphing macro has intervened, and by the
              amount of the <b>IN </b>register otherwise.  Calls to <b>.RS </b>can be
              nested; each increments by 1 the inset level used by <b>.RE</b>.
              The level prior to any <b>.RS </b>calls is 1.

       <b>.RE </b>[<i>inset-level</i>]
              End a relative inset.  The inset amount corresponding to
              <i>inset-level</i> is restored.  If no argument is given, the
              inset level is reduced by 1.

   <b>Paragraphing macros</b>
       An ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>) indents all output lines by the same
       amount.  Definition lists frequently occur in man pages; these
       can be set as <i>tagged paragraphs,</i> which have one (<b>.TP</b>) or more
       (<b>.TQ</b>) leading tags followed by a paragraph that has an additional
       indentation.  The indented paragraph (<b>.IP</b>) macro is useful to
       continue the indented content of a narrative started with <b>.TP</b>, or
       to present an itemized or ordered list.  All of these macros
       break the output line.  If another paragraph macro has occurred
       since the previous <b>.SH </b>or <b>.SS</b>, they (except for <b>.TQ</b>) follow the
       break with a default amount of vertical space, which can be
       changed by the deprecated <b>.PD </b>macro; see subsection “Horizontal
       and vertical spacing” below.  They also reset the type size and
       font style to defaults (<b>.TQ </b>again excepted); see subsection “Font
       style macros” below.

       <b>.P</b>
       <b>.LP</b>
       <b>.PP    </b>Begin a new paragraph; these macros are synonymous.  Any
              indentation from use of <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, or the deprecated <b>.HP </b>is
              cleared.  The inset amount, as affected by <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE</b>, is
              not.

       <b>.TP </b>[<i>indentation</i>]
              Set a paragraph with a leading tag, and the remainder of
              the paragraph indented.  The macro plants a one-line input
              trap that honors the <b>\c </b>escape sequence; text on the next
              line becomes the tag, set without indentation.  Text on
              subsequent lines is indented by <i>indentation,</i> if specified,
              and by the amount of the <b>IN </b>register otherwise.  If the
              tag, plus the “tag spacing” stored in the <b>TS </b>register (see
              section “Options” below) is wider than the indentation,
              the line is broken after the tag.

       <b>.TQ    </b>Set an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with <b>.TP</b>,
              planting a one-line input trap as with <b>.TP</b>.

              <b>.TQ </b>is a GNU extension supported by Heirloom Doctools
              <i>troff</i> and <i>mandoc</i> (since 1.14.5) but not by Documenter's
              Workbench, Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff</i>s.  See subsection “Use
              of extensions” in <i>groff_man_style</i>(7).

       <b>.IP </b>[<i>mark</i> [<i>indentation</i>]]
              Set an indented paragraph with an optional mark.
              Arguments, if present, are handled as with <b>.TP</b>, except
              that the <i>mark</i> argument to <b>.IP </b>cannot include a macro call,
              and the tag separation amount stored in the <b>TS </b>register is
              not enforced.

   <b>Synopsis macros</b>
       Use <b>.SY </b>and <b>.YS </b>to summarize syntax using familiar Unix
       conventions.  Heirloom Doctools <i>troff</i> and <i>mandoc</i> (since 1.14.5)
       support these GNU extensions; Documenter's Workbench, Plan 9, and
       Solaris <i>troff</i>s do not.  See subsection “Use of extensions” in
       <i>groff_man_style</i>(7).

       <b>.SY </b><i>keyword</i> [<i>suffix</i>]
              Begin synopsis.  Adjustment and automatic hyphenation are
              disabled.  If <b>.SY </b>has already been called without a
              corresponding <b>.YS</b>, a break is performed.  <i>keyword</i> and
              <i>suffix</i> (if any) are set in bold.  If a break is required
              in subsequent text (up to another paragraphing,
              sectioning, or synopsis macro call), lines after the first
              are indented.  The indentation amount is the width of
              <i>keyword</i> plus a space, if that is the only argument, and by
              the sum of the widths of <i>keyword</i> and <i>suffix</i> otherwise.

       <b>.YS </b>[<i>reuse-indentation</i>]
              End synopsis, breaking the line and restoring indentation,
              adjustment, and hyphenation to their previous states.  If
              an argument is given, the indentation corresponding to the
              previous <b>.SY </b>call is reused by the next <b>.SY </b>call instead
              of being computed.

   <b>Hyperlink macros</b>
       Man page cross references are best presented with <b>.MR</b>.  Text may
       be hyperlinked to email addresses with <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME </b>or other URIs with
       <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>.  Not all output devices support hyperlinking of text;
       terminals and pager programs must support ECMA-48 OSC 8 escape
       sequences (see <i>grotty</i>(1)).  When device support is unavailable or
       disabled with the <b>U </b>register (see section “Options” below), <b>.MT</b>
       and <b>.UR </b>URIs are rendered between angle brackets after the linked
       text.

       <b>.MT</b>, <b>.ME</b>, <b>.UR</b>, and <b>.UE </b>are GNU extensions supported by Heirloom
       Doctools and <i>mandoc</i> (<b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE </b>since 1.12.3; <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME </b>since 1.14.2)
       but not by Documenter's Workbench, Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff</i>s.
       Plan 9 from User Space's <i>troff</i> implements <b>.MR</b>.  See subsection
       “Use of extensions” in <i>groff_man_style</i>(7).

       The arguments to <b>.MR</b>, <b>.MT</b>, and <b>.UR </b>should be prepared for
       typesetting since they can appear in the output.  Use special
       character escape sequences to encode Unicode basic Latin
       characters where necessary, particularly the hyphen-minus.  The
       formatter removes <b>\: </b>escape sequences from hyperlinks when
       supplying device control commands to output drivers.

       <b>.MR </b><i>topic</i> [<i>manual-section</i> [<i>trailing-text</i>]]
              <i>(since</i> groff <i>1.23)</i> Set a man page cross reference as
              “<i>topic</i><b>(</b><i>manual-section</i><b>)</b>”.  If <i>manual-section</i> is absent, the
              package omits the surrounding parentheses.  If <i>trailing-</i>
              <i>text</i> (typically punctuation) is specified, it follows the
              closing parenthesis without intervening space.
              Hyphenation is disabled while the cross reference is set.
              <i>topic</i> is set in the font specified by the <b>MF </b>string.  If
              <i>manual-section</i> is present, the cross reference hyperlinks
              to a URI of the form “<b>man:</b><i>topic</i>(<i>manual-section</i>)”.

       <b>.MT </b><i>address</i>
       <b>.ME </b>[<i>trailing-text</i>]
              Identify <i>address</i> as an RFC 6068 <i>addr-spec</i> for a “mailto:”
              URI with the text between the two macro calls as the link
              text.  An argument to <b>.ME </b>is placed after the link text
              without intervening space.  <i>address</i> may not be visible in
              the rendered document if hyperlinks are enabled and
              supported by the output driver.  If they are not, <i>address</i>
              is set in angle brackets after the link text and before
              <i>trailing-text.</i>  If hyperlinking is enabled but there is no
              link text, <i>address</i> is formatted and hyperlinked <i>without</i>
              angle brackets.

       <b>.UR </b><i>uri</i>
       <b>.UE </b>[<i>trailing-text</i>]
              Identify <i>uri</i> as an RFC 3986 URI hyperlink with the text
              between the two macro calls as the link text.  An argument
              to <b>.UE </b>is placed after the link text without intervening
              space.  <i>uri</i> may not be visible in the rendered document if
              hyperlinks are enabled and supported by the output driver.
              If they are not, <i>uri</i> is set in angle brackets after the
              link text and before <i>trailing-text.</i>  If hyperlinking is
              enabled but there is no link text, <i>uri</i> is formatted and
              hyperlinked <i>without</i> angle brackets.

       If a <b>.TP </b>call is followed immediately by hyperlinking macros
       <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE </b>or <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>, and the device doesn't support hyperlinking,
       the hyperlink is set at the beginning of the indented paragraph,
       not as part of the tag.

   <b>Font style macros</b>
       The <i>man</i> macro package is limited in its font styling options,
       offering only <b>bold </b>(<b>.B</b>), <i>italic</i> (<b>.I</b>), and roman.  Italic text is
       usually set underscored instead on terminals.  <b>.SM </b>sets text at a
       smaller type size, which differs visually from regular-sized text
       only on typesetters.  It is often necessary to set text in
       different styles without intervening space.  The macros <b>.BI</b>, <b>.BR</b>,
       <b>.IB</b>, <b>.IR</b>, <b>.RB</b>, and <b>.RI</b>, where “B”, “I”, and “R” indicate bold,
       italic, and roman, respectively, set their odd- and even-numbered
       arguments in alternating styles, with no space separating them.

       The default type size and family for typesetters is 10-point
       Times, except on the <b>X75-12 </b>and <b>X100-12 </b>devices where the type
       size is 12 points.  The default style is roman.

       <b>.B </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in bold.  If no argument is given, the macro
              plants a one-line input trap; text on the next line, which
              can be further formatted with a macro, is set in bold.

       <b>.I </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in an italic or oblique face.  If no argument is
              given, the macro plants a one-line input trap; text on the
              next line, which can be further formatted with a macro, is
              set in an italic or oblique face.

       <b>.SM </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> one point smaller than the default type size on
              typesetters.  If no argument is given, the macro plants a
              one-line input trap; text on the next line, which can be
              further formatted with a macro, is set smaller.

       Unlike the above font style macros, the font style alternation
       macros below set no input traps; they must be given arguments to
       have effect.  They apply italic corrections as appropriate.

       <b>.BI </b><i>bold-text italic-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in bold and italics, alternately.

       <b>.BR </b><i>bold-text roman-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in bold and roman, alternately.

       <b>.IB </b><i>italic-text bold-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in italics and bold, alternately.

       <b>.IR </b><i>italic-text roman-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in italics and roman, alternately.

       <b>.RB </b><i>roman-text bold-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in roman and bold, alternately.

       <b>.RI </b><i>roman-text italic-text</i> ...
              Set each argument in roman and italics, alternately.

   <b>Horizontal and vertical spacing</b>
       All text is rendered with respect to the <i>page offset;</i> see
       register <b>PO </b>in section “Options” below.  Headers, footers (both
       set with <b>.TH</b>), and section headings (<b>.SH</b>) are set with no further
       indentation.  Subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) are indented by the
       amount in the <b>SN </b>register.

       Ordinary paragraphs not within an <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE </b>inset region are inset
       by the amount stored in the <b>BP </b>register; see section “Options”
       below.  The <b>IN </b>register configures the default indentation amount
       used by <b>.RS </b>(as the <i>inset-amount</i>), <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated
       <b>.HP</b>; an overriding argument is a number plus an optional scaling
       unit.  If no scaling unit is given, the <i>man</i> package assumes “n”.
       An indentation specified in a call to <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, or the deprecated
       <b>.HP </b>persists until (1) another of these macros is called with an
       <i>indentation</i> argument, or (2) <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, or <b>.P </b>or its synonyms is
       called; these clear the indentation entirely.

       Several macros insert vertical space: <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, <b>.P </b>(and its
       synonyms), <b>.IP</b>, and the deprecated <b>.HP</b>.  The default inter-
       section and inter-paragraph spacing is 1v for terminals and 0.4v
       for typesetters.  (The deprecated macro <b>.PD </b>can change this
       vertical spacing, but we discourage its use.)  Between <b>.EX </b>and
       <b>.EE </b>calls, the inter-paragraph spacing is 1v regardless of output
       device.

   <b>Registers</b>
       Registers are described in section “Options” below.  They can be
       set not only on the command line but in the site <i>man.local</i> file
       as well; see section “Files” below.

   <b>Strings</b>
       The following strings are defined for use in man pages.  None of
       these is necessary in a contemporary man page; see
       <i>groff_man_style</i>(7).  Others are supported for configuration of
       rendering parameters; see section “Options” below.

       <b>\*R    </b>interpolates a special character escape sequence for the
              “registered sign” glyph, <b>\(rg</b>, if available, and “(Reg.)”
              otherwise.

       <b>\*S    </b>interpolates an escape sequence setting the type size to
              the document default.

       <b>\*(lq</b>
       <b>\*(rq  </b>interpolate special character escape sequences for left
              and right double-quotation marks, <b>\(lq </b>and <b>\(rq</b>,
              respectively.

       <b>\*(Tm  </b>interpolates a special character escape sequence for the
              “trade mark sign” glyph, <b>\(tm</b>, if available, and “(TM)”
              otherwise.

   <b>Hooks</b>
       Two macros, both GNU extensions, are called internally by the
       <i>groff man</i> package to format page headers and footers and can be
       redefined by the administrator in a site's <i>man.local</i> file (see
       section “Files” below).  The presentation of <b>.TH </b>above describes
       the default headers and footers.  Because these macros are hooks
       for <i>groff man</i> internals, man pages have no reason to call them.
       Such hook definitions will likely consist of “.sp” and “.tl”
       requests.  They must also increase the page length with “.pl”
       requests in continuous rendering mode; <b>.PT </b>furthermore has the
       responsibility of emitting a PDF bookmark after writing the first
       page header in a document.  Consult the existing implementations
       in <i>an.tmac</i> when drafting replacements.

       <b>.BT    </b>Set the page footer text (“bottom trap”).

       <b>.PT    </b>Set the page header text (“page trap”).

       To remove a page header or footer entirely, define the
       appropriate macro as empty rather than deleting it.

   <b>Deprecated features</b>
       Use of the following in man pages for public distribution is
       discouraged.

       <b>.AT </b>[<i>system</i> [<i>release</i>]]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy AT&amp;T man pages,
              overriding any definition of the <i>footer-inside</i> argument to
              <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only to render man pages from
              historical systems.

              The inside footer is populated per the value of <i>system.</i>

                     3      7th edition <i>(default)</i>

                     4      System III

                     5      System V

              The optional <i>release</i> argument specifies the release
              number, as in “System V Release 3”.

       <b>.DT    </b>Reset tab stops to the default (every 0.5i).

              Use of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact space control
              and tabulation are not readily available.  Thus,
              information or distinctions that you use tab stops to
              express are likely to be lost.  If you feel tempted to
              change the tab stops such that calling this macro later to
              restore them is desirable, consider composing a table
              using <i>tbl</i>(1) instead.

       <b>.HP </b>[<i>indentation</i>]
              Set up a paragraph with a hanging left indentation.
              <i>indentation,</i> if present, is handled as with <b>.TP</b>.

              Use of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  A
              hanging indentation cannot be expressed naturally in HTML,
              a hanging paragraph is not distinguishable from an
              ordinary one if it formats on only one output line, and
              non-<i>roff</i>-based man page interpreters may treat <b>.HP </b>as an
              ordinary paragraph.  Thus, information or distinctions you
              mean to express with indentation may be lost.

       <b>.OP </b><i>option-name</i> [<i>option-argument</i>]
              Indicate an optional command parameter called <i>option-name</i>,
              which is set in bold.  If the option takes an argument,
              specify <i>option-argument</i> using a noun, abbreviation, or
              hyphenated noun phrase.  If present, <i>option-argument</i> is
              preceded by a space and set in italics.  Square brackets
              in roman surround both arguments.

              Use of this quasi-semantic macro, an extension originating
              in Documenter's Workbench <i>troff</i>, is deprecated.  It cannot
              easily be used to annotate options that take optional
              arguments or options whose arguments have internal
              structure (such as a mixture of literal and variable
              components).  One could work around these limitations with
              font selection escape sequences, but it is preferable to
              use font style alternation macros, which afford greater
              flexibility.

       <b>.PD </b>[<i>vertical-space</i>]
              Configure the amount of vertical space between paragraphs
              or (sub)sections.  The optional argument <i>vertical-space</i>
              specifies the amount; the default scaling unit is “v”.
              Without an argument, the spacing is reset to its default
              value; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing”
              above.

              Use of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact control of
              inter-paragraph spacing is not readily available.  Thus,
              information or distinctions that you use <b>.PD </b>to express
              are likely to be lost.

       <b>.SB </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in bold and (on typesetters) one point smaller
              than the default type size.  If no argument is given, the
              macro plants a one-line input trap; text on the next line,
              which can be further formatted with a macro, is set
              smaller and in bold.  Use of this macro, an extension
              originating in SunOS 4.0 <i>troff</i>, is deprecated.  <b>.SM</b>
              without an argument, followed immediately by “<b>.B </b><i>text</i>”,
              produces the same output more portably.  The macros' order
              is interchangeable; put <i>text</i> with the latter.

       <b>.UC </b>[<i>version</i>]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy BSD man pages,
              overriding any definition of the <i>footer-inside</i> argument to
              <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only to render man pages from
              historical systems.

              The inside footer is populated per the value of <i>version.</i>

   <b>History</b>
       M. Douglas McIlroy ⟨m.douglas.mcilroy@dartmouth.edu⟩ designed,
       implemented, and documented the AT&amp;T <i>man</i> macros for Unix
       Version 7 (1979) and employed them to edit the first volume of
       its <i>Programmer's Manual</i>, a compilation of all man pages supplied
       by the system.  That <i>man</i> supported the macros listed in this page
       not described as extensions, except <b>.P </b>and the deprecated <b>.AT </b>and
       <b>.UC</b>.  The only strings defined were <b>R </b>and <b>S</b>; no registers were
       documented.

       <b>.UC </b>appeared in 3BSD (1980).  Unix System III (1980) introduced
       <b>.P </b>and exposed the registers <b>IN </b>and <b>LL</b>, which had been internal
       to Seventh Edition Unix <i>man</i>.  PWB/UNIX 2.0 (1980) added the <b>Tm</b>
       string.  4BSD (1980) added <b>lq </b>and <b>rq </b>strings.  SunOS 2.0 (1985)
       recognized <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>X </b>registers.  4.3BSD (1986) added <b>.AT </b>and
       <b>.P</b>.  Ninth Edition Unix (1986) introduced <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  SunOS 4.0
       (1988) added <b>.SB</b>.

       James Clark implemented the foregoing features in early versions
       of <i>groff.</i>  Later, <i>groff</i> 1.20 (2009) originated <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS</b>, <b>.TQ</b>,
       <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>, and <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>.  Plan 9 from User Space's <i>troff</i> introduced
       <b>.MR </b>in 2020.
</pre> <h2>
Options </h2>
<pre>
       The following <i>groff</i> options set registers (with <b>-r</b>) and strings
       (with <b>-d</b>) recognized and used by the <i>man</i> macro package.  To
       ensure rendering consistent with output device capabilities and
       reader preferences, man pages should never manipulate them.

       <b>-dAD=</b><i>adjustment-mode</i>
              Set line adjustment to <i>adjustment-mode,</i> which is typically
              “<b>b</b>” for adjustment to both margins (the default), or “<b>l</b>”
              for left alignment (ragged right margin).  Any valid
              argument to <i>groff</i>'s “.ad” request may be used.  See
              <i>groff</i>(7) for less-common choices.

       <b>-rBP=</b><i>base-paragraph-inset</i>
              Set the inset amount for ordinary paragraphs not within an
              <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE </b>inset.  The default is 5n.

       <b>-rcR=1 </b>Enable continuous rendering.  Output is not paginated;
              instead, one (potentially very long) page is produced.
              This is the default for terminal and HTML devices.  Use
              <b>-rcR=0 </b>to disable it on terminals; on HTML devices, it
              cannot be disabled.

       <b>-rC1   </b>Number output pages consecutively, in strictly increasing
              sequence, rather than resetting the page number to 1 (or
              the value of register <b>P</b>) with each new <i>man</i> document.

       <b>-rCS=1 </b>Set section headings (the argument(s) to <b>.SH</b>) in full
              capitals.  This transformation is off by default because
              it discards case distinction information.

       <b>-rCT=1 </b>Set the man page identifier (the first argument to <b>.TH</b>) in
              full capitals in headers and footers.  This transformation
              is off by default because it discards case distinction
              information.

       <b>-rD1   </b>Enable double-sided layout, formatting footers for even
              and odd pages differently; see the description of <b>.TH </b>in
              subsection “Document structure macros” above.

       <b>-rFT=</b><i>footer-distance</i>
              Set distance of the footer relative to the bottom of the
              page to <i>footer-distance;</i> this amount is always negative.
              At one half-inch above this location, the page text is
              broken before writing the footer.  Ignored if continuous
              rendering is enabled.  The default is “-0.5i - 1v”.

       <b>-dHF=</b><i>heading-font</i>
              Select the font used for section and subsection headings;
              the default is “<b>B</b>” (bold style of the default family).
              Any valid argument to <i>groff</i>'s “.ft” request may be used.
              See <i>groff</i>(7).

       <b>-rHY=0 </b>Disable automatic hyphenation.  Normally, it is
              enabled (1).  The hyphenation mode is determined by the
              <i>groff</i> locale; see section “Localization“ of <i>groff</i>(7).

       <b>-rIN=</b><i>standard-indentation</i>
              Set the default indentation amount used by <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and
              the deprecated <b>.HP</b>, and the inset amount used by <b>.RS</b>.  The
              default is 7n on terminals and 7.2n on typesetters.  Use
              only integer multiples of unit “n” on terminals for
              consistent indentation.

       <b>-rLL=</b><i>line-length</i>
              Set line length; the default is 80n on terminals and 6.5i
              on typesetters.

       <b>-rLT=</b><i>title-length</i>
              Set the line length for titles.  By default, it is set to
              the line length (see <b>-rLL </b>above).

       <b>-dMF=</b><i>man-page-topic-font</i>
              Select the font used for man page identifiers in <b>.TH </b>calls
              and topics named in <b>.MR </b>calls; the default is “<b>I</b>” (italic
              style of the default family).  Any valid argument to
              <i>groff</i>'s “.ft” request may be used.  If the <b>MF </b>string ends
              in “I”, it is assumed to be an oblique typeface, and
              italic corrections are applied before and after man page
              topics and identifiers.

       <b>-rP</b><i>n</i>   Start enumeration of pages at <i>n</i>.  The default is 1.

       <b>-rPO=</b><i>page-offset</i>
              Set page offset; the default is 0 on terminals and 1i on
              typesetters.

       <b>-rS</b><i>type-size</i>
              Use <i>type-size</i> for the document's body text; acceptable
              values are 10, 11, or 12 points.  See subsection “Font
              style macros” above for the default.

       <b>-rSN=</b><i>subsection-indentation</i>
              Set indentation of subsection headings to <i>subsection-</i>
              <i>indentation.</i>  The default is 3n.

       <b>-rTS=</b><i>separation</i>
              Require the given <i>separation</i> between a <b>TP </b>paragraph's tag
              and its body.  The default is 2n.

       <b>-rU0   </b>Disable generation of URI hyperlinks in output drivers
              capable of them, making the arguments to <b>MT </b>and <b>UR </b>calls
              visible as formatted text.  <i>grohtml</i>(1), <i>gropdf</i>(1), and
              <i>grotty</i>(1) enable hyperlinks by default (the last only if
              not in legacy output mode).

       <b>-rX</b><i>p</i>   Number successors of page <i>p</i> as <i>p</i>a, <i>p</i>b, <i>p</i>c, and so forth.
              The register tracking the suffixed page letter uses format
              “a” (see the “.af” request in <i>groff</i>(7)).

Files </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/an.tmac</i>
              Most <i>man</i> macros are defined in this file.  It also loads
              extensions from <i>an-ext.tmac</i> (see below).

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/andoc.tmac</i>
              This brief <i>groff</i> program detects whether the <i>man</i> or <i>mdoc</i>
              macro package is being used by a document and loads the
              correct macro definitions, taking advantage of the fact
              that pages using them must call <b>.TH </b>or <b>.Dd</b>, respectively,
              before any other macros.  A <i>man</i> program or a user typing,
              for example, “<b>groff -mandoc page.1</b>”, need not know which
              package the file <i>page.1</i> uses.  Multiple man pages, in
              either format, can be handled; <i>andoc</i> reloads each macro
              package as necessary.  Page-local redefinitions of names
              used by the <i>man</i> or <i>mdoc</i> packages prior to <b>.TH </b>or <b>.Dd </b>calls
              will be “clobbered” by the reloading process.  If you want
              to provide your own definition of an extension macro to
              ensure its availability, the <i>an-ext.tmac</i> entry below
              offers advice.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/an-ext.tmac</i>
              Definitions of macros described above as extensions (and
              not deprecated) are contained in this file; in some cases,
              they are simpler versions of definitions appearing in
              <i>an.tmac</i>, and are ignored if the formatter is GNU <i>troff</i>.
              They are written to be compatible with AT&amp;T <i>troff</i> and
              permissively licensed—not copylefted.  To reduce the risk
              of name space collisions, string and register names begin
              only with “<b>m</b>”<b>.  </b>We encourage man page authors who are
              concerned about portability to legacy Unix systems to copy
              these definitions into their pages, and maintainers of
              <i>troff</i> implementations or work-alike systems that format
              man pages to re-use them.  To ensure reliable rendering,
              define them after your page calls <b>.TH</b>; see the discussion
              of <i>andoc.tmac</i> above.  Further, it is wise to define such
              page-local macros (if at all) after the “Name” section to
              accommodate timid <i>makewhatis</i>(8) or <i>mandb</i>(8)
              implementations that easily give up scanning for indexing
              material.

       The initial GNU implementation of the <i>man</i> macro package was
       written by James Clark.  Later, Werner Lemberg ⟨wl@gnu.org⟩
       supplied the <b>S</b>, <b>LT</b>, and <b>cR </b>registers, the last a 4.3BSD-Reno
       <b>mdoc</b>(7) feature.  Larry Kollar ⟨kollar@alltel.net⟩ added the <b>FT</b>,
       <b>HY</b>, and <b>SN </b>registers; the <b>HF </b>string; and the <b>PT </b>and <b>BT </b>macros.
       G. Branden Robinson ⟨g.branden.robinson@gmail.com⟩ implemented
       the <b>AD </b>and <b>MF </b>strings; <b>BP</b>, <b>CS</b>, <b>CT</b>, <b>PO</b>, <b>TS</b>, and <b>U </b>registers; and
       the <b>MR </b>macro.  Extension macros since <i>groff</i> 1.20 were written by
       Lemberg, Eric S. Raymond ⟨esr@thyrsus.com⟩, and Robinson.

       This document was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux
       system by Susan G. Kleinmann ⟨sgk@debian.org⟩.  It was corrected
       and updated by Lemberg and Robinson.  The extension macros were
       documented by Raymond and Robinson.
