Description </h2>
<pre>
       The GNU implementation of the <i>man</i> macro package is part of the
       <i>groff</i> document formatting system.  It is used to compose manual
       pages (“man pages”) like the one you are reading.  This document
       presents the macros thematically; for those needing only a quick
       reference, the following table lists them alphabetically, with
       cross references to appropriate subsections below.

       We discuss other macros (<b>.AT</b>, <b>.DT</b>, <b>.HP</b>, <b>.OP</b>, <b>.PD</b>, <b>.SB</b>, and <b>.UC</b>)
       in subsection “Deprecated features” below.

       Throughout Unix documentation, a manual entry is referred to
       simply as a “man page”, regardless of its length, without
       gendered implication, and irrespective of the macro package
       selected for its composition.

       A man page employs the Unix line-ending convention (U+000A only).
       Some basic Latin characters have special meaning to <i>roff;</i> see
       subsection “Portability” below.

   <b>Fundamental concepts</b>
       <i>groff</i> is a programming system for typesetting: we thus often use
       the verb “to set” in the sense “to typeset”.  The formatter
       <i>troff</i>(1) collects words from the input and <i>fills</i> output lines
       with as many as will fit.  <i>Words</i> are separated by spaces and
       newlines.  A transition to a new output line is called a <i>break.</i>
       When formatted, a word may be broken at hyphens, at <b>\% </b>or <b>\:</b>
       escape sequences (see subsection “Portability” below), or at
       predetermined locations if automatic hyphenation is enabled (see
       the <b>-rHY </b>option in section “Options” below).  An output line may
       be supplemented with <i>inter-sentence space,</i> and then optionally
       <i>adjusted</i> with more space to a consistent length (see the <b>-dAD</b>
       option).  <i>roff</i>(7) details these processes.  Output is prepared
       for <i>terminals</i> or for more capable <i>typesetters</i> that can change the
       type size and font family.

       An input line that starts with a dot (.) or neutral apostrophe
       (') is a <i>control line.</i>  To call a macro, put its name after a dot
       on a control line.  This document uses the leading dot to
       identify macros.  Some macros interpret <i>arguments,</i> words that
       follow its name.  A newline, unless escaped (see subsection
       “Portability” below), marks the end of the macro call.  A control
       line with no macro name on it is called an <i>empty request;</i> it does
       nothing.  <i>Text lines</i> are input lines that are not control lines.

       We describe below several <i>man</i> macros that plant one-line <i>input</i>
       <i>traps:</i> the next input line that directly produces formatted
       output is treated specially.  For <i>man</i> documents that follow the
       advice in section “Portability” below, this means that control
       lines using the empty request and uncommented input lines ending
       with an escaped newline do not spring the trap; anything else
       does (but see the <b>.TP </b>macro description).

   <b>Macro reference preliminaries</b>
       A tagged paragraph describes each macro.  We present coupled
       pairs together, as with <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  Optional macro arguments
       are indicated by surrounding them with square brackets.  If a
       macro accepts multiple arguments, those containing space
       characters must be double-quoted to be interpreted correctly.  An
       empty macro argument can be specified with a pair of double-
       quotes (""), but the <i>man</i> package is designed such that this
       should seldom be necessary.  See section “Notes” below for
       examples of cases where better alternatives to empty arguments in
       macro calls are available.  Most macro arguments will be
       formatted as text in the output; exceptions are noted.

   <b>Document structure macros</b>
       Document structure macros organize a man page's content.  All of
       them break the output line.  <b>.TH </b>(title heading) identifies the
       document as a man page and configures the page headers and
       footers.  Section headings (<b>.SH</b>), one of which is mandatory and
       many of which are conventionally expected, facilitate location of
       material by the reader and aid the man page writer to discuss all
       essential aspects of the subject.  Subsection headings (<b>.SS</b>) are
       optional and permit sections that grow long to develop in a
       controlled way.  Many technical discussions benefit from
       examples; lengthy ones, especially those reflecting multiple
       lines of input to or output from the system, are usefully
       bracketed by <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  When none of the foregoing meets a
       structural demand, use <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE </b>to inset a region within a
       (sub)section.

       <b>.TH </b><i>identifier section</i> [<i>footer-middle</i> [<i>footer-inside</i> [<i>header-</i>
       <i>middle</i>]]]
              Populate the page header and footer.  <i>roff</i> systems refer
              to these collectively as “titles”.  Together, <i>identifier</i>
              and the <i>section</i> of the manual to which it belongs can
              uniquely identify a <i>man</i> document on the system.  This use
              of “section” has nothing to do with the section headings
              otherwise discussed in this page; it arises from the
              organizational scheme of printed and bound Unix manuals.
              See <i>man</i>(1) or <i>intro</i>(1) for the manual sectioning
              applicable to your system.  <i>identifier</i> and <i>section</i> are
              positioned at the left and right in the header; the latter
              is set after the former, in parentheses and without space.
              <i>footer-middle</i> is centered in the footer.  The arrangement
              of the rest of the footer depends on whether double-sided
              layout is enabled with the option <b>-rD1</b>.  When disabled
              (the default), <i>footer-inside</i> is positioned at the bottom
              left.  Otherwise, <i>footer-inside</i> appears at the bottom left
              on recto (odd-numbered) pages, and at the bottom right on
              verso (even-numbered) pages.  The outside footer is the
              page number, except in the continuous-rendering mode
              enabled by the option <b>-rcR=1</b>, in which case it is the
              <i>identifier</i> and <i>section,</i> as in the header.  <i>header-middle</i>
              is centered in the header.  If <i>section</i> is an integer
              between 1 and 9 (inclusive), there is no need to specify
              <i>header-middle; an.tmac</i> will supply text for it.  This
              package may abbreviate <i>identifier</i> and <i>footer-inside</i> with
              ellipses (<b>...</b>) if they would overrun the space available
              in the header and footer, respectively.  In HTML output,
              headers and footers are suppressed.

              Additionally, this macro breaks the page, resetting the
              number to 1 (unless the <b>-rC1 </b>option is given).  This
              feature is intended only for formatting multiple <i>man</i>
              documents in sequence.

              A valid <i>man</i> document calls <b>.TH </b>only once, early in the
              file, prior to any other macro calls.

              By convention, <i>footer-middle</i> is the date of the most
              recent modification to the man page source document, and
              <i>footer-inside</i> is the name and version or release of the
              project providing it.

       <b>.SH </b>[<i>heading-text</i>]
              Set <i>heading-text</i> as a section heading.  If no argument is
              given, the macro plants a one-line input trap; text on the
              next line becomes <i>heading-text.</i>  The heading text is set
              in bold (or the font specified by the string <b>HF</b>), and, on
              typesetters, slightly larger than the base type size.  If
              the heading font <b>\*[HF] </b>is bold, use of an italic style in
              <i>heading-text</i> is mapped to the bold-italic style if
              available in the font family.  The inset level is reset to
              1; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing” below.
              Text after <i>heading-text</i> is set as an ordinary paragraph
              (<b>.P</b>).

              The content of <i>heading-text</i> and ordering of sections
              follows a set of common practices, as has much of the
              layout of material within sections.  For example, a
              section called “Name” or “NAME” must exist, must be the
              first section after the <b>.TH </b>call, and must contain only
              text of the form
                     <i>topic</i>[<b>, </b><i>another-topic</i>]... \- <i>summary-description</i>
              for a man page in English to be properly indexed.

       <b>.SS </b>[<i>subheading-text</i>]
              Set <i>subheading-text</i> as a subsection heading indented
              between a section heading and an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).
              If no argument is given, the macro plants a one-line input
              trap; text on the next line becomes <i>subheading-text.</i>  The
              subheading text is set in bold (or the font specified by
              the string <b>HF</b>).  If the heading font <b>\*[HF] </b>is bold, use
              of an italic style in <i>subheading-text</i> is mapped to the
              bold-italic style if available in the font family.  The
              inset level is reset to 1; see subsection “Horizontal and
              vertical spacing” below.  Text after <i>subheading-text</i> is
              set as an ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>).

       <b>.EX</b>
       <b>.EE    </b>Begin and end example.  After <b>.EX</b>, filling is disabled and
              a constant-width (monospaced) font is selected.  Calling
              <b>.EE </b>enables filling and restores the previous font.

              Example regions are useful for formatting code, shell
              sessions, and text file contents.  An example region is
              not a “literal mode” of any sort: special character escape
              sequences must still be used to produce correct glyphs for
              <b>'</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>\</b>, <b>^</b>, <b>`</b>, and <b>~ </b>(see subsection “Portability” below).
              Sentence endings are still detected and additional inter-
              sentence space applied.  If the amount of additional
              inter-sentence spacing is altered, the rendering of, for
              instance, regular expressions using <b>. </b>or <b>? </b>followed by
              multiple spaces can change.  Use the dummy character
              escape sequence <b>\&amp; </b>before the spaces.

              <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE </b>are extensions introduced in Ninth Edition
              Unix.  Documenter's Workbench, Heirloom Doctools, and
              Plan 9 <i>troff</i>s, and <i>mandoc</i> (since 1.12.2) also support
              them.  Solaris <i>troff</i> does not.  See subsection “Use of
              extensions” below.

       <b>.RS </b>[<i>inset-amount</i>]
              Start a new relative inset level.  The current inset
              amount is saved, then moved right by <i>inset-amount,</i> if
              specified, by the <i>indentation</i> amount of the preceding <b>.IP</b>,
              <b>.TP</b>, or (deprecated) <b>.HP </b>macro call if no (sub-)sectioning
              or ordinary paragraphing macro has intervened, and by the
              amount of the <b>IN </b>register otherwise.  Calls to <b>.RS </b>can be
              nested; each increments by 1 the inset level used by <b>.RE</b>.
              The level prior to any <b>.RS </b>calls is 1.

       <b>.RE </b>[<i>inset-level</i>]
              End a relative inset.  The inset amount corresponding to
              <i>inset-level</i> is restored.  If no argument is given, the
              inset level is reduced by 1.

   <b>Paragraphing macros</b>
       An ordinary paragraph (<b>.P</b>) like this one indents all output lines
       by the same amount.  Definition lists frequently occur in man
       pages; these can be set as <i>tagged paragraphs,</i> which have one
       (<b>.TP</b>) or more (<b>.TQ</b>) leading tags followed by a paragraph that has
       an additional indentation.  The indented paragraph (<b>.IP</b>) macro is
       useful to continue the indented content of a narrative started
       with <b>.TP</b>, or to present an itemized or ordered list.  All of
       these macros break the output line.  If another paragraph macro
       has occurred since the previous <b>.SH </b>or <b>.SS</b>, they (except for <b>.TQ</b>)
       follow the break with a default amount of vertical space, which
       can be changed by the deprecated <b>.PD </b>macro; see subsection
       “Horizontal and vertical spacing” below.  They also reset the
       type size and font style to defaults (<b>.TQ </b>again excepted); see
       subsection “Font style macros” below.

       <b>.P</b>
       <b>.LP</b>
       <b>.PP    </b>Begin a new paragraph; these macros are synonymous.  Any
              indentation from use of <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, or the deprecated <b>.HP </b>is
              cleared.  The inset amount, as affected by <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE</b>, is
              not.

       <b>.TP </b>[<i>indentation</i>]
              Set a paragraph with a leading tag, and the remainder of
              the paragraph indented.  The macro plants a one-line input
              trap that honors the <b>\c </b>escape sequence; text on the next
              line becomes the tag, set without indentation.  Text on
              subsequent lines is indented by <i>indentation,</i> if specified,
              and by the amount of the <b>IN </b>register otherwise.  If the
              tag, plus the “tag spacing” stored in the <b>TS </b>register (see
              section “Options” below) is wider than the indentation,
              the line is broken after the tag.

              The line containing the tag can include a macro call, for
              instance to set the tag in bold with <b>.B</b>.  <b>.TP </b>was used to
              write the first paragraph of this description of <b>.TP</b>, and
              <b>.IP </b>the subsequent one.

       <b>.TQ    </b>Set an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with <b>.TP</b>,
              planting a one-line input trap as with <b>.TP</b>.

              <b>.TQ </b>is a GNU extension supported by Heirloom Doctools
              <i>troff</i> and <i>mandoc</i> (since 1.14.5) but not by Documenter's
              Workbench, Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff</i>s.  See subsection “Use
              of extensions” below.

              The descriptions of <b>.P</b>, <b>.LP</b>, and <b>.PP </b>above were written
              using <b>.TP </b>and <b>.TQ</b>.

       <b>.IP </b>[<i>mark</i> [<i>indentation</i>]]
              Set an indented paragraph with an optional mark.
              Arguments, if present, are handled as with <b>.TP</b>, except
              that the <i>mark</i> argument to <b>.IP </b>cannot include a macro call,
              and the tag separation amount stored in the <b>TS </b>register is
              not enforced.

              Two convenient uses for <b>.IP </b>are

                  (1)  to start a new paragraph with the same
                       indentation as an immediately preceding <b>.IP </b>or
                       <b>.TP </b>paragraph, if no <i>indentation</i> argument is
                       given; and

                  (2)  to set a paragraph with a short <i>mark</i> that is not
                       semantically important, such as a bullet
                       (•)—obtained with the <b>\(bu </b>special character
                       escape sequence—or list enumerator, as seen in
                       this very paragraph.

   <b>Synopsis macros</b>
       Use <b>.SY </b>and <b>.YS </b>to summarize syntax using familiar Unix
       conventions.  Heirloom Doctools <i>troff</i> and <i>mandoc</i> (since 1.14.5)
       support these GNU extensions; Documenter's Workbench, Plan 9, and
       Solaris <i>troff</i>s do not.  See subsection “Use of extensions” below.

       <b>.SY </b><i>keyword</i> [<i>suffix</i>]
              Begin synopsis.  Adjustment and automatic hyphenation are
              disabled.  If <b>.SY </b>has already been called without a
              corresponding <b>.YS</b>, a break is performed.  <i>keyword</i> and
              <i>suffix</i> (if any) are set in bold.  If a break is required
              in subsequent text (up to another paragraphing,
              sectioning, or synopsis macro call), lines after the first
              are indented.  The indentation amount is the width of
              <i>keyword</i> plus a space, if that is the only argument, and by
              the sum of the widths of <i>keyword</i> and <i>suffix</i> otherwise.

       <b>.YS </b>[<i>reuse-indentation</i>]
              End synopsis, breaking the line and restoring indentation,
              adjustment, and hyphenation to their previous states.  If
              an argument is given, the indentation corresponding to the
              previous <b>.SY </b>call is reused by the next <b>.SY </b>call instead
              of being computed.

       Interleave multiple <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS </b>blocks with paragraphing macros to

       Several features of the above example are of note.

       •  The empty request (.), which does nothing, vertically spaces
          the input file for readability by the document maintainer.  Do
          not put blank (empty) lines in a man page source document.

       •  Command and option names are presented in <b>bold </b>to cue the user
          that they should be input literally.

       •  Option dashes are specified with the <b>\- </b>escape sequence; this
          is an important practice to make them clearly visible and to
          facilitate copy-and-paste from the rendered man page to a
          shell prompt or text file.

       •  Option arguments and command operands are presented in <i>italics</i>
          (but see subsection “Font style macros” below regarding
          terminals) to cue the user that they must be replaced with
          appropriate input.

       •  Symbols that are neither to be typed literally nor replaced at
          the user's discretion appear in the roman style; brackets
          surround optional arguments, and an ellipsis indicates that
          the previous syntactic element may be repeated arbitrarily.
          Where whitespace separates optional arguments, a space
          precedes the ellipsis.

       •  The non-breaking adjustable space escape sequence <b>\~ </b>prevents
          the output line from breaking within the option brackets; see
          subsection “Portability” below.

       •  The output line continuation escape sequence <b>\c </b>is used with
          font style alternation macros to allow all three font styles
          to be set without (breakable) space among them; see subsection
          “Portability” below.

       •  The dummy character escape sequence <b>\&amp; </b>follows the ellipsis
          when further text will follow after space on the output line,
          keeping its last period from being interpreted as the end of a
          sentence and causing additional inter-sentence space to be
          placed after it.  See subsection “Portability” below.

       We might synopsize the standard C library function <i>bsearch</i>(3) as
       follows.

              .P
              .B void *\c
              .SY bsearch (
              .BI const\~void\~* key ,
              .BI const\~void\~* base ,
              .BI size_t\~ nmemb ,
              .BI int\~(* compar )\c
              .B (const\~void\~*, const\~void\~*));
              .YS

       <i>man</i> produces the following result.

              <b>void *</b>

              <b>bsearch const void *</b><i>key</i><b>, const void *</b><i>base</i><b>, size_t </b><i>nmemb</i><b>,</b>
                      <b>int (*</b><i>compar</i><b>)(const void *, const void *));</b>

   <b>Hyperlink macros</b>
       Man page cross references like <i>ls</i>(1) are best presented with <b>.MR</b>.
       Text may be hyperlinked to email addresses with <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME </b>or other
       URIs with <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>.  Not all output devices support hyperlinking
       of text; terminals and pager programs must support ECMA-48 OSC 8
       escape sequences (see <i>grotty</i>(1)).  When device support is
       unavailable or disabled with the <b>U </b>register (see section
       “Options” below), <b>.MT </b>and <b>.UR </b>URIs are rendered between angle
       brackets after the linked text.

       <b>.MT</b>, <b>.ME</b>, <b>.UR</b>, and <b>.UE </b>are GNU extensions supported by Heirloom
       Doctools and <i>mandoc</i> (<b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE </b>since 1.12.3; <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME </b>since 1.14.2)
       but not by Documenter's Workbench, Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff</i>s.
       Plan 9 from User Space's <i>troff</i> implements <b>.MR</b>.  See subsection
       “Use of extensions” below.

       The arguments to <b>.MR</b>, <b>.MT</b>, and <b>.UR </b>should be prepared for
       typesetting since they can appear in the output.  Use special
       character escape sequences to encode Unicode basic Latin
       characters where necessary, particularly the hyphen-minus.  (See
       section “Portability” below.)  URIs can be lengthy; rendering
       them can result in jarring adjustment or variations in line
       length, or <i>troff</i> warnings when a hyperlink is longer than an
       output line.  The application of non-printing break point escape
       sequences <b>\: </b>after each slash (or series thereof), and before
       each dot (or series thereof) is recommended as a rule of thumb.
       The former practice avoids forcing a trailing slash in a URI onto
       a separate output line, and the latter helps the reader to avoid
       mistakenly interpreting a dot at the end of a line as a period
       (or multiple dots as an ellipsis).  Thus,
              .UR <a href="#">http://\:example\:.com/\:fb8afcfbaebc74e\:.cc</a>
       has several potential break points in the URI shown.  Consider
       adding break points before or after at signs in email addresses,
       and question marks, ampersands, and number signs in HTTP(S) URIs.
       The formatter removes <b>\: </b>escape sequences from hyperlinks when
       supplying device control commands to output drivers.

       <b>.MR </b><i>topic</i> [<i>manual-section</i> [<i>trailing-text</i>]]
              <i>(since</i> groff <i>1.23)</i> Set a man page cross reference as
              “<i>topic</i><b>(</b><i>manual-section</i><b>)</b>”.  If <i>manual-section</i> is absent, the
              package omits the surrounding parentheses.  If <i>trailing-</i>
              <i>text</i> (typically punctuation) is specified, it follows the
              closing parenthesis without intervening space.
              Hyphenation is disabled while the cross reference is set.
              <i>topic</i> is set in the font specified by the <b>MF </b>string.  If
              <i>manual-section</i> is present, the cross reference hyperlinks
              to a URI of the form “<b>man:</b><i>topic</i>(<i>manual-section</i>)”.

                     The output driver
                     .MR grops 1
                     produces PostScript from

       <b>.MT </b><i>address</i>
       <b>.ME </b>[<i>trailing-text</i>]
              Identify <i>address</i> as an RFC 6068 <i>addr-spec</i> for a “mailto:”
              URI with the text between the two macro calls as the link
              text.  An argument to <b>.ME </b>is placed after the link text
              without intervening space.  <i>address</i> may not be visible in
              the rendered document if hyperlinks are enabled and
              supported by the output driver.  If they are not, <i>address</i>
              is set in angle brackets after the link text and before
              <i>trailing-text.</i>  If hyperlinking is enabled but there is no
              link text, <i>address</i> is formatted and hyperlinked <i>without</i>
              angle brackets.

       <b>.UR </b><i>uri</i>
       <b>.UE </b>[<i>trailing-text</i>]
              Identify <i>uri</i> as an RFC 3986 URI hyperlink with the text
              between the two macro calls as the link text.  An argument
              to <b>.UE </b>is placed after the link text without intervening
              space.  <i>uri</i> may not be visible in the rendered document if
              hyperlinks are enabled and supported by the output driver.
              If they are not, <i>uri</i> is set in angle brackets after the
              link text and before <i>trailing-text.</i>  If hyperlinking is
              enabled but there is no link text, <i>uri</i> is formatted and
              hyperlinked <i>without</i> angle brackets.

       If a <b>.TP </b>call is followed immediately by hyperlinking macros
       <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE </b>or <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>, and the device doesn't support hyperlinking,
       the hyperlink is set at the beginning of the indented paragraph,
       not as part of the tag.

   <b>Font style macros</b>
       The <i>man</i> macro package is limited in its font styling options,
       offering only <b>bold </b>(<b>.B</b>), <i>italic</i> (<b>.I</b>), and roman.  Italic text is
       usually set underscored instead on terminals.  <b>.SM </b>sets text at a
       smaller type size, which differs visually from regular-sized text
       only on typesetters.  It is often necessary to set text in
       different styles without intervening space.  The macros <b>.BI</b>, <b>.BR</b>,
       <b>.IB</b>, <b>.IR</b>, <b>.RB</b>, and <b>.RI</b>, where “B”, “I”, and “R” indicate bold,
       italic, and roman, respectively, set their odd- and even-numbered
       arguments in alternating styles, with no space separating them.

       Because font styles are presentational rather than semantic,
       conflicting traditions have arisen regarding which font styles
       should be used to mark file or path names, environment variables,
       and inlined literals.

       The default type size and family for typesetters is 10-point
       Times, except on the <b>X75-12 </b>and <b>X100-12 </b>devices where the type
       size is 12 points.  The default style is roman.

       <b>.B </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in bold.  If no argument is given, the macro
              plants a one-line input trap; text on the next line, which
              can be further formatted with a macro, is set in bold.

              Use bold for literal portions of syntax synopses, for
              command-line options in running text, and for literals
              that are major topics of the subject under discussion; for
              example, this page uses bold for macro, string, and
              register names.  In an <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE </b>example of interactive I/O
              (such as a shell session), set only user input in bold.

       <b>.I </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in an italic or oblique face.  If no argument is
              given, the macro plants a one-line input trap; text on the
              next line, which can be further formatted with a macro, is
              set in an italic or oblique face.

              Use italics for file and path names, for environment
              variables, for C data types, for enumeration or
              preprocessor constants in C, for variant (user-
              replaceable) portions of syntax synopses, for the first
              occurrence (only) of a technical concept being introduced,
              for names of journals and of literary works longer than an
              article, and anywhere a parameter requiring replacement by
              the user is encountered.  An exception involves variant
              text in a context already typeset in italics, such as file
              or path names with replaceable components; in such cases,
              follow the convention of mathematical typography: set the
              file or path name in italics as usual but use roman for
              the variant part (see <b>.IR </b>and <b>.RI </b>below), and italics
              again in running roman text when referring to the variant
              material.

       <b>.SM </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> one point smaller than the default type size on
              typesetters.  If no argument is given, the macro plants a
              one-line input trap; text on the next line, which can be
              further formatted with a macro, is set smaller.

              <i>Note:</i> terminals will render <i>text</i> at normal size instead.
              Do not rely upon <b>.SM </b>to communicate semantic information
              distinct from using roman style at normal size; it will be
              hidden from readers using such devices.

       Observe what is <i>not</i> prescribed for setting in bold or italics
       above: elements of “synopsis language” such as ellipses and
       brackets around options; proper names and adjectives; titles of
       anything other than major works of literature; identifiers for
       standards documents or technical reports such as CSTR #54,
       RFC 1918, Unicode 13.0, or POSIX.1-2017; acronyms; and
       occurrences after the first of a technical term.

       Be frugal with italics for emphasis, and particularly with bold.
       Article titles and brief runs of literal text, such as references
       to individual characters or short strings, including section and
       subsection headings of man pages, are suitable objects for
       quotation; see the <b>\(lq</b>, <b>\(rq</b>, <b>\(oq</b>, and <b>\(cq </b>escape sequences in
       subsection “Portability” below.

       Unlike the above font style macros, the font style alternation
       macros below set no input traps; they must be given arguments to
       have effect.  They apply italic corrections as appropriate.  If a
       space is required within an argument, first consider whether the
       same result could be achieved with as much clarity by using
       single-style macros on separate input lines.  When it cannot,
       double-quote an argument containing embedded space characters.
       Setting all three different styles within a word presents
       challenges; it is possible with the <b>\c </b>and/or <b>\f </b>escape
       sequences.  See subsection “Portability” below for approaches.

       unit.  If no scaling unit is given, the <i>man</i> package assumes “n”;
       that is, roughly the width of a letter “n” in the font current
       when the macro is called—see section “Measurements” in <i>groff</i>(7).
       An indentation specified in a call to <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, or the deprecated
       <b>.HP </b>persists until (1) another of these macros is called with an
       <i>indentation</i> argument, or (2) <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, or <b>.P </b>or its synonyms is
       called; these clear the indentation entirely.

       The inset amount and indentation are related but distinct
       parameters with the same defaults.  The former is manipulated by
       <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE </b>(and by <b>.SH </b>and <b>.SS</b>, which reset it to the default).
       Indentation is controlled by the paragraphing macros (though,
       again, <b>.SH </b>and <b>.SS </b>reset it); it is imposed by the <b>.TP</b>, <b>.IP</b>, and
       deprecated <b>.HP </b>macros, and cancelled by <b>.P </b>and its synonyms.  An
       extensive example follows.

       This ordinary (<b>.P</b>) paragraph is not in a relative inset nor does
       it possess an indentation.

              Now we have created a relative inset with <b>.RS </b>and started
              another ordinary paragraph with <b>.P</b>.  We observe that all
              of its lines are inset and indented the same; contrast
              with a first-line indentation.

              <b>tag    </b>This tagged paragraph, set with <b>.TP</b>, is still
                     within the <b>.RS </b>region, but lines after the first
                     have a supplementary indentation that the tag
                     lacks.

                     A paragraph like this one, set with <b>.IP</b>, will
                     appear to the reader as also associated with the
                     tag above, because <b>.IP </b>re-uses the previous
                     paragraph's indentation unless given an argument to
                     change it.  Both the inset amount (<b>.RS</b>) and
                     indentation (<b>.IP</b>) affect this paragraph.
                     ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
                     │ This table is affected both by    │
                     │ the inset amount and indentation. │
                     └───────────────────────────────────┘

              •      This indented paragraph is marked with a bullet,
                     contrasting the inset amount and the indentation;
                     only the former affects the mark, but both affect
                     the text of the paragraph.

              This ordinary (<b>.P</b>) paragraph resets the indentation, but
              the inset amount is unchanged.
              ┌─────────────────────────────┐
              │ This table is affected only │
              │ by the inset amount.        │
              └─────────────────────────────┘

       Finally, we have ended the relative inset by using <b>.RE</b>, which
       (because we used only one <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE </b>pair) has restored the inset
       amount to its initial value.  This is an ordinary <b>.P </b>paragraph.

       Resist the temptation to mock up tabular or multi-column output
       with tab characters or the indentation arguments to <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>,
       <b>.RS</b>, or the deprecated <b>.HP</b>; the result may not be comprehensible
       on an output device you fail to check, or which is developed in
       the future.  Consider the table preprocessor <i>tbl</i>(1) instead.

       Several macros insert vertical space: <b>.SH</b>, <b>.SS</b>, <b>.TP</b>, <b>.P </b>(and its
       synonyms), <b>.IP</b>, and the deprecated <b>.HP</b>.  The default inter-
       section and inter-paragraph spacing is 1v for terminals and 0.4v
       for typesetters.  “v” is a unit of vertical distance, where 1v is
       the distance between adjacent text baselines.  (The deprecated
       macro <b>.PD </b>can change this vertical spacing, but we discourage its
       use.)  Between <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE </b>calls, the inter-paragraph spacing is
       1v regardless of output device.

   <b>Registers</b>
       Registers are described in section “Options” below.  They can be
       set not only on the command line but in the site <i>man.local</i> file
       as well; see section “Files” below.

   <b>Strings</b>
       The following strings are defined for use in man pages.  Others
       are supported for configuration of rendering parameters; see
       section “Options” below.

       <b>\*R    </b>interpolates a special character escape sequence for the
              “registered sign” glyph, <b>\(rg</b>, if available, and “(Reg.)”
              otherwise.

       <b>\*S    </b>interpolates an escape sequence setting the type size to
              the document default.

       <b>\*(lq</b>
       <b>\*(rq  </b>interpolate special character escape sequences for left
              and right double-quotation marks, <b>\(lq </b>and <b>\(rq</b>,
              respectively.

       <b>\*(Tm  </b>interpolates a special character escape sequence for the
              “trade mark sign” glyph, <b>\(tm</b>, if available, and “(TM)”
              otherwise.

       None of the above is necessary in a contemporary man page.  <b>\*S</b>
       is superfluous, since type size changes are invisible on
       terminals and macros that change it restore its original value
       afterward.  Better alternatives exist for the rest; simply use
       the <b>\(rg</b>, <b>\(lq</b>, <b>\(rq</b>, and <b>\(tm </b>special character escape sequences
       directly.  Unless you are aiming for a pathological level of
       portability—perhaps composing a man page for consumption on
       simulators of 1980s Unix systems (or Solaris <i>troff</i>, though even
       it supports <b>\(rg</b>)—avoid using the above strings.

   <b>Use of extensions</b>
       To ensure that your man page formats reliably on a wide variety
       of viewers, write it solely with the macros described in this
       page (except for the ones identified as deprecated, which you
       should avoid).  The macros we have described as extensions might
       not be supported by a formatter that is important to your
       audience.  Nevertheless, <i>groff</i>'s extensions are present because
       they perform tasks that are otherwise difficult or tedious to
       achieve portably.  If you require an extension but also expect
       your man page to be rendered on a system that doesn't support it,
       consider writing a configuration test that measures a property of
       the system, and use <i>m4</i>(1), <i>sed</i>(1), or a similar tool to generate
       a <i>.man</i> file from a <i>.man.in</i> file, defining page-local versions of
       extension macros only where necessary.  You can copy extension
       macro definitions from <i>groff</i>; see <i>an-ext.tmac</i> in section “Files”
       below.

       For example, we might put a line
              @DEFINE_MR@
       in our <i>man</i> document at the end of the “Name” section, test a
       system for the availability of the <i>groff man</i> <b>.MR </b>macro, remove
       the line if the macro is present, and “inline” a definition
       otherwise, as follows.  (This version is slightly simplified and
       does not attempt to disable hyphenation when setting arguments to
       <b>.MR</b>.)
              have_MR=$(echo .pm | troff -man 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep MR)
              if [ -n "$have_MR" ]
              then
                sed '/@DEFINE_MR@/d' myprog.man.in &gt; myprog.man
              else
                sed 's/@DEFINE_MR@/.de MR\
              .  ie \\\\n(.$=1 .I \\\\$1\
              .  el .IR \\\\$1 (\\\\$2)\\\\$3\
              ../' myprog.man.in &gt; myprog.man
              fi
       (The profusion of backslashes is due to its status as an escape
       character in both <i>roff</i> and <i>sed</i>.)

       If the foregoing method is too much trouble, you could apply the
       radical technique of reading your man page using every formatter
       of interest, confirming satisfactory output from each.  Test
       documentation for syntactic validity and semantic correctness,
       just as you would test code.

   <b>Portability</b>
       An installed man page should contain Unicode basic Latin code
       points exclusively.  One can <i>maintain</i> it in a more convenient
       encoding, using <i>preconv</i>(1) to produce a basic Latin version that
       employs special character escape sequences to access code points
       necessary in non-English text.

       The two major features that control formatting in the <i>roff</i>
       language are requests and escape sequences.  Since the <i>man</i> macros
       are implemented in terms of these, one can, in principle,
       supplement the functionality of <i>man</i> with these lower-level
       elements where necessary.

       However, use of <i>roff</i> requests (apart from the empty request “<b>.</b>”)
       risks poor rendering when your page is processed by tools other
       than <i>roff</i> formatters that attempt to interpret page sources.
       (Historically, this was commonly attempted for HTML conversion.)
       Requests might make assumptions about line length that do not
       hold in an HTML environment.  Many of these programs don't
       interpret the full <i>roff</i> language (let alone extensions): they may
       be incapable of handling numeric expressions, control structures,
       or register, string, and macro definitions.  Such limitations can
       lead to portions of a document being presented incomprehensibly
       or omitted altogether.

       It is wise to quote multi-word section and subsection headings;
       the <b>.SH </b>and <b>.SS </b>macros of <i>man</i>(7) implementations descended from
       Seventh Edition Unix supported six arguments at most.  This
       restriction also applied to the <b>.B</b>, <b>.I</b>, <b>.SM</b>, and font style
       alternation macros.

       Exercise restraint with escape sequences as with requests.  Some
       escape sequences are however required for correct typesetting
       even in man pages and usually do not cause portability problems.

       Several of these render glyphs corresponding to punctuation code
       points in the Unicode basic Latin range (U+0000–U+007F) that are
       handled specially in <i>roff</i> input; the escape sequences below must
       be used to render them correctly and portably when documenting
       material that uses them as literals—namely, any of the set <b>' - \</b>
       <b>^ ` ~ </b>(apostrophe, dash or hyphen-minus, backslash, caret, grave
       accent, tilde).

       <b>\"        </b>Comment.  Everything after the double-quote to the end
                 of the input line is ignored.  Whole-line comments
                 should be placed immediately after the empty request
                 (“<b>.</b>”).

       <b>\</b><i>newline</i>  Join the next input line to the current one.  Except
                 for the update of the input line counter (used for
                 diagnostic messages and related purposes), a series of
                 lines ending in backslash-newline appears to <i>groff</i> as a
                 single input line.  Use this escape sequence to split
                 excessively long input lines for document maintenance.

       <b>\%        </b>Control hyphenation.  The location of this escape
                 sequence within a word marks a hyphenation point,
                 supplementing <i>groff</i>'s automatic hyphenation patterns.
                 At the beginning of a word, it suppresses any
                 hyphenation breaks within <i>except</i> those specified with
                 <b>\%</b>.

       <b>\:        </b>Insert a non-printing break point.  A word can break at
                 such a point, but a hyphen glyph is not written to the
                 output if it does.  <b>\: </b>is an input word boundary, so
                 the remainder of the word is subject to hyphenation as
                 normal.  You can use <b>\: </b>and <b>\% </b>in combination to
                 control breaking of a file name or URI or to permit
                 hyphenation only after certain explicit hyphens within
                 a word.  See subsection “Hyperlink macros” above for an
                 example.

                 <b>\: </b>is a GNU extension also supported by Heirloom
                 Doctools <i>troff</i> 050915 (September 2005), <i>mandoc</i> 1.13.1
                 (2014-08-10), and <i>neatroff</i> (commit 399a4936,
                 2014-02-17), but not by Plan 9, Solaris, or
                 Documenter's Workbench <i>troff</i>s.

       <b>\~        </b>Adjustable non-breaking space.  Use this escape
                 sequence to prevent a break inside a short phrase or
                 between a numerical quantity and its corresponding
                 unit(s).

                        Before starting the motor,
                        set the output speed to\~1.

                        CSTR\~#8 documents the B\~language.

                 <b>\~ </b>is a GNU extension also supported by Heirloom
                 Doctools <i>troff</i> 050915 (September 2005), <i>mandoc</i> 1.9.14
                 (2009-11-16), <i>neatroff</i> (commit 1c6ab0f6e, 2016-09-13),
                 and Plan 9 from User Space <i>troff</i> (commit 93f8143600,
                 2022-08-12), but not by Solaris or Documenter's
                 Workbench <i>troff</i>s.

       <b>\&amp;        </b>Dummy character.  Insert at the beginning of an input
                 line to prevent a dot or apostrophe from being
                 interpreted as beginning a <i>roff</i> control line.  Append
                 to an end-of-sentence punctuation sequence to keep it
                 from being recognized as such.

       <b>\|        </b>Thin space (one-sixth em on typesetters, zero-width on
                 terminals); a non-breaking space.  Used primarily in
                 ellipses (“.\|.\|.”) to space the dots more pleasantly
                 on typesetters like <b>dvi</b>, <b>pdf</b>, and <b>ps</b>.

       <b>\c        </b>End a text line without inserting space or attempting a
                 break.  Normally, if filling is enabled, the end of a
                 text line is treated like a space; an output line <i>may</i>
                 break there (if it does not, <i>troff</i> inserts an
                 adjustable space); if filling is disabled, the line
                 <i>will</i> break there, as in <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE </b>examples.  The next
                 line is interpreted as usual and can include a macro
                 call (contrast with <b>\</b><i>newline</i>).  <b>\c </b>is useful when three
                 font styles are needed in a single word, as in a
                 command synopsis.

                        .RB [ \-\-stylesheet=\c
                        .IR name ]

                 It also helps when changing font styles in <b>.EX</b>/<b>.EE</b>
                 examples, since they are not filled.

                        .EX
                        $ \c
                        .B groff \-T utf8 \-Z \c
                        .I file \c
                        .B | grotty \-i
                        .EE

                 Alternatively, and perhaps with better portability, the
                 <b>\f </b>font selection escape sequence can be used; see
                 below.  Using <b>\c </b>to continue a <b>.TP </b>paragraph tag across
                 multiple input lines will render incorrectly with <i>groff</i>
                 1.22.3, <i>mandoc</i> 1.14.1, older versions of these
                 programs, and perhaps with some other formatters.

       <b>\e        </b>Format the <i>roff</i> escape character on the output; widely
                 used in man pages to render a backslash glyph.  It
                 works reliably as long as the “.ec” request is not
                 used, which should never happen in man pages, and it is
                 slightly more portable than the more explicit <b>\(rs</b>
                 (“reverse solidus”) special character escape sequence.

       <b>\fB</b>, <b>\fI</b>, <b>\fR</b>, <b>\fP</b>
                 Switch to bold, italic, roman, or back to the previous
                 style, respectively.  Either <b>\f </b>or <b>\c </b>is needed when
                 three different font styles are required in a word.

                        .RB [ \-\-reference\-dictionary=\fI\,name\/\fP ]

                        .RB [ \-\-reference\-dictionary=\c
                        .IR name ]

                 Style escape sequences may be more portable than <b>\c</b>.
                 As shown above, it is up to you to account for italic
                 corrections with “<b>\/</b>” and “<b>\,</b>”, which are themselves
                 GNU extensions, if desired and if supported by your
                 implementation.

                 <b>\fP </b>reliably returns to the style in use immediately
                 preceding the previous <b>\f </b>escape sequence only if no
                 sectioning, paragraph, example, or style macro calls
                 have intervened.

                 As long as at most two styles are needed in a word,
                 style macros like <b>.B </b>and <b>.BI </b>usually result in more
                 readable <i>roff</i> source than <b>\f </b>escape sequences do.

       Several special characters are also widely portable.  Except for
       <b>\-</b>, <b>\(em</b>, and <b>\(ga</b>, AT&amp;T <i>troff</i> did not consistently define the
       characters listed below, but its descendants, like Plan 9 or
       Solaris <i>troff</i>, can be made to support them by defining them in
       font description files, making them aliases of existing glyphs if
       necessary; see <i>groff_font</i>(5).  <i>groff</i>'s extended notation for
       special characters, <b>\[</b><i>xx</i><b>]</b>, is also supported by <i>mandoc</i>(1),
       Heirloom Doctools <i>troff</i>, and <i>neatroff</i>, but not Documenter's
       Workbench, Plan 9, or Solaris <i>troff.</i>

       <b>\-     </b>Minus sign.  <b>\- </b>produces the basic Latin hyphen-minus
              (U+002D) specifying Unix command-line options and
              frequently used in file names.  “<b>-</b>” is a hyphen in <i>roff</i>;
              some output devices format it as U+2010 (hyphen).

       <b>\(aq   </b>Basic Latin neutral apostrophe.  Some output devices
              format “<b>'</b>” as a right single quotation mark.

       <b>\(oq</b>
       <b>\(cq   </b>Opening (left) and closing (right) single quotation marks.
              Use these for paired directional single quotes, ‘like
              this’.

       <b>\(dq   </b>Basic Latin quotation mark (double quote).  Use in macro
              calls to prevent ‘<b>"</b>’ from being interpreted as beginning a
              quoted argument, or simply for readability.

                     .TP
                     .BI "split \(dq" text \(dq

       <b>\(lq</b>
       <b>\(rq   </b>Left and right double quotation marks.  Use these for
              paired directional double quotes, “like this”.

       <b>\(em   </b>Em dash.  Use for an interruption—such as this one—in a
              sentence.

       <b>\(en   </b>En dash.  Use to separate the ends of a range,
              particularly between numbers; for example, “the digits
              1–9”.

       <b>\(ga   </b>Basic Latin grave accent.  Some output devices format “<b>`</b>”
              as a left single quotation mark.

       <b>\(ha   </b>Basic Latin circumflex accent (“hat”).  Some output
              devices format “<b>^</b>” as U+02C6 (modifier letter circumflex
              accent).

       <b>\(rs   </b>Reverse solidus (backslash).  The backslash is the default
              escape character in the <i>roff</i> language, so it does not
              represent itself in output.  Also see <b>\e </b>above.

       <b>\(ti   </b>Basic Latin tilde.  Some output devices format “<b>~</b>” as
              U+02DC (small tilde).

       For maximum portability, avoid escape sequences (including
       special characters) not listed above.

   <b>Hooks</b>
       Two macros, both GNU extensions, are called internally by the
       <i>groff man</i> package to format page headers and footers and can be
       redefined by the administrator in a site's <i>man.local</i> file (see
       section “Files” below).  The presentation of <b>.TH </b>above describes
       the default headers and footers.  Because these macros are hooks
       for <i>groff man</i> internals, man pages have no reason to call them.
       Such hook definitions will likely consist of “.sp” and “.tl”
       requests.  They must also increase the page length with “.pl”
       requests in continuous rendering mode; <b>.PT </b>furthermore has the
       responsibility of emitting a PDF bookmark after writing the first
       page header in a document.  Consult the existing implementations
       in <i>an.tmac</i> when drafting replacements.

       <b>.BT    </b>Set the page footer text (“bottom trap”).

       <b>.PT    </b>Set the page header text (“page trap”).

       To remove a page header or footer entirely, define the
       appropriate macro as empty rather than deleting it.

   <b>Deprecated features</b>
       Use of the following in man pages for public distribution is
       discouraged.

       <b>.AT </b>[<i>system</i> [<i>release</i>]]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy AT&amp;T man pages,
              overriding any definition of the <i>footer-inside</i> argument to
              <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only to render man pages from
              historical systems.

              The inside footer is populated per the value of <i>system.</i>

                     3      7th edition <i>(default)</i>

                     4      System III

                     5      System V

              The optional <i>release</i> argument specifies the release
              number, as in “System V Release 3”.

       <b>.DT    </b>Reset tab stops to the default (every 0.5i [inches]).

              Use of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact space control
              and tabulation are not readily available.  Thus,
              information or distinctions that you use tab stops to
              express are likely to be lost.  If you feel tempted to
              change the tab stops such that calling this macro later to
              restore them is desirable, consider composing a table
              using <i>tbl</i>(1) instead.

       <b>.HP </b>[<i>indentation</i>]
              Set up a paragraph with a hanging left indentation.
              <i>indentation,</i> if present, is handled as with <b>.TP</b>.

              Use of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  A
              hanging indentation cannot be expressed naturally in HTML,
              a hanging paragraph is not distinguishable from an
              ordinary one if it formats on only one output line, and
              non-<i>roff</i>-based man page interpreters may treat <b>.HP </b>as an
              ordinary paragraph.  Thus, information or distinctions you
              mean to express with indentation may be lost.

       <b>.OP </b><i>option-name</i> [<i>option-argument</i>]
              Indicate an optional command parameter called <i>option-name</i>,
              which is set in bold.  If the option takes an argument,
              specify <i>option-argument</i> using a noun, abbreviation, or
              hyphenated noun phrase.  If present, <i>option-argument</i> is
              preceded by a space and set in italics.  Square brackets
              in roman surround both arguments.

              Use of this quasi-semantic macro, an extension originating
              in Documenter's Workbench <i>troff</i>, is deprecated.  It cannot
              easily be used to annotate options that take optional
              arguments or options whose arguments have internal
              structure (such as a mixture of literal and variable
              components).  One could work around these limitations with
              font selection escape sequences, but it is preferable to
              use font style alternation macros, which afford greater
              flexibility.

       <b>.PD </b>[<i>vertical-space</i>]
              Configure the amount of vertical space between paragraphs
              or (sub)sections.  The optional argument <i>vertical-space</i>
              specifies the amount; the default scaling unit is “v”.
              Without an argument, the spacing is reset to its default
              value; see subsection “Horizontal and vertical spacing”
              above.

              Use of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.  It
              translates poorly to HTML, under which exact control of
              inter-paragraph spacing is not readily available.  Thus,
              information or distinctions that you use <b>.PD </b>to express
              are likely to be lost.

       <b>.SB </b>[<i>text</i>]
              Set <i>text</i> in bold and (on typesetters) one point smaller
              than the default type size.  If no argument is given, the
              macro plants a one-line input trap; text on the next line,
              which can be further formatted with a macro, is set
              smaller and in bold.  Use of this macro, an extension
              originating in SunOS 4.0 <i>troff</i>, is deprecated.  <b>.SM</b>
              without an argument, followed immediately by “<b>.B </b><i>text</i>”,
              produces the same output more portably.  The macros' order
              is interchangeable; put <i>text</i> with the latter.

              <i>Note:</i> terminals will render <i>text</i> in bold at the normal
              size instead.  Do not rely upon <b>.SB </b>to communicate
              semantic information distinct from using bold style at
              normal size; it will be hidden from readers using such
              devices.

       <b>.UC </b>[<i>version</i>]
              Alter the footer for use with legacy BSD man pages,
              overriding any definition of the <i>footer-inside</i> argument to
              <b>.TH</b>.  This macro exists only to render man pages from
              historical systems.

              The inside footer is populated per the value of <i>version.</i>

   <b>History</b>
       M. Douglas McIlroy ⟨m.douglas.mcilroy@dartmouth.edu⟩ designed,
       implemented, and documented the AT&amp;T <i>man</i> macros for Unix
       Version 7 (1979) and employed them to edit the first volume of
       its <i>Programmer's Manual</i>, a compilation of all man pages supplied
       by the system.  That <i>man</i> supported the macros listed in this page
       not described as extensions, except <b>.P </b>and the deprecated <b>.AT </b>and
       <b>.UC</b>.  The only strings defined were <b>R </b>and <b>S</b>; no registers were
       documented.

       <b>.UC </b>appeared in 3BSD (1980).  Unix System III (1980) introduced
       <b>.P </b>and exposed the registers <b>IN </b>and <b>LL</b>, which had been internal
       to Seventh Edition Unix <i>man</i>.  PWB/UNIX 2.0 (1980) added the <b>Tm</b>
       string.  4BSD (1980) added <b>lq </b>and <b>rq </b>strings.  SunOS 2.0 (1985)
       recognized <b>C</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>X </b>registers.  4.3BSD (1986) added <b>.AT </b>and
       <b>.P</b>.  Ninth Edition Unix (1986) introduced <b>.EX </b>and <b>.EE</b>.  SunOS 4.0
       (1988) added <b>.SB</b>.

       James Clark implemented the foregoing features in early versions
       of <i>groff.</i>  Later, <i>groff</i> 1.20 (2009) originated <b>.SY</b>/<b>.YS</b>, <b>.TQ</b>,
       <b>.MT</b>/<b>.ME</b>, and <b>.UR</b>/<b>.UE</b>.  Plan 9 from User Space's <i>troff</i> introduced
       <b>.MR </b>in 2020.
</pre> <h2>
Options </h2>
<pre>
       The following <i>groff</i> options set registers (with <b>-r</b>) and strings
       (with <b>-d</b>) recognized and used by the <i>man</i> macro package.  To
       ensure rendering consistent with output device capabilities and
       reader preferences, man pages should never manipulate them.

       <b>-dAD=</b><i>adjustment-mode</i>
              Set line adjustment to <i>adjustment-mode,</i> which is typically
              “<b>b</b>” for adjustment to both margins (the default), or “<b>l</b>”
              for left alignment (ragged right margin).  Any valid
              argument to <i>groff</i>'s “.ad” request may be used.  See
              <i>groff</i>(7) for less-common choices.

       <b>-rBP=</b><i>base-paragraph-inset</i>
              Set the inset amount for ordinary paragraphs not within an
              <b>.RS</b>/<b>.RE </b>inset.  The default is 5n.

       <b>-rcR=1 </b>Enable continuous rendering.  Output is not paginated;
              instead, one (potentially very long) page is produced.
              This is the default for terminal and HTML devices.  Use
              <b>-rcR=0 </b>to disable it on terminals; on HTML devices, it
              cannot be disabled.

       <b>-rC1   </b>Number output pages consecutively, in strictly increasing
              sequence, rather than resetting the page number to 1 (or
              the value of register <b>P</b>) with each new <i>man</i> document.

       <b>-rCS=1 </b>Set section headings (the argument(s) to <b>.SH</b>) in full
              capitals.  This transformation is off by default because
              it discards case distinction information.

       <b>-rCT=1 </b>Set the man page identifier (the first argument to <b>.TH</b>) in
              full capitals in headers and footers.  This transformation
              is off by default because it discards case distinction
              information.

       <b>-rD1   </b>Enable double-sided layout, formatting footers for even
              and odd pages differently; see the description of <b>.TH </b>in
              subsection “Document structure macros” above.

       <b>-rFT=</b><i>footer-distance</i>
              Set distance of the footer relative to the bottom of the
              page to <i>footer-distance;</i> this amount is always negative.
              At one half-inch above this location, the page text is
              broken before writing the footer.  Ignored if continuous
              rendering is enabled.  The default is “-0.5i - 1v”.

       <b>-dHF=</b><i>heading-font</i>
              Select the font used for section and subsection headings;
              the default is “<b>B</b>” (bold style of the default family).
              Any valid argument to <i>groff</i>'s “.ft” request may be used.
              See <i>groff</i>(7).

       <b>-rHY=0 </b>Disable automatic hyphenation.  Normally, it is
              enabled (1).  The hyphenation mode is determined by the
              <i>groff</i> locale; see section “Localization“ of <i>groff</i>(7).

       <b>-rIN=</b><i>standard-indentation</i>
              Set the default indentation amount used by <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and
              the deprecated <b>.HP</b>, and the inset amount used by <b>.RS</b>.  The
              default is 7n on terminals and 7.2n on typesetters.  Use
              only integer multiples of unit “n” on terminals for
              consistent indentation.

       <b>-rLL=</b><i>line-length</i>
              Set line length; the default is 80n on terminals and 6.5i
              on typesetters.

       <b>-rLT=</b><i>title-length</i>
              Set the line length for titles.  (“Titles” is the <i>roff</i>
              term for headers and footers.)  By default, it is set to
              the line length (see <b>-rLL </b>above).

       <b>-dMF=</b><i>man-page-topic-font</i>
              Select the font used for man page identifiers in <b>.TH </b>calls
              and topics named in <b>.MR </b>calls; the default is “<b>I</b>” (italic
              style of the default family).  Any valid argument to
              <i>groff</i>'s “.ft” request may be used.  If the <b>MF </b>string ends
              in “I”, it is assumed to be an oblique typeface, and
              italic corrections are applied before and after man page
              topics and identifiers.

       <b>-rP</b><i>n</i>   Start enumeration of pages at <i>n</i>.  The default is 1.

       <b>-rPO=</b><i>page-offset</i>
              Set page offset; the default is 0 on terminals and 1i on
              typesetters.

       <b>-rS</b><i>type-size</i>
              Use <i>type-size</i> for the document's body text; acceptable
              values are 10, 11, or 12 points.  See subsection “Font
              style macros” above for the default.

       <b>-rSN=</b><i>subsection-indentation</i>
              Set indentation of subsection headings to <i>subsection-</i>
              <i>indentation.</i>  The default is 3n.

       <b>-rTS=</b><i>separation</i>
              Require the given <i>separation</i> between a <b>TP </b>paragraph's tag
              and its body.  The default is 2n.

       <b>-rU0   </b>Disable generation of URI hyperlinks in output drivers
              capable of them, making the arguments to <b>MT </b>and <b>UR </b>calls
              visible as formatted text.  <i>grohtml</i>(1), <i>gropdf</i>(1), and
              <i>grotty</i>(1) enable hyperlinks by default (the last only if
              not in legacy output mode).

       <b>-rX</b><i>p</i>   Number successors of page <i>p</i> as <i>p</i>a, <i>p</i>b, <i>p</i>c, and so forth.
              The register tracking the suffixed page letter uses format
              “a” (see the “.af” request in <i>groff</i>(7)).  For example, the
              option <b>-rX2 </b>produces the following page numbers: 1, 2, 2a,
              2b, ..., 2aa, 2ab, and so on.

Files </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/an.tmac</i>
              Most <i>man</i> macros are defined in this file.  It also loads
              extensions from <i>an-ext.tmac</i> (see below).

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/andoc.tmac</i>
              This brief <i>groff</i> program detects whether the <i>man</i> or <i>mdoc</i>
              macro package is being used by a document and loads the
              correct macro definitions, taking advantage of the fact
              that pages using them must call <b>.TH </b>or <b>.Dd</b>, respectively,
              before any other macros.  A <i>man</i> program or a user typing,
              for example, “<b>groff -mandoc page.1</b>”, need not know which
              package the file <i>page.1</i> uses.  Multiple man pages, in
              either format, can be handled; <i>andoc</i> reloads each macro
              package as necessary.  Page-local redefinitions of names
              used by the <i>man</i> or <i>mdoc</i> packages prior to <b>.TH </b>or <b>.Dd </b>calls
              will be “clobbered” by the reloading process.  If you want
              to provide your own definition of an extension macro to
              ensure its availability, the <i>an-ext.tmac</i> entry below
              offers advice.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/an-ext.tmac</i>
              Definitions of macros described above as extensions (and
              not deprecated) are contained in this file; in some cases,
              they are simpler versions of definitions appearing in
              <i>an.tmac</i>, and are ignored if the formatter is GNU <i>troff</i>.
              They are written to be compatible with AT&amp;T <i>troff</i> and
              permissively licensed—not copylefted.  To reduce the risk
              of name space collisions, string and register names begin
              only with “<b>m</b>”<b>.  </b>We encourage man page authors who are
              concerned about portability to legacy Unix systems to copy
              these definitions into their pages, and maintainers of
              <i>troff</i> implementations or work-alike systems that format
              man pages to re-use them.  To ensure reliable rendering,
              define them after your page calls <b>.TH</b>; see the discussion
              of <i>andoc.tmac</i> above.  Further, it is wise to define such
              page-local macros (if at all) after the “Name” section to
              accommodate timid <i>makewhatis</i>(8) or <i>mandb</i>(8)
              implementations that easily give up scanning for indexing
              material.

Notes </h2>
<pre>
       Some tips on composing and troubleshooting your man pages follow.

       • What's the difference between a man page topic and identifier?

         A single man page may document several related but distinct
         topics.  For example, <i>printf</i>(3) and <i>fprintf</i>(3) are often
         presented together.  Further, multiple programming languages
         have functions named “printf”, and may document these in a man
         page.  The identifier is intended to (with the section)
         uniquely identify a page on the system; it may furthermore
         correspond closely to the file name of the document.

         The <i>man</i>(1) librarian makes access to man pages convenient by
         resolving topics to man page identifiers.  Thus, you can type
         “<b>man fprintf</b>”, and other pages can refer to it, without knowing
         whether the installed document uses “printf”, “fprintf”, or
         even “c_printf” as an identifier.

       • Some ASCII characters look funny or copy and paste wrong.

         On devices with large glyph repertoires, like UTF-8-capable
         terminals and PDF, several keyboard glyphs are mapped to code
         points outside the Unicode basic Latin range because that
         usually results in better typography in the general case.  When
         documenting GNU/Linux command or C language syntax, however,
         this translation is sometimes not desirable.

         To get a “literal”...   ...should be input.

         Additionally, if a neutral double quote (") is needed in a
         macro argument, you can use <b>\(dq </b>to get it.  You should <i>not</i> use
         <b>\(aq </b>for an ordinary apostrophe (as in “can't”) or <b>\- </b>for an
         ordinary hyphen (as in “word-aligned”).  Review subsection
         “Portability” above.

       • Do I ever need to use an empty macro argument ("")?

         Probably not.  When this seems necessary, often a shorter or
         clearer alternative is available.

                Instead of...               ...should be considered.

         In the title heading (<b>.TH</b>), the date of the page's last
         revision is more important than packaging information; it
         should not be omitted.  Ideally, a page maintainer will keep
         both up to date.

         <b>.IP </b>is sometimes ill-understood and misused, especially when no
         mark argument is supplied—an indentation argument is not
         required.  By setting an explicit indentation, you may be
         overriding the reader's preference as set with the <b>-rIN </b>option.
         If your page renders adequately without one, use the simpler
         form.  If you need to indent multiple (unmarked) paragraphs,
         consider setting an inset region with <b>.RS </b>and <b>.RE </b>instead.

         In the last example, the empty argument does have a subtly
         different effect than its suggested replacement: the empty
         argument causes an additional space character to be
         interpolated between the arguments “two” and “three”—but it is
         a regular breaking space, so it can be discarded at the end of
         an output line.  It is better not to be subtle, particularly
         with space, which can be overlooked in source and rendered
         forms.

       • <b>.RS </b>doesn't indent relative to my indented paragraph.

         The <b>.RS </b>macro determines the <i>inset amount,</i> the position at
         which an <i>ordinary</i> paragraph (<b>.P </b>and its synonyms) will be set;
         the value of the <b>IN </b>register determines its default amount.
         This register also determines the default indentation used by
         <b>.IP</b>, <b>.TP</b>, and the deprecated <b>.HP</b>.  To create an inset relative
         to an indented paragraph, call <b>.RS </b>repeatedly until an
         acceptable indentation is achieved, or give <b>.RS </b>an indentation
         argument that is at least as much as the paragraph's
         indentation amount relative to an adjacent ordinary (<b>.P</b>)
         paragraph.

         Another approach to tagged paragraphs places an <b>.RS </b>call
         immediately after the tag; this will also force a break
         regardless of the tag's width, which some authors prefer.
         Follow-up paragraphs under the tag can then be set with <b>.P</b>
         instead of <b>.IP</b>.  Remember to use <b>.RE </b>to end the indented region
         before starting the next tagged paragraph (at the appropriate
         nesting level).

       • <b>.RE </b>doesn't move the inset back to the expected level.

         The <b>.RS </b>macro takes an inset <i>amount</i> as an argument; the <b>.RE</b>
         macro's argument is an inset <i>level.</i>  <b>.RE 1 </b>goes to the level
         before any <b>.RS </b>macros were called, <b>.RE 2 </b>goes to the level of
         the first <b>.RS </b>call you made, and so forth.  If you desire
         symmetry in your macro calls, simply issue one <b>.RE </b>without an
         argument for each <b>.RS </b>that precedes it.

         Calling the <b>.SH </b>or <b>.SS </b>sectioning macros clears all relative
         insets and <b>.RE </b>calls have no effect until <b>.RS </b>is used again.

       • Do I need to keep typing the indentation in a series of <b>.IP</b>
         calls?

         Not if you don't want to change it.  Review subsection
         “Horizontal and vertical spacing” above.

           Instead of...     ...should be considered.

       • Why doesn't the package provide a string to insert an ellipsis?

         Examples of ellipsis usage are shown above, in subsection
         “Synopsis macros”.  The idiomatic <i>roff</i> ellipsis is three dots
         (periods) with thin space escape sequences <b>\| </b>internally
         separating them.  Since dots both begin control lines and are
         candidate end-of-sentence characters, however, it is sometimes
         necessary to prefix and/or suffix an ellipsis with the dummy
         character escape sequence <b>\&amp;</b>.  That fact stands even if a
         string is defined to contain the sequence; further, if the
         string ends with <b>\&amp;</b>, end-of-sentence detection is defeated when
         you use the string at the end of an actual sentence.  (Ending a
         sentence with an ellipsis is often poor style, but not always.)
         A hypothetical string <b>EL </b>that contained an ellipsis, but not
         the trailing dummy character <b>\&amp;</b>, would then need to be suffixed
         with the latter when not ending a sentence.

             Instead of...              ...do this.
         ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
         .ds EL \&amp;.\|.\|.         Arguments are
         Arguments are            .IR src-file\~ .\|.\|.\&amp;
         .IR src-file\~ \*(EL\&amp;   .IR dest-dir .
         .IR dest-dir .
         ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

         The first column practices a false economy; the savings in
         typing is offset by the cost of obscuring even the suggestion
         of an ellipsis to a casual reader of the source document, and
         reduced portability to non-<i>roff</i> man page formatters that cannot
         handle string definitions.

         There is an ellipsis code point in Unicode, and some fonts have
         an ellipsis glyph, which some man pages have accessed in a non-
         portable way with the font-dependent <b>\N </b>escape sequence.  We
         discourage the use of these; on terminals, they may crowd the
         dots into a half-width character cell, and will not render at
         all if the output device doesn't have the glyph.  In syntax
         synopses, missing ellipses can mislead the reader.  Dots and
         space are universally supported.

       The initial GNU implementation of the <i>man</i> macro package was
       written by James Clark.  Later, Werner Lemberg ⟨wl@gnu.org⟩
       supplied the <b>S</b>, <b>LT</b>, and <b>cR </b>registers, the last a 4.3BSD-Reno
       <b>mdoc</b>(7) feature.  Larry Kollar ⟨kollar@alltel.net⟩ added the <b>FT</b>,
       <b>HY</b>, and <b>SN </b>registers; the <b>HF </b>string; and the <b>PT </b>and <b>BT </b>macros.
       G. Branden Robinson ⟨g.branden.robinson@gmail.com⟩ implemented
       the <b>AD </b>and <b>MF </b>strings; <b>BP</b>, <b>CS</b>, <b>CT</b>, <b>PO</b>, <b>TS</b>, and <b>U </b>registers; and
       the <b>MR </b>macro.  Extension macros since <i>groff</i> 1.20 were written by
       Lemberg, Eric S. Raymond ⟨esr@thyrsus.com⟩, and Robinson.

       This document was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux
       system by Susan G. Kleinmann ⟨sgk@debian.org⟩.  It was corrected
       and updated by Lemberg and Robinson.  The extension macros were
       documented by Raymond and Robinson.  Raymond also originated the
       portability section, to which Ingo Schwarze ⟨schwarze@usta.de⟩
       contributed most of the material on escape sequences.
