DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Terms (and abbreviations)</b>
       <i>string</i> (<i>str</i>)
              is a sequence of zero or more non-null characters followed
              by a null character.

       <i>character sequence</i>
              is a sequence of zero or more non-null characters.  A
              program should never use a character sequence where a
              string is required.  However, with appropriate care, a
              string can be used in the place of a character sequence.

              <i>null-padded character sequence</i>
                     Character sequences can be contained in fixed-size
                     buffers, which contain padding null bytes after the
                     character sequence, to fill the rest of the buffer
                     without affecting the character sequence; however,
                     those padding null bytes are not part of the
                     character sequence.  Don't confuse null-padded with
                     null-terminated: null-padded means 0 or more
                     padding null bytes, while null-terminated means
                     exactly 1 terminating null character.

              <i>known-length character sequence</i>
                     Character sequence delimited by its length.  It may
                     be a slice of a larger character sequence, or even
                     of a string.

       <i>length</i> (<i>len</i>)
              is the number of non-null characters in a string or
              character sequence.  It is the return value of <i>strlen(str)</i>
              and of <i>strnlen(buf, size)</i>.

       <i>size</i>   refers to the entire buffer where the string or character
              sequence is contained.

       <i>end</i>    is the name of a pointer to one past the last element of a
              buffer.  It is equivalent to <i>&amp;str[size]</i>.  It is used as a
              sentinel value, to be able to truncate strings or
              character sequences instead of overrunning the containing
              buffer.

       <i>copy</i>   This term is used when the writing starts at the first
              element pointed to by <i>dst</i>.

       <i>catenate</i>
              This term is used when a function first finds the
              terminating null character in <i>dst</i>, and then starts writing
              at that position.

       <i>chain</i>  This term is used when it's the programmer who provides a
              pointer to the terminating null character in the string
              <i>dst</i> (or one after the last character in a character
              sequence), and the function starts writing at that
              location.  The function returns a pointer to the new
              location of the terminating null character (or one after
              the last character in a character sequence) after the
              call, so that the programmer can use it to chain such
              calls.

       <i>duplicate</i>
              Allocate a new buffer where a copy is placed.

   <b>Copy, catenate, and chain-copy</b>
       Originally, there was a distinction between functions that copy
       and those that catenate.  However, newer functions that copy
       while allowing chaining cover both use cases with a single API.
       They are also algorithmically faster, since they don't need to
       search for the terminating null character of the existing string.
       However, functions that catenate have a much simpler use, so if
       performance is not important, it can make sense to use them for
       improving readability.

       The pointer returned by functions that allow chaining is a
       byproduct of the copy operation, so it has no performance costs.
       Functions that return such a pointer, and thus can be chained,
       have names of the form *<b>stp</b>*(), since it's common to name the
       pointer just <i>p</i>.

       Chain-copying functions that truncate should accept a pointer to
       the end of the destination buffer, and have names of the form
       *<b>stpe</b>*().  This allows not having to recalculate the remaining
       size after each call.

   <b>Truncate or not?</b>
       The first thing to note is that programmers should be careful
       with buffers, so they always have the correct size, and
       truncation is not necessary.

       In most cases, truncation is not desired, and it is simpler to
       just do the copy.  Simpler code is safer code.  Programming
       against programming mistakes by adding more code just adds more
       points where mistakes can be made.

       Nowadays, compilers can detect most programmer errors with
       features like compiler warnings, static analyzers, and
       <b>_FORTIFY_SOURCE </b>(see <b>ftm</b>(7)).  Keeping the code simple helps
       these overflow-detection features be more precise.

       When validating user input, code should normally not truncate,
       but instead fail and prevent the copy at all.

       In some cases, however, it makes sense to truncate.

       Functions that truncate:

       •  <b>stpecpy</b>()

       •  <b>strtcpy</b>()

       •  <b>strlcpy</b>(3bsd) and <b>strlcat</b>(3bsd) are similar, but have
          important performance problems; see BUGS.

       •  <a href="../man3/stpncpy.3.html">stpncpy(3)</a> and <a href="../man3/strncpy.3.html">strncpy(3)</a> also truncate, but they don't write
          strings, but rather null-padded character sequences.

   <b>Null-padded character sequences</b>
       For historic reasons, some standard APIs and file formats, such
       as <a href="../man5/utmpx.5.html">utmpx(5)</a> and <a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar(1)</a>, use null-padded character sequences in
       fixed-size buffers.  To interface with them, specialized
       functions need to be used.

       To copy bytes from strings into these buffers, use <a href="../man3/strncpy.3.html">strncpy(3)</a> or
       <a href="../man3/stpncpy.3.html">stpncpy(3)</a>.

       To read a null-padded character sequence, use
       <i>strnlen(src, NITEMS(src))</i>, and then you can treat it as a known-
       length character sequence; or use <a href="../man3/strncat.3.html">strncat(3)</a> or <a href="../man3/strndup.3.html">strndup(3)</a>
       directly.

   <b>Known-length character sequences</b>
       The simplest character sequence copying function is <a href="../man3/mempcpy.3.html">mempcpy(3)</a>.
       It requires always knowing the length of your character
       sequences, for which structures can be used.  It makes the code
       much faster, since you always know the length of your character
       sequences, and can do the minimal copies and length measurements.
       <a href="../man3/mempcpy.3.html">mempcpy(3)</a> copies character sequences, so you need to explicitly
       set the terminating null character if you need a string.

       In programs that make considerable use of strings or character
       sequences, and need the best performance, using overlapping
       character sequences can make a big difference.  It allows holding
       subsequences of a larger character sequence, while not
       duplicating memory nor using time to do a copy.

       However, this is delicate, since it requires using character
       sequences.  C library APIs use strings, so programs that use
       character sequences will have to take care of differentiating
       strings from character sequences.

       To copy a known-length character sequence, use <a href="../man3/mempcpy.3.html">mempcpy(3)</a>.

       To copy a known-length character sequence into a string, use
       <i>stpcpy(mempcpy(dst, src, len), "")</i>.

       A string is also accepted as input, because <a href="../man3/mempcpy.3.html">mempcpy(3)</a> asks for
       the length, and a string is composed of a character sequence of
       the same length plus a terminating null character.

   <b>String vs character sequence</b>
       Some functions only operate on strings.  Those require that the
       input <i>src</i> is a string, and guarantee an output string (even when
       truncation occurs).  Functions that catenate also require that
       <i>dst</i> holds a string before the call.  List of functions:

       •  <a href="../man3/stpcpy.3.html">stpcpy(3)</a>
       •  <a href="../man3/strcpy.3.html">strcpy(3)</a>, <a href="../man3/strcat.3.html">strcat(3)</a>
       •  <b>stpecpy</b>()
       •  <b>strtcpy</b>()
       •  <b>strlcpy</b>(3bsd), <b>strlcat</b>(3bsd)

       Other functions require an input string, but create a character
       sequence as output.  These functions have confusing names, and
       have a long history of misuse.  List of functions:

       •  <a href="../man3/stpncpy.3.html">stpncpy(3)</a>
       •  <a href="../man3/strncpy.3.html">strncpy(3)</a>

       Other functions operate on an input character sequence, and
       create an output string.  Functions that catenate also require
       that <i>dst</i> holds a string before the call.  <a href="../man3/strncat.3.html">strncat(3)</a> has an even
       more misleading name than the functions above.  List of
       functions:

       •  <a href="../man3/strncat.3.html">strncat(3)</a>
       •  <a href="../man3/strndup.3.html">strndup(3)</a>

       Other functions operate on an input character sequence to create
       an output character sequence.  List of functions:

   <b>Functions</b>
       <a href="../man3/stpcpy.3.html">stpcpy(3)</a>
              Copy the input string into a destination string.  The
              programmer is responsible for allocating a buffer large
              enough.  It returns a pointer suitable for chaining.

       <a href="../man3/strcpy.3.html">strcpy(3)</a>
       <a href="../man3/strcat.3.html">strcat(3)</a>
              Copy and catenate the input string into a destination
              string.  The programmer is responsible for allocating a
              buffer large enough.  The return value is useless.

              <a href="../man3/stpcpy.3.html">stpcpy(3)</a> is a faster alternative to these functions.

       <b>stpecpy</b>()
              Chain-copy the input string into a destination string.  If
              the destination buffer, limited by a pointer to its end,
              isn't large enough to hold the copy, the resulting string
              is truncated (but it is guaranteed to be null-terminated).
              It returns a pointer suitable for chaining.  Truncation
              needs to be detected only once after the last chained
              call.

              This function is not provided by any library; see EXAMPLES
              for a reference implementation.

       <b>strtcpy</b>()
              Copy the input string into a destination string.  If the
              destination buffer isn't large enough to hold the copy,
              the resulting string is truncated (but it is guaranteed to
              be null-terminated).  It returns the length of the string,
              or -1 if it truncated.

              This function is not provided by any library; see EXAMPLES
              for a reference implementation.

       <b>strlcpy</b>(3bsd)
       <b>strlcat</b>(3bsd)
              Copy and catenate the input string into a destination
              string.  If the destination buffer, limited by its size,
              isn't large enough to hold the copy, the resulting string
              is truncated (but it is guaranteed to be null-terminated).
              They return the length of the total string they tried to
              create.

              Check BUGS before using these functions.

              <b>strtcpy</b>() and <b>stpecpy</b>() are better alternatives to these
              functions.

       <a href="../man3/stpncpy.3.html">stpncpy(3)</a>
              Copy the input string into a destination null-padded
              character sequence in a fixed-size buffer.  If the
              destination buffer, limited by its size, isn't large
              enough to hold the copy, the resulting character sequence
              is truncated.  Since it creates a character sequence, it
              doesn't need to write a terminating null character.  It's
              impossible to distinguish truncation by the result of the
              call, from a character sequence that just fits the
              destination buffer; truncation should be detected by
              comparing the length of the input string with the size of
              the destination buffer.

       <a href="../man3/strncpy.3.html">strncpy(3)</a>
              This function is identical to <a href="../man3/stpncpy.3.html">stpncpy(3)</a> except for the
              useless return value.

              <a href="../man3/stpncpy.3.html">stpncpy(3)</a> is a more useful alternative to this function.

       <a href="../man3/strncat.3.html">strncat(3)</a>
              Catenate the input character sequence, contained in a
              null-padded fixed-size buffer, into a destination string.
              The programmer is responsible for allocating a buffer
              large enough.  The return value is useless.

              Do not confuse this function with <a href="../man3/strncpy.3.html">strncpy(3)</a>; they are not
              related at all.

              <i>stpcpy(mempcpy(dst, src, strnlen(src, NITEMS(src))), "")</i>
              is a faster alternative to this function.

       <a href="../man3/strndup.3.html">strndup(3)</a>
              Duplicate the input character sequence, contained in a
              null-padded fixed-size buffer, into a newly allocated
              destination string.

              The string must be freed with <a href="../man3/free.3.html">free(3)</a>.

       <a href="../man3/mempcpy.3.html">mempcpy(3)</a>
              Copy the input character sequence, limited by its length,
              into a destination character sequence.  The programmer is
              responsible for allocating a buffer large enough.  It
              returns a pointer suitable for chaining.

CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       Don't mix chain calls to truncating and non-truncating functions.
       It is conceptually wrong unless you know that the first part of a
       copy will always fit.  Anyway, the performance difference will
       probably be negligible, so it will probably be more clear if you
       use consistent semantics: either truncating or non-truncating.
       Calling a non-truncating function after a truncating one is
       necessarily wrong.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       All catenation functions share the same performance problem:

       mitigation, compilers are able to transform some calls to
       catenation functions into normal copy functions, since
       <i>strlen(dst)</i> is usually a byproduct of the previous copy.

       <b>strlcpy</b>(3) and <b>strlcat</b>(3) need to read the entire <i>src</i> string,
       even if the destination buffer is small.  This makes them
       vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if an attacker can
       control the length of the <i>src</i> string.  And if not, they're still
       unnecessarily slow.
