NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rxe - Software RDMA over Ethernet
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>modprobe rdma_rxe</b>
       This is usually performed by a configuration utility (see <b>rdma</b>
       <b>link</b>(8).)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The rdma_rxe kernel module provides a software implementation of
       the RoCEv2 protocol. The RoCEv2 protocol is an RDMA transport
       protocol that exists on top of UDP/IPv4 or UDP/IPv6. The
       InfiniBand (IB) Base Transport Header (BTH) is encapsulated in
       the UDP packet.

       Once a RXE instance has been created, communicating via RXE is
       the same as communicating via any OFED compatible Infiniband HCA,
       albeit in some cases with addressing implications.

       In particular, while the use of a GRH header is optional within
       IB subnets, it is mandatory with RoCE.  Verbs applications
       written over IB verbs should work seamlessly, but they require
       provisioning of GRH information when creating address vectors.
       The library and driver are modified to provide for mapping from
       GID to MAC addresses required by the hardware.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/sys/class/infiniband/rxe[0,1,...]</b>
              Directory that holds RDMA device information. The format
              is the same as other RDMA devices.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe_net/parameters/mtu</b>
              Write only file used to configure RoCE and Ethernet MTU
              values.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_ucontext</b>
              Read/Write file that sets a limit on the number of UCs
              allowed per RXE device.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_qp</b>
              Read/Write file that sets a limit on the number of QPs
              allowed per RXE device.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_qp_wr</b>
              Read/Write file that sets a limit on the number of WRs per
              QP allowed per RXE device.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_mr</b>
              Read/Write file that sets a limit on the number of MRs
              allowed per RXE device.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_fmr</b>
              Read/Write file that sets a limit on the number of FMRs
              allowed per RXE device.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_cq</b>
              Read/Write file that sets a limit on the number of CQs
              allowed per RXE device.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_log_cqe</b>
              Read/Write file that sets a limit on the log base 2 of the
              number of CQEs per CQ allowed per RXE device.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_inline_data</b>
              Read/Write file that sets a limit on the maximum amount of
              inline data per WR allowed per RXE device.

              The above configuration parameters only affect a new RXE
              instance when it is created not afterwards.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/crc_disable</b>
              Read/Write file that controls the disabling of ICRC
              computation. Set to a nonzero value for TRUE. Zero for
              FALSE.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/fast_comp|req|resp|arb</b>
              Read/Write file that enables calling kernel tasklets as
              subroutines to reduce latency.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/nsec_per_packet|kbyte</b>
              Read/Write file that controls static rate pacing for
              output packets. If set to nonzero values the minimum delay
              to the next packet is set to nsec_per_kbyte *
              sizeof(current packet in KBytes) or nsec_per_packet which
              ever is less.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_packet_per_ack</b>
              Read/Write file that controls the issuing of acks by the
              responder during a long message. If set additional acks
              will be generated every max_pkt_per_ack packets.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_skb_per_qp</b>
              Read/Write file that controls the number of skbs (packets)
              that a requester can queue for sending internally.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/max_req_comp_gap</b>
              Read/Write file that controls the maximum gap between the
              PSN of request packets send and ack packets received.

       <b>/sys/module/rdma_rxe/parameters/default_mtu</b>
              Read/Write file that controls the default mtu used for UD
              packets.
