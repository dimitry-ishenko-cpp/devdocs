       ddp - Linux AppleTalk protocol implementation
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include &lt;netatalk/at.h&gt;</b>

       <i>ddp_socket</i> <b>= socket(AF_APPLETALK, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);</b>
       <i>raw_socket</i> <b>= socket(AF_APPLETALK, SOCK_RAW, </b><i>protocol</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Linux implements the AppleTalk protocols described in <i>Inside</i>
       <i>AppleTalk</i>.  Only the DDP layer and AARP are present in the
       kernel.  They are designed to be used via the <b>netatalk </b>protocol
       libraries.  This page documents the interface for those who wish
       or need to use the DDP layer directly.

       The communication between AppleTalk and the user program works
       using a BSD-compatible socket interface.  For more information on
       sockets, see <a href="socket.7.html">socket(7)</a>.

       An AppleTalk socket is created by calling the <a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket(2)</a> function
       with a <b>AF_APPLETALK </b>socket family argument.  Valid socket types
       are <b>SOCK_DGRAM </b>to open a <b>ddp </b>socket or <b>SOCK_RAW </b>to open a <b>raw</b>
       socket.  <i>protocol</i> is the AppleTalk protocol to be received or
       sent.  For <b>SOCK_RAW </b>you must specify <b>ATPROTO_DDP</b>.

       Raw sockets may be opened only by a process with effective user
       ID 0 or when the process has the <b>CAP_NET_RAW </b>capability.

   <b>Address format</b>
       An AppleTalk socket address is defined as a combination of a
       network number, a node number, and a port number.

           struct at_addr {
               unsigned short s_net;
               unsigned char  s_node;
           };

           struct sockaddr_atalk {
               sa_family_t    sat_family;    /* address family */
               unsigned char  sat_port;      /* port */
               struct at_addr sat_addr;      /* net/node */
           };

       <i>sat_family</i> is always set to <b>AF_APPLETALK</b>.  <i>sat_port</i> contains the
       port.  The port numbers below 129 are known as <i>reserved ports</i>.
       Only processes with the effective user ID 0 or the
       <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE </b>capability may <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> to these sockets.
       <i>sat_addr</i> is the host address.  The <i>net</i> member of <i>struct at_addr</i>
       contains the host network in network byte order.  The value of
       <b>AT_ANYNET </b>is a wildcard and also implies “this network.”  The
       <i>node</i> member of <i>struct at_addr</i> contains the host node number.  The
       value of <b>AT_ANYNODE </b>is a wildcard and also implies “this node.”
       The value of <b>ATADDR_BCAST </b>is a link local broadcast address.

   <b>Socket options</b>
       No protocol-specific socket options are supported.

   <b>/proc interfaces</b>
       IP supports a set of <i>/proc</i> interfaces to configure some global
       AppleTalk parameters.  The parameters can be accessed by reading
       or writing files in the directory <i>/proc/sys/net/atalk/</i>.

       <i>aarp-expiry-time</i>
              The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry
              expires.

       <i>aarp-resolve-time</i>
              The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry
              is resolved.

       <i>aarp-retransmit-limit</i>
              The number of retransmissions of an AARP query before the
              node is declared dead.

       <i>aarp-tick-time</i>
              The timer rate (in seconds) for the timer driving AARP.

       The default values match the specification and should never need
       to be changed.

   <b>Ioctls</b>
       All ioctls described in <a href="socket.7.html">socket(7)</a> apply to DDP.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EACCES </b>The user tried to execute an operation without the
              necessary permissions.  These include sending to a
              broadcast address without having the broadcast flag set,
              and trying to bind to a reserved port without effective
              user ID 0 or <b>CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</b>.

       <b>EADDRINUSE</b>
              Tried to bind to an address already in use.

       <b>EADDRNOTAVAIL</b>
              A nonexistent interface was requested or the requested
              source address was not local.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>Operation on a nonblocking socket would block.

       <b>EALREADY</b>
              A connection operation on a nonblocking socket is already
              in progress.

       <b>ECONNABORTED</b>
              A connection was closed during an <a href="../man2/accept.2.html">accept(2)</a>.

       <b>EHOSTUNREACH</b>
              No routing table entry matches the destination address.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Invalid argument passed.

       <b>EISCONN</b>
              <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> was called on an already connected socket.

       <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              Datagram is bigger than the DDP MTU.

       <b>ENODEV </b>Network device not available or not capable of sending IP.

       <b>ENOENT SIOCGSTAMP </b>was called on a socket where no packet arrived.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>and <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Not enough memory available.

       <b>ENOPKG </b>A kernel subsystem was not configured.

       <b>ENOPROTOOPT </b>and <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              Invalid socket option passed.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              The operation is defined only on a connected socket, but
              the socket wasn't connected.

       <b>EPERM  </b>User doesn't have permission to set high priority, make a
              configuration change, or send signals to the requested
              process or group.

       <b>EPIPE  </b>The connection was unexpectedly closed or shut down by the
              other end.

       <b>ESOCKTNOSUPPORT</b>
              The socket was unconfigured, or an unknown socket type was
              requested.
</pre> <h2>
VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       AppleTalk is supported by Linux 2.0 or higher.  The <i>/proc</i>
       interfaces exist since Linux 2.2.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Be very careful with the <b>SO_BROADCAST </b>option; it is not
       privileged in Linux.  It is easy to overload the network with
       careless sending to broadcast addresses.

   <b>Compatibility</b>
       The basic AppleTalk socket interface is compatible with <b>netatalk</b>
       on BSD-derived systems.  Many BSD systems fail to check
       <b>SO_BROADCAST </b>when sending broadcast frames; this can lead to
       compatibility problems.

       The raw socket mode is unique to Linux and exists to support the
       alternative CAP package and AppleTalk monitoring tools more
       easily.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       There are too many inconsistent error values.

       The ioctls used to configure routing tables, devices, AARP
       tables, and other devices are not yet described.
