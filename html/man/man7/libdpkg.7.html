NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libdpkg - Debian package manager C library
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>libdpkg </b>C library provides functions and infrastructure for
       the dpkg tool set, and external projects that need to integrate
       tightly with it.

       The library provides a <b>pkgconf</b>(1) entry named <i>libdpkg</i>.

       <b>Warning</b>: The API provided by this library is highly volatile,
       still in the process of being cleaned up. It is only supposed to
       be used internally by dpkg for now. Header files, functions,
       variables and types might get renamed, removed or change
       semantics. If you still have a need to use it, which you would be
       doing anyway, say by locally building dpkg to get the library,
       then define the C preprocessor macro LIBDPKG_VOLATILE_API in your
       build to acknowledge that fact.

       Due to the currently API volatility, only a static library is
       provided.
