NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcilib - a library for accessing PCI devices
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The PCI library (also known as <i>pcilib</i> and <i>libpci</i>) is a portable
       library for accessing PCI devices and their configuration space.
</pre> <h2>
ACCESS METHODS </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports a variety of methods to access the
       configuration space on different operating systems. By default,
       the first matching method in this list is used, but you can
       specify override the decision (see the <b>-A </b>switch of <i>lspci</i>).

       <b>linux-sysfs</b>
              The <b>/sys </b>filesystem on Linux 2.6 and newer. The standard
              header of the config space is available to all users, the
              rest only to root. Supports extended configuration space,
              PCI domains, VPD (from Linux 2.6.26), physical slots (also
              since Linux 2.6.26) and information on attached kernel
              drivers.

       <b>linux-proc</b>
              The <b>/proc/bus/pci </b>interface supported by Linux 2.1 and
              newer. The standard header of the config space is
              available to all users, the rest only to root.

       <b>intel-conf1</b>
              Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism
              1. Available on i386 and compatibles on Linux,
              Solaris/x86, GNU Hurd, Windows, BeOS and Haiku. Requires
              root privileges.

       <b>intel-conf2</b>
              Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism
              2. Available on i386 and compatibles on Linux,
              Solaris/x86, GNU Hurd, Windows, BeOS and Haiku. Requires
              root privileges. Warning: This method is able to address
              only the first 16 devices on any bus and it seems to be
              very unreliable in many cases.

       <b>mmio-conf1</b>
              Direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1
              via memory-mapped I/O.  Mostly used on non-i386 platforms.
              Requires root privileges. Warning: This method needs to be
              properly configured via the <b>mmio-conf1.addrs </b>parameter.

       <b>mmio-conf1-ext</b>
              Direct hardware access via Extended PCIe Intel
              configuration mechanism 1 via memory-mapped I/O.  Mostly
              used on non-i386 platforms. Requires root privileges.
              Warning: This method needs to be properly configured via
              the <b>mmio-conf1-ext.addrs </b>parameter.

       <b>ecam   </b>Direct hardware access via PCIe ECAM (Enhanced
              Configuration Access Mechanism).  Available on all PCIe-
              compliant hardware. Requires root privileges and access to
              physical memory (on Linux systems disabled
              CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM option). On ACPI compatible systems
              is ECAM mapping read from the MCFG table specified by the
              <b>ecam.acpimcfg </b>parameter. On EFI compatible systems, ACPI
              MCFG table can be located in physical memory via EFI
              system table specified by the <b>ecam.efisystab </b>parameter. On
              FreeBSD/NetBSD systems, physical address of ACPI MCFG
              table can be located by kenv or sysctl interface when the
              <b>ecam.bsd </b>parameter is not disabled. On x86 BIOS compatible
              systems, ACPI MCFG table can be located in physical memory
              by scanning x86 BIOS memory when the <b>ecam.x86bios</b>
              parameter is not disabled. Alternatively ECAM mappings can
              be specified by the <b>ecam.addrs </b>parameter which takes
              precedence over ACPI MCFG table. This option is required
              on systems without ACPI and also on systems without EFI or
              x86 BIOS.

       <b>fbsd-device</b>
              The <b>/dev/pci </b>device on FreeBSD. Requires root privileges.

       <b>aix-device</b>
              Access method used on AIX. Requires root privileges.

       <b>nbsd-libpci</b>
              The <b>/dev/pci0 </b>device on NetBSD accessed using the local
              libpci library.

       <b>obsd-device</b>
              The <b>/dev/pci </b>device on OpenBSD. Requires root privileges.

       <b>dump   </b>Read the contents of configuration registers from a file
              specified in the <b>dump.name </b>parameter. The format
              corresponds to the output of <i>lspci</i> <b>-x</b>.

       <b>darwin </b>Access method used on Mac OS X / Darwin. Must be run as
              root and the system must have been booted with
              debug=0x144.

       <b>win32-cfgmgr32</b>
              Device listing on Windows systems using the Windows
              Configuration Manager via cfgmgr32.dll system library.
              This method does not require any special Administrator
              rights or privileges. Configuration Manager provides only
              basic information about devices, assigned resources and
              device tree structure. There is no access to the PCI
              configuration space but libpci either tries to use other
              access method to access configuration space or it provides
              read-only virtual emulation based on information from
              Configuration Manager. Other access method can be chosen
              by the <b>win32.cfgmethod </b>parameter. By default the first
              working one is selected (if any). Starting with Windows 8
              (NT 6.2) it is not possible to retrieve resources from
              32-bit application or library on 64-bit system.

       <b>win32-sysdbg</b>
              Access to the PCI configuration space via NT SysDbg
              interface on Windows systems. Process needs to have Debug
              privilege, which local Administrators have by default. Not
              available on 64-bit systems and neither on recent 32-bit
              systems. Only devices from the first domain are accessible
              and only first 256 bytes of the PCI configuration space is
              accessible via this method.

       <b>win32-kldbg</b>
              Access to the PCI configuration space via Kernel Local
              Debugging Driver kldbgdrv.sys. This driver is not part of
              the Windows system but is part of the Microsoft WinDbg
              tool. It is required to have kldbgdrv.sys driver installed
              in the system32 directory or to have windbg.exe or kd.exe
              binary in PATH.  kldbgdrv.sys driver has some
              restrictions. Process needs to have Debug privilege and
              Windows system has to be booted with Debugging option.
              Debugging option can be enabled by calling (takes effect
              after next boot): <b>bcdedit /debug on</b>

       <b>aos-expansion</b>
              Access method used on PowerPC Amiga running OS4+. Access
              is made through Expansion.library. It offers read and
              write access to configuration space.
</pre> <h2>
PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
       The library is controlled by several parameters. They should have
       sensible default values, but in case you want to do something
       unusual (or even something weird), you can override them (see the
       <b>-O </b>switch of <i>lspci</i>).

   <b>Parameters of specific access methods</b>
       <b>dump.name</b>
              Name of the bus dump file to read from.

       <b>fbsd.path</b>
              Path to the FreeBSD PCI device.

       <b>nbsd.path</b>
              Path to the NetBSD PCI device.

       <b>obsd.path</b>
              Path to the OpenBSD PCI device.

       <b>proc.path</b>
              Path to the procfs bus tree.

       <b>sysfs.path</b>
              Path to the sysfs device tree.

       <b>devmem.path</b>
              Path to the /dev/mem device or path to the
              \Device\PhysicalMemory NT section or name of the platform
              specific physical address access method. Generally on
              POSIX systems it is path to memory device and on Windows
              systems it is path to memory NT section. Additionally on
              32-bit Windows systems are recognized also platform
              methods: <i>vxdcall</i>, <i>w32skrnl</i>. On DOS/DJGPP systems are
              recognized only platform methods: <i>auto</i>, <i>devmap</i>, <i>physmap</i>.
              DJGPP's <i>devmap</i> method uses DPMI 1.0 functions 0508H (Map
              Device in Memory Block) and 0509H (Map Conventional Memory
              in Memory Block). DJGPP's <i>physmap</i> method uses DPMI 0.9
              function 0800H (Physical Address Mapping). DJGPP's <i>auto</i>
              parameter automatically chooses one of the mentioned
              method supported by the system.

       <b>mmio-conf1.addrs</b>
              Physical addresses of memory-mapped I/O ports for Intel
              configuration mechanism 1.  CF8 (address) and CFC (data)
              I/O port addresses are separated by slash and multiple
              addresses for different PCI domains are separated by
              commas.  Format: 0xaddr1/0xdata1,0xaddr2/0xdata2,...

       <b>mmio-conf1-ext.addrs</b>
              Physical addresses of memory-mapped I/O ports for Extended
              PCIe Intel configuration mechanism 1.  It has same format
              as <b>mmio-conf1.addrs </b>parameter.

       <b>ecam.addrs</b>
              Physical addresses of PCIe ECAM mappings. Each mapping
              must contains first PCI bus number and physical address
              where mapping starts. And then it may contain the length
              of the mapping, the last PCI bus number and PCI domain
              number. When the last PCI bus number is not provided then
              it is calculated from the length of the mapping or it is
              assumed 0xff. When length of the mapping is provided then
              it is calculated from the last PCI bus number. And when
              PCI domain is not provided then 0x0 is assumed. All
              numbers must be supplied in hexadecimal form (leading
              prefix 0x is not required). Multiple mappings are
              separated by commas.  Format:
              [domain:]start_bus[-end_bus]:start_addr[+length],...

       <b>ecam.acpimcfg</b>
              Path to the ACPI MCFG table. Processed by the <a href="../man3/glob.3.html">glob(3)</a>
              function, so it may contain wildcards (*).

       <b>ecam.efisystab</b>
              Path to the EFI system table.

       <b>ecam.bsd</b>
              When not set to 0 then use BSD kenv or sysctl to find ACPI
              MCFG table. Default value is 1 on BSD systems.

       <b>ecam.x86bios</b>
              When not set to 0 then scan x86 BIOS memory for ACPI MCFG
              table. Default value is 1 on x86 systems.

       <b>win32.cfgmethod</b>
              Config space access method to use with win32-cfgmgr32 on
              Windows systems. Value <i>auto</i> or an empty string selects the
              first access method which supports access to the config
              space on Windows. Value <i>win32-cfgmgr32</i> or <i>none</i> only builds
              a read-only virtual emulated config space with information
              from the Configuration Manager.

   <b>Parameters for resolving of ID's via DNS</b>
       <b>net.domain</b>
              DNS domain containing the ID database.

       <b>net.cache_name</b>
              Name of the file used for caching of resolved ID's. An
              initial <b>~/ </b>is expanded to the user's home directory.

   <b>Parameters for resolving of ID's via UDEV's HWDB</b>
       <b>hwdb.disable</b>
              Disable use of HWDB if set to a non-zero value.
