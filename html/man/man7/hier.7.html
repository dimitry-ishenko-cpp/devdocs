DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A typical Linux system has, among others, the following
       directories:

       <i>/</i>      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree
              starts.

       <i>/bin</i>   This directory contains executable programs which are
              needed in single user mode and to bring the system up or
              repair it.

       <i>/boot</i>  Contains static files for the boot loader.  This directory
              holds only the files which are needed during the boot
              process.  The map installer and configuration files should
              go to <i>/sbin</i> and <i>/etc</i>.  The operating system kernel (initrd
              for example) must be located in either <i>/</i> or <i>/boot</i>.

       <i>/dev</i>   Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.
              See <a href="../man1/mknod.1.html">mknod(1)</a>.

       <i>/etc</i>   Contains configuration files which are local to the
              machine.  Some larger software packages, like X11, can
              have their own subdirectories below <i>/etc</i>.  Site-wide
              configuration files may be placed here or in <i>/usr/etc</i>.
              Nevertheless, programs should always look for these files
              in <i>/etc</i> and you may have links for these files to
              <i>/usr/etc</i>.

       <i>/etc/opt</i>
              Host-specific configuration files for add-on applications
              installed in <i>/opt</i>.

       <i>/etc/sgml</i>
              This directory contains the configuration files for SGML
              (optional).

       <i>/etc/skel</i>
              When a new user account is created, files from this
              directory are usually copied into the user's home
              directory.

       <i>/etc/X11</i>
              Configuration files for the X11 window system (optional).

       <i>/etc/xml</i>
              This directory contains the configuration files for XML
              (optional).

       <i>/home</i>  On machines with home directories for users, these are
              usually beneath this directory, directly or not.  The
              structure of this directory depends on local
              administration decisions (optional).

       <i>/lib</i>   This directory should hold those shared libraries that are
              necessary to boot the system and to run the commands in
              the root filesystem.

       <i>/lib&lt;qual&gt;</i>
              These directories are variants of <i>/lib</i> on system which
              support more than one binary format requiring separate
              libraries (optional).

       <i>/lib/modules</i>
              Loadable kernel modules (optional).

       <i>/lost+found</i>
              This directory contains items lost in the filesystem.
              These items are usually chunks of files mangled as a
              consequence of a faulty disk or a system crash.

       <i>/media</i> This directory contains mount points for removable media
              such as CD and DVD disks or USB sticks.  On systems where
              more than one device exists for mounting a certain type of
              media, mount directories can be created by appending a
              digit to the name of those available above starting with
              '0', but the unqualified name must also exist.

       <i>/media/floppy[1-9]</i>
              Floppy drive (optional).

       <i>/media/cdrom[1-9]</i>
              CD-ROM drive (optional).

       <i>/media/cdrecorder[1-9]</i>
              CD writer (optional).

       <i>/media/zip[1-9]</i>
              Zip drive (optional).

       <i>/media/usb[1-9]</i>
              USB drive (optional).

       <i>/mnt</i>   This directory is a mount point for a temporarily mounted
              filesystem.  In some distributions, <i>/mnt</i> contains
              subdirectories intended to be used as mount points for
              several temporary filesystems.

       <i>/opt</i>   This directory should contain add-on packages that contain
              static files.

       <i>/proc</i>  This is a mount point for the <i>proc</i> filesystem, which
              provides information about running processes and the
              kernel.  This pseudo-filesystem is described in more
              detail in <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a>.

       <i>/root</i>  This directory is usually the home directory for the root
              user (optional).

       <i>/run</i>   This directory contains information which describes the
              system since it was booted.  Once this purpose was served
              by <i>/var/run</i> and programs may continue to use it.

       <i>/sbin</i>  Like <i>/bin</i>, this directory holds commands needed to boot
              the system, but which are usually not executed by normal
              users.

       <i>/srv</i>   This directory contains site-specific data that is served
              by this system.

       <i>/sys</i>   This is a mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which
              provides information about the kernel like <i>/proc</i>, but
              better structured, following the formalism of kobject
              infrastructure.

       <i>/tmp</i>   This directory contains temporary files which may be
              deleted with no notice, such as by a regular job or at
              system boot up.

       <i>/usr</i>   This directory is usually mounted from a separate
              partition.  It should hold only shareable, read-only data,
              so that it can be mounted by various machines running
              Linux.

       <i>/usr/X11R6</i>
              The X-Window system, version 11 release 6 (present in FHS
              2.3, removed in FHS 3.0).

       <i>/usr/X11R6/bin</i>
              Binaries which belong to the X-Window system; often, there
              is a symbolic link from the more traditional <i>/usr/bin/X11</i>
              to here.

       <i>/usr/X11R6/lib</i>
              Data files associated with the X-Window system.

       <i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</i>
              These contain miscellaneous files needed to run X;  Often,
              there is a symbolic link from <i>/usr/lib/X11</i> to this
              directory.

       <i>/usr/X11R6/include/X11</i>
              Contains include files needed for compiling programs using
              the X11 window system.  Often, there is a symbolic link
              from <i>/usr/include/X11</i> to this directory.

       <i>/usr/bin</i>
              This is the primary directory for executable programs.
              Most programs executed by normal users which are not
              needed for booting or for repairing the system and which
              are not installed locally should be placed in this
              directory.

       <i>/usr/bin/mh</i>
              Commands for the MH mail handling system (optional).

       <i>/usr/bin/X11</i>
              This is the traditional place to look for X11 executables;
              on Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to <i>/usr/X11R6/bin</i>.

       <i>/usr/dict</i>
              Replaced by <i>/usr/share/dict</i>.

       <i>/usr/doc</i>
              Replaced by <i>/usr/share/doc</i>.

       <i>/usr/etc</i>
              Site-wide configuration files to be shared between several
              machines may be stored in this directory.  However,
              commands should always reference those files using the
              <i>/etc</i> directory.  Links from files in <i>/etc</i> should point to
              the appropriate files in <i>/usr/etc</i>.

       <i>/usr/games</i>
              Binaries for games and educational programs (optional).

       <i>/usr/include</i>
              Include files for the C compiler.

       <i>/usr/include/bsd</i>
              BSD compatibility include files (optional).

       <i>/usr/include/X11</i>
              Include files for the C compiler and the X-Window system.
              This is usually a symbolic link to <i>/usr/X11R6/include/X11</i>.

       <i>/usr/include/asm</i>
              Include files which declare some assembler functions.
              This used to be a symbolic link to
              <i>/usr/src/linux/include/asm</i>.

       <i>/usr/include/linux</i>
              This contains information which may change from system
              release to system release and used to be a symbolic link
              to <i>/usr/src/linux/include/linux</i> to get at operating-
              system-specific information.

              (Note that one should have include files there that work
              correctly with the current libc and in user space.
              However, Linux kernel source is not designed to be used
              with user programs and does not know anything about the
              libc you are using.  It is very likely that things will
              break if you let <i>/usr/include/asm</i> and <i>/usr/include/linux</i>
              point at a random kernel tree.  Debian systems don't do
              this and use headers from a known good kernel version,
              provided in the libc*-dev package.)

       <i>/usr/include/g++</i>
              Include files to use with the GNU C++ compiler.

       <i>/usr/lib</i>
              Object libraries, including dynamic libraries, plus some
              executables which usually are not invoked directly.  More
              complicated programs may have whole subdirectories there.

       <i>/usr/libexec</i>
              Directory contains binaries for internal use only and they
              are not meant to be executed directly by users shell or
              scripts.

       <i>/usr/lib&lt;qual&gt;</i>
              These directories are variants of <i>/usr/lib</i> on system which
              support more than one binary format requiring separate
              libraries, except that the symbolic link <i>/usr/lib</i>qual<i>/X11</i>
              is not required (optional).

       <i>/usr/lib/X11</i>
              The usual place for data files associated with X programs,
              and configuration files for the X system itself.  On
              Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to
              <i>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11</i>.

       <i>/usr/lib/gcc-lib</i>
              contains executables and include files for the GNU C
              compiler, <a href="../man1/gcc.1.html">gcc(1)</a>.

       <i>/usr/sbin</i>
              This directory contains program binaries for system
              administration which are not essential for the boot
              process, for mounting <i>/usr</i>, or for system repair.

       <i>/usr/share</i>
              This directory contains subdirectories with specific
              application data, that can be shared among different

              man page sections.

       <i>/usr/share/man/</i>locale<i>/man[1-9]</i>
              These directories contain manual pages for the specific
              locale in source code form.  Systems which use a unique
              language and code set for all manual pages may omit the
              &lt;locale&gt; substring.

       <i>/usr/src/linux</i>
              This was the traditional place for the kernel source.
              Some distributions put here the source for the default

              <i>&lt;device&gt;</i> is the device's name in the filesystem.  The
              format used is that of HDU UUCP lock files, that is, lock
              files contain a PID as a 10-byte ASCII decimal number,
              followed by a newline character.
