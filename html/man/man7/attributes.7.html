DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Note</i>: the text of this man page is based on the material taken
       from the "POSIX Safety Concepts" section of the GNU C Library
       manual.  Further details on the topics described here can be
       found in that manual.

       Various function manual pages include a section ATTRIBUTES that
       describes the safety of calling the function in various contexts.
       This section annotates functions with the following safety
       markings:

       <i>MT-Safe</i>
              <i>MT-Safe</i> or Thread-Safe functions are safe to call in the
              presence of other threads.  MT, in MT-Safe, stands for
              Multi Thread.

              Being MT-Safe does not imply a function is atomic, nor
              that it uses any of the memory synchronization mechanisms
              POSIX exposes to users.  It is even possible that calling
              MT-Safe functions in sequence does not yield an MT-Safe
              combination.  For example, having a thread call two MT-
              Safe functions one right after the other does not
              guarantee behavior equivalent to atomic execution of a
              combination of both functions, since concurrent calls in
              other threads may interfere in a destructive way.

              Whole-program optimizations that could inline functions
              across library interfaces may expose unsafe reordering,
              and so performing inlining across the GNU C Library
              interface is not recommended.  The documented MT-Safety
              status is not guaranteed under whole-program optimization.
              However, functions defined in user-visible headers are
              designed to be safe for inlining.

       <i>MT-Unsafe</i>
              <i>MT-Unsafe</i> functions are not safe to call in a
              multithreaded programs.

       Other keywords that appear in safety notes are defined in
       subsequent sections.

   <b>Conditionally safe features</b>
       For some features that make functions unsafe to call in certain
       contexts, there are known ways to avoid the safety problem other
       than refraining from calling the function altogether.  The
       keywords that follow refer to such features, and each of their
       definitions indicates how the whole program needs to be
       constrained in order to remove the safety problem indicated by
       the keyword.  Only when all the reasons that make a function
       unsafe are observed and addressed, by applying the documented
       constraints, does the function become safe to call in a context.

       <i>init</i>   Functions marked with <i>init</i> as an MT-Unsafe feature perform
              MT-Unsafe initialization when they are first called.

              Calling such a function at least once in single-threaded
              mode removes this specific cause for the function to be
              regarded as MT-Unsafe.  If no other cause for that
              remains, the function can then be safely called after
              other threads are started.

       <i>race</i>   Functions annotated with <i>race</i> as an MT-Safety issue
              operate on objects in ways that may cause data races or
              similar forms of destructive interference out of
              concurrent execution.  In some cases, the objects are
              passed to the functions by users; in others, they are used
              by the functions to return values to users; in others,
              they are not even exposed to users.

       <i>const</i>  Functions marked with <i>const</i> as an MT-Safety issue non-
              atomically modify internal objects that are better
              regarded as constant, because a substantial portion of the
              GNU C Library accesses them without synchronization.
              Unlike <i>race</i>, which causes both readers and writers of
              internal objects to be regarded as MT-Unsafe, this mark is
              applied to writers only.  Writers remain MT-Unsafe to
              call, but the then-mandatory constness of objects they
              modify enables readers to be regarded as MT-Safe (as long
              as no other reasons for them to be unsafe remain), since
              the lack of synchronization is not a problem when the
              objects are effectively constant.

              The identifier that follows the <i>const</i> mark will appear by
              itself as a safety note in readers.  Programs that wish to
              work around this safety issue, so as to call writers, may
              use a non-recursive read-write lock associated with the
              identifier, and guard <i>all</i> calls to functions marked with
              <i>const</i> followed by the identifier with a write lock, and
              <i>all</i> calls to functions marked with the identifier by
              itself with a read lock.

       <i>sig</i>    Functions marked with <i>sig</i> as a MT-Safety issue may
              temporarily install a signal handler for internal
              purposes, which may interfere with other uses of the
              signal, identified after a colon.

              This safety problem can be worked around by ensuring that
              no other uses of the signal will take place for the
              duration of the call.  Holding a non-recursive mutex while
              calling all functions that use the same temporary signal;
              blocking that signal before the call and resetting its
              handler afterwards is recommended.

       <i>term</i>   Functions marked with <i>term</i> as an MT-Safety issue may
              change the terminal settings in the recommended way,
              namely: call <a href="../man3/tcgetattr.3.html">tcgetattr(3)</a>, modify some flags, and then
              call <a href="../man3/tcsetattr.3.html">tcsetattr(3)</a>, this creates a window in which changes
              made by other threads are lost.  Thus, functions marked
              with <i>term</i> are MT-Unsafe.

              It is thus advisable for applications using the terminal
              to avoid concurrent and reentrant interactions with it, by
              not using it in signal handlers or blocking signals that
              might use it, and holding a lock while calling these
              functions and interacting with the terminal.  This lock
              should also be used for mutual exclusion with functions
              marked with <i>race:tcattr(fd)</i>, where <i>fd</i> is a file descriptor
              for the controlling terminal.  The caller may use a single
              mutex for simplicity, or use one mutex per terminal, even
              if referenced by different file descriptors.

   <b>Other safety remarks</b>
       Additional keywords may be attached to functions, indicating
       features that do not make a function unsafe to call, but that may
       need to be taken into account in certain classes of programs:

       <i>locale</i> Functions annotated with <i>locale</i> as an MT-Safety issue read
              from the locale object without any form of
              synchronization.  Functions annotated with <i>locale</i> called
              concurrently with locale changes may behave in ways that
              do not correspond to any of the locales active during
              their execution, but an unpredictable mix thereof.

              We do not mark these functions as MT-Unsafe, however,
              because functions that modify the locale object are marked
              with <i>const:locale</i> and regarded as unsafe.  Being unsafe,
              the latter are not to be called when multiple threads are
              running or asynchronous signals are enabled, and so the
              locale can be considered effectively constant in these
              contexts, which makes the former safe.

       <i>env</i>    Functions marked with <i>env</i> as an MT-Safety issue access the
              environment with <a href="../man3/getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a> or similar, without any guards
              to ensure safety in the presence of concurrent
              modifications.

              We do not mark these functions as MT-Unsafe, however,
              because functions that modify the environment are all
              marked with <i>const:env</i> and regarded as unsafe.  Being
              unsafe, the latter are not to be called when multiple
              threads are running or asynchronous signals are enabled,
              and so the environment can be considered effectively
              constant in these contexts, which makes the former safe.

       <i>hostid</i> The function marked with <i>hostid</i> as an MT-Safety issue
              reads from the system-wide data structures that hold the
              "host ID" of the machine.  These data structures cannot
              generally be modified atomically.  Since it is expected
              that the "host ID" will not normally change, the function
              that reads from it (<a href="../man3/gethostid.3.html">gethostid(3)</a>) is regarded as safe,
              whereas the function that modifies it (<a href="../man3/sethostid.3.html">sethostid(3)</a>) is
              marked with <i>const:hostid</i>, indicating it may require
              special care if it is to be called.  In this specific
              case, the special care amounts to system-wide (not merely
              intra-process) coordination.

       <i>sigintr</i>
              Functions marked with <i>sigintr</i> as an MT-Safety issue access
              the GNU C Library <i>_sigintr</i> internal data structure without
              any guards to ensure safety in the presence of concurrent
              modifications.

              We do not mark these functions as MT-Unsafe, however,
              because functions that modify this data structure are all
              marked with <i>const:sigintr</i> and regarded as unsafe.  Being
              unsafe, the latter are not to be called when multiple
              threads are running or asynchronous signals are enabled,
              and so the data structure can be considered effectively
              constant in these contexts, which makes the former safe.

       <i>cwd</i>    Functions marked with <i>cwd</i> as an MT-Safety issue may
              temporarily change the current working directory during
              their execution, which may cause relative pathnames to be
              resolved in unexpected ways in other threads or within
              asynchronous signal or cancelation handlers.

              This is not enough of a reason to mark so-marked functions
              as MT-Unsafe, but when this behavior is optional (e.g.,
              <a href="../man3/nftw.3.html">nftw(3)</a> with <b>FTW_CHDIR</b>), avoiding the option may be a good
              alternative to using full pathnames or file descriptor-
              relative (e.g., <a href="../man2/openat.2.html">openat(2)</a>) system calls.

       <i>:identifier</i>
              Annotations may sometimes be followed by identifiers,
              intended to group several functions that, for example,
              access the data structures in an unsafe way, as in <i>race</i>
              and <i>const</i>, or to provide more specific information, such
              as naming a signal in a function marked with <i>sig</i>.  It is
              envisioned that it may be applied to <i>lock</i> and <i>corrupt</i> as
              well in the future.

              In most cases, the identifier will name a set of
              functions, but it may name global objects or function
              arguments, or identifiable properties or logical
              components associated with them, with a notation such as,
              for example, <i>:buf(arg)</i> to denote a buffer associated with
              the argument <i>arg</i>, or <i>:tcattr(fd)</i> to denote the terminal
              attributes of a file descriptor <i>fd</i>.

              The most common use for identifiers is to provide logical
              groups of functions and arguments that need to be
              protected by the same synchronization primitive in order
              to ensure safe operation in a given context.

       <i>/condition</i>
              Some safety annotations may be conditional, in that they
              only apply if a boolean expression involving arguments,
              global variables or even the underlying kernel evaluates
              to true.  For example, <i>/!ps</i> and <i>/one_per_line</i> indicate the
              preceding marker only applies when argument <i>ps</i> is NULL, or
              global variable <i>one_per_line</i> is nonzero.

              When all marks that render a function unsafe are adorned
              with such conditions, and none of the named conditions
              hold, then the function can be regarded as safe.
