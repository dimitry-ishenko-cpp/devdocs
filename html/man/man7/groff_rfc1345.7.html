       groff_rfc1345 - special character names from RFC 1345 and Vim
       digraphs
</pre> <h2>
Description </h2>
<pre>
       The file <i>rfc1345.tmac</i> defines special character escape sequences
       for <i>groff</i>(7) based on the glyph mnemonics specified in RFC 1345
       and the digraph table of the text editor Vim.  Each escape
       sequence translates to a Unicode code point, and will render
       correctly if the underlying font is a Unicode font that covers
       the code point.

       For example, “<b>\[Rx]</b>” is the “recipe” or “prescription take”
       symbol, and maps to the code point U+211E.  <i>groff</i> lets you write
       it as “<b>\[u211E]</b>”, but “<b>\[Rx]</b>” is more mnemonic.

       For a list of the glyph names provided, please see the file
       <i>rfc1345.tmac</i>, which contains definitions of the form
              .char \[Rx] \[u211E]    \" PRESCRIPTION TAKE
       where <b>.char</b>'s first argument defines a <i>groff</i> special character
       escape sequence with a mnemonic glyph name, its second argument
       is a special character escape sequence based on the code point,
       and the comment describes the glyph defined.

       The RFC 1345 glyph names cover a wide range of Unicode code
       points, including supplemental Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew,
       Arabic, Hiragana, Katakana, and Bopomofo letters, punctuation,
       math notation, currency symbols, industrial and entertainment
       icons, and box-drawing symbols.

       The Vim digraph table is largely a subset of RFC 1345 (being
       limited to two-character mnemonics), but, as a newer
       implementation, adds several mnemonics not specified in the RFC
       (Latin capital and small letters W and Y with grave accent,
       bullet, horizontal ellipsis, quadruple prime, and two mappings
       each for the Euro and rouble signs).  These have also been added
       to <i>rfc1345.tmac</i>.

       <i>rfc1345.tmac</i> contains about 1,700 glyph names.  It is not an
       error to load <i>rfc1345.tmac</i> if your font does not have all the
       glyphs, as long as it contains the glyphs that you actually use
       in your document.

       The RFC 1345 mnemonics are not identical in every case to the
       mappings for special character glyph names that are built in to
       <i>groff</i>; for example, “<b>\[&lt;&lt;]</b>” means the “much less than” sign
       (U+226A) when <i>rfc1345.tmac</i> is not loaded and this special
       character is not otherwise defined by a document or macro
       package.  <i>rfc1345.tmac</i> redefines “<b>\[&lt;&lt;]</b>” to the “left-pointing
       double angle quotation mark” (U+00AB).  See <i>groff_char</i>(7) for the
       full list of predefined special character escape sequences.

   <b>Usage</b>
       Load the <i>rfc1345.tmac</i> file.  This can be done by either adding
       “<b>.mso rfc1345.tmac</b>” to your document before the first use of any
       of the glyph names the macro file defines, or by using the
       <i>troff</i>(1) option “<b>-m rfc1345</b>” from the shell.

   <b>Bugs</b>
       As the <i>groff</i> Texinfo manual notes, “[o]nly the current font is
       checked for ligatures and kerns; neither special fonts nor
       entities defined with the <b>char </b>request (and its siblings) are
       taken into account.”  Many of the characters defined in
       <i>rfc1345.tmac</i> are accented Latin letters, and will be affected by
       this deficiency, producing subpar typography 
       ⟨<a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?59932">https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?59932</a>⟩.
