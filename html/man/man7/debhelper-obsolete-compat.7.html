       debhelper-obsolete-compat - List of no longer supported compat
       levels
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       This document contains the upgrade guidelines from all compat
       levels which are no longer supported.  Accordingly it is mostly
       for historical purposes and to assist people upgrading from a
       non-supported compat level to a supported level.

       For upgrades from supported compat levels, please see

UPGRADE LIST FOR COMPAT LEVELS </h2>
<pre>
       The following is the list of now obsolete compat levels and their
       changes.

       v7  This is the lowest supported compatibility level.

           Changes from v6 are:

           -       <b>dh_install</b>, will fall back to looking for files in
                   <i>debian/tmp</i> if it doesn't find them in the current
                   directory (or wherever you tell it look using
                   <b>--sourcedir</b>). This allows <b>dh_install </b>to interoperate
                   with <b>dh_auto_install</b>, which installs to <i>debian/tmp</i>,
                   without needing any special parameters.

           -       <b>dh_clean </b>will read <i>debian/clean</i> and delete files
                   listed there.

           -       <b>dh_clean </b>will delete toplevel <i>*-stamp</i> files.

           -       <b>dh_installchangelogs </b>will guess at what file is the
                   upstream changelog if none is specified.

       v6  Changes from v5 are:

           -       Commands that generate maintainer script fragments
                   will order the fragments in reverse order for the
                   <i>prerm</i> and <i>postrm</i> scripts.

           -       <b>dh_installwm </b>will install a slave manpage link for
                   <i>x-window-manager.1.gz</i>, if it sees the man page in
                   <i>usr/share/man/man1</i> in the package build directory.

           -       <b>dh_builddeb </b>did not previously delete everything
                   matching <b>DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE</b>, if it was set to a list
                   of things to exclude, such as <b>CVS:.svn:.git</b>. Now it
                   does.

           -       <b>dh_installman </b>allows overwriting existing man pages
                   in the package build directory. In previous
                   compatibility levels it silently refuses to do this.

           This mode is deprecated.

       v5  Changes from v4 are:

           -       Comments are ignored in debhelper config files.

           -       <b>dh_strip --dbg-package </b>now specifies the name of a
                   package to put debugging symbols in, not the packages
                   to take the symbols from.

           -       <b>dh_installdocs </b>skips installing empty files.

           -       <b>dh_install </b>errors out if wildcards expand to nothing.

       v4  Changes from v3 are:

           -       <b>dh_makeshlibs -V </b>will not include the Debian part of
                   the version number in the generated dependency line
                   in the shlibs file.

           -       You are encouraged to put the new <b>${misc:Depends}</b>
                   into <i>debian/control</i> to supplement the
                   <b>${shlibs:Depends} </b>field.

           -       <b>dh_fixperms </b>will make all files in <i>bin/</i> directories
                   and in <i>etc/init.d</i> executable.

           -       <b>dh_link </b>will correct existing links to conform with
                   policy.

           This mode is deprecated.

       v3  This mode works like v2, with the following additions:

           -       Debhelper config files support globbing via <b>* </b>and <b>?</b>,
                   when appropriate. To turn this off and use those
                   characters raw, just prefix with a backslash.

           -       <b>dh_makeshlibs </b>makes the <i>postinst</i> and <i>postrm</i> scripts
                   call <b>ldconfig</b>.

           -       Every file in <i>etc/</i> is automatically flagged as a
                   conffile by <b>dh_installdeb</b>.

           This mode is deprecated.

       v2  In this mode, debhelper will consistently use debian/<i>package</i>
           as the package tree directory for every package that is
           built.

           This mode is deprecated.

       v1  This is the original debhelper compatibility level, and so it
           is the default one. In this mode, debhelper will use
           <i>debian/tmp</i> as the package tree directory for the first binary
           package listed in the control file, while using
           debian/<i>package</i> for all other packages listed in the <i>control</i>
           file.

           This mode is deprecated.
