DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For an overview of namespaces, see <a href="namespaces.7.html">namespaces(7)</a>.

       PID namespaces isolate the process ID number space, meaning that
       processes in different PID namespaces can have the same PID.  PID
       namespaces allow containers to provide functionality such as
       suspending/resuming the set of processes in the container and
       migrating the container to a new host while the processes inside
       the container maintain the same PIDs.

       PIDs in a new PID namespace start at 1, somewhat like a
       standalone system, and calls to <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork(2)</a>, or <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>
       will produce processes with PIDs that are unique within the
       namespace.

       Use of PID namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with
       the <b>CONFIG_PID_NS </b>option.

   <b>The namespace init process</b>
       The first process created in a new namespace (i.e., the process
       created using <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> with the <b>CLONE_NEWPID </b>flag, or the first
       child created by a process after a call to <a href="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> using the
       <b>CLONE_NEWPID </b>flag) has the PID 1, and is the "init" process for
       the namespace (see <a href="../man1/init.1.html">init(1)</a>).  This process becomes the parent of
       any child processes that are orphaned because a process that
       resides in this PID namespace terminated (see below for further
       details).

       If the "init" process of a PID namespace terminates, the kernel
       terminates all of the processes in the namespace via a <b>SIGKILL</b>
       signal.  This behavior reflects the fact that the "init" process
       is essential for the correct operation of a PID namespace.  In
       this case, a subsequent <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> into this PID namespace fail with
       the error <b>ENOMEM</b>; it is not possible to create a new process in a
       PID namespace whose "init" process has terminated.  Such
       scenarios can occur when, for example, a process uses an open
       file descriptor for a <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/ns/pid</i> file corresponding to a
       process that was in a namespace to <a href="../man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> into that namespace
       after the "init" process has terminated.  Another possible
       scenario can occur after a call to <a href="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>: if the first child
       subsequently created by a <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> terminates, then subsequent
       calls to <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> fail with <b>ENOMEM</b>.

       Only signals for which the "init" process has established a
       signal handler can be sent to the "init" process by other members
       of the PID namespace.  This restriction applies even to
       privileged processes, and prevents other members of the PID
       namespace from accidentally killing the "init" process.

       Likewise, a process in an ancestor namespace can—subject to the
       usual permission checks described in <a href="../man2/kill.2.html">kill(2)</a>—send signals to the
       "init" process of a child PID namespace only if the "init"
       process has established a handler for that signal.  (Within the
       handler, the <i>siginfo_t si_pid</i> field described in <a href="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</a>
       will be zero.)  <b>SIGKILL </b>or <b>SIGSTOP </b>are treated exceptionally:
       these signals are forcibly delivered when sent from an ancestor
       PID namespace.  Neither of these signals can be caught by the
       "init" process, and so will result in the usual actions
       associated with those signals (respectively, terminating and
       stopping the process).

       Starting with Linux 3.4, the <a href="../man2/reboot.2.html">reboot(2)</a> system call causes a
       signal to be sent to the namespace "init" process.  See <a href="../man2/reboot.2.html">reboot(2)</a>
       for more details.

   <b>Nesting PID namespaces</b>
       PID namespaces can be nested: each PID namespace has a parent,
       except for the initial ("root") PID namespace.  The parent of a
       PID namespace is the PID namespace of the process that created
       the namespace using <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>.  PID namespaces thus
       form a tree, with all namespaces ultimately tracing their
       ancestry to the root namespace.  Since Linux 3.7, the kernel
       limits the maximum nesting depth for PID namespaces to 32.

       A process is visible to other processes in its PID namespace, and
       to the processes in each direct ancestor PID namespace going back
       to the root PID namespace.  In this context, "visible" means that
       one process can be the target of operations by another process
       using system calls that specify a process ID.  Conversely, the
       processes in a child PID namespace can't see processes in the
       parent and further removed ancestor namespaces.  More succinctly:
       a process can see (e.g., send signals with <a href="../man2/kill.2.html">kill(2)</a>, set nice
       values with <a href="../man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority(2)</a>, etc.) only processes contained in its
       own PID namespace and in descendants of that namespace.

       A process has one process ID in each of the layers of the PID
       namespace hierarchy in which is visible, and walking back though
       each direct ancestor namespace through to the root PID namespace.
       System calls that operate on process IDs always operate using the
       process ID that is visible in the PID namespace of the caller.  A
       call to <a href="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid(2)</a> always returns the PID associated with the
       namespace in which the process was created.

       Some processes in a PID namespace may have parents that are
       outside of the namespace.  For example, the parent of the initial
       process in the namespace (i.e., the <a href="../man1/init.1.html">init(1)</a> process with PID 1)
       is necessarily in another namespace.  Likewise, the direct
       children of a process that uses <a href="../man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> to cause its children to
       join a PID namespace are in a different PID namespace from the
       caller of <a href="../man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a>.  Calls to <a href="../man2/getppid.2.html">getppid(2)</a> for such processes
       return 0.

       While processes may freely descend into child PID namespaces
       (e.g., using <a href="../man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> with a PID namespace file descriptor), they
       may not move in the other direction.  That is to say, processes
       may not enter any ancestor namespaces (parent, grandparent,
       etc.).  Changing PID namespaces is a one-way operation.

       The <b>NS_GET_PARENT ioctl</b>(2) operation can be used to discover the
       parental relationship between PID namespaces; see <a href="../man2/ioctl_nsfs.2.html">ioctl_nsfs(2)</a>.

   <b>setns(2) and unshare(2) semantics</b>
       Calls to <a href="../man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> that specify a PID namespace file descriptor
       and calls to <a href="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> with the <b>CLONE_NEWPID </b>flag cause children
       subsequently created by the caller to be placed in a different
       PID namespace from the caller.  (Since Linux 4.12, that PID
       namespace is shown via the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/ns/pid_for_children</i> file, as
       described in <a href="namespaces.7.html">namespaces(7)</a>.)  These calls do not, however, change
       the PID namespace of the calling process, because doing so would
       change the caller's idea of its own PID (as reported by
       <b>getpid</b>()), which would break many applications and libraries.

       To put things another way: a process's PID namespace membership
       is determined when the process is created and cannot be changed
       thereafter.  Among other things, this means that the parental
       relationship between processes mirrors the parental relationship
       between PID namespaces: the parent of a process is either in the
       same namespace or resides in the immediate parent PID namespace.

       A process may call <a href="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> with the <b>CLONE_NEWPID </b>flag only
       once.  After it has performed this operation, its
       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/ns/pid_for_children</i> symbolic link will be empty until
       the first child is created in the namespace.

   <b>Adoption of orphaned children</b>
       When a child process becomes orphaned, it is reparented to the
       "init" process in the PID namespace of its parent (unless one of
       the nearer ancestors of the parent employed the <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a>
       <b>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER </b>command to mark itself as the reaper of
       orphaned descendant processes).  Note that because of the
       <a href="../man2/setns.2.html">setns(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a> semantics described above, this may be
       the "init" process in the PID namespace that is the <i>parent</i> of the
       child's PID namespace, rather than the "init" process in the
       child's own PID namespace.

   <b>Compatibility of CLONE_NEWPID with other CLONE_* flags</b>
       In current versions of Linux, <b>CLONE_NEWPID </b>can't be combined with
       <b>CLONE_THREAD</b>.  Threads are required to be in the same PID
       namespace such that the threads in a process can send signals to
       each other.  Similarly, it must be possible to see all of the
       threads of a process in the <a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc(5)</a> filesystem.  Additionally, if
       two threads were in different PID namespaces, the process ID of
       the process sending a signal could not be meaningfully encoded
       when a signal is sent (see the description of the <i>siginfo_t</i> type
       in <a href="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</a>).  Since this is computed when a signal is
       enqueued, a signal queue shared by processes in multiple PID
       namespaces would defeat that.

       In earlier versions of Linux, <b>CLONE_NEWPID </b>was additionally
       disallowed (failing with the error <b>EINVAL</b>) in combination with
       <b>CLONE_SIGHAND </b>(before Linux 4.3) as well as <b>CLONE_VM </b>(before
       Linux 3.12).  The changes that lifted these restrictions have
       also been ported to earlier stable kernels.

   <b>/proc and PID namespaces</b>
       A <i>/proc</i> filesystem shows (in the <i>/proc/</i>pid directories) only
       processes visible in the PID namespace of the process that
       performed the mount, even if the <i>/proc</i> filesystem is viewed from
       processes in other namespaces.

       After creating a new PID namespace, it is useful for the child to
       change its root directory and mount a new procfs instance at
       <i>/proc</i> so that tools such as <a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps(1)</a> work correctly.  If a new mount
       namespace is simultaneously created by including <b>CLONE_NEWNS </b>in
       the <i>flags</i> argument of <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare(2)</a>, then it isn't
       necessary to change the root directory: a new procfs instance can
       be mounted directly over <i>/proc</i>.

       From a shell, the command to mount <i>/proc</i> is:

           $ mount -t proc proc /proc

       Calling <a href="../man2/readlink.2.html">readlink(2)</a> on the path <i>/proc/self</i> yields the process ID
       of the caller in the PID namespace of the procfs mount (i.e., the
       PID namespace of the process that mounted the procfs).  This can
       be useful for introspection purposes, when a process wants to
       discover its PID in other namespaces.

   <b>/proc files</b>
       <b>/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid </b>(since Linux 3.3)
              This file (which is virtualized per PID namespace)
              displays the last PID that was allocated in this PID
              namespace.  When the next PID is allocated, the kernel
              will search for the lowest unallocated PID that is greater
              than this value, and when this file is subsequently read
              it will show that PID.

              This file is writable by a process that has the
              <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>or (since Linux 5.9) <b>CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</b>
              capability inside the user namespace that owns the PID
              namespace.  This makes it possible to determine the PID
              that is allocated to the next process that is created
              inside this PID namespace.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       When a process ID is passed over a UNIX domain socket to a
       process in a different PID namespace (see the description of
       <b>SCM_CREDENTIALS </b>in <a href="unix.7.html">unix(7)</a>), it is translated into the
       corresponding PID value in the receiving process's PID namespace.
