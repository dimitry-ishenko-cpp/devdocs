DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The sock_diag netlink subsystem provides a mechanism for
       obtaining information about sockets of various address families
       from the kernel.  This subsystem can be used to obtain
       information about individual sockets or request a list of
       sockets.

       In the request, the caller can specify additional information it
       would like to obtain about the socket, for example, memory
       information or information specific to the address family.

       When requesting a list of sockets, the caller can specify filters
       that would be applied by the kernel to select a subset of sockets
       to report.  For now, there is only the ability to filter sockets
       by state (connected, listening, and so on.)

       Note that sock_diag reports only those sockets that have a name;
       that is, either sockets bound explicitly with <a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind(2)</a> or sockets
       that were automatically bound to an address (e.g., by
       <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a>).  This is the same set of sockets that is available
       via <i>/proc/net/unix</i>, <i>/proc/net/tcp</i>, <i>/proc/net/udp</i>, and so on.

   <b>Request</b>
       The request starts with a <i>struct nlmsghdr</i> header described in
       <a href="netlink.7.html">netlink(7)</a> with <i>nlmsg_type</i> field set to <b>SOCK_DIAG_BY_FAMILY</b>.  It
       is followed by a header specific to the address family that
       starts with a common part shared by all address families:

           struct sock_diag_req {
               __u8 sdiag_family;
               __u8 sdiag_protocol;
           };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       <i>sdiag_family</i>
              An address family.  It should be set to the appropriate
              <b>AF_* </b>constant.

       <i>sdiag_protocol</i>
              Depends on <i>sdiag_family</i>.  It should be set to the
              appropriate <b>IPPROTO_* </b>constant for <b>AF_INET </b>and <b>AF_INET6</b>,
              and to 0 otherwise.

       If the <i>nlmsg_flags</i> field of the <i>struct nlmsghdr</i> header has the
       <b>NLM_F_DUMP </b>flag set, it means that a list of sockets is being
       requested; otherwise it is a query about an individual socket.

   <b>Response</b>
       The response starts with a <i>struct nlmsghdr</i> header and is followed
       by an array of objects specific to the address family.  The array
       is to be accessed with the standard <b>NLMSG_* </b>macros from the
       <a href="../man3/netlink.3.html">netlink(3)</a> API.

       Each object is the NLA (netlink attributes) list that is to be
       accessed with the <b>RTA_* </b>macros from <a href="../man3/rtnetlink.3.html">rtnetlink(3)</a> API.

   <b>UNIX domain sockets</b>
       For UNIX domain sockets the request is represented in the
       following structure:

           struct unix_diag_req {
               __u8    sdiag_family;
               __u8    sdiag_protocol;
               __u16   pad;
               __u32   udiag_states;
               __u32   udiag_ino;
               __u32   udiag_show;
               __u32   udiag_cookie[2];
           };

       The fields of this structure are as follows:

       <i>sdiag_family</i>
              The address family; it should be set to <b>AF_UNIX</b>.

       <i>sdiag_protocol</i>
       <i>pad</i>    These fields should be set to 0.

       <i>udiag_states</i>
              This is a bit mask that defines a filter of sockets
              states.  Only those sockets whose states are in this mask
              will be reported.  Ignored when querying for an individual
              socket.  Supported values are:

                   1 &lt;&lt; <b>TCP_ESTABLISHED</b>

                   1 &lt;&lt; <b>TCP_LISTEN</b>

       <i>udiag_ino</i>
              This is an inode number when querying for an individual
              socket.  Ignored when querying for a list of sockets.

       <i>udiag_show</i>
              This is a set of flags defining what kind of information
              to report.  Each requested kind of information is reported

              along with other fields of this structure to specify an
              individual socket.  It is ignored when querying for a list
              of sockets, as well as when all its elements are set to
              -1.

       The response to a query for IPv4 or IPv6 sockets is represented
       as an array of

           struct inet_diag_msg {
               __u8    idiag_family;

              This denotes socket state as in <i>struct inet_diag_req_v2</i>.

       <i>idiag_timer</i>
              For TCP sockets, this field describes the type of timer
              that is currently active for the socket.  It is set to one
              of the following constants:

                   <b>0      </b>no timer is active
                   <b>1      </b>a retransmit timer
                   <b>2      </b>a keep-alive timer
                   <b>3      </b>a TIME_WAIT timer
                   <b>4      </b>a zero window probe timer

              For non-TCP sockets, this field is set to 0.

       <i>idiag_retrans</i>
              For <i>idiag_timer</i> values 1, 2, and 4, this field contains
              the number of retransmits.  For other <i>idiag_timer</i> values,
              this field is set to 0.

       <i>idiag_expires</i>
              For TCP sockets that have an active timer, this field
              describes its expiration time in milliseconds.  For other
              sockets, this field is set to 0.

       <i>idiag_rqueue</i>
              For listening sockets: the number of pending connections.

              For other sockets: the amount of data in the incoming
              queue.

       <i>idiag_wqueue</i>
              For listening sockets: the backlog length.

              For other sockets: the amount of memory available for
              sending.

       <i>idiag_uid</i>
              This is the socket owner UID.

       <i>idiag_inode</i>
              This is the socket inode number.

   <b>Socket memory information</b>
       The payload associated with <b>UNIX_DIAG_MEMINFO </b>and
       <b>INET_DIAG_SKMEMINFO </b>netlink attributes is an array of the
       following __u32 values:

       <b>SK_MEMINFO_RMEM_ALLOC</b>
              The amount of data in receive queue.

       <b>SK_MEMINFO_RCVBUF</b>
              The receive socket buffer as set by <b>SO_RCVBUF</b>.

       <b>SK_MEMINFO_WMEM_ALLOC</b>
              The amount of data in send queue.

       <b>SK_MEMINFO_SNDBUF</b>
              The send socket buffer as set by <b>SO_SNDBUF</b>.

       <b>SK_MEMINFO_FWD_ALLOC</b>
              The amount of memory scheduled for future use (TCP only).

       <b>SK_MEMINFO_WMEM_QUEUED</b>
              The amount of data queued by TCP, but not yet sent.

       <b>SK_MEMINFO_OPTMEM</b>
              The amount of memory allocated for the socket's service
              needs (e.g., socket filter).

       <b>SK_MEMINFO_BACKLOG</b>
              The amount of packets in the backlog (not yet processed).

VERSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>NETLINK_INET_DIAG </b>was introduced in Linux 2.6.14 and supported
       <b>AF_INET </b>and <b>AF_INET6 </b>sockets only.  In Linux 3.3, it was renamed
       to <b>NETLINK_SOCK_DIAG </b>and extended to support <b>AF_UNIX </b>sockets.

       <b>UNIX_DIAG_MEMINFO </b>and <b>INET_DIAG_SKMEMINFO </b>were introduced in
       Linux 3.6.
