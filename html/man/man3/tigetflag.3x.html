DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These  low-level routines must be called by programs that have to
       deal directly with the <b>terminfo </b>database to handle certain termi‐
       nal capabilities, such as programming  function  keys.   For  all
       other  functionality, <b>curses </b>routines are more suitable and their
       use is recommended.

       None of these functions use (or are aware of) multibyte character
       strings such as UTF-8:

       •   capability names use the POSIX portable character set

       •   capability string values have no associated encoding; they
           are strings of 8-bit characters.

   <b>Initialization</b>
       Initially, <b>setupterm </b>should be called.  The high-level curses
       functions <b>initscr </b>and <b>newterm </b>call <b>setupterm </b>to initialize the
       low-level set of terminal-dependent variables [listed in <b>termin‐</b>
       <b>fo</b>(5)].

       Applications can use the terminal capabilities either directly
       (via header definitions), or by special functions.  The header
       files <b>curses.h </b>and <b>term.h </b>should be included (in this order) to
       get the definitions for these strings, numbers, and flags.

       The <b>terminfo </b>variables <b>lines </b>and <b>columns </b>are initialized by <b>se‐</b>
       <b>tupterm </b>as follows:

       •   If <b>use_env(FALSE) </b>has been called, values for <b>lines </b>and
           <b>columns </b>specified in <b>terminfo </b>are used.

       •   Otherwise, if the environment variables <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS </b>ex‐
           ist, their values are used.  If these environment variables
           do not exist and the program is running in a window, the cur‐
           rent window size is used.  Otherwise, if the environment
           variables do not exist, the values for <b>lines </b>and <b>columns</b>
           specified in the <b>terminfo </b>database are used.

       Parameterized strings should be passed through <b>tparm </b>to instanti‐
       ate them.  All <b>terminfo </b>strings (including the output of <b>tparm</b>)
       should be printed with <b>tputs </b>or <b>putp</b>.  Call <b>reset_shell_mode </b>to
       restore the tty modes before exiting [see <b>curs_kernel</b>(3X)].

       Programs which use cursor addressing should

       •   output <b>enter_ca_mode </b>upon startup and

       •   output <b>exit_ca_mode </b>before exiting.

       Programs which execute shell subprocesses should

       •   call <b>reset_shell_mode </b>and output <b>exit_ca_mode </b>before the
           shell is called and

       •   output <b>enter_ca_mode </b>and call <b>reset_prog_mode </b>after returning
           from the shell.

       The <b>setupterm </b>routine reads in the <b>terminfo </b>database, initializ‐
       ing the <b>terminfo </b>structures, but does not set up the output vir‐
       tualization structures used by <b>curses</b>.  These are its parameters:

          <i>term</i> is the terminal type, a character string.  If <i>term</i> is
               null, the environment variable <b>TERM </b>is used.

          <i>filedes</i>
               is the file descriptor used for all output.

          <i>errret</i>
               points to an optional location where an error status can
               be returned to the caller.  If <i>errret</i> is not null, then
               <b>setupterm </b>returns <b>OK </b>or <b>ERR </b>and stores a status value in
               the integer pointed to by <i>errret</i>.  A return value of <b>OK</b>
               combined with status of <b>1 </b>in <i>errret</i> is normal.

               If <b>ERR </b>is returned, examine <i>errret</i>:

               <b>1    </b>means that the terminal is hardcopy, cannot be used
                    for curses applications.

                    <b>setupterm </b>determines if the entry is a hardcopy type
                    by checking the <b>hc </b>(<b>hardcopy</b>) capability.

               <b>0    </b>means that the terminal could not be found, or that
                    it is a generic type, having too little information
                    for curses applications to run.

                    <b>setupterm </b>determines if the entry is a generic type
                    by checking the <b>gn </b>(<b>generic</b>) capability.

               <b>-1   </b>means that the <b>terminfo </b>database could not be found.

               If <i>errret</i> is null, <b>setupterm </b>prints an error message upon
               finding an error and exits.  Thus, the simplest call is:

                     <b>setupterm((char *)0, 1, (int *)0);</b>,

               which uses all the defaults and sends the output to <b>std‐</b>
               <b>out</b>.

   <b>The Terminal State</b>
       The <b>setupterm </b>routine stores its information about the terminal
       in a <b>TERMINAL </b>structure pointed to by the global variable
       <b>cur_term</b>.  If it detects an error, or decides that the terminal
       is unsuitable (hardcopy or generic), it discards this informa‐
       tion, making it not available to applications.

       If <b>setupterm </b>is called repeatedly for the same terminal type, it
       will reuse the information.  It maintains only one copy of a giv‐
       en terminal's capabilities in memory.  If it is called for dif‐
       ferent terminal types, <b>setupterm </b>allocates new storage for each
       set of terminal capabilities.

       The <b>set_curterm </b>routine sets <b>cur_term </b>to <i>nterm</i>, and makes all of
       the <b>terminfo </b>boolean, numeric, and string variables use the val‐
       ues from <i>nterm</i>.  It returns the old value of <b>cur_term</b>.

       The <b>del_curterm </b>routine frees the space pointed to by <i>oterm</i> and
       makes it available for further use.  If <i>oterm</i> is the same as
       <b>cur_term</b>, references to any of the <b>terminfo </b>boolean, numeric, and
       string variables thereafter may refer to invalid memory locations
       until another <b>setupterm </b>has been called.

       The <b>restartterm </b>routine is similar to <b>setupterm </b>and <b>initscr</b>, ex‐
       cept that it is called after restoring memory to a previous state
       (for example, when reloading a game saved as a core image dump).
       <b>restartterm </b>assumes that the windows and the input and output op‐
       tions are the same as when memory was saved, but the terminal
       type and baud rate may be different.  Accordingly, <b>restartterm</b>
       saves various tty state bits, calls <b>setupterm</b>, and then restores
       the bits.

   <b>Formatting Output</b>
       The <b>tparm </b>routine instantiates the string <i>str</i> with parameters <i>pi</i>.
       A pointer is returned to the result of <i>str</i> with the parameters
       applied.  Application developers should keep in mind these quirks
       of the interface:

       •   Although <b>tparm</b>'s actual parameters may be integers or
           strings, the prototype expects <b>long </b>(integer) values.

       •   Aside from the <b>set_attributes </b>(<b>sgr</b>) capability, most terminal
           capabilities require no more than one or two parameters.

       •   Padding information is ignored by <b>tparm</b>; it is interpreted by
           <b>tputs</b>.

       •   The capability string is null-terminated.  Use “\200” where
           an ASCII NUL is needed in the output.

       <b>tiparm </b>is a newer form of <b>tparm </b>which uses <i>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</i> rather than
       a fixed-parameter list.  Its numeric parameters are integers
       (int) rather than longs.

   <b>Output Functions</b>
       The <b>tputs </b>routine applies padding information (i.e., by inter‐
       preting marker embedded in the terminfo capability such as “$&lt;5&gt;”
       as 5 milliseconds) to the string <i>str</i> and outputs it:

       •   The <i>str</i> parameter must be a terminfo string variable or the
           return value from <b>tparm</b>, <b>tiparm</b>, <b>tgetstr</b>, or <b>tgoto</b>.

           The <b>tgetstr </b>and <b>tgoto </b>functions are part of the <i>termcap</i> in‐
           terface, which happens to share this function name with the
           <i>terminfo</i> interface.

       •   <i>affcnt</i> is the number of lines affected, or 1 if not applica‐
           ble.

       •   <i>putc</i> is a <b>putchar</b>-like routine to which the characters are
           passed, one at a time.

       The <b>putp </b>routine calls <b>tputs(</b><i>str</i><b>, 1, putchar)</b>.  The output of
       <b>putp </b>always goes to <b>stdout</b>, rather than the <i>filedes</i> specified in
       <b>setupterm</b>.

       The <b>vidputs </b>routine displays the string on the terminal in the
       video attribute mode <i>attrs</i>, which is any combination of the at‐
       tributes listed in <b>curses</b>(3X).  The characters are passed to the
       <b>putchar</b>-like routine <i>putc</i>.

       The <b>vidattr </b>routine is like the <b>vidputs </b>routine, except that it
       outputs through <b>putchar</b>.

       The <b>vid_attr </b>and <b>vid_puts </b>routines correspond to vidattr and vid‐
       puts, respectively.  They use a set of arguments for representing
       the video attributes plus color, i.e.,

       •   <i>attrs</i> of type <b>attr_t </b>for the attributes and

       •   <i>pair</i> of type <b>short </b>for the color-pair number.

       The <b>vid_attr </b>and <b>vid_puts </b>routines are designed to use the at‐
       tribute constants with the <b>WA_ </b>prefix.

       X/Open Curses reserves the <i>opts</i> argument for future use, saying
       that applications must provide a null pointer for that argument.
       As an extension, this implementation allows <i>opts</i> to be used as a
       pointer to <b>int</b>, which overrides the <i>pair</i> (<b>short</b>) argument.

       The <b>mvcur </b>routine provides low-level cursor motion.  It takes ef‐
       fect immediately (rather than at the next refresh).

       While <b>putp </b>and <b>mvcur </b>are low-level functions which do not use the
       high-level curses state, they are declared in <b>&lt;curses.h&gt; </b>because
       SystemV did this (see <i>HISTORY</i>).

   <b>Terminal Capability Functions</b>
       The <b>tigetflag</b>, <b>tigetnum </b>and <b>tigetstr </b>routines return the value of
       the capability corresponding to the <b>terminfo </b><i>capname</i> passed to
       them, such as <b>xenl</b>.  The <i>capname</i> for each capability is given in
       the table column entitled <i>capname</i> code in the capabilities sec‐
       tion of <a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a>.

       These routines return special values to denote errors.

       The <b>tigetflag </b>routine returns

       <b>-1     </b>if <i>capname</i> is not a boolean capability, or

       <b>0      </b>if it is canceled or absent from the terminal description.

       The <b>tigetnum </b>routine returns

       <b>-2     </b>if <i>capname</i> is not a numeric capability, or

       <b>-1     </b>if it is canceled or absent from the terminal description.

       The <b>tigetstr </b>routine returns

       <b>(char *)-1</b>
              if <i>capname</i> is not a string capability, or

       <b>0      </b>if it is canceled or absent from the terminal description.

   <b>Terminal Capability Names</b>
       These null-terminated arrays contain

       •   the short terminfo names (“codes”),

       •   the <b>termcap </b>names (“names”), and

       •   the long terminfo names (“fnames”)

       for each of the predefined <b>terminfo </b>variables:

              <b>const char *boolnames[]</b>, <b>*boolcodes[]</b>, <b>*boolfnames[]</b>
              <b>const char *numnames[]</b>, <b>*numcodes[]</b>, <b>*numfnames[]</b>
              <b>const char *strnames[]</b>, <b>*strcodes[]</b>, <b>*strfnames[]</b>

   <b>Releasing Memory</b>
       Each successful call to <b>setupterm </b>allocates memory to hold the
       terminal description.  As a side-effect, it sets <b>cur_term </b>to
       point to this memory.  If an application calls

            <b>del_curterm(cur_term);</b>

       the memory will be freed.

       The formatting functions <b>tparm </b>and <b>tiparm </b>extend the storage al‐
       located by <b>setupterm</b>:

       •   the “static” terminfo variables [a-z].  Before ncurses 6.3,
           those were shared by all screens.  With ncurses 6.3, those
           are allocated per screen.  See <a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a> for details.

       •   to improve performance, ncurses 6.3 caches the result of ana‐
           lyzing terminfo strings for their parameter types.  That is
           stored as a binary tree referenced from the <b>TERMINAL </b>struc‐
           ture.

       The higher-level <b>initscr </b>and <b>newterm </b>functions use <b>setupterm</b>.
       Normally they do not free this memory, but it is possible to do
       that using the <b>delscreen</b>(3X) function.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Routines that return an integer return <b>ERR </b>upon failure and <b>OK</b>
       (SVr4 only specifies “an integer value other than <b>ERR</b>”) upon suc‐
       cessful completion, unless otherwise noted in the preceding rou‐
       tine descriptions.

       Routines that return pointers always return <b>NULL </b>on error.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation

          <b>del_curterm</b>
               returns an error if its terminal parameter is null.

          <b>putp </b>calls <b>tputs</b>, returning the same error-codes.

          <b>restartterm</b>
               returns an error if the associated call to <b>setupterm </b>re‐
               turns an error.

          <b>setupterm</b>
               returns an error if it cannot allocate enough memory, or
               create the initial windows (stdscr, curscr, newscr).
               Other error conditions are documented above.

          <b>tputs</b>
               returns an error if the string parameter is null.  It
               does not detect I/O errors: X/Open states that <b>tputs </b>ig‐
               nores the return value of the output function <i>putc</i>.

   <b>Compatibility macros</b>
       This implementation provides a few macros for compatibility with
       systems before SVr4 (see <i>HISTORY</i>).  Those include <b>crmode</b>, <b>fix‐</b>
       <b>term</b>, <b>gettmode</b>, <b>nocrmode</b>, <b>resetterm</b>, <b>saveterm</b>, and <b>setterm</b>.

       In SVr4, those are found in <b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b>, but except for <b>setterm</b>,
       are likewise macros.  The one function, <b>setterm</b>, is mentioned in
       the manual page.  The manual page notes that the <b>setterm </b>routine
       was replaced by <b>setupterm</b>, stating that the call:

             <b>setupterm(</b><i>term</i><b>, 1, (int *)0)</b>

       provides the same functionality as <b>setterm(</b><i>term</i><b>)</b>, and is not rec‐
       ommended for new programs.  This implementation provides each of
       those symbols as macros for BSD compatibility,

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       SVr2 introduced the terminfo feature.  Its programming manual
       mentioned these low-level functions:
       <b>Function    Description</b>
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       fixterm     restore tty to “in curses” state
       gettmode    establish current tty modes
       mvcur       low level cursor motion
       putp        utility function that uses <b>tputs </b>to send char‐
                   acters via <b>putchar</b>.
       resetterm   set tty modes to “out of curses” state
       resetty     reset tty flags to stored value
       saveterm    save current modes as “in curses” state
       savetty     store current tty flags
       setterm     establish terminal with given type
       setupterm   establish terminal with given type
       tparm       instantiate a string expression with parameters
       tputs       apply padding information to a string
       vidattr     like <b>vidputs</b>, but outputs through <b>putchar</b>
       vidputs     output a string to put terminal in a specified
                   video attribute mode

       The programming manual also mentioned functions provided for
       termcap compatibility (commenting that they “may go away at a
       later date”):
       <b>Function   Description</b>
       ────────────────────────────────────────────────
       tgetent    look up termcap entry for given <i>name</i>
       tgetflag   get boolean entry for given <i>id</i>
       tgetnum    get numeric entry for given <i>id</i>
       tgetstr    get string entry for given <i>id</i>
       tgoto      apply parameters to given capability
       tputs      apply padding to capability, calling
                  a function to put characters

       Early terminfo programs obtained capability values from the <b>TER‐</b>
       <b>MINAL </b>structure initialized by <b>setupterm</b>.

       SVr3 extended terminfo by adding functions to retrieve capability
       values (like the termcap interface), and reusing tgoto and tputs:
       <b>Function    Description</b>
       ───────────────────────────────────────────
       tigetflag   get boolean entry for given <i>id</i>
       tigetnum    get numeric entry for given <i>id</i>
       tigetstr    get string entry for given <i>id</i>

       SVr3 also replaced several of the SVr2 terminfo functions which
       had no counterpart in the termcap interface, documenting them as
       obsolete:
       <b>Function    Replaced by</b>
       ─────────────────────────────
       crmode      cbreak
       fixterm     reset_prog_mode
       gettmode    N/A
       nocrmode    nocbreak
       resetterm   reset_shell_mode
       saveterm    def_prog_mode
       setterm     setupterm

       SVr3 kept the <b>mvcur</b>, <b>vidattr </b>and <b>vidputs </b>functions, along with
       <b>putp</b>, <b>tparm </b>and <b>tputs</b>.  The latter were needed to support
       padding, and handling functions such as <b>vidattr </b>(which used more
       than the two parameters supported by <b>tgoto</b>).

       SVr3 introduced the functions for switching between terminal de‐
       scriptions, e.g., <b>set_curterm</b>.  Some of that was incremental im‐
       provements to the SVr2 library:

       •   The <b>TERMINAL </b>type definition was introduced in SVr3.01, for
           the <b>term </b>structure provided in SVr2.

       •   The various global variables such as <b>boolnames </b>were mentioned
           in the programming manual at this point, though the variables
           were provided in SVr2.

       SVr4 added the <b>vid_attr </b>and <b>vid_puts </b>functions.

       There are other low-level functions declared in the curses header
       files on Unix systems, but none were documented.  The functions
       marked “obsolete” remained in use by the Unix <b>vi</b>(1) editor.

PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Legacy functions</b>
       X/Open notes that <b>vidattr </b>and <b>vidputs </b>may be macros.

       The function <b>setterm </b>is not described by X/Open and must be con‐
       sidered non-portable.  All other functions are as described by
       X/Open.

   <b>Legacy data</b>
       <b>setupterm </b>copies the terminal name to the array <b>ttytype</b>.  This is
       not part of X/Open Curses, but is assumed by some applications.

       Other implementions may not declare the capability name arrays.
       Some provide them without declaring them.  X/Open does not speci‐
       fy them.

       Extended terminal capability names, e.g., as defined by <b>@TIC@ -x</b>,
       are not stored in the arrays described here.

   <b>Output buffering</b>
       Older versions of <b>ncurses </b>assumed that the file descriptor passed
       to <b>setupterm </b>from <b>initscr </b>or <b>newterm </b>uses buffered I/O, and would
       write to the corresponding stream.  In addition to the limitation
       that the terminal was left in block-buffered mode on exit (like
       System V curses), it was problematic because <b>ncurses </b>did not al‐
       low a reliable way to cleanup on receiving SIGTSTP.

       The current version (ncurses6) uses output buffers managed di‐
       rectly by <b>ncurses</b>.  Some of the low-level functions described in
       this manual page write to the standard output.  They are not sig‐
       nal-safe.  The high-level functions in <b>ncurses </b>use alternate ver‐
       sions of these functions using the more reliable buffering
       scheme.

   <b>Function prototypes</b>
       The X/Open Curses prototypes are based on the SVr4 curses header
       declarations, which were defined at the same time the C language
       was first standardized in the late 1980s.

       •   X/Open Curses uses <b>const </b>less effectively than a later design
           might, in some cases applying it needlessly to values are al‐
           ready constant, and in most cases overlooking parameters
           which normally would use <b>const</b>.  Using constant parameters
           for functions which do not use <b>const </b>may prevent the program
           from compiling.  On the other hand, <i>writable strings</i> are an
           obsolescent feature.

           As an extension, this implementation can be configured to
           change the function prototypes to use the <b>const </b>keyword.  The
           ncurses ABI 6 enables this feature by default.

       •   X/Open Curses prototypes <b>tparm </b>with a fixed number of parame‐
           ters, rather than a variable argument list.

           This implementation uses a variable argument list, but can be
           configured to use the fixed-parameter list.  Portable appli‐
           cations should provide 9 parameters after the format; zeroes
           are fine for this purpose.

           In response to review comments by Thomas E. Dickey, X/Open
           Curses Issue 7 proposed the <b>tiparm </b>function in mid-2009.

   <b>Special TERM treatment</b>
       If configured to use the terminal-driver, e.g., for the MinGW
       port,

       •   <b>setupterm </b>interprets a missing/empty TERM variable as the
           special value “unknown”.

       •   <b>setupterm </b>allows explicit use of the the windows console dri‐
           ver by checking if $TERM is set to “#win32con” or an abbrevi‐
           ation of that string.

   <b>Other portability issues</b>
       In System V Release 4, <b>set_curterm </b>has an <b>int </b>return type and re‐
       turns <b>OK </b>or <b>ERR</b>.  We have chosen to implement the X/Open Curses
       semantics.

       In System V Release 4, the third argument of <b>tputs </b>has the type
       <b>int (*putc)(char)</b>.

       At least one implementation of X/Open Curses (Solaris) returns a
       value other than <b>OK</b>/<b>ERR </b>from <b>tputs</b>.  That returns the length of
       the string, and does no error-checking.

       X/Open notes that after calling <b>mvcur</b>, the curses state may not
       match the actual terminal state, and that an application should
       touch and refresh the window before resuming normal curses calls.
       Both <b>ncurses </b>and System V Release 4 curses implement <b>mvcur </b>using
       the SCREEN data allocated in either <b>initscr </b>or <b>newterm</b>.  So
       though it is documented as a terminfo function, <b>mvcur </b>is really a
       curses function which is not well specified.

       X/Open states that the old location must be given for <b>mvcur</b>.
       This implementation allows the caller to use -1's for the old or‐
       dinates.  In that case, the old location is unknown.
