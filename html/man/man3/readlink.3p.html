       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       readlink, readlinkat — read the contents of a symbolic link
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       ssize_t readlink(const char *restrict <i>path</i>, char *restrict <i>buf</i>,
           size_t <i>bufsize</i>);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       ssize_t readlinkat(int <i>fd</i>, const char *restrict <i>path</i>,
           char *restrict <i>buf</i>, size_t <i>bufsize</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>readlink</i>() function shall place the contents of the symbolic
       link referred to by <i>path</i> in the buffer <i>buf</i> which has size
       <i>bufsize</i>.  If the number of bytes in the symbolic link is less
       than <i>bufsize</i>, the contents of the remainder of <i>buf</i> are
       unspecified. If the <i>buf</i> argument is not large enough to contain
       the link content, the first <i>bufsize</i> bytes shall be placed in <i>buf</i>.

       If the value of <i>bufsize</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result
       is implementation-defined.

       Upon successful completion, <i>readlink</i>() shall mark for update the
       last data access timestamp of the symbolic link.

       The <i>readlinkat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>readlink</i>()
       function except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a relative path.
       In this case the symbolic link whose content is read is relative
       to the directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead
       of the current working directory. If the access mode of the open
       file description associated with the file descriptor is not
       O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory searches are
       permitted using the current permissions of the directory
       underlying the file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH,
       the function shall not perform the check.

       If <i>readlinkat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to <i>readlink</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
       count of bytes placed in the buffer. Otherwise, these functions
       shall return a value of -1, leave the buffer unchanged, and set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied for a component of the path
              prefix of <i>path</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>path</i> argument names a file that is not a symbolic
              link.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       The <i>readlinkat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd</i> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path</i> argument does not specify an absolute path and
              the <i>fd</i> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
              descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument is not an absolute path and <i>fd</i> is a file
              descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Reading the Name of a Symbolic Link</b>
       The following example shows how to read the name of a symbolic
       link named <b>/modules/pass1</b>.

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

           char buf[1024];
           ssize_t len;
           ...
           if ((len = readlink("/modules/pass1", buf, sizeof(buf)-1)) != -1)
               buf[len] = '\0';
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Conforming applications should not assume that the returned
       contents of the symbolic link are null-terminated.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The type associated with <i>bufsiz</i> is a <b>size_t </b>in order to be
       consistent with both the ISO C standard and the definition of
       <i>read</i>().  The behavior specified for <i>readlink</i>() when <i>bufsiz</i> is
       zero represents historical practice. For this case, the standard
       developers considered a change whereby <i>readlink</i>() would return
       the number of non-null bytes contained in the symbolic link with
       the buffer <i>buf</i> remaining unchanged; however, since the <b>stat</b>
       structure member <i>st_size</i> value can be used to determine the size
       of buffer necessary to contain the contents of the symbolic link
       as returned by <i>readlink</i>(), this proposal was rejected, and the
       historical practice retained.

       The purpose of the <i>readlinkat</i>() function is to read the content
       of symbolic links in directories other than the current working
       directory without exposure to race conditions.  Any part of the
       path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to
       <i>readlink</i>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file
       descriptor for the target directory and using the <i>readlinkat</i>()
       function it can be guaranteed that the symbolic link read is
       located relative to the desired directory.
