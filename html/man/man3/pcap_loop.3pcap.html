SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>typedef void (*pcap_handler)(u_char *user, const struct pcap_pkthdr *h,</b>
           <b>const u_char *bytes);</b>
       <b>int pcap_loop(pcap_t *p, int cnt,</b>
           <b>pcap_handler callback, u_char *user);</b>
       <b>int pcap_dispatch(pcap_t *p, int cnt,</b>
           <b>pcap_handler callback, u_char *user);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_loop</b>() processes packets from a live capture or ``savefile''
       until <i>cnt</i> packets are processed, the end of the ``savefile'' is
       reached when reading from a ``savefile'', <b>pcap_breakloop</b>(3PCAP)
       is called, or an error occurs.  It does <b>not </b>return when live
       packet buffer timeouts occur.  A value of <b>-1 </b>or <b>0 </b>for <i>cnt</i> is
       equivalent to infinity, so that packets are processed until
       another ending condition occurs.

       <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() processes packets from a live capture or
       ``savefile'' until <i>cnt</i> packets are processed, the end of the
       current bufferful of packets is reached when doing a live
       capture, the end of the ``savefile'' is reached when reading from
       a ``savefile'', <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() is called, or an error occurs.
       Thus, when doing a live capture, <i>cnt</i> is the maximum number of
       packets to process before returning, but is not a minimum number;
       when reading a live capture, only one bufferful of packets is
       read at a time, so fewer than <i>cnt</i> packets may be processed. A
       value of <b>-1 </b>or <b>0 </b>for <i>cnt</i> causes all the packets received in one
       buffer to be processed when reading a live capture, and causes
       all the packets in the file to be processed when reading a
       ``savefile''.

       Note that, when doing a live capture on some platforms, if the
       read timeout expires when there are no packets available,
       <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() will return 0, even when not in non-blocking
       mode, as there are no packets to process.  Applications should be
       prepared for this to happen, but must not rely on it happening.

       <i>callback</i> specifies a <b>pcap_handler </b>routine to be called with three
       arguments: a <b>u_char </b>pointer which is passed in the <i>user</i> argument
       to <b>pcap_loop</b>() or <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(), a <b>const struct pcap_pkthdr</b>
       pointer pointing to the packet time stamp and lengths, and a
       <b>const u_char </b>pointer to the first <b>caplen </b>(as given in the <b>struct</b>
       <b>pcap_pkthdr</b>, a pointer to which is passed to the callback
       routine) bytes of data from the packet.  The <b>struct pcap_pkthdr</b>
       and the packet data are not to be freed by the callback routine,
       and are not guaranteed to be valid after the callback routine
       returns; if the code needs them to be valid after the callback,
       it must make a copy of them.

       The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.
       The format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return
       value of the <b>pcap_datalink</b>(3PCAP) routine when handed the <b>pcap_t</b>
       value also passed to <b>pcap_loop</b>() or <b>pcap_dispatch</b>().
       <i><a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html">https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html</a> </i> lists the values
       <b>pcap_datalink</b>() can return and describes the packet formats that
       correspond to those values.  The value it returns will be valid
       for all packets received unless and until
       <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>(3PCAP) is called; after a successful call to
       <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>(), all subsequent packets will have a link-
       layer header of the type specified by the link-layer header type
       value passed to <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>().

       Do <b>NOT </b>assume that the packets for a given capture or
       ``savefile`` will have any given link-layer header type, such as
       <b>DLT_EN10MB </b>for Ethernet.  For example, the "any" device on Linux
       will have a link-layer header type of <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL </b>or
       <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL2 </b>even if all devices on the system at the time the
       "any" device is opened have some other data link type, such as
       <b>DLT_EN10MB </b>for Ethernet.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_loop</b>() returns <b>0 </b>if <i>cnt</i> is exhausted or if, when reading
       from a ``savefile'', no more packets are available.  It returns
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK </b>if the loop terminated due to a call to
       <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() before any packets were processed,
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED </b>if called on a capture handle that has
       been created but not activated, or <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>if another error
       occurs.  It does <b>not </b>return when live packet buffer timeouts
       occur; instead, it attempts to read more packets.

       <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() returns the number of packets processed on
       success; this can be 0 if no packets were read from a live
       capture (if, for example, they were discarded because they didn't
       pass the packet filter, or if, on platforms that support a packet
       buffer timeout that starts before any packets arrive, the timeout
       expires before any packets arrive, or if the file descriptor for
       the capture device is in non-blocking mode and no packets were
       available to be read) or if no more packets are available in a
       ``savefile.'' It returns <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK </b>if the loop terminated
       due to a call to <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() before any packets were
       processed, <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED </b>if called on a capture handle
       that has been created but not activated, or <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>if another
       error occurs.  <b>If your application uses pcap_breakloop(), make</b>
       <b>sure that you explicitly check for PCAP_ERROR and</b>
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK, rather than just checking for a return value &lt;</b>
       <b>0.</b>

       If <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is returned, <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or
       <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP) may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch
       or display the error text.
</pre> <h2>
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       In libpcap versions before 1.5.0, the behavior when <i>cnt</i> was <b>0 </b>was
       undefined; different platforms and devices behaved differently,
       so code that must work with these versions of libpcap should use
       <b>-1</b>, not <b>0</b>, as the value of <i>cnt</i>.
