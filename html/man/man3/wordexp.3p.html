SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;wordexp.h&gt;

       int wordexp(const char *restrict <i>words</i>, wordexp_t *restrict <i>pwordexp</i>,
           int <i>flags</i>);
       void wordfree(wordexp_t *<i>pwordexp</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>wordexp</i>() function shall perform word expansions as described
       in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.6</i>,
       <i>Word Expansions</i>, subject to quoting as described in the Shell and
       Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.2</i>, <i>Quoting</i>, and place
       the list of expanded words into the structure pointed to by
       <i>pwordexp</i>.

       The <i>words</i> argument is a pointer to a string containing one or
       more words to be expanded. The expansions shall be the same as
       would be performed by the command line interpreter if <i>words</i> were
       the part of a command line representing the arguments to a
       utility. Therefore, the application shall ensure that <i>words</i> does
       not contain an unquoted &lt;newline&gt; character or any of the
       unquoted shell special characters <b>'|'</b>, <b>'&amp;'</b>, <b>';'</b>, <b>'&lt;'</b>, <b>'&gt;' </b>except
       in the context of command substitution as specified in the Shell
       and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.6.3</i>, <i>Command</i>
       <i>Substitution</i>.  It also shall not contain unquoted parentheses or
       braces, except in the context of command or variable
       substitution. The application shall ensure that every member of
       <i>words</i> which it expects to have expanded by <i>wordexp</i>() does not
       contain an unquoted initial comment character. The application
       shall also ensure that any words which it intends to be ignored
       (because they begin or continue a comment) are deleted from
       <i>words</i>.  If the argument <i>words</i> contains an unquoted comment
       character (&lt;number-sign&gt;) that is the beginning of a token,
       <i>wordexp</i>() shall either treat the comment character as a regular
       character, or interpret it as a comment indicator and ignore the
       remainder of <i>words</i>.

       The structure type <b>wordexp_t </b>is defined in the <i>&lt;wordexp.h&gt;</i> header
       and includes at least the following members:
     ┌───────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐
     │ <b>Member Type   </b>│ <b>Member Name  </b>│            <b>Description             </b>│
     ├───────────────┼──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
     │ <b>size_t        </b>│<i>we_wordc</i>      │ Count of words matched by <i>words</i>.   │
     │ <b>char **       </b>│<i>we_wordv</i>      │ Pointer to list of expanded words. │
     │ <b>size_t        </b>│<i>we_offs</i>       │ Slots to reserve at the beginning  │
     │               │              │ of <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i>.             │
     └───────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘

       The <i>wordexp</i>() function shall store the number of generated words
       into <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordc</i> and a pointer to a list of pointers to
       words in <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i>. Each individual field created during
       field splitting (see the Shell and Utilities volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.6.5</i>, <i>Field Splitting</i>) or pathname
       expansion (see the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       <i>Section 2.6.6</i>, <i>Pathname Expansion</i>) shall be a separate word in
       the <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i> list. The words shall be in order as
       described in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       <i>Section 2.6</i>, <i>Word Expansions</i>.  The first pointer after the last
       word pointer shall be a null pointer.  The expansion of special
       parameters described in the Shell and Utilities volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.5.2</i>, <i>Special Parameters</i> is unspecified.

       It is the caller's responsibility to allocate the storage pointed
       to by <i>pwordexp</i>.  The <i>wordexp</i>() function shall allocate other
       space as needed, including memory pointed to by
       <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i>. The <i>wordfree</i>() function frees any memory
       associated with <i>pwordexp</i> from a previous call to <i>wordexp</i>().

       The <i>flags</i> argument is used to control the behavior of <i>wordexp</i>().
       The value of <i>flags</i> is the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of
       the following constants, which are defined in <i>&lt;wordexp.h&gt;</i>:

       WRDE_APPEND   Append words generated to the ones from a previous
                     call to <i>wordexp</i>().

       WRDE_DOOFFS   Make use of <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_offs</i>. If this flag is set,
                     <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_offs</i> is used to specify how many null
                     pointers to add to the beginning of
                     <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i>.  In other words,
                     <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i> shall point to <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_offs</i>
                     null pointers, followed by <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordc</i> word
                     pointers, followed by a null pointer.

       WRDE_NOCMD    If the implementation supports the utilities
                     defined in the Shell and Utilities volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2017, fail if command substitution, as
                     specified in the Shell and Utilities volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.6.3</i>, <i>Command Substitution</i>,
                     is requested.

       WRDE_REUSE    The <i>pwordexp</i> argument was passed to a previous
                     successful call to <i>wordexp</i>(), and has not been
                     passed to <i>wordfree</i>().  The result shall be the same
                     as if the application had called <i>wordfree</i>() and
                     then called <i>wordexp</i>() without WRDE_REUSE.

       WRDE_SHOWERR  Do not redirect <i>stderr</i> to <b>/dev/null</b>.

       WRDE_UNDEF    Report error on an attempt to expand an undefined
                     shell variable.

       The WRDE_APPEND flag can be used to append a new set of words to
       those generated by a previous call to <i>wordexp</i>().  The following
       rules apply to applications when two or more calls to <i>wordexp</i>()
       are made with the same value of <i>pwordexp</i> and without intervening
       calls to <i>wordfree</i>():

        1. The first such call shall not set WRDE_APPEND. All subsequent
           calls shall set it.

        2. All of the calls shall set WRDE_DOOFFS, or all shall not set
           it.

        3. After the second and each subsequent call, <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i>
           shall point to a list containing the following:

            a. Zero or more null pointers, as specified by WRDE_DOOFFS
               and <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_offs</i>

            b. Pointers to the words that were in the <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i>
               list before the call, in the same order as before

            c. Pointers to the new words generated by the latest call,
               in the specified order

        4. The count returned in <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordc</i> shall be the total
           number of words from all of the calls.

        5. The application can change any of the fields after a call to
           <i>wordexp</i>(), but if it does it shall reset them to the original
           value before a subsequent call, using the same <i>pwordexp</i>
           value, to <i>wordfree</i>() or <i>wordexp</i>() with the WRDE_APPEND or
           WRDE_REUSE flag.

       If the implementation supports the utilities defined in the Shell
       and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, and <i>words</i> contains an
       unquoted character—&lt;newline&gt;, <b>'|'</b>, <b>'&amp;'</b>, <b>';'</b>, <b>'&lt;'</b>, <b>'&gt;'</b>, <b>'('</b>, <b>')'</b>,
       <b>'{'</b>, <b>'}'</b>—in an inappropriate context, <i>wordexp</i>() shall fail, and
       the number of expanded words shall be 0.

       Unless WRDE_SHOWERR is set in <i>flags</i>, <i>wordexp</i>() shall redirect
       <i>stderr</i> to <b>/dev/null </b>for any utilities executed as a result of
       command substitution while expanding <i>words</i>.  If WRDE_SHOWERR is
       set, <i>wordexp</i>() may write messages to <i>stderr</i> if syntax errors are
       detected while expanding <i>words</i>, unless the <i>stderr</i> stream has wide
       orientation in which case the behavior is undefined.  It is
       unspecified whether any write errors encountered while outputting
       such messages will affect the <i>stderr</i> error indicator or the value
       of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.

       The application shall ensure that if WRDE_DOOFFS is set, then
       <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_offs</i> has the same value for each <i>wordexp</i>() call and
       <i>wordfree</i>() call using a given <i>pwordexp</i>.

       The results are unspecified if WRDE_APPEND and WRDE_REUSE are
       both specified.

       The following constants are defined as error return values:

       WRDE_BADCHAR  One of the unquoted characters—&lt;newline&gt;, <b>'|'</b>, <b>'&amp;'</b>,
                     <b>';'</b>, <b>'&lt;'</b>, <b>'&gt;'</b>, <b>'('</b>, <b>')'</b>, <b>'{'</b>, <b>'}'</b>—appears in <i>words</i>
                     in an inappropriate context.

       WRDE_BADVAL   Reference to undefined shell variable when
                     WRDE_UNDEF is set in <i>flags</i>.

       WRDE_CMDSUB   Command substitution requested when WRDE_NOCMD was
                     set in <i>flags</i>.

       WRDE_NOSPACE  Attempt to allocate memory failed.

       WRDE_SYNTAX   Shell syntax error, such as unbalanced parentheses
                     or unterminated string.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>wordexp</i>() shall return 0. Otherwise,
       a non-zero value, as described in <i>&lt;wordexp.h&gt;</i>, shall be returned
       to indicate an error. If <i>wordexp</i>() returns the value
       WRDE_NOSPACE, then <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordc</i> and <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i>
       shall be updated to reflect any words that were successfully
       expanded. In other error cases, if the WRDE_APPEND flag was
       specified, <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordc</i> and <i>pwordexp</i>-&gt;<i>we_wordv</i> shall not be
       modified.

       The <i>wordfree</i>() function shall not return a value.

EXAMPLES </h2>

       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>wordexp</i>() function is intended to be used by an application
       that wants to do all of the shell's expansions on a word or words
       obtained from a user. For example, if the application prompts for
       a pathname (or list of pathnames) and then uses <i>wordexp</i>() to
       process the input, the user could respond with anything that
       would be valid as input to the shell.

       The WRDE_NOCMD flag is provided for applications that, for
       security or other reasons, want to prevent a user from executing
       shell commands.  Disallowing unquoted shell special characters
       also prevents unwanted side-effects, such as executing a command
       or writing a file.

       POSIX.1‐2008 does not require the <i>wordexp</i>() function to be
       thread-safe if passed an expression referencing an environment
       variable while any other thread is concurrently modifying any
       environment variable; see <a href="../man1/exec.1p.html">exec(1p)</a>.

       Even though the WRDE_SHOWERR flag allows the implementation to
       write messages to <i>stderr</i> during command substitution or syntax
       errors, this standard does not provide any way to detect write
       failures during the output of such messages.

       Applications which use wide-character output functions with
       <i>stderr</i> should ensure that any calls to <i>wordexp</i>() do not write to
       <i>stderr</i>, by avoiding use of the WRDE_SHOWERR flag.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       This function was included as an alternative to <i>glob</i>().  There
       had been continuing controversy over exactly what features should
       be included in <i>glob</i>().  It is hoped that by providing <i>wordexp</i>()
       (which provides all of the shell word expansions, but which may
       be slow to execute) and <i>glob</i>() (which is faster, but which only
       performs pathname expansion, without tilde or parameter
       expansion) this will satisfy the majority of applications.

       While <i>wordexp</i>() could be implemented entirely as a library
       routine, it is expected that most implementations run a shell in
       a subprocess to do the expansion.

       Two different approaches have been proposed for how the required
       information might be presented to the shell and the results
       returned.  They are presented here as examples.

       One proposal is to extend the <i>echo</i> utility by adding a <b>-q </b>option.
       This option would cause <i>echo</i> to add a &lt;backslash&gt; before each
       &lt;backslash&gt; and &lt;blank&gt; that occurs within an argument. The
       <i>wordexp</i>() function could then invoke the shell as follows:

           (void) strcpy(buffer, "echo -q");
           (void) strcat(buffer, <i>words</i>);
           if ((flags &amp; WRDE_SHOWERR) == 0)
               (void) strcat(buffer, "2&gt;/dev/null");
           f = popen(buffer, "r");

       The <i>wordexp</i>() function would read the resulting output, remove
       unquoted &lt;backslash&gt; characters, and break into words at unquoted
       &lt;blank&gt; characters. If the WRDE_NOCMD flag was set, <i>wordexp</i>()
       would have to scan <i>words</i> before starting the subshell to make
       sure that there would be no command substitution. In any case, it
       would have to scan <i>words</i> for unquoted special characters.

       Another proposal is to add the following options to <i>sh</i>:

       <b>-w </b><i>wordlist</i>
             This option provides a wordlist expansion service to
             applications. The words in <i>wordlist</i> shall be expanded and
             the following written to standard output:

              1. The count of the number of words after expansion, in
                 decimal, followed by a null byte

              2. The number of bytes needed to represent the expanded
                 words (not including null separators), in decimal,
                 followed by a null byte

              3. The expanded words, each terminated by a null byte

             If an error is encountered during word expansion, <i>sh</i> exits
             with a non-zero status after writing the former to report
             any words successfully expanded

       <b>-P    </b>Run in ``protected'' mode. If specified with the <b>-w </b>option,
             no command substitution shall be performed.

       With these options, <i>wordexp</i>() could be implemented fairly simply
       by creating a subprocess using <i>fork</i>() and executing <i>sh</i> using the
       line:

           execl(&lt;<i>shell path</i>&gt;, "sh", "-P", "-w", <i>words</i>, (char *)0);

       after directing standard error to <b>/dev/null</b>.

       It seemed objectionable for a library routine to write messages
       to standard error, unless explicitly requested, so <i>wordexp</i>() is
       required to redirect standard error to <b>/dev/null </b>to ensure that
       no messages are generated, even for commands executed for command
       substitution. The WRDE_SHOWERR flag can be specified to request
       that error messages be written.

       The WRDE_REUSE flag allows the implementation to avoid the
       expense of freeing and reallocating memory, if that is possible.
       A minimal implementation can call <i>wordfree</i>() when WRDE_REUSE is
       set.
