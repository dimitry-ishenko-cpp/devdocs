PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sigemptyset — initialize and empty a signal set
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int sigemptyset(sigset_t *<i>set</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigemptyset</i>() function initializes the signal set pointed to
       by <i>set</i>, such that all signals defined in POSIX.1‐2008 are
       excluded.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>sigemptyset</i>() shall return 0;
       otherwise, it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>

       No errors are defined.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The implementation of the <i>sigemptyset</i>() (or <i>sigfillset</i>())
       function could quite trivially clear (or set) all the bits in the
       signal set. Alternatively, it would be reasonable to initialize
       part of the structure, such as a version field, to permit binary-
       compatibility between releases where the size of the set varies.
       For such reasons, either <i>sigemptyset</i>() or <i>sigfillset</i>() must be
       called prior to any other use of the signal set, even if such use
       is read-only (for example, as an argument to <i>sigpending</i>()).  This
       function is not intended for dynamic allocation.

       The <i>sigfillset</i>() and <i>sigemptyset</i>() functions require that the
       resulting signal set include (or exclude) all the signals defined
       in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. Although it is outside the scope
       of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to place this requirement on
       signals that are implemented as extensions, it is recommended
       that implementation-defined signals also be affected by these
       functions. However, there may be a good reason for a particular
       signal not to be affected. For example, blocking or ignoring an
       implementation-defined signal may have undesirable side-effects,
       whereas the default action for that signal is harmless. In such a
       case, it would be preferable for such a signal to be excluded
       from the signal set returned by <i>sigfillset</i>().

       In early proposals there was no distinction between invalid and
       unsupported signals (the names of optional signals that were not
       supported by an implementation were not defined by that
       implementation). The <b>[EINVAL] </b>error was thus specified as a
       required error for invalid signals. With that distinction, it is
       not necessary to require implementations of these functions to
       determine whether an optional signal is actually supported, as
       that could have a significant performance impact for little
       value. The error could have been required for invalid signals and
       optional for unsupported signals, but this seemed unnecessarily
       complex. Thus, the error is optional in both cases.
