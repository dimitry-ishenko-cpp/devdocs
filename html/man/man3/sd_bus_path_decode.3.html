DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_bus_path_encode() </b>and <b>sd_bus_path_decode() </b>convert external
       identifier strings into object paths and back. These functions
       are useful to map application-specific string identifiers of any
       kind into bus object paths in a simple, reversible and safe way.

       <b>sd_bus_path_encode() </b>takes a bus path prefix and an external
       identifier string as arguments, plus a place to store the
       returned bus path string. The bus path prefix must be a valid bus
       path, starting with a slash "/", and not ending in one. The
       external identifier string may be in any format, may be the empty
       string, and has no restrictions on the charset — however, it must
       always be <b>NUL</b>-terminated. The returned string will be the
       concatenation of the bus path prefix plus an escaped version of
       the external identifier string. This operation may be reversed
       with <b>sd_bus_path_decode()</b>. It is recommended to only use external
       identifiers that generally require little escaping to be turned
       into valid bus path identifiers (for example, by sticking to a
       7-bit ASCII character set), in order to ensure the resulting bus
       path is still short and easily processed.

       <b>sd_bus_path_decode() </b>reverses the operation of
       <b>sd_bus_path_encode() </b>and thus regenerates an external identifier
       string from a bus path. It takes a bus path and a prefix string,
       plus a place to store the returned external identifier string. If
       the bus path does not start with the specified prefix, 0 is
       returned and the returned string is set to <b>NULL</b>. Otherwise, the
       string following the prefix is unescaped and returned in the
       external identifier string.

       The escaping used will replace all characters which are invalid
       in a bus object path by "_", followed by a hexadecimal value. As
       a special case, the empty string will be replaced by a lone "_".

       <b>sd_bus_path_encode_many() </b>works like its counterpart
       <b>sd_bus_path_encode()</b>, but takes a path template as argument and
       encodes multiple labels according to its embedded directives. For
       each "%" character found in the template, the caller must provide
       a string via varargs, which will be encoded and embedded at the
       position of the "%" character. Any other character in the
       template is copied verbatim into the encoded path.

       <b>sd_bus_path_decode_many() </b>does the reverse of
       <b>sd_bus_path_encode_many()</b>. It decodes the passed object path
       according to the given path template. For each "%" character in
       the template, the caller must provide an output storage ("char
       **") via varargs. The decoded label will be stored there. Each
       "%" character will only match the current label. It will never
       match across labels. Furthermore, only a single directive is
       allowed per label. If <b>NULL </b>is passed as output storage, the label
       is verified but not returned to the caller.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>sd_bus_path_encode() </b>returns positive or 0, and a
       valid bus path in the return argument. On success,
       <b>sd_bus_path_decode() </b>returns a positive value if the prefixed
       matched, or 0 if it did not. If the prefix matched, the external
       identifier is returned in the return parameter. If it did not
       match, <b>NULL </b>is returned in the return parameter. On failure, a
       negative errno-style error number is returned by either function.
       The returned strings must be <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a>'d by the caller.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
</pre> <h2>
