NAME </h2>

       gnutls_reauth - API function
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int gnutls_reauth(gnutls_session_t </b><i>session</i><b>, unsigned int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a <b>gnutls_session_t </b>type.

       unsigned int flags
                   must be zero
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This function performs the post-handshake authentication for TLS
       1.3. The post-handshake authentication is initiated by the server
       by calling this function. Clients respond when
       <b>GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST </b>has been seen while receiving data.

       The non-fatal errors expected by this function are:
       <b>GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED</b>, <b>GNUTLS_E_AGAIN</b>, as well as
       <b>GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA </b>when called on server side.

       The former two interrupt the authentication procedure due to the
       transport layer being interrupted, and the latter because there
       were pending data prior to peer initiating the re-authentication.
       The server should read/process that data as unauthenticated and
       retry calling <b>gnutls_reauth()</b>.

       When this function is called under TLS1.2 or earlier or the peer
       didn't advertise post-handshake auth, it always fails with
       <b>GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST</b>. The verification of the received peers
       certificate is delegated to the session or credentials
       verification callbacks. A server can check whether post handshake
       authentication is supported by the client by checking the session
       flags with <b>gnutls_session_get_flags()</b>.

       Prior to calling this function in server side, the function
       <b>gnutls_certificate_server_set_request() </b>must be called setting
       expectations for the received certificate (request or require).
       If none are set this function will return with
       <b>GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST</b>.

       Note that post handshake authentication is available irrespective
       of the initial negotiation type (PSK or certificate). In all
       cases however, certificate credentials must be set to the session
       prior to calling this function.

RETURNS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS </b>on a successful authentication, otherwise a
       negative error code.
