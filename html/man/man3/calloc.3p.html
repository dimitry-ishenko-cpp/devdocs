PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       calloc — a memory allocator
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       void *calloc(size_t <i>nelem</i>, size_t <i>elsize</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>calloc</i>() function shall allocate unused space for an array of
       <i>nelem</i> elements each of whose size in bytes is <i>elsize</i>.  The space
       shall be initialized to all bits 0.

       The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls
       to <i>calloc</i>() is unspecified. The pointer returned if the
       allocation succeeds shall be suitably aligned so that it may be
       assigned to a pointer to any type of object and then used to
       access such an object or an array of such objects in the space
       allocated (until the space is explicitly freed or reallocated).
       Each such allocation shall yield a pointer to an object disjoint
       from any other object. The pointer returned shall point to the
       start (lowest byte address) of the allocated space. If the space
       cannot be allocated, a null pointer shall be returned. If the
       size of the space requested is 0, the behavior is implementation-
       defined: either a null pointer shall be returned, or the behavior
       shall be as if the size were some non-zero value, except that the
       behavior is undefined if the returned pointer is used to access
       an object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion with both <i>nelem</i> and <i>elsize</i> non-zero,
       <i>calloc</i>() shall return a pointer to the allocated space. If either
       <i>nelem</i> or <i>elsize</i> is 0, then either:

        *  A null pointer shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> may be set to an
           implementation-defined value, or

        *  A pointer to the allocated space shall be returned. The
           application shall ensure that the pointer is not used to
           access an object.

       Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>calloc</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory is available.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       There is now no requirement for the implementation to support the
       inclusion of <i>&lt;malloc.h&gt;</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
