</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>acl_calc_mask </b>— calculate the file group class mask
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;<i>sys/types.h</i>&gt; &lt;<i>sys/acl.h</i>&gt; <i>int</i> <b>acl_calc_mask</b>(<i>acl_t *acl_p</i>)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>acl_calc_mask</b>() function calculates and sets the permissions
       associated with the ACL_MASK ACL entry of the ACL referred to by
       <i>acl_p</i>.  The value of the new permissions is the union of the
       permissions granted by all entries of tag type ACL_GROUP,
       ACL_GROUP_OBJ, or ACL_USER.  If the ACL referred to by <i>acl_p</i>
       already contains an ACL_MASK entry, its permissions are
       overwritten; if it does not contain an ACL_MASK entry, one is
       added.

       If the ACL referred to by <i>acl_p</i> does not contain enough space for
       the new ACL entry, then additional working storage may be
       allocated. If the working storage cannot be increased in the
       current location, then it may be relocated and the previous
       working storage is released and a pointer to the new working
       storage is returned via <i>acl_p</i>.

       The order of existing entries in the ACL is undefined after this
       function.

       Any existing ACL entry descriptors that refer to entries in the
       ACL continue to refer to those entries. Any existing ACL pointers
       that refer to the ACL referred to by <i>acl_p</i> continue to refer to
       the ACL.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>acl_calc_mask</b>() function returns the value 0 if successful;
       otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If any of the following conditions occur, the <b>acl_calc_mask</b>()
       function returns <b>-1 </b>and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the corresponding value:

       [EINVAL]           The argument <i>acl</i> is not a valid pointer to an
                          ACL.

       [ENOMEM]           The <b>acl_calc_mask</b>() function is unable to
                          allocate the memory required for an ACL_MASK
                          ACL entry.
