NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flockfile, ftrylockfile, funlockfile — stdio locking functions
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       void flockfile(FILE *<i>file</i>);
       int ftrylockfile(FILE *<i>file</i>);
       void funlockfile(FILE *<i>file</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall provide for explicit application-level
       locking of stdio (<b>FILE *</b>) objects. These functions can be used by
       a thread to delineate a sequence of I/O statements that are
       executed as a unit.

       The <i>flockfile</i>() function shall acquire for a thread ownership of
       a (<b>FILE *</b>) object.

       The <i>ftrylockfile</i>() function shall acquire for a thread ownership
       of a (<b>FILE *</b>) object if the object is available; <i>ftrylockfile</i>()
       is a non-blocking version of <i>flockfile</i>().

       The <i>funlockfile</i>() function shall relinquish the ownership granted
       to the thread.  The behavior is undefined if a thread other than
       the current owner calls the <i>funlockfile</i>() function.

       The functions shall behave as if there is a lock count associated
       with each (<b>FILE *</b>) object. This count is implicitly initialized
       to zero when the (<b>FILE *</b>) object is created. The (<b>FILE *</b>) object
       is unlocked when the count is zero. When the count is positive, a
       single thread owns the (<b>FILE *</b>) object. When the <i>flockfile</i>()
       function is called, if the count is zero or if the count is
       positive and the caller owns the (<b>FILE *</b>) object, the count shall
       be incremented. Otherwise, the calling thread shall be suspended,
       waiting for the count to return to zero. Each call to
       <i>funlockfile</i>() shall decrement the count. This allows matching
       calls to <i>flockfile</i>() (or successful calls to <i>ftrylockfile</i>()) and
       <i>funlockfile</i>() to be nested.

       All functions that reference (<b>FILE *</b>) objects, except those with
       names ending in <i>_unlocked</i>, shall behave as if they use
       <i>flockfile</i>() and <i>funlockfile</i>() internally to obtain ownership of
       these (<b>FILE *</b>) objects.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       None for <i>flockfile</i>() and <i>funlockfile</i>().

       The <i>ftrylockfile</i>() function shall return zero for success and
       non-zero to indicate that the lock cannot be acquired.

       No errors are defined.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications using these functions may be subject to priority
       inversion, as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.291</i>, <i>Priority Inversion</i>.

       A call to <i>exit</i>() can block until locked streams are unlocked
       because a thread having ownership of a (<b>FILE</b>*) object blocks all
       function calls that reference that (<b>FILE</b>*) object (except those
       with names ending in _unlocked) from other threads, including
       calls to <i>exit</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>flockfile</i>() and <i>funlockfile</i>() functions provide an orthogonal
       mutual-exclusion lock for each <b>FILE</b>.  The <i>ftrylockfile</i>() function
       provides a non-blocking attempt to acquire a file lock, analogous
       to <i>pthread_mutex_trylock</i>().

       These locks behave as if they are the same as those used
       internally by <i>stdio</i> for thread-safety.  This both provides
       thread-safety of these functions without requiring a second level
       of internal locking and allows functions in <i>stdio</i> to be
       implemented in terms of other <i>stdio</i> functions.

       Application developers and implementors should be aware that
       there are potential deadlock problems on <b>FILE </b>objects. For
       example, the line-buffered flushing semantics of <i>stdio</i> (requested
       via {_IOLBF}) require that certain input operations sometimes
       cause the buffered contents of implementation-defined line-
       buffered output streams to be flushed. If two threads each hold
       the lock on the other's <b>FILE</b>, deadlock ensues. This type of
       deadlock can be avoided by acquiring <b>FILE </b>locks in a consistent
       order. In particular, the line-buffered output stream deadlock
       can typically be avoided by acquiring locks on input streams
       before locks on output streams if a thread would be acquiring
       both.

       In summary, threads sharing <i>stdio</i> streams with other threads can
       use <i>flockfile</i>() and <i>funlockfile</i>() to cause sequences of I/O
       performed by a single thread to be kept bundled. The only case
       where the use of <i>flockfile</i>() and <i>funlockfile</i>() is required is to
       provide a scope protecting uses of the <i>*_unlocked</i>
       functions/macros. This moves the cost/performance tradeoff to the
       optimal point.
