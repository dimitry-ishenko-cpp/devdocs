       getrlimit, setrlimit — control maximum resource consumption
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;

       int getrlimit(int <i>resource</i>, struct rlimit *<i>rlp</i>);
       int setrlimit(int <i>resource</i>, const struct rlimit *<i>rlp</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getrlimit</i>() function shall get, and the <i>setrlimit</i>() function
       shall set, limits on the consumption of a variety of resources.

       Each call to either <i>getrlimit</i>() or <i>setrlimit</i>() identifies a
       specific resource to be operated upon as well as a resource
       limit. A resource limit is represented by an <b>rlimit </b>structure.
       The <i>rlim_cur</i> member specifies the current or soft limit and the
       <i>rlim_max</i> member specifies the maximum or hard limit. Soft limits
       may be changed by a process to any value that is less than or
       equal to the hard limit. A process may (irreversibly) lower its
       hard limit to any value that is greater than or equal to the soft
       limit. Only a process with appropriate privileges can raise a
       hard limit. Both hard and soft limits can be changed in a single
       call to <i>setrlimit</i>() subject to the constraints described above.

       The value RLIM_INFINITY, defined in <i>&lt;sys/resource.h&gt;</i>, shall be
       considered to be larger than any other limit value. If a call to
       <i>getrlimit</i>() returns RLIM_INFINITY for a resource, it means the
       implementation shall not enforce limits on that resource.
       Specifying RLIM_INFINITY as any resource limit value on a
       successful call to <i>setrlimit</i>() shall inhibit enforcement of that
       resource limit.

       The following resources are defined:

       RLIMIT_CORE   This is the maximum size of a <b>core </b>file, in bytes,
                     that may be created by a process. A limit of 0
                     shall prevent the creation of a <b>core </b>file. If this
                     limit is exceeded, the writing of a <b>core </b>file shall
                     terminate at this size.

       RLIMIT_CPU    This is the maximum amount of CPU time, in seconds,
                     used by a process.  If this limit is exceeded,
                     SIGXCPU shall be generated for the process. If the
                     process is catching or ignoring SIGXCPU, or all
                     threads belonging to that process are blocking
                     SIGXCPU, the behavior is unspecified.

       RLIMIT_DATA   This is the maximum size of a data segment of the
                     process, in bytes.  If this limit is exceeded, the
                     <i>malloc</i>() function shall fail with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to
                     <b>[ENOMEM]</b>.

       RLIMIT_FSIZE  This is the maximum size of a file, in bytes, that
                     may be created by a process. If a write or truncate
                     operation would cause this limit to be exceeded,
                     SIGXFSZ shall be generated for the thread. If the
                     thread is blocking, or the process is catching or
                     ignoring SIGXFSZ, continued attempts to increase
                     the size of a file from end-of-file to beyond the
                     limit shall fail with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EFBIG]</b>.

       RLIMIT_NOFILE This is a number one greater than the maximum value
                     that the system may assign to a newly-created
                     descriptor. If this limit is exceeded, functions
                     that allocate a file descriptor shall fail with
                     <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EMFILE]</b>.  This limit constrains the
                     number of file descriptors that a process may
                     allocate.

       RLIMIT_STACK  This is the maximum size of the initial thread's
                     stack, in bytes. The implementation does not
                     automatically grow the stack beyond this limit. If
                     this limit is exceeded, SIGSEGV shall be generated
                     for the thread. If the thread is blocking SIGSEGV,
                     or the process is ignoring or catching SIGSEGV and
                     has not made arrangements to use an alternate
                     stack, the disposition of SIGSEGV shall be set to
                     SIG_DFL before it is generated.

       RLIMIT_AS     This is the maximum size of total available memory
                     of the process, in bytes. If this limit is
                     exceeded, the <i>malloc</i>() and <i>mmap</i>() functions shall
                     fail with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[ENOMEM]</b>.  In addition, the
                     automatic stack growth fails with the effects
                     outlined above.

       When using the <i>getrlimit</i>() function, if a resource limit can be
       represented correctly in an object of type <b>rlim_t</b>, then its
       representation is returned; otherwise, if the value of the
       resource limit is equal to that of the corresponding saved hard
       limit, the value returned shall be RLIM_SAVED_MAX; otherwise, the
       value returned shall be RLIM_SAVED_CUR.

       When using the <i>setrlimit</i>() function, if the requested new limit
       is RLIM_INFINITY, the new limit shall be ``no limit''; otherwise,
       if the requested new limit is RLIM_SAVED_MAX, the new limit shall
       be the corresponding saved hard limit; otherwise, if the
       requested new limit is RLIM_SAVED_CUR, the new limit shall be the
       corresponding saved soft limit; otherwise, the new limit shall be
       the requested value. In addition, if the corresponding saved
       limit can be represented correctly in an object of type <b>rlim_t</b>
       then it shall be overwritten with the new limit.

       The result of setting a limit to RLIM_SAVED_MAX or RLIM_SAVED_CUR
       is unspecified unless a previous call to <i>getrlimit</i>() returned
       that value as the soft or hard limit for the corresponding
       resource limit.

       The determination of whether a limit can be correctly represented
       in an object of type <b>rlim_t </b>is implementation-defined. For
       example, some implementations permit a limit whose value is
       greater than RLIM_INFINITY and others do not.

       The <i>exec</i> family of functions shall cause resource limits to be
       saved.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>getrlimit</i>() and <i>setrlimit</i>() shall
       return 0. Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getrlimit</i>() and <i>setrlimit</i>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>An invalid <i>resource</i> was specified; or in a <i>setrlimit</i>()
              call, the new <i>rlim_cur</i> exceeds the new <i>rlim_max</i>.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The limit specified to <i>setrlimit</i>() would have raised the
              maximum limit value, and the calling process does not have
              appropriate privileges.

       The <i>setrlimit</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The limit specified cannot be lowered because current
              usage is already higher than the limit.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If a process attempts to set the hard limit or soft limit for
       RLIMIT_NOFILE to less than the value of {_POSIX_OPEN_MAX} from
       <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i>, unexpected behavior may occur.

       If a process attempts to set the hard limit or soft limit for
       RLIMIT_NOFILE to less than the highest currently open file
       descriptor +1, unexpected behavior may occur.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       It should be noted that RLIMIT_STACK applies ``at least'' to the
       stack of the initial thread in the process, and not to the sum of
       all the stacks in the process, as that would be very limiting
       unless the value is so big as to provide no value at all with a
       single thread.
