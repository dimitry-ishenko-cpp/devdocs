       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       open_memstream, open_wmemstream — open a dynamic memory buffer
       stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       FILE *open_memstream(char **<i>bufp</i>, size_t *<i>sizep</i>);

       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       FILE *open_wmemstream(wchar_t **<i>bufp</i>, size_t *<i>sizep</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>open_memstream</i>() and <i>open_wmemstream</i>() functions shall create
       an I/O stream associated with a dynamically allocated memory
       buffer. The stream shall be opened for writing and shall be
       seekable.

       The stream associated with a call to <i>open_memstream</i>() shall be
       byte-oriented.

       The stream associated with a call to <i>open_wmemstream</i>() shall be
       wide-oriented.

       The stream shall maintain a current position in the allocated
       buffer and a current buffer length. The position shall be
       initially set to zero (the start of the buffer). Each write to
       the stream shall start at the current position and move this
       position by the number of successfully written bytes for
       <i>open_memstream</i>() or the number of successfully written wide
       characters for <i>open_wmemstream</i>().  The length shall be initially
       set to zero. If a write moves the position to a value larger than
       the current length, the current length shall be set to this
       position. In this case a null character for <i>open_memstream</i>() or a
       null wide character for <i>open_wmemstream</i>() shall be appended to
       the current buffer. For both functions the terminating null is
       not included in the calculation of the buffer length.

       After a successful <i>fflush</i>() or <i>fclose</i>(), the pointer referenced
       by <i>bufp</i> shall contain the address of the buffer, and the variable
       pointed to by <i>sizep</i> shall contain the smaller of the current
       buffer length and the number of bytes for <i>open_memstream</i>(), or
       the number of wide characters for <i>open_wmemstream</i>(), between the
       beginning of the buffer and the current file position indicator.

       After a successful <i>fflush</i>() the pointer referenced by <i>bufp</i> and
       the variable referenced by <i>sizep</i> remain valid only until the next
       write operation on the stream or a call to <i>fclose</i>().

       After a successful <i>fclose</i>(), the pointer referenced by <i>bufp</i> can
       be passed to <i>free</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a
       pointer to the object controlling the stream. Otherwise, a null
       pointer shall be returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EMFILE </b>{STREAM_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>bufp</i> or <i>sizep</i> are NULL.

       <b>EMFILE </b>{FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Memory for the stream or the buffer could not be
              allocated.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

           int
           main (void)
           {
               FILE *stream;
               char *buf;
               size_t len;
               off_t eob;

               stream = open_memstream (&amp;buf, &amp;len);
               if (stream == NULL)
                   /* handle error */ ;
               fprintf (stream, "hello my world");
               fflush (stream);
               printf ("buf=%s, len=%zu\n", buf, len);
               eob = ftello(stream);
               fseeko (stream, 0, SEEK_SET);
               fprintf (stream, "good-bye");
               fseeko (stream, eob, SEEK_SET);
               fclose (stream);
               printf ("buf=%s, len=%zu\n", buf, len);
               free (buf);
               return 0;
           }

       This program produces the following output:

           buf=hello my world, len=14
           buf=good-bye world, len=14
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The buffer created by these functions should be freed by the
       application after closing the stream, by means of a call to
       <i>free</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are similar to <i>fmemopen</i>() except that the memory
       is always allocated dynamically by the function, and the stream
       is opened only for output.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
