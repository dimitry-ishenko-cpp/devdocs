DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The              <i>posix_trace_attr_getinherited</i>()              and
       <i>posix_trace_attr_setinherited</i>()  functions,  respectively,  shall
       get  and  set  the  inheritance  policy stored in the <i>inheritance</i>
       attribute for traced processes  across  the  <i>fork</i>()  and  <i>spawn</i>()
       operations.  The  <i>inheritance</i>  attribute of the attributes object
       pointed to by the <i>attr</i> argument  shall  be  set  to  one  of  the
       following  values  defined by manifest constants in the <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i>
       header:

       POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD
             After a <i>fork</i>() or <i>spawn</i>() operation, the child shall not be
             traced, and tracing of the parent shall continue.

       POSIX_TRACE_INHERITED
             After a <i>fork</i>() or <i>spawn</i>() operation, if the parent is being
             traced, its child shall be concurrently traced using the
             same trace stream.

       The default value for the <i>inheritance</i> attribute is
       POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD.

       The <i>posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy</i>() and
       <i>posix_trace_attr_setlogfullpolicy</i>() functions, respectively,
       shall get and set the trace log full policy stored in the <i>log-</i>
       <i>full-policy</i> attribute of the attributes object pointed to by the
       <i>attr</i> argument.

       The <i>log-full-policy</i> attribute shall be set to one of the
       following values defined by manifest constants in the <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i>
       header:

       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP
             The trace log shall loop until the associated trace stream
             is stopped.  This policy means that when the trace log gets
             full, the file system shall reuse the resources allocated
             to the oldest trace events that were recorded. In this way,
             the trace log will always contain the most recent trace
             events flushed.

       POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL
             The trace stream shall be flushed to the trace log until
             the trace log is full. This condition can be deduced from
             the <i>posix_log_full_status</i> member status (see the
             <b>posix_trace_status_info </b>structure defined in <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i>).
             The last recorded trace event shall be the POSIX_TRACE_STOP
             trace event.

       POSIX_TRACE_APPEND
             The associated trace stream shall be flushed to the trace
             log without log size limitation. If the application
             specifies POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the implementation shall
             ignore the <i>log-max-size</i> attribute.

       The default value for the <i>log-full-policy</i> attribute is
       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP.

       The <i>posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy</i>() and
       <i>posix_trace_attr_setstreamfullpolicy</i>() functions, respectively,
       shall get and set the trace stream full policy stored in the
       <i>stream-full-policy</i> attribute of the attributes object pointed to
       by the <i>attr</i> argument.

       The <i>stream-full-policy</i> attribute shall be set to one of the
       following values defined by manifest constants in the <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i>
       header:

       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP
             The trace stream shall loop until explicitly stopped by the
             <i>posix_trace_stop</i>() function. This policy means that when
             the trace stream is full, the trace system shall reuse the
             resources allocated to the oldest trace events recorded. In
             this way, the trace stream will always contain the most
             recent trace events recorded.

       POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL
             The trace stream will run until the trace stream resources
             are exhausted. Then the trace stream will stop. This
             condition can be deduced from <i>posix_stream_status</i> and
             <i>posix_stream_full_status</i> (see the <b>posix_trace_status_info</b>
             structure defined in <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i>).  When this trace stream is
             read, a POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace event shall be reported
             after reporting the last recorded trace event.  The trace
             system shall reuse the resources allocated to any trace
             events already reported—see the
             <i>posix_trace_getnext_event</i>(),
             <i>posix_trace_trygetnext_event</i>(), and
             <i>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</i>() functions—or already
             flushed for an active trace stream with log if the Trace
             Log option is supported; see the <i>posix_trace_flush</i>()
             function. The trace system shall restart the trace stream
             when it is empty and may restart it sooner. A
             POSIX_TRACE_START trace event shall be reported before
             reporting the next recorded trace event.

       POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH
             If the Trace Log option is supported, this policy is
             identical to the POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL trace stream full
             policy except that the trace stream shall be flushed
             regularly as if <i>posix_trace_flush</i>() had been explicitly
             called. Defining this policy for an active trace stream
             without log shall be invalid.

       The default value for the <i>stream-full-policy</i> attribute shall be
       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP for an active trace stream without log.

       If the Trace Log option is supported, the default value for the
       <i>stream-full-policy</i> attribute shall be POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH for an
       active trace stream with log.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value
       of zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error
       number.

       If successful, the <i>posix_trace_attr_getinherited</i>() function shall
       store the <i>inheritance</i> attribute value in the object pointed to by
       <i>inheritancepolicy</i>.  Otherwise, the content of this object is
       undefined.

       If successful, the <i>posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy</i>() function
       shall store the <i>log-full-policy</i> attribute value in the object
       pointed to by <i>logpolicy</i>.  Otherwise, the content of this object
       is undefined.

       If successful, the <i>posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy</i>()
       function shall store the <i>stream-full-policy</i> attribute value in
       the object pointed to by <i>streampolicy</i>.  Otherwise, the content of
       this object is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
