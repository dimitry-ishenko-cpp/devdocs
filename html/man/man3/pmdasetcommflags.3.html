DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaInit  </b>initializes  a PMDA so that it is ready to receive PDUs
       from <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  The function expects as arguments the instance do‐
       main table (<i>indoms</i>) and the metric  description  table  (<i>metrics</i>)
       that  are  initialized  by  the  PMDA.  The arguments <i>nindoms</i> and
       <i>nmetrics</i> should be set to the number of instances and metrics  in
       the tables, respectively.

       Much of the <b>pmdaInterface </b>structure can be automatically initial‐
       ized  with <a href="pmdadaemon.3.html">pmdaDaemon(3)</a>, <a href="pmdagetopt.3.html">pmdaGetOpt(3)</a> and <a href="pmdadso.3.html">pmdaDSO(3)</a>.  <b>pmdaInit</b>
       completes the PMDA initialization phase  with  three  operations.
       The  first  operation adds the domain and instance numbers to the
       instance and metric tables.  Singular metrics (metrics without an
       instance domain) should have the  instance  domain  <b>PM_INDOM_NULL</b>
       set   in   the   <i>indom</i>   field   of  the  <b>pmDesc  </b>structure  (see
       <a href="pmlookupdesc.3.html">pmLookupDesc(3)</a>).  Metrics with an  instance  domain  should  set
       this  field to be the serial number of the instance domain in the
       <i>indoms</i> table.

       The instance domain table may be made empty by setting <i>indoms</i>  to
       NULL  and <i>nindoms</i> to 0.  This allows the caller to provide custom
       Fetch and Instance callback functions.  The metric table  may  be
       made  empty  by  setting <i>metrics</i> to NULL and <i>nmetrics</i> to 0.  This
       allows the caller to provide custom Fetch and Descriptor callback
       functions.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       For example, a PMDA has three metrics: A, B and C,  and  two  in‐
       stance  domains  X and Y, with two instances in each instance do‐
       main.  The instance domain and metrics description  tables  could
       be defined as:

            static pmdaInstid _X[] = {
                { 0, "X1" }, { 1, "X2" }
            };

            static pmdaInstid _Y[] = {
                { 0, "Y1" }, { 1, "Y2" }
            };

            static pmdaIndom indomtab[] = {
            #define X_INDOM 0
                { X_INDOM, 2, _X },
            #define Y_INDOM 3
                { Y_INDOM, 2, _Y }
            };

            static pmdaMetric metrictab[] = {
            /* A */
                { (void *)0,
                  { PMDA_PMID(0,0), PM_TYPE_U32, PM_INDOM_NULL, PM_SEM_INSTANT,
                    { 0,0,0,0,0,0} }, },
            /* B */
                { (void *)0,
                  { PMDA_PMID(0,1), PM_TYPE_U32, X_INDOM, PM_SEM_INSTANT,
                    { 0,0,0,0,0,0} }, },
            /* C */
                { (void *)0,
                  { PMDA_PMID(0,2), PM_TYPE_DOUBLE, Y_INDOM, PM_SEM_INSTANT,
                    { 0,1,0,0,PM_TIME_SEC,0} }, }
            };

       The  metric  description  table defines metric A with no instance
       domain, metric B with instance domain X and  metric  C  with  in‐
       stance  domain Y.  Metric C has units of seconds, while the other
       metrics have no units  (simple  counters).   <b>pmdaInit  </b>will  take
       these  structures  and  assign  the  <a href="pmda.3.html">PMDA(3)</a> domain number to the
       <i>it_indom</i> field of each instance domain.  This identifier also re‐
       places the <i>indom</i> field of all metrics which  have  that  instance
       domain, so that they are correctly associated.

       The  second  stage opens the help text file, if one was specified
       with the <b>-h </b>command line option (see <a href="pmdagetopt.3.html">pmdaGetOpt(3)</a>) or as a <i>help‐</i>
       <i>text</i> argument to <a href="pmdadso.3.html">pmdaDSO(3)</a> or <a href="pmdadaemon.3.html">pmdaDaemon(3)</a>.

       The final stage involves preparing the metric table lookup strat‐
       egy.
</pre> <h2>
METRIC LOOKUP </h2>
<pre>
       When fetch and descriptor requests are made of the PMDA, each re‐
       quested PMID must be mapped to a metric table entry.   There  are
       currently  three strategies for performing this mapping - direct,
       linear and hashed.  Each has its own set of tradeoffs and an  ap‐
       propriate strategy should be selected for each PMDA.

       If all of the metric PMID item numbers correspond to the position
       in  the  <i>metrics</i> table, then direct mapping is used.  This is the
       most efficient of the lookup functions as it  involves  a  direct
       array  index (no additional memory is required nor any additional
       processing overhead).  If the PMID numbering requirement  is  met
       by  the  PMDA,  it is ideal.  This strategy can be explicitly re‐
       quested by calling <b>pmdaSetFlags</b>(<i>pmda</i>,  <i>PMDA_EXT_FLAG_DIRECT</i>)  be‐
       fore  calling  <b>pmdaInit</b>.   In this case, if the direct mapping is
       not possible (e.g. due to an oversight on the part  of  the  PMDA
       developer),  a  warning is logged and the linear strategy is used
       instead.

       The second strategy (linear search) is the default, when a direct
       mapping cannot be established.  This provides greater flexibility
       in the PMID numbering scheme, as the PMDA  item  numbers  do  not
       have  to  be  unique (hence, the PMID cluster numbers can be used
       more freely, which is often extremely convenient for the PMDA de‐
       veloper).  However, lookup involves a linear walk from the  start
       of  the metric table until a matching PMID is found, for each re‐
       quested PMID in a request.

       The third strategy (hash lookup) can be requested by calling  <b>pm‐</b>
       <b>daSetFlags</b>(<i>pmda</i>,  <i>PMDA_EXT_FLAG_HASHED</i>)  before calling <b>pmdaInit</b>.
       This strategy is most useful for PMDAs with large numbers of met‐
       rics (many hundreds, or thousands).  Such PMDAs will  almost  al‐
       ways  use  the  cluster  numbering  scheme,  so the direct lookup
       scheme becomes inappropriate.  They may also be prepared to  sac‐
       rifice a small amount of additional memory for a hash table, map‐
       ping  PMID  to metric table offsets, to speed up lookups in their
       vast metric tables.

       This final strategy can also be used by PMDAs serving up  dynami‐
       cally  numbered  metrics.  For this case, the <b>pmdaRehash </b>function
       should be used to replace the metric table when new  metrics  be‐
       come  available,  or existing metrics are removed.  The PMID hash
       mapping will be recomputed at the same time that the  new  metric
       table is installed.
</pre> <h2>
METRIC CHANGES </h2>
<pre>
       It should be well understood by PMDA authors that metric metadata
       for  individual  metrics  is  fixed,  and  ideally would not ever
       change.  In the situation where metadata is incorrect and is  up‐
       dated,  such a change requires correction to logged metrics using
       <a href="../man1/pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a>, and as a result should be avoided whenever  pos‐
       sible.

       However,  a  PMDA  may become aware of new domain metrics at run‐
       time, and in this case it is ideal  to  export  them  immediately
       (without  any  collector system restart).  In this situation, the
       PMDA can inform all running PMAPI clients that may  have  already
       explored    the    metric    namespace    (for   example,   using
       <a href="pmtraversepmns.3.html">pmTraversePMNS(3)</a>) of the change to the metric namespace.

       This is achieved using <b>pmdaSetFlags</b>(<i>pmda</i>,  <i>PMDA_EXT_NAMES_CHANGE</i>)
       which will result in the PMCD_NAMES_CHANGE state change notifica‐
       tion being sent to each PMAPI client on next fetch.  If the newly
       discovered  metrics  have label metadata associated, then the <i>PM‐</i>
       <i>DA_EXT_LABEL_CHANGE</i> flag may also be set, which  will  result  in
       the PMCD_LABEL_CHANGE notification being sent as well.

       <b>pmdaExtSetFlags </b>is equivalent to <b>pmdaSetFlags</b>, and is provided as
       a  convenience  interface in situations where the <b>pmdaExt </b>is more
       readily available than the <b>pmdaInterface </b>structure.
</pre> <h2>
COMMUNICATION ATTRIBUTES </h2>
<pre>
       Agents that make use of authentication  or  container  attributes
       should  indicate this using the <b>pmdaSetCommFlags </b>interface.  This
       indicates the need for these attributes to be communicated on the
       channel between the PMDA and <b>pmcd </b>or local context client.  Valid
       flags are PMDA_FLAG_AUTHORIZE (for authentication related attrib‐
       utes) and PMDA_FLAG_CONTAINER (for container name related attrib‐
       utes).
</pre> <h2>
PRIVATE DATA </h2>
<pre>
       A facility for associating private PMDA  data  with  the  <b>pmdaExt</b>
       structure is available.  This allows a PMDA to associate an arbi‐
       trary  (and  typically  not global) pointer with the <b>pmdaExt </b>such
       that it can be later obtained during callbacks.   The  interfaces
       for  setting this pointer are <b>pmdaSetData </b>and <b>pmdaExtSetData</b>, and
       <b>pmdaExtGetData </b>for subsequently retrieving it.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       The PMDA must be using <b>PMDA_INTERFACE_2 </b>or later, as specified in
       the call to <a href="pmdadso.3.html">pmdaDSO(3)</a> or <a href="pmdadaemon.3.html">pmdaDaemon(3)</a> to use <b>pmdaInit</b>.

       The PMDA must use <b>PMDA_INTERFACE_7 </b>or later to issue state change
       notifications using <b>pmdaSetFlags </b>or <b>pmdaExtSetFlags</b>.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaInit </b>will set <i>dispatch-&gt;status</i> to a value less than  zero  if
       there is an error that would prevent the <a href="pmda.3.html">PMDA(3)</a> from successful‐
       ly running.  <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> will terminate the connection to the <a href="pmda.3.html">PMDA(3)</a>
       if this occurs.

       <b>pmdaInit </b>may issue any of these messages:

       <b>PMDA interface version </b><i>interface</i> <b>not supported</b>
              The <i>interface</i> version is not supported by <b>pmdaInit</b>.

       <b>Using pmdaFetch() but fetch call back not set</b>
              The fetch callback, <a href="pmdafetch.3.html">pmdaFetch(3)</a>, requires an additional
              callback to be provided using <a href="pmdasetfetchcallback.3.html">pmdaSetFetchCallBack(3)</a>.

       <b>Illegal instance domain </b><i>inst</i> <b>for metric </b><i>pmid</i>
              The instance domain <i>inst</i> that was specified for metric
              <i>pmid</i> is not within the range of the instance domain table.

       <b>No help text path specified</b>
              The help text callback, <a href="pmdatext.3.html">pmdaText(3)</a>, requires a help text
              file for the metrics to have been opened, however no path
              to the help text was specified as a command line option,
              or as an argument to <a href="pmdadso.3.html">pmdaDSO(3)</a> or <a href="pmdadaemon.3.html">pmdaDaemon(3)</a>.  This
              message is only a warning.

       <b>Direct mapping for metrics disabled @ </b><i>num</i>
              The unit numbers of the metrics did not correspond to the
              index in the metric description table.  The direct mapping
              failed for metric number <i>num</i> in the <i>metrics</i> table.  This
              is less efficient but is not fatal and the message is only
              a warning.

       <b>Hashed mapping for metrics disabled @ </b><i>num</i>
              A memory allocation failure occurred while building the
              hash table to index the metric description table.  This is
              a non-fatal warning message - a fallback to linear search‐
              ing will be automatically performed should this situation
              arise.
