CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Within the libraries and applications of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) these routines provide a convenient and portable interface
       to service manager APIs, such as <a href="sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a>.

       PCP service daemons should call
       <b>__pmServerNotifyServiceManagerReady </b>immediately prior to entering
       their main loop, regardless of whether or not they have forked or
       daemonised.  This will notify the service manager (if any,
       depending on the platform) that the daemon service has started,
       and that the main process to be tracked is <b>mainpid</b>.

       Similarly when shutting down, service daemons should call
       <b>__pmServerNotifyServiceManagerStopping </b>to notify the service
       manager (if any) that the tracked process of the service has
       returned from it's main loop and is about to shut down.

       These routines are intended to be portable and thus no
       conditional code should be needed for any service daemon on any
       platform.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions will print diagnostics to the <b>stderr </b>stream if
       <b>pmDebugOptions.services </b>is set.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN CODE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, <b>__pmServerNotifyServiceManagerReady </b>returns a
       positive integer that depends on the platform service manager.
       In the case of <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>, the return code is from <a href="sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a>.
       If the platform supports <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> but the <b>NOTIFY_SOCKET</b>
       environment variable is not set (as may be the case if the server
       program is started manually rather than by <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>), the
       return code will be <b>PM_ERR_GENERIC </b>which will normally be ignored
       but a diagnostic will be printed if <b>pmDebugOptions.services </b>is
       set.  On platforms that have no service manager, the return code
       will be <b>PM_ERR_NYI</b>.  For backward compatibility on these
       platforms, the return code should be ignored.
