NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_get_required_select_timeout - get a timeout to be used when
       doing select() for a live capture
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>const struct timeval *pcap_get_required_select_timeout(pcap_t *p);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() returns, on UNIX, a pointer to
       a <b>struct timeval </b>containing a value that must be used as the
       minimum timeout in <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/epoll_wait.2.html">epoll_wait(2)</a>, and
       <b>kevent</b>(2) calls, or <b>NULL </b>if there is no such timeout.  If a non-
       <b>NULL </b>value is returned, it must be used regardless of whether
       <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>(3PCAP) returns <b>-1 </b>for any descriptor on
       which those calls are being done.
       <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() should be called for all
       <b>pcap_t</b>s before a call to <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(), <b>epoll_wait</b>(), or
       <b>kevent</b>(), and any timeouts used for those calls should be updated
       as appropriate given the new value of the timeout.

       For <b>kevent</b>(), one <b>EVFILT_TIMER </b>filter per selectable descriptor
       can be used, rather than using the timeout argument to <b>kevent</b>();
       if the <b>EVFILT_TIMER </b>event for a particular selectable descriptor
       signals an event, <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP) should be called for the
       corresponding <b>pcap_t</b>.

       On Linux systems with <a href="../man2/timerfd_create.2.html">timerfd_create(2)</a>, one timer object created
       by <b>timerfd_create</b>() per selectable descriptor can be used, rather
       than using the timeout argument to <b>epoll_wait</b>(); if the timer
       object for a particular selectable descriptor signals an event,
       <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP) should be called for the corresponding
       <b>pcap_t</b>.

       Otherwise, a timeout value no larger than the smallest of all
       timeouts returned by <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() for
       devices from which packets will be captured and any other
       timeouts to be used in the call should be used as the timeout for
       the call, and, when the call returns, <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP) should
       be called for all <b>pcap_t</b>s for which a non-<b>NULL </b>timeout was
       returned, regardless of whether it's indicated as having anything
       to read from it or not.

       All devices with a non-<b>NULL </b>timeout must be put in non-blocking
       mode with <b>pcap_setnonblock</b>(3PCAP).

       Note that a device on which a read can be done without blocking
       may, on some platforms, not have any packets to read if the
       packet buffer timeout has expired.  A call to <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() or
       <b>pcap_next_ex</b>(3PCAP) will return <b>0 </b>in this case, but will not
       block.

       <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() is not available on Windows.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       A pointer to a <b>struct timeval </b>is returned if the timeout is
       required; otherwise <b>NULL </b>is returned.
</pre> <h2>
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       This function became available in libpcap release 1.9.0.  In
       previous releases, <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(), <b>epoll_wait</b>(), and <b>kevent</b>()
       could not be used for devices that don't provide a selectable
       file descriptor (in other words, on any capture source for that
       <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>() returns <b>-1</b>).

       In libpcap release 1.10.0 and later, the timeout value can change
       from call to call, so <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() must be
       called before each call to <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(), <b>epoll_wait</b>(), or
       <b>kevent</b>(), and the new value must be used to calculate timeouts
       for the call.  Code that does that will also work with libpcap
       1.9.x releases, so code using <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>()
       should be changed to call it for each call to <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(),
       <b>epoll_wait</b>(), or <b>kevent</b>() even if the code must also work with
       libpcap 1.9.x.
