       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       wcsnrtombs, wcsrtombs — convert a wide-character string to a
       character string (restartable)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       size_t wcsnrtombs(char *restrict <i>dst</i>, const wchar_t **restrict <i>src</i>,
           size_t <i>nwc</i>, size_t <i>len</i>, mbstate_t *restrict <i>ps</i>);
       size_t wcsrtombs(char *restrict <i>dst</i>, const wchar_t **restrict <i>src</i>,
           size_t <i>len</i>, mbstate_t *restrict <i>ps</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For <i>wcsrtombs</i>(): The functionality described on this reference
       page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is
       unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C
       standard.

       The <i>wcsrtombs</i>() function shall convert a sequence of wide
       characters from the array indirectly pointed to by <i>src</i> into a
       sequence of corresponding characters, beginning in the conversion
       state described by the object pointed to by <i>ps</i>.  If <i>dst</i> is not a
       null pointer, the converted characters shall then be stored into
       the array pointed to by <i>dst</i>.  Conversion continues up to and
       including a terminating null wide character, which shall also be
       stored. Conversion shall stop earlier in the following cases:

        *  When a code is reached that does not correspond to a valid
           character

        *  When the next character would exceed the limit of <i>len</i> total
           bytes to be stored in the array pointed to by <i>dst</i> (and <i>dst</i> is
           not a null pointer)

       Each conversion shall take place as if by a call to the <i>wcrtomb</i>()
       function.

       If <i>dst</i> is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by
       <i>src</i> shall be assigned either a null pointer (if conversion
       stopped due to reaching a terminating null wide character) or the
       address just past the last wide character converted (if any). If
       conversion stopped due to reaching a terminating null wide
       character, the resulting state described shall be the initial
       conversion state.

       If <i>ps</i> is a null pointer, the <i>wcsrtombs</i>() function shall use its
       own internal <b>mbstate_t </b>object, which is initialized at program
       start-up to the initial conversion state. Otherwise, the
       <b>mbstate_t </b>object pointed to by <i>ps</i> shall be used to completely
       describe the current conversion state of the associated character
       sequence.

       The <i>wcsnrtombs</i>() and <i>wcsrtombs</i>() functions need not be thread-
       safe if called with a NULL <i>ps</i> argument.

       The <i>wcsnrtombs</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>wcsrtombs</i>()
       function, except that the conversion is limited to the first <i>nwc</i>
       wide characters.

       The <i>wcsrtombs</i>() function shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.

       The behavior of these functions shall be affected by the <i>LC_CTYPE</i>
       category of the current locale.

       The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 calls these functions.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If conversion stops because a code is reached that does not
       correspond to a valid character, an encoding error occurs. In
       this case, these functions shall store the value of the macro
       <b>[EILSEQ] </b>in <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> and return (<b>size_t</b>)-1; the conversion state is
       undefined.  Otherwise, these functions shall return the number of
       bytes in the resulting character sequence, not including the
       terminating null (if any).
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ </b>A wide-character code does not correspond to a valid
              character.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>ps</i> points to an object that contains an invalid conversion
              state.
