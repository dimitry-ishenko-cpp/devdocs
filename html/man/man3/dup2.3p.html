NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dup, dup2 — duplicate an open file descriptor
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int dup(int <i>fildes</i>);
       int dup2(int <i>fildes</i>, int <i>fildes2</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>dup</i>() function provides an alternative interface to the
       service provided by <i>fcntl</i>() using the F_DUPFD command. The call
       <i>dup</i>(<i>fildes</i>) shall be equivalent to:

           fcntl(fildes, F_DUPFD, 0);

       The <i>dup2</i>() function shall cause the file descriptor <i>fildes2</i> to
       refer to the same open file description as the file descriptor
       <i>fildes</i> and to share any locks, and shall return <i>fildes2</i>.  If
       <i>fildes2</i> is already a valid open file descriptor, it shall be
       closed first, unless <i>fildes</i> is equal to <i>fildes2</i> in which case
       <i>dup2</i>() shall return <i>fildes2</i> without closing it. If the close
       operation fails to close <i>fildes2</i>, <i>dup2</i>() shall return -1 without
       changing the open file description to which <i>fildes2</i> refers. If
       <i>fildes</i> is not a valid file descriptor, <i>dup2</i>() shall return -1 and
       shall not close <i>fildes2</i>.  If <i>fildes2</i> is less than 0 or greater
       than or equal to {OPEN_MAX}, <i>dup2</i>() shall return -1 with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       set to <b>[EBADF]</b>.

       Upon successful completion, if <i>fildes</i> is not equal to <i>fildes2</i>,
       the FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with <i>fildes2</i> shall be cleared. If
       <i>fildes</i> is equal to <i>fildes2</i>, the FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with
       <i>fildes2</i> shall not be changed.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of the
       <i>dup2</i>() function is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion a non-negative integer, namely the
       file descriptor, shall be returned; otherwise, -1 shall be
       returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>dup</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       The <i>dup2</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid open file descriptor or
              the argument <i>fildes2</i> is negative or greater than or equal
              to {OPEN_MAX}.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>dup2</i>() function was interrupted by a signal.

       The <i>dup2</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while attempting to close <i>fildes2</i>.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Redirecting Standard Output to a File S</b>
       The following example closes standard output for the current
       processes, re-assigns standard output to go to the file
       referenced by <i>pfd</i>, and closes the original file descriptor to
       clean up.

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           ...
           int pfd;
           ...
           close(1);
           dup(pfd);
           close(pfd);
           ...

   <b>Redirecting Error Messages</b>
       The following example redirects messages from <i>stderr</i> to <i>stdout</i>.

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           ...
           dup2(1, 2);
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Implementations may use file descriptors that must be inherited
       into child processes for the child process to remain conforming,
       such as for message catalog or tracing purposes. Therefore, an
       application that calls <i>dup2</i>() with an arbitrary integer for
       <i>fildes2</i> risks non-conforming behavior, and <i>dup2</i>() can only
       portably be used to overwrite file descriptor values that the
       application has obtained through explicit actions, or for the
       three file descriptors corresponding to the standard file
       streams. In order to avoid a race condition of leaking an
       unintended file descriptor into a child process, an application
       should consider opening all file descriptors with the FD_CLOEXEC
       bit set unless the file descriptor is intended to be inherited
       across <i>exec</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>dup</i>() function is redundant. Its services are also provided
       by the <i>fcntl</i>() function. It has been included in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 primarily for historical reasons, since many
       existing applications use it. On the other hand, the <i>dup2</i>()
       function provides unique services, as no other interface is able
       to atomically replace an existing file descriptor.

       The <i>dup2</i>() function is not marked obsolescent because it presents
       a type-safe version of functionality provided in a type-unsafe
       version by <i>fcntl</i>().  It is used in the POSIX Ada binding.

       The <i>dup2</i>() function is not intended for use in critical regions
       as a synchronization mechanism.

       In the description of <b>[EBADF]</b>, the case of <i>fildes</i> being out of
       range is covered by the given case of <i>fildes</i> not being valid. The
       descriptions for <i>fildes</i> and <i>fildes2</i> are different because the
       only kind of invalidity that is relevant for <i>fildes2</i> is whether
       it is out of range; that is, it does not matter whether <i>fildes2</i>
       refers to an open file when the <i>dup2</i>() call is made.
