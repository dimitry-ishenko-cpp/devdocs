       ssize_t write(int <i>fildes</i>, const void *<i>buf</i>, size_t <i>nbyte</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>write</i>() function shall attempt to write <i>nbyte</i> bytes from the
       buffer pointed to by <i>buf</i> to the file associated with the open
       file descriptor, <i>fildes</i>.

       Before any action described below is taken, and if <i>nbyte</i> is zero
       and the file is a regular file, the <i>write</i>() function may detect
       and return errors as described below. In the absence of errors,
       or if error detection is not performed, the <i>write</i>() function
       shall return zero and have no other results. If <i>nbyte</i> is zero and
       the file is not a regular file, the results are unspecified.

       On a regular file or other file capable of seeking, the actual
       writing of data shall proceed from the position in the file
       indicated by the file offset associated with <i>fildes</i>.  Before
       successful return from <i>write</i>(), the file offset shall be
       incremented by the number of bytes actually written. On a regular
       file, if the position of the last byte written is greater than or
       equal to the length of the file, the length of the file shall be
       set to this position plus one.

       On a file not capable of seeking, writing shall always take place
       starting at the current position. The value of a file offset
       associated with such a device is undefined.

       If the O_APPEND flag of the file status flags is set, the file
       offset shall be set to the end of the file prior to each write
       and no intervening file modification operation shall occur
       between changing the file offset and the write operation.

       If a <i>write</i>() requests that more bytes be written than there is
       room for (for example, the file size limit of the process or the
       physical end of a medium), only as many bytes as there is room
       for shall be written. For example, suppose there is space for 20
       bytes more in a file before reaching a limit. A write of 512
       bytes will return 20. The next write of a non-zero number of
       bytes would give a failure return (except as noted below).

       If the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file
       size limit for the process and there is no room for any bytes to
       be written, the request shall fail and the implementation shall
       generate the SIGXFSZ signal for the thread.

       If <i>write</i>() is interrupted by a signal before it writes any data,
       it shall return -1 with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       If <i>write</i>() is interrupted by a signal after it successfully
       writes some data, it shall return the number of bytes written.

       If the value of <i>nbyte</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is
       implementation-defined.

       After a <i>write</i>() to a regular file has successfully returned:

        *  Any successful <i>read</i>() from each byte position in the file
           that was modified by that write shall return the data
           specified by the <i>write</i>() for that position until such byte
           positions are again modified.

        *  Any subsequent successful <i>write</i>() to the same byte position
           in the file shall overwrite that file data.

       Write requests to a pipe or FIFO shall be handled in the same way
       as a regular file with the following exceptions:

        *  There is no file offset associated with a pipe, hence each
           write request shall append to the end of the pipe.

        *  Write requests of {PIPE_BUF} bytes or less shall not be
           interleaved with data from other processes doing writes on
           the same pipe. Writes of greater than {PIPE_BUF} bytes may
           have data interleaved, on arbitrary boundaries, with writes
           by other processes, whether or not the O_NONBLOCK flag of the
           file status flags is set.

        *  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, a write request may cause
           the thread to block, but on normal completion it shall return
           <i>nbyte</i>.

        *  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, <i>write</i>() requests shall be
           handled differently, in the following ways:

           --  The <i>write</i>() function shall not block the thread.

           --  A write request for {PIPE_BUF} or fewer bytes shall have
               the following effect: if there is sufficient space
               available in the pipe, <i>write</i>() shall transfer all the
               data and return the number of bytes requested.
               Otherwise, <i>write</i>() shall transfer no data and return -1
               with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

           --  A write request for more than {PIPE_BUF} bytes shall
               cause one of the following:

               --  When at least one byte can be written, transfer what
                   it can and return the number of bytes written. When
                   all data previously written to the pipe is read, it
                   shall transfer at least {PIPE_BUF} bytes.

               --  When no data can be written, transfer no data, and
                   return -1 with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

       When attempting to write to a file descriptor (other than a pipe
       or FIFO) that supports non-blocking writes and cannot accept the
       data immediately:

        *  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, <i>write</i>() shall block the
           calling thread until the data can be accepted.

        *  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, <i>write</i>() shall not block the
           thread. If some data can be written without blocking the
           thread, <i>write</i>() shall write what it can and return the number
           of bytes written.  Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set
           <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

       Upon successful completion, where <i>nbyte</i> is greater than 0,
       <i>write</i>() shall mark for update the last data modification and last
       file status change timestamps of the file, and if the file is a
       regular file, the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may
       be cleared.

       For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset
       maximum established in the open file description associated with
       <i>fildes</i>.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, <i>write</i>() shall be equivalent to
       <i>send</i>() with no flags set.

       If the O_DSYNC bit has been set, write I/O operations on the file
       descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O data
       integrity completion.

       If the O_SYNC bit has been set, write I/O operations on the file
       descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file
       integrity completion.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory object, the result of the
       <i>write</i>() function is unspecified.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of the
       <i>write</i>() function is unspecified.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a STREAM, the operation of <i>write</i>() shall be
       determined by the values of the minimum and maximum <i>nbyte</i> range
       (packet size) accepted by the STREAM. These values are determined
       by the topmost STREAM module. If <i>nbyte</i> falls within the packet
       size range, <i>nbyte</i> bytes shall be written. If <i>nbyte</i> does not fall
       within the range and the minimum packet size value is 0, <i>write</i>()
       shall break the buffer into maximum packet size segments prior to
       sending the data downstream (the last segment may contain less
       than the maximum packet size). If <i>nbyte</i> does not fall within the
       range and the minimum value is non-zero, <i>write</i>() shall fail with
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[ERANGE]</b>.  Writing a zero-length buffer (<i>nbyte</i> is 0)
       to a STREAMS device sends 0 bytes with 0 returned. However,
       writing a zero-length buffer to a STREAMS-based pipe or FIFO
       sends no message and 0 is returned. The process may issue
       I_SWROPT <i>ioctl</i>() to enable zero-length messages to be sent across
       the pipe or FIFO.

       When writing to a STREAM, data messages are created with a
       priority band of 0. When writing to a STREAM that is not a pipe
       or FIFO:

        *  If O_NONBLOCK is clear, and the STREAM cannot accept data
           (the STREAM write queue is full due to internal flow control
           conditions), <i>write</i>() shall block until data can be accepted.

        *  If O_NONBLOCK is set and the STREAM cannot accept data,
           <i>write</i>() shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

        *  If O_NONBLOCK is set and part of the buffer has been written
           while a condition in which the STREAM cannot accept
           additional data occurs, <i>write</i>() shall terminate and return
           the number of bytes written.

       In addition, <i>write</i>() shall fail if the STREAM head has processed
       an asynchronous error before the call. In this case, the value of
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> does not reflect the result of <i>write</i>(), but reflects the
       prior error.

       The <i>pwrite</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>write</i>(), except that
       it writes into a given position and does not change the file
       offset (regardless of whether O_APPEND is set). The first three
       arguments to <i>pwrite</i>() are the same as <i>write</i>() with the addition
       of a fourth argument <i>offset</i> for the desired position inside the
       file. An attempt to perform a <i>pwrite</i>() on a file that is
       incapable of seeking shall result in an error.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
       number of bytes actually written to the file associated with
       <i>fildes</i>.  This number shall never be greater than <i>nbyte</i>.
       Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the
       error.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       See also the RATIONALE section in <i>read</i>().

       An attempt to write to a pipe or FIFO has several major
       characteristics:

        *  <i>Atomic/non-atomic</i>: A write is atomic if the whole amount
           written in one operation is not interleaved with data from
           any other process.  This is useful when there are multiple
           writers sending data to a single reader. Applications need to
           know how large a write request can be expected to be
           performed atomically. This maximum is called {PIPE_BUF}.
           This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not say whether write
           requests for more than {PIPE_BUF} bytes are atomic, but
           requires that writes of {PIPE_BUF} or fewer bytes shall be
           atomic.

        *  <i>Blocking/immediate</i>: Blocking is only possible with O_NONBLOCK
           clear. If there is enough space for all the data requested to
           be written immediately, the implementation should do so.
           Otherwise, the calling thread may block; that is, pause until
           enough space is available for writing. The effective size of
           a pipe or FIFO (the maximum amount that can be written in one
           operation without blocking) may vary dynamically, depending
           on the implementation, so it is not possible to specify a
           fixed value for it.

        *  <i>Complete/partial/deferred</i>: A write request:

               int fildes;
               size_t nbyte;
               ssize_t ret;
               char *buf;

               ret = write(fildes, buf, nbyte);

           may return:

           Complete  <i>ret</i>=<i>nbyte</i>

           Partial   <i>ret</i>&lt;<i>nbyte</i>

                     This shall never happen if <i>nbyte</i>≤{PIPE_BUF}.  If it
                     does happen (with <i>nbyte</i>&gt;{PIPE_BUF}), this volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2017 does not guarantee atomicity, even if
                     <i>ret</i>≤{PIPE_BUF}, because atomicity is guaranteed
                     according to the amount <i>requested</i>, not the amount
                     <i>written</i>.

           Deferred: <i>ret</i>=-1, <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>=[EAGAIN]

                     This error indicates that a later request may
                     succeed. It does not indicate that it <i>shall</i>
                     succeed, even if <i>nbyte</i>≤{PIPE_BUF}, because if no
                     process reads from the pipe or FIFO, the write
                     never succeeds. An application could usefully count
                     the number of times <b>[EAGAIN] </b>is caused by a
                     particular value of <i>nbyte</i>&gt;{PIPE_BUF} and perhaps do
                     later writes with a smaller value, on the
                     assumption that the effective size of the pipe may
                     have decreased.

           Partial and deferred writes are only possible with O_NONBLOCK
           set.

       The relations of these properties are shown in the following
       tables:
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │             <b>Write to a Pipe or FIFO with O_NONBLOCK </b><i>clear</i>              │

  └──────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

       If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, a write request shall block if
       the amount writable immediately is less than that requested. If
       the flag is set (by <i>fcntl</i>()), a write request shall never block.
      ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

       There is no exception regarding partial writes when O_NONBLOCK is
       set.  With the exception of writing to an empty pipe, this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify exactly when a partial write is
       performed since that would require specifying internal details of
       the implementation. Every application should be prepared to
       handle partial writes when O_NONBLOCK is set and the requested
       amount is greater than {PIPE_BUF}, just as every application
       should be prepared to handle partial writes on other kinds of
       file descriptors.

       The intent of forcing writing at least one byte if any can be
       written is to assure that each write makes progress if there is
       any room in the pipe. If the pipe is empty, {PIPE_BUF} bytes must
       be written; if not, at least some progress must have been made.

       Where this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires -1 to be returned and
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, most historical implementations return
       zero (with the O_NDELAY flag set, which is the historical
       predecessor of O_NONBLOCK, but is not itself in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017). The error indications in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 were chosen so that an application can distinguish
       these cases from end-of-file. While <i>write</i>() cannot receive an
       indication of end-of-file, <i>read</i>() can, and the two functions have
       similar return values. Also, some existing systems (for example,
       Eighth Edition) permit a write of zero bytes to mean that the
       reader should get an end-of-file indication; for those systems, a
       return value of zero from <i>write</i>() indicates a successful write of
       an end-of-file indication.

       Implementations are allowed, but not required, to perform error
       checking for <i>write</i>() requests of zero bytes.

       The concept of a {PIPE_MAX} limit (indicating the maximum number
       of bytes that can be written to a pipe in a single operation) was
       considered, but rejected, because this concept would
       unnecessarily limit application writing.

       See also the discussion of O_NONBLOCK in <i>read</i>().

       Writes can be serialized with respect to other reads and writes.
       If a <i>read</i>() of file data can be proven (by any means) to occur
       after a <i>write</i>() of the data, it must reflect that <i>write</i>(), even
       if the calls are made by different processes. A similar
       requirement applies to multiple write operations to the same file
       position. This is needed to guarantee the propagation of data
       from <i>write</i>() calls to subsequent <i>read</i>() calls. This requirement
       is particularly significant for networked file systems, where
       some caching schemes violate these semantics.

       Note that this is specified in terms of <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>().  The
       XSI extensions <i>readv</i>() and <i>writev</i>() also obey these semantics. A
       new ``high-performance'' write analog that did not follow these
       serialization requirements would also be permitted by this
       wording. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 is also silent about any
       effects of application-level caching (such as that done by
       <i>stdio</i>).

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the value of the
       file offset after an error is returned; there are too many cases.
       For programming errors, such as <b>[EBADF]</b>, the concept is
       meaningless since no file is involved. For errors that are
       detected immediately, such as <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, clearly the pointer
       should not change. After an interrupt or hardware error, however,
       an updated value would be very useful and is the behavior of many
       implementations.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the behavior of
       concurrent writes to a regular file from multiple threads, except
       that each write is atomic (see <i>Section 2.9.7</i>, <i>Thread Interactions</i>
       <i>with Regular File Operations</i>).  Applications should use some form
       of concurrency control.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 intentionally does not specify any
       <i>pwrite</i>() errors related to pipes, FIFOs, and sockets other than
       <b>[ESPIPE]</b>.
