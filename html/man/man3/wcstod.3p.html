       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       double wcstod(const wchar_t *restrict <i>nptr</i>, wchar_t **restrict <i>endptr</i>);

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall convert the initial portion of the wide-
       character string pointed to by <i>nptr</i> to <b>double</b>, <b>float</b>, and <b>long</b>
       <b>double </b>representation, respectively. First, they shall decompose
       the input wide-character string into three parts:

        1. An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space wide-
           character codes (as specified by <i>iswspace</i>())

        2. A subject sequence interpreted as a floating-point constant
           or representing infinity or NaN

        3. A final wide-character string of one or more unrecognized
           wide-character codes, including the terminating null wide-
           character code of the input wide-character string

       Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence to a
       floating-point number, and return the result.

       The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional <b>'+' </b>or
       <b>'-' </b>sign, then one of the following:

        *  A non-empty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing
           a radix character; then an optional exponent part consisting
           of the wide character <b>'e' </b>or the wide character <b>'E'</b>,
           optionally followed by a <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-' </b>wide character, and then
           followed by one or more decimal digits

        *  A 0x or 0X, then a non-empty sequence of hexadecimal digits
           optionally containing a radix character; then an optional
           binary exponent part consisting of the wide character <b>'p' </b>or
           the wide character <b>'P'</b>, optionally followed by a <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-'</b>
           wide character, and then followed by one or more decimal
           digits

        *  One of INF or INFINITY, or any other wide string equivalent
           except for case

        *  One of NAN or NAN(<i>n-wchar-sequenceopt</i>), or any other wide
           string ignoring case in the NAN part, where:

               n-wchar-sequence:
                   digit
                   nondigit
                   n-wchar-sequence digit
                   n-wchar-sequence nondigit

       The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial
       subsequence of the input wide string, starting with the first
       non-white-space wide character, that is of the expected form. The
       subject sequence contains no wide characters if the input wide
       string is not of the expected form.

       If the subject sequence has the expected form for a floating-
       point number, the sequence of wide characters starting with the
       first digit or the radix character (whichever occurs first) shall
       be interpreted as a floating constant according to the rules of
       the C language, except that the radix character shall be used in
       place of a period, and that if neither an exponent part nor a
       radix character appears in a decimal floating-point number, or if
       a binary exponent part does not appear in a hexadecimal floating-
       point number, an exponent part of the appropriate type with value
       zero shall be assumed to follow the last digit in the string. If
       the subject sequence begins with a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;, the sequence
       shall be interpreted as negated. A wide-character sequence INF or
       INFINITY shall be interpreted as an infinity, if representable in
       the return type, else as if it were a floating constant that is
       too large for the range of the return type. A wide-character
       sequence NAN or NAN(<i>n-wchar-sequenceopt</i>) shall be interpreted as
       a quiet NaN, if supported in the return type, else as if it were
       a subject sequence part that does not have the expected form; the
       meaning of the <i>n</i>-wchar sequences is implementation-defined. A
       pointer to the final wide string shall be stored in the object
       pointed to by <i>endptr</i>, provided that <i>endptr</i> is not a null pointer.

       If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is
       a power of 2, the conversion shall be rounded in an
       implementation-defined manner.

       The radix character shall be as defined in the current locale
       (category <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>).  In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where
       the radix character is not defined, the radix character shall
       default to a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>).

       In other than the C or POSIX locale, additional locale-specific
       subject sequence forms may be accepted.

       If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected
       form, no conversion shall be performed; the value of <i>nptr</i> shall
       be stored in the object pointed to by <i>endptr</i>, provided that
       <i>endptr</i> is not a null pointer.

       These functions shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.

       Since 0 is returned on error and is also a valid return on
       success, an application wishing to check for error situations
       should set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to 0, then call <i>wcstod</i>(), <i>wcstof</i>(), or
       <i>wcstold</i>(), then check <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
       converted value. If no conversion could be performed, 0 shall be
       returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> may be set to <b>[EINVAL]</b>.

       If the correct value is outside the range of representable
       values, ±HUGE_VAL, ±HUGE_VALF, or ±HUGE_VALL shall be returned
       (according to the sign of the value), and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to
       <b>[ERANGE]</b>.

       If the correct value would cause underflow, a value whose
       magnitude is no greater than the smallest normalized positive
       number in the return type shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to
       <b>[ERANGE]</b>.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>wcstod</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ERANGE </b>The value to be returned would cause overflow or
              underflow.

       The <i>wcstod</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>No conversion could be performed.

</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the subject sequence has the hexadecimal form and FLT_RADIX is
       not a power of 2, and the result is not exactly representable,
       the result should be one of the two numbers in the appropriate
       internal format that are adjacent to the hexadecimal floating
       source value, with the extra stipulation that the error should
       have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

       If the subject sequence has the decimal form and at most
       DECIMAL_DIG (defined in <i>&lt;float.h&gt;</i>) significant digits, the result
       should be correctly rounded. If the subject sequence <i>D</i> has the
       decimal form and more than DECIMAL_DIG significant digits,
       consider the two bounding, adjacent decimal strings <i>L</i> and <i>U</i>, both
       having DECIMAL_DIG significant digits, such that the values of <i>L</i>,
       <i>D</i>, and <i>U</i> satisfy <b>"L</b>&lt;=<b>D</b>&lt;=<b>U"</b>.  The result should be one of the
       (equal or adjacent) values that would be obtained by correctly
       rounding <i>L</i> and <i>U</i> according to the current rounding direction,
       with the extra stipulation that the error with respect to <i>D</i>
       should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.
