NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_nhm_unc - support for Intel Nehalem uncore PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: nhm_unc</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Nehalem uncore</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Nehalem uncore PMU as implemented by
       processors such as Intel Core i7, and Intel Core i5.

       The PMU is located at the socket-level and is therefore shared
       between the various cores. By construction it can only measure at
       all privilege levels.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Nehalem
       processors:

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       <b>o      </b>Causes the queue occupancy counter associated with the
              event to be cleared (zeroed). This is a boolean modifier.
