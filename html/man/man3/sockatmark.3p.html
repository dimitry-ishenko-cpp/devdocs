PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sockatmark — determine whether a socket is at the out-of-band
       mark
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int sockatmark(int <i>s</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sockatmark</i>() function shall determine whether the socket
       specified by the descriptor <i>s</i> is at the out-of-band data mark
       (see <i>Section 2.10.12</i>, <i>Socket Out-of-Band Data State</i>).  If the
       protocol for the socket supports out-of-band data by marking the
       stream with an out-of-band data mark, the <i>sockatmark</i>() function
       shall return 1 when all data preceding the mark has been read and
       the out-of-band data mark is the first element in the receive
       queue. The <i>sockatmark</i>() function shall not remove the mark from
       the stream.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>sockatmark</i>() function shall
       return a value indicating whether the socket is at an out-of-band
       data mark. If the protocol has marked the data stream and all
       data preceding the mark has been read, the return value shall be
       1; if there is no mark, or if data precedes the mark in the
       receive queue, the <i>sockatmark</i>() function shall return 0.
       Otherwise, it shall return a value of -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sockatmark</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>s</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ENOTTY </b>The file associated with the <i>s</i> argument is not a socket.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The use of this function between receive operations allows an
       application to determine which received data precedes the out-of-
       band data and which follows the out-of-band data.

       There is an inherent race condition in the use of this function.
       On an empty receive queue, the current read of the location might
       well be at the ``mark'', but the system has no way of knowing
       that the next data segment that will arrive from the network will
       carry the mark, and <i>sockatmark</i>() will return false, and the next
       read operation will silently consume the mark.

       Hence, this function can only be used reliably when the
       application already knows that the out-of-band data has been seen
       by the system or that it is known that there is data waiting to
       be read at the socket (via SIGURG or <i>select</i>()).  See <i>Section</i>
       <i>2.10.11</i>, <i>Socket Receive Queue</i>, <i>Section 2.10.12</i>, <i>Socket Out-of-</i>
       <i>Band Data State</i>, <i>Section 2.10.14</i>, <i>Signals</i>, and <i>pselect</i>() for
       details.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sockatmark</i>() function replaces the historical SIOCATMARK
       command to <i>ioctl</i>() which implemented the same functionality on
       many implementations. Using a wrapper function follows the
       adopted conventions to avoid specifying commands to the <i>ioctl</i>()
       function, other than those now included to support XSI STREAMS.
       The <i>sockatmark</i>() function could be implemented as follows:

           #include &lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;

           int sockatmark(int s)
           {
               int val;
               if (ioctl(s,SIOCATMARK,&amp;val)==-1)
                   return(-1);
               return(val);
           }

       The use of <b>[ENOTTY] </b>to indicate an incorrect descriptor type
       matches the historical behavior of SIOCATMARK.
