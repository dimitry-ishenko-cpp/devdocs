       pthread_mutex_timedlock — lock a mutex
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       int pthread_mutex_timedlock(pthread_mutex_t *restrict <i>mutex</i>,
           const struct timespec *restrict <i>abstime</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() function shall lock the mutex
       object referenced by <i>mutex</i>.  If the mutex is already locked, the
       calling thread shall block until the mutex becomes available as
       in the <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() function. If the mutex cannot be
       locked without waiting for another thread to unlock the mutex,
       this wait shall be terminated when the specified timeout expires.

       The timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by
       <i>abstime</i> passes, as measured by the clock on which timeouts are
       based (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds
       <i>abstime</i>), or if the absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i> has
       already been passed at the time of the call.

       The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.  The
       resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of the clock on
       which it is based. The <b>timespec </b>data type is defined in the
       <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i> header.

       Under no circumstance shall the function fail with a timeout if
       the mutex can be locked immediately. The validity of the <i>abstime</i>
       parameter need not be checked if the mutex can be locked
       immediately.

       As a consequence of the priority inheritance rules (for mutexes
       initialized with the PRIO_INHERIT protocol), if a timed mutex
       wait is terminated because its timeout expires, the priority of
       the owner of the mutex shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect
       the fact that this thread is no longer among the threads waiting
       for the mutex.

       If <i>mutex</i> is a robust mutex and the process containing the owning
       thread terminated while holding the mutex lock, a call to
       <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() shall return the error value
       <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>.  If <i>mutex</i> is a robust mutex and the owning thread
       terminated while holding the mutex lock, a call to
       <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() may return the error value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>
       even if the process in which the owning thread resides has not
       terminated. In these cases, the mutex is locked by the thread but
       the state it protects is marked as inconsistent. The application
       should ensure that the state is made consistent for reuse and
       when that is complete call <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>().  If the
       application is unable to recover the state, it should unlock the
       mutex without a prior call to <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>(), after
       which the mutex is marked permanently unusable.

       If <i>mutex</i> does not refer to an initialized mutex object, the
       behavior is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() function shall
       return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The mutex could not be acquired because the maximum number
              of recursive locks for <i>mutex</i> has been exceeded.

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              The mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK and the current
              thread already owns the mutex.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The mutex was created with the protocol attribute having
              the value PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT and the calling thread's
              priority is higher than the mutex' current priority
              ceiling.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The process or thread would have blocked, and the <i>abstime</i>
              parameter specified a nanoseconds field value less than
              zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       <b>ENOTRECOVERABLE</b>
              The state protected by the mutex is not recoverable.

       <b>EOWNERDEAD</b>
              The mutex is a robust mutex and the process containing the
              previous owning thread terminated while holding the mutex
              lock. The mutex lock shall be acquired by the calling
              thread and it is up to the new owner to make the state
              consistent.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The mutex could not be locked before the specified timeout
              expired.

       The <i>pthread_mutex_timedlock</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock condition was detected.

       <b>EOWNERDEAD</b>
              The mutex is a robust mutex and the previous owning thread
              terminated while holding the mutex lock. The mutex lock
              shall be acquired by the calling thread and it is up to
              the new owner to make the state consistent.

       This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications that have assumed that non-zero return values are
       errors will need updating for use with robust mutexes, since a
       valid return for a thread acquiring a mutex which is protecting a
       currently inconsistent state is <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>.  Applications that
       do not check the error returns, due to ruling out the possibility
       of such errors arising, should not use robust mutexes. If an
       application is supposed to work with normal and robust mutexes,
       it should check all return values for error conditions and if
       necessary take appropriate action.
