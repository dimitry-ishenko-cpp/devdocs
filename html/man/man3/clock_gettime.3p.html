SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       int clock_getres(clockid_t <i>clock_id</i>, struct timespec *<i>res</i>);
       int clock_gettime(clockid_t <i>clock_id</i>, struct timespec *<i>tp</i>);
       int clock_settime(clockid_t <i>clock_id</i>, const struct timespec *<i>tp</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>clock_getres</i>() function shall return the resolution of any
       clock. Clock resolutions are implementation-defined and cannot be
       set by a process. If the argument <i>res</i> is not NULL, the resolution
       of the specified clock shall be stored in the location pointed to
       by <i>res</i>.  If <i>res</i> is NULL, the clock resolution is not returned. If
       the <i>time</i> argument of <i>clock_settime</i>() is not a multiple of <i>res</i>,
       then the value is truncated to a multiple of <i>res</i>.

       The <i>clock_gettime</i>() function shall return the current value <i>tp</i>
       for the specified clock, <i>clock_id</i>.

       The <i>clock_settime</i>() function shall set the specified clock,
       <i>clock_id</i>, to the value specified by <i>tp</i>.  Time values that are
       between two consecutive non-negative integer multiples of the
       resolution of the specified clock shall be truncated down to the
       smaller multiple of the resolution.

       A clock may be system-wide (that is, visible to all processes) or
       per-process (measuring time that is meaningful only within a
       process).  All implementations shall support a <i>clock_id</i> of
       CLOCK_REALTIME as defined in <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.  This clock represents the
       clock measuring real time for the system.  For this clock, the
       values returned by <i>clock_gettime</i>() and specified by
       <i>clock_settime</i>() represent the amount of time (in seconds and
       nanoseconds) since the Epoch. An implementation may also support
       additional clocks. The interpretation of time values for these
       clocks is unspecified.

       If the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock is set via
       <i>clock_settime</i>(), the new value of the clock shall be used to
       determine the time of expiration for absolute time services based
       upon the CLOCK_REALTIME clock. This applies to the time at which
       armed absolute timers expire.  If the absolute time requested at
       the invocation of such a time service is before the new value of
       the clock, the time service shall expire immediately as if the
       clock had reached the requested time normally.

       Setting the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock via <i>clock_settime</i>()
       shall have no effect on threads that are blocked waiting for a
       relative time service based upon this clock, including the
       <i>nanosleep</i>() function; nor on the expiration of relative timers
       based upon this clock. Consequently, these time services shall
       expire when the requested relative interval elapses,
       independently of the new or old value of the clock.

       If the Monotonic Clock option is supported, all implementations
       shall support a <i>clock_id</i> of CLOCK_MONOTONIC defined in <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.
       This clock represents the monotonic clock for the system. For
       this clock, the value returned by <i>clock_gettime</i>() represents the
       amount of time (in seconds and nanoseconds) since an unspecified
       point in the past (for example, system start-up time, or the
       Epoch). This point does not change after system start-up time.
       The value of the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock cannot be set via
       <i>clock_settime</i>().  This function shall fail if it is invoked with
       a <i>clock_id</i> argument of CLOCK_MONOTONIC.

       The effect of setting a clock via <i>clock_settime</i>() on armed per-
       process timers associated with a clock other than CLOCK_REALTIME
       is implementation-defined.

       If the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock is set via
       <i>clock_settime</i>(), the new value of the clock shall be used to
       determine the time at which the system shall awaken a thread
       blocked on an absolute <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() call based upon the
       CLOCK_REALTIME clock. If the absolute time requested at the
       invocation of such a time service is before the new value of the
       clock, the call shall return immediately as if the clock had
       reached the requested time normally.

       Setting the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock via <i>clock_settime</i>()
       shall have no effect on any thread that is blocked on a relative
       <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() call. Consequently, the call shall return when
       the requested relative interval elapses, independently of the new
       or old value of the clock.

       Appropriate privileges to set a particular clock are
       implementation-defined.

       If _POSIX_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall support clock
       ID values obtained by invoking <i>clock_getcpuclockid</i>(), which
       represent the CPU-time clock of a given process. Implementations
       shall also support the special <b>clockid_t </b>value
       CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, which represents the CPU-time clock of
       the calling process when invoking one of the <i>clock_*</i>() or
       <i>timer_*</i>() functions. For these clock IDs, the values returned by
       <i>clock_gettime</i>() and specified by <i>clock_settime</i>() represent the
       amount of execution time of the process associated with the
       clock. Changing the value of a CPU-time clock via <i>clock_settime</i>()
       shall have no effect on the behavior of the sporadic server
       scheduling policy (see <i>Scheduling Policies</i>).

       If _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall
       support clock ID values obtained by invoking
       <i>pthread_getcpuclockid</i>(), which represent the CPU-time clock of a
       given thread. Implementations shall also support the special
       <b>clockid_t </b>value CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, which represents the
       CPU-time clock of the calling thread when invoking one of the
       <i>clock_*</i>() or <i>timer_*</i>() functions. For these clock IDs, the values
       returned by <i>clock_gettime</i>() and specified by <i>clock_settime</i>()
       shall represent the amount of execution time of the thread
       associated with the clock. Changing the value of a CPU-time clock
       via <i>clock_settime</i>() shall have no effect on the behavior of the
       sporadic server scheduling policy (see <i>Scheduling Policies</i>).
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       A return value of 0 shall indicate that the call succeeded. A
       return value of -1 shall indicate that an error occurred, and
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>clock_getres</i>(), <i>clock_gettime</i>(), and <i>clock_settime</i>()
       functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>clock_id</i> argument does not specify a known clock.

       The <i>clock_gettime</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The number of seconds will not fit in an object of type
              <b>time_t</b>.

       The <i>clock_settime</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>tp</i> argument to <i>clock_settime</i>() is outside the range
              for the given clock ID.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>tp</i> argument specified a nanosecond value less than
              zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>clock_id</i> argument is CLOCK_MONOTONIC.

       The <i>clock_settime</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EPERM  </b>The requesting process does not have appropriate
              privileges to set the specified clock.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Note that the absolute value of the monotonic clock is
       meaningless (because its origin is arbitrary), and thus there is
       no need to set it.  Furthermore, realtime applications can rely
       on the fact that the value of this clock is never set and,
       therefore, that time intervals measured with this clock will not
       be affected by calls to <i>clock_settime</i>().
