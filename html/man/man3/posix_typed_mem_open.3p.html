NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_typed_mem_open — open a typed memory object (<b>ADVANCED</b>
       <b>REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int posix_typed_mem_open(const char *<i>name</i>, int <i>oflag</i>, int <i>tflag</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>() function shall establish a connection
       between the typed memory object specified by the string pointed
       to by <i>name</i> and a file descriptor. It shall create an open file
       description that refers to the typed memory object and a file
       descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file
       descriptor shall be allocated as described in <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>File</i>
       <i>Descriptor Allocation</i> and can be used by other functions to refer
       to that typed memory object. It is unspecified whether the name
       appears in the file system and is visible to other functions that
       take pathnames as arguments. The <i>name</i> argument conforms to the
       construction rules for a pathname, except that the interpretation
       of &lt;slash&gt; characters other than the leading &lt;slash&gt; character in
       <i>name</i> is implementation-defined, and that the length limits for
       the <i>name</i> argument are implementation-defined and need not be the
       same as the pathname limits {PATH_MAX} and {NAME_MAX}.  If <i>name</i>
       begins with the &lt;slash&gt; character, then processes calling
       <i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>() with the same value of <i>name</i> shall refer to
       the same typed memory object. If <i>name</i> does not begin with the
       &lt;slash&gt; character, the effect is implementation-defined.

       Each typed memory object supported in a system shall be
       identified by a name which specifies not only its associated
       typed memory pool, but also the path or port by which it is
       accessed. That is, the same typed memory pool accessed via
       several different ports shall have several different
       corresponding names. The binding between names and typed memory
       objects is established in an implementation-defined manner.
       Unlike shared memory objects, there is no way within POSIX.1‐2008
       for a program to create a typed memory object.

       The value of <i>tflag</i> shall determine how the typed memory object
       behaves when subsequently mapped by calls to <i>mmap</i>().  At most,
       one of the following flags defined in <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i> may be
       specified:

       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE
             Allocate on <i>mmap</i>().

       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG
             Allocate contiguously on <i>mmap</i>().

       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE
             Map on <i>mmap</i>(), without affecting allocatability.

       If <i>tflag</i> has the flag POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE specified, any
       subsequent call to <i>mmap</i>() using the returned file descriptor
       shall result in allocation and mapping of typed memory from the
       specified typed memory pool. The allocated memory may be a
       contiguous previously unallocated area of the typed memory pool
       or several non-contiguous previously unallocated areas (mapped to
       a contiguous portion of the process address space). If <i>tflag</i> has
       the flag POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG specified, any
       subsequent call to <i>mmap</i>() using the returned file descriptor
       shall result in allocation and mapping of a single contiguous
       previously unallocated area of the typed memory pool (also mapped
       to a contiguous portion of the process address space). If <i>tflag</i>
       has none of the flags POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE or
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG specified, any subsequent call to
       <i>mmap</i>() using the returned file descriptor shall map an
       application-chosen area from the specified typed memory pool such
       that this mapped area becomes unavailable for allocation until
       unmapped by all processes. If <i>tflag</i> has the flag
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE specified, any subsequent call to
       <i>mmap</i>() using the returned file descriptor shall map an
       application-chosen area from the specified typed memory pool
       without an effect on the availability of that area for
       allocation; that is, mapping such an object leaves each byte of
       the mapped area unallocated if it was unallocated prior to the
       mapping or allocated if it was allocated prior to the mapping.
       Appropriate privileges to specify the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE flag are implementation-defined.

       If successful, <i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>() shall return a file
       descriptor for the typed memory object.  The open file
       description is new, and therefore the file descriptor shall not
       share it with any other processes. It is unspecified whether the
       file offset is set. The FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag
       associated with the new file descriptor shall be cleared.

       The behavior of <i>msync</i>(), <i>ftruncate</i>(), and all file operations
       other than <i>mmap</i>(), <i>posix_mem_offset</i>(),
       <i>posix_typed_mem_get_info</i>(), <i>fstat</i>(), <i>dup</i>(), <i>dup2</i>(), and <i>close</i>(),
       is unspecified when passed a file descriptor connected to a typed
       memory object by this function.

       The file status flags of the open file description shall be set
       according to the value of <i>oflag</i>.  Applications shall specify
       exactly one of the three access mode values described below and
       defined in the <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> header, as the value of <i>oflag</i>.

       O_RDONLY    Open for read access only.

       O_WRONLY    Open for write access only.

       O_RDWR      Open for read or write access.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>() function
       shall return a non-negative integer representing the file
       descriptor. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The typed memory object exists and the permissions
              specified by <i>oflag</i> are denied.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>() operation was interrupted by a
              signal.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The flags specified in <i>tflag</i> are invalid (more than one of
              POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE, POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG,
              or POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE is specified).

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>ENFILE </b>Too many file descriptors are currently open in the
              system.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The named typed memory object does not exist.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller lacks appropriate privileges to specify the
              POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE flag in the <i>tflag</i>
              argument.

       The <i>posix_typed_mem_open</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of the <i>name</i> argument exceeds {_POSIX_PATH_MAX}
              on systems that do not support the XSI option or exceeds
              {_XOPEN_PATH_MAX} on XSI systems, or has a pathname
              component that is longer than {_POSIX_NAME_MAX} on systems
              that do not support the XSI option or longer than
              {_XOPEN_NAME_MAX} on XSI systems.
