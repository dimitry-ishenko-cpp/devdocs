</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>acl_extended_file, acl_extended_file_nofollow </b>— test for
       information in ACLs by file name
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;<i>sys/types.h</i>&gt; &lt;<i>acl/libacl.h</i>&gt; <i>int</i> <b>acl_extended_file</b>(<i>const char</i>
       <i>*path_p</i>) <i>int</i> <b>acl_extended_file_nofollow</b>(<i>const char *path_p</i>)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>acl_extended_file</b>() function returns <b>1 </b>if the file or
       directory referred to by the argument <i>path_p</i> is associated with
       an extended access ACL, or if the directory referred to by <i>path_p</i>
       is associated with a default ACL. The function returns <b>0 </b>if the
       file has neither an extended access ACL nor a default ACL.

       An extended ACL is an ACL that contains entries other than the
       three required entries of tag types ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ
       and ACL_OTHER.  If the result of the <b>acl_extended_file</b>() function
       for a file object is <b>0</b>, then ACLs define no discretionary access
       rights other than those already defined by the traditional file
       permission bits.

       Access to the file object may be further restricted by other
       mechanisms, such as Mandatory Access Control schemes. The
       <i>access</i>(2) system call can be used to check whether a given type
       of access to a file object would be granted.

       <b>acl_extended_file_nofollow</b>() is identical to <b>acl_extended_file</b>(),
       except in the case of a symbolic link, where the link itself is
       interrogated, not the file that it refers to.  Since symbolic
       links have no ACL themselves, the operation is supposed to fail
       on them.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <b>acl_extended_file</b>() function returns <b>1 </b>if the
       file object referred to by <i>path_p</i> has an extended access ACL or a
       default ACL, and <b>0 </b>if the file object referred to by <i>path_p</i> has
       neither an extended access ACL nor a default ACL. Otherwise, the
       value <b>-1 </b>is returned and the global variable <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If any of the following conditions occur, the <b>acl_extended_file</b>()
       function returns <b>-1 </b>and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the corresponding value:

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component of
                          the path prefix.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     The length of the argument <i>path_p</i> is too long.

       [ENOENT]           The named object does not exist or the
                          argument <i>path_p</i> points to an empty string.

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a
                          directory.

       [ENOTSUP]          The file system on which the file identified
                          by <i>path_p</i> is located does not support ACLs, or
                          ACLs are disabled.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       This is a non-portable, Linux specific extension to the ACL
       manipulation functions defined in IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17
       (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned).
