DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This function is used to convert an event string passed in <b>str</b>
       into an opaque event identifier, i.e., the return value.

       Events are first manipulated a strings which contain the event
       name, sub-event names and optional filters and modifiers. This
       function analyzes the string and try to find the matching event.

       The event string is a structured string and it is composed as
       follows:

       <b>[pmu_name::]event_name[:unit_mask][:modifier|:modifier=val]</b>

       The various components are separated by <b>: </b>or <b>::</b>, they are defined
       as follows:

       <b>pmu_name</b>
              This is an optional prefix to designate a specific PMU
              model. With the prefix the event which matches the
              event_name is used. In case multiple PMU models are
              activated, there may be conflict with identical event
              names to mean the same or different things. In that case,
              it is necessary to fully specify the event with a
              pmu_name. That string corresponds to what is returned by
              <b>pfm_get_pmu_name()</b>.

       <b>event_name</b>
              This is the event name and is required. The library is not
              case sensitive on event string. The event name must match
              <b>completely </b>the actual event name; it cannot be a
              substring.

       <b>unit_mask</b>
              The optional unit mask which can be considered like a sub-
              event of the major event. If a event has unit masks, and
              there is no default, then at least one unit mask must be
              passed in the string. Multiple unit masks may be specified
              for a single event.

       <b>modifier</b>
              A modifier is an optional filter which is provided by the
              hardware register hosting the event or by the underlying
              kernel infrastructure.  Typical modifiers include
              privilege level filters. Some modifiers are simple
              boolean, in which case just passing their names is
              equivalent to setting their value to <b>true</b>. Other modifiers
              need a specific value, in which case it is provided after
              the equal sign. No space is tolerate around the equal
              sign. The list of modifiers depends on the host PMU and
              underlying kernel API. They are documented in PMU-specific
              documentation. Multiple modifiers may be passed. There is
              not order between unit masks and modifiers.

       The library uses the generic term <b>attribute </b>to designate both
       unit masks and modifiers.

       Here are a few examples of event strings:

       <b>amd64::RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS:u</b>
              Event RETIRED_INSTRUCTION on AMD64 processor, measure at
              user privilege level only

       <b>RS_UOPS_DISPATCHED:c=1:i:u</b>
              Event RS_UOPS_DISPATCHED measured at user privilege level
              only, and with counter-mask set to 1

       For the purpose of this function, only the pmu_name and
       event_name are considered, everything else is parsed, thus must
       be valid, but is ignored.

       The function searches only for one event per call. As a
       convenience, the function will identify the event up to the first
       comma. In other words, if <b>str </b>is equal to "EVENTA,EVENTB", then
       the function will only look at EVENTA and will not return an
       error because of invalid event string. This is handy when parsing
       constant event strings containing multiple, comma-separated,
       events.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN </h2>
<pre>
       The function returns the opaque event identifier that corresponds
       that the event string. In case of error, a negative error code is
       returned instead.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_NOINIT</b>
              The library has not been initialized properly.

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_INVAL</b>
              The event string is NULL.

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_NOMEM</b>
              The library ran out of memory.

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_NOTFOUND</b>
              The event was not found

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_ATTR</b>
              Invalid event attribute

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_ATTR_VAL</b>
              Invalid event attribute value

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_TOOMANY</b>
              Too many event attributes passed
