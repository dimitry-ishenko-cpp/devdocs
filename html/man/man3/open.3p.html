DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>open</i>() function shall establish the connection between a file
       and a file descriptor. It shall create an open file description
       that refers to a file and a file descriptor that refers to that
       open file description.  The file descriptor is used by other I/O
       functions to refer to that file. The <i>path</i> argument points to a
       pathname naming the file.

       The <i>open</i>() function shall return a file descriptor for the named
       file, allocated as described in <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>File Descriptor</i>
       <i>Allocation</i>.  The open file description is new, and therefore the
       file descriptor shall not share it with any other process in the
       system. The FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated with the
       new file descriptor shall be cleared unless the O_CLOEXEC flag is
       set in <i>oflag</i>.

       The file offset used to mark the current position within the file
       shall be set to the beginning of the file.

       The file status flags and file access modes of the open file
       description shall be set according to the value of <i>oflag</i>.

       Values for <i>oflag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of
       flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.
       Applications shall specify exactly one of the first five values
       (file access modes) below in the value of <i>oflag</i>:

       O_EXEC        Open for execute only (non-directory files). The
                     result is unspecified if this flag is applied to a
                     directory.

       O_RDONLY      Open for reading only.

       O_RDWR        Open for reading and writing. The result is
                     undefined if this flag is applied to a FIFO.

       O_SEARCH      Open directory for search only. The result is
                     unspecified if this flag is applied to a non-
                     directory file.

       O_WRONLY      Open for writing only.

       Any combination of the following may be used:

       O_APPEND      If set, the file offset shall be set to the end of
                     the file prior to each write.

       O_CLOEXEC     If set, the FD_CLOEXEC flag for the new file
                     descriptor shall be set.

       O_CREAT       If the file exists, this flag has no effect except
                     as noted under O_EXCL below. Otherwise, if
                     O_DIRECTORY is not set the file shall be created as
                     a regular file; the user ID of the file shall be
                     set to the effective user ID of the process; the
                     group ID of the file shall be set to the group ID
                     of the file's parent directory or to the effective
                     group ID of the process; and the access permission
                     bits (see <i>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</i>) of the file mode shall be
                     set to the value of the argument following the
                     <i>oflag</i> argument taken as type <b>mode_t </b>modified as
                     follows: a bitwise AND is performed on the file-
                     mode bits and the corresponding bits in the
                     complement of the process' file mode creation mask.
                     Thus, all bits in the file mode whose corresponding
                     bit in the file mode creation mask is set are
                     cleared. When bits other than the file permission
                     bits are set, the effect is unspecified. The
                     argument following the <i>oflag</i> argument does not
                     affect whether the file is open for reading,
                     writing, or for both. Implementations shall provide
                     a way to initialize the file's group ID to the
                     group ID of the parent directory. Implementations
                     may, but need not, provide an implementation-
                     defined way to initialize the file's group ID to
                     the effective group ID of the calling process.

       O_DIRECTORY   If <i>path</i> resolves to a non-directory file, fail and
                     set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[ENOTDIR]</b>.

       O_DSYNC       Write I/O operations on the file descriptor shall
                     complete as defined by synchronized I/O data
                     integrity completion.

       O_EXCL        If O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set, <i>open</i>() shall fail if
                     the file exists. The check for the existence of the
                     file and the creation of the file if it does not
                     exist shall be atomic with respect to other threads
                     executing <i>open</i>() naming the same filename in the
                     same directory with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set. If
                     O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set, and <i>path</i> names a
                     symbolic link, <i>open</i>() shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
                     <b>[EEXIST]</b>, regardless of the contents of the
                     symbolic link. If O_EXCL is set and O_CREAT is not
                     set, the result is undefined.

       O_NOCTTY      If set and <i>path</i> identifies a terminal device,
                     <i>open</i>() shall not cause the terminal device to
                     become the controlling terminal for the process. If
                     <i>path</i> does not identify a terminal device, O_NOCTTY
                     shall be ignored.

       O_NOFOLLOW    If <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
                     to <b>[ELOOP]</b>.

       O_NONBLOCK    When opening a FIFO with O_RDONLY or O_WRONLY set:

                      *  If O_NONBLOCK is set, an <i>open</i>() for reading-
                         only shall return without delay. An <i>open</i>() for
                         writing-only shall return an error if no
                         process currently has the file open for
                         reading.

                      *  If O_NONBLOCK is clear, an <i>open</i>() for reading-
                         only shall block the calling thread until a
                         thread opens the file for writing. An <i>open</i>()
                         for writing-only shall block the calling thread
                         until a thread opens the file for reading.

                     When opening a block special or character special
                     file that supports non-blocking opens:

                      *  If O_NONBLOCK is set, the <i>open</i>() function shall
                         return without blocking for the device to be
                         ready or available. Subsequent behavior of the
                         device is device-specific.

                      *  If O_NONBLOCK is clear, the <i>open</i>() function
                         shall block the calling thread until the device
                         is ready or available before returning.

                     Otherwise, the O_NONBLOCK flag shall not cause an
                     error, but it is unspecified whether the file
                     status flags will include the O_NONBLOCK flag.

       O_RSYNC       Read I/O operations on the file descriptor shall
                     complete at the same level of integrity as
                     specified by the O_DSYNC and O_SYNC flags. If both
                     O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC are set in <i>oflag</i>, all I/O
                     operations on the file descriptor shall complete as
                     defined by synchronized I/O data integrity
                     completion. If both O_SYNC and O_RSYNC are set in
                     flags, all I/O operations on the file descriptor
                     shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file
                     integrity completion.

       O_SYNC        Write I/O operations on the file descriptor shall
                     complete as defined by synchronized I/O file
                     integrity completion.

                     The O_SYNC flag shall be supported for regular
                     files, even if the Synchronized Input and Output
                     option is not supported.

       O_TRUNC       If the file exists and is a regular file, and the
                     file is successfully opened O_RDWR or O_WRONLY, its
                     length shall be truncated to 0, and the mode and
                     owner shall be unchanged. It shall have no effect
                     on FIFO special files or terminal device files. Its
                     effect on other file types is implementation-
                     defined. The result of using O_TRUNC without either
                     O_RDWR or O_WRONLY is undefined.

       O_TTY_INIT    If <i>path</i> identifies a terminal device other than a
                     pseudo-terminal, the device is not already open in
                     any process, and either O_TTY_INIT is set in <i>oflag</i>
                     or O_TTY_INIT has the value zero, <i>open</i>() shall set
                     any non-standard <b>termios </b>structure terminal
                     parameters to a state that provides conforming
                     behavior; see the Base Definitions volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 11.2</i>, <i>Parameters that Can be</i>
                     <i>Set</i>.  It is unspecified whether O_TTY_INIT has any
                     effect if the device is already open in any
                     process. If <i>path</i> identifies the slave side of a
                     pseudo-terminal that is not already open in any
                     process, <i>open</i>() shall set any non-standard <b>termios</b>
                     structure terminal parameters to a state that
                     provides conforming behavior, regardless of whether
                     O_TTY_INIT is set. If <i>path</i> does not identify a
                     terminal device, O_TTY_INIT shall be ignored.

       If O_CREAT and O_DIRECTORY are set and the requested access mode
       is neither O_WRONLY nor O_RDWR, the result is unspecified.

       If O_CREAT is set and the file did not previously exist, upon
       successful completion, <i>open</i>() shall mark for update the last data
       access, last data modification, and last file status change
       timestamps of the file and the last data modification and last
       file status change timestamps of the parent directory.

       If O_TRUNC is set and the file did previously exist, upon
       successful completion, <i>open</i>() shall mark for update the last data
       modification and last file status change timestamps of the file.

       If both the O_SYNC and O_DSYNC flags are set, the effect is as if
       only the O_SYNC flag was set.

       If <i>path</i> refers to a STREAMS file, <i>oflag</i> may be constructed from
       O_NONBLOCK OR'ed with either O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR. Other
       flag values are not applicable to STREAMS devices and shall have
       no effect on them. The value O_NONBLOCK affects the operation of
       STREAMS drivers and certain functions applied to file descriptors
       associated with STREAMS files. For STREAMS drivers, the
       implementation of O_NONBLOCK is device-specific.

       The application shall ensure that it specifies the O_TTY_INIT
       flag on the first open of a terminal device since system boot or
       since the device was closed by the process that last had it open.
       The application need not specify the O_TTY_INIT flag when opening
       pseudo-terminals.  If <i>path</i> names the master side of a pseudo-
       terminal device, then it is unspecified whether <i>open</i>() locks the
       slave side so that it cannot be opened. Conforming applications
       shall call <i>unlockpt</i>() before opening the slave side.

       The largest value that can be represented correctly in an object
       of type <b>off_t </b>shall be established as the offset maximum in the
       open file description.

       The <i>openat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>open</i>() function
       except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a relative path. In this
       case the file to be opened is determined relative to the
       directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the
       current working directory. If the access mode of the open file
       description associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH,
       the function shall check whether directory searches are permitted
       using the current permissions of the directory underlying the
       file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function
       shall not perform the check.

       The <i>oflag</i> parameter and the optional fourth parameter correspond
       exactly to the parameters of <i>open</i>().

       If <i>openat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to <i>open</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall open the file
       and return a non-negative integer representing the file
       descriptor.  Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error. If -1 is returned, no files shall be
       created or modified.

              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The <i>path</i> argument names a STREAMS file and the system is
              unable to allocate resources.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument names a socket.

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is
              being executed and <i>oflag</i> is O_WRONLY or O_RDWR.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Opening a File for Writing by the Owner</b>
       The following example opens the file <b>/tmp/file</b>, either by
       creating it (if it does not already exist), or by truncating its
       length to 0 (if it does exist). In the former case, if the call
       creates a new file, the access permission bits in the file mode
       of the file are set to permit reading and writing by the owner,
       and to permit reading only by group members and others.

       If the call to <i>open</i>() is successful, the file is opened for
       writing.

           #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
           ...
           int fd;
           mode_t mode = S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH;
           char *pathname = "/tmp/file";
           ...
           fd = open(pathname, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, mode);
           ...

   <b>Opening a File Using an Existence Check</b>
       The following example uses the <i>open</i>() function to try to create
       the <b>LOCKFILE </b>file and open it for writing. Since the <i>open</i>()
       function specifies the O_EXCL flag, the call fails if the file
       already exists. In that case, the program assumes that someone
       else is updating the password file and exits.

           #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

           #define LOCKFILE "/etc/ptmp"
           ...
           int pfd; /* Integer for file descriptor returned by open() call. */
           ...
           if ((pfd = open(LOCKFILE, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL,
               S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH)) == -1)
           {
               fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open /etc/ptmp. Try again later.\n");
               exit(1);
           }
           ...

   <b>Opening a File for Writing</b>
       The following example opens a file for writing, creating the file
       if it does not already exist. If the file does exist, the system
       truncates the file to zero bytes.

           #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

           #define LOCKFILE "/etc/ptmp"
           ...
           int pfd;
           char pathname[PATH_MAX+1];
           ...
           if ((pfd = open(pathname, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC,
               S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH)) == -1)
           {
               perror("Cannot open output file\n"); exit(1);
           }
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1‐2008 does not require that terminal parameters be
       automatically set to any state on first open, nor that they be
       reset after the last close. It is possible for a non-conforming
       application to leave a terminal device in a state where the next
       process to use that device finds it in a non-conforming state,
       but has no way of determining this. To ensure that the device is
       set to a conforming initial state, applications which perform a
       first open of a terminal (other than a pseudo-terminal) should do
       so using the O_TTY_INIT flag to set the parameters associated
       with the terminal to a conforming state.

       Except as specified in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the flags
       allowed in <i>oflag</i> are not mutually-exclusive and any number of
       them may be used simultaneously. Not all combinations of flags
       make sense. For example, using O_SEARCH | O_CREAT will
       successfully open a pre-existing directory for searching, but if
       there is no existing file by that name, then it is unspecified
       whether a regular file will be created. Likewise, if a non-
       directory file descriptor is successfully returned, it is
       unspecified whether that descriptor will have execute permissions
       as if by O_EXEC (note that it is unspecified whether O_EXEC and
       O_SEARCH have the same value).
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Some implementations permit opening FIFOs with O_RDWR. Since
       FIFOs could be implemented in other ways, and since two file
       descriptors can be used to the same effect, this possibility is
       left as undefined.

       See <a href="getgroups.3p.html">getgroups(3p)</a> about the group of a newly created file.

       The use of <i>open</i>() to create a regular file is preferable to the
       use of <i>creat</i>(), because the latter is redundant and included only
       for historical reasons.

       The use of the O_TRUNC flag on FIFOs and directories (pipes
       cannot be <i>open</i>()-ed) must be permissible without unexpected side-
       effects (for example, <i>creat</i>() on a FIFO must not remove data).
       Since terminal special files might have type-ahead data stored in
       the buffer, O_TRUNC should not affect their content, particularly
       if a program that normally opens a regular file should open the
       current controlling terminal instead. Other file types,
       particularly implementation-defined ones, are left
       implementation-defined.

       POSIX.1‐2008 permits <b>[EACCES] </b>to be returned for conditions other
       than those explicitly listed.

       The O_NOCTTY flag was added to allow applications to avoid
       unintentionally acquiring a controlling terminal as a side-effect
       of opening a terminal file. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not
       specify how a controlling terminal is acquired, but it allows an
       implementation to provide this on <i>open</i>() if the O_NOCTTY flag is
       not set and other conditions specified in the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i>
       are met.

       In historical implementations the value of O_RDONLY is zero.
       Because of that, it is not possible to detect the presence of
       O_RDONLY and another option. Future implementations should encode
       O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY as bit flags so that:

           O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY == O_RDWR

       O_EXEC and O_SEARCH are specified as two of the five file access
       modes.  Since O_EXEC does not apply to directories, and O_SEARCH
       only applies to directories, their values need not be distinct.
       Since O_RDONLY has historically had the value zero,
       implementations are not able to distinguish between O_SEARCH and
       O_SEARCH | O_RDONLY, and similarly for O_EXEC.

       In general, the <i>open</i>() function follows the symbolic link if <i>path</i>
       names a symbolic link. However, the <i>open</i>() function, when called
       with O_CREAT and O_EXCL, is required to fail with <b>[EEXIST] </b>if
       <i>path</i> names an existing symbolic link, even if the symbolic link
       refers to a nonexistent file. This behavior is required so that
       privileged applications can create a new file in a known location
       without the possibility that a symbolic link might cause the file
       to be created in a different location.

       For example, a privileged application that must create a file
       with a predictable name in a user-writable directory, such as the
       user's home directory, could be compromised if the user creates a
       symbolic link with that name that refers to a nonexistent file in
       a system directory. If the user can influence the contents of a
       file, the user could compromise the system by creating a new
       system configuration or spool file that would then be interpreted
       by the system. The test for a symbolic link which refers to a
       nonexisting file must be atomic with the creation of a new file.

       In addition, the <i>open</i>() function refuses to open non-directories
       if the O_DIRECTORY flag is set. This avoids race conditions
       whereby a user might compromise the system by substituting a hard
       link to a sensitive file (e.g., a device or a FIFO) while a
       privileged application is running, where opening a file even for
       read access might have undesirable side-effects.

       In addition, the <i>open</i>() function does not follow symbolic links
       if the O_NOFOLLOW flag is set.  This avoids race conditions
       whereby a user might compromise the system by substituting a
       symbolic link to a sensitive file (e.g., a device) while a
       privileged application is running, where opening a file even for
       read access might have undesirable side-effects.

       The POSIX.1‐1990 standard required that the group ID of a newly
       created file be set to the group ID of its parent directory or to
       the effective group ID of the creating process. FIPS 151‐2
       required that implementations provide a way to have the group ID
       be set to the group ID of the containing directory, but did not
       prohibit implementations also supporting a way to set the group
       ID to the effective group ID of the creating process.  Conforming
       applications should not assume which group ID will be used. If it
       matters, an application can use <i>chown</i>() to set the group ID after
       the file is created, or determine under what conditions the
       implementation will set the desired group ID.

       The purpose of the <i>openat</i>() function is to enable opening files
       in directories other than the current working directory without
       exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could
       be changed in parallel to a call to <i>open</i>(), resulting in
       unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for the target
       directory and using the <i>openat</i>() function it can be guaranteed
       that the opened file is located relative to the desired
       directory. Some implementations use the <i>openat</i>() function for
       other purposes as well. In some cases, if the <i>oflag</i> parameter has
       the O_XATTR bit set, the returned file descriptor provides access
       to extended attributes. This functionality is not standardized
       here.
