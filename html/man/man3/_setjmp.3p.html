PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       _longjmp, _setjmp — non-local goto
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;

       void _longjmp(jmp_buf <i>env</i>, int <i>val</i>);
       int _setjmp(jmp_buf <i>env</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>_longjmp</i>() and <i>_setjmp</i>() functions shall be equivalent to
       <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>setjmp</i>(), respectively, with the additional
       restriction that <i>_longjmp</i>() and <i>_setjmp</i>() shall not manipulate
       the signal mask.

       If <i>_longjmp</i>() is called even though <i>env</i> was never initialized by
       a call to <i>_setjmp</i>(), or when the last such call was in a function
       that has since returned, the results are undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Refer to <a href="longjmp.3p.html">longjmp(3p)</a> and <a href="setjmp.3p.html">setjmp(3p)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>_longjmp</i>() is executed and the environment in which <i>_setjmp</i>()
       was executed no longer exists, errors can occur. The conditions
       under which the environment of the <i>_setjmp</i>() no longer exists
       include exiting the function that contains the <i>_setjmp</i>() call,
       and exiting an inner block with temporary storage. This condition
       might not be detectable, in which case the <i>_longjmp</i>() occurs and,
       if the environment no longer exists, the contents of the
       temporary storage of an inner block are unpredictable. This
       condition might also cause unexpected process termination. If the
       function has returned, the results are undefined.

       Passing <i>longjmp</i>() a pointer to a buffer not created by <i>setjmp</i>(),
       passing <i>_longjmp</i>() a pointer to a buffer not created by
       <i>_setjmp</i>(), passing <i>siglongjmp</i>() a pointer to a buffer not created
       by <i>sigsetjmp</i>(), or passing any of these three functions a buffer
       that has been modified by the user can cause all the problems
       listed above, and more.

       The <i>_longjmp</i>() and <i>_setjmp</i>() functions are included to support
       programs written to historical system interfaces. New
       applications should use <i>siglongjmp</i>() and <i>sigsetjmp</i>()
       respectively.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>_longjmp</i>() and <i>_setjmp</i>() functions may be removed in a future
       version.
