NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sigaltstack — set and get signal alternate stack context
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int sigaltstack(const stack_t *restrict <i>ss</i>, stack_t *restrict <i>oss</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigaltstack</i>() function allows a process to define and examine
       the state of an alternate stack for signal handlers for the
       current thread. Signals that have been explicitly declared to
       execute on the alternate stack shall be delivered on the
       alternate stack.

       If <i>ss</i> is not a null pointer, it points to a <b>stack_t </b>structure
       that specifies the alternate signal stack that shall take effect
       upon return from <i>sigaltstack</i>().  The <i>ss_flags</i> member specifies
       the new stack state. If it is set to SS_DISABLE, the stack is
       disabled and <i>ss_sp</i> and <i>ss_size</i> are ignored. Otherwise, the stack
       shall be enabled, and the <i>ss_sp</i> and <i>ss_size</i> members specify the
       new address and size of the stack.

       The range of addresses starting at <i>ss_sp</i> up to but not including
       <i>ss_sp</i>+<i>ss_size</i> is available to the implementation for use as the
       stack. This function makes no assumptions regarding which end is
       the stack base and in which direction the stack grows as items
       are pushed.

       If <i>oss</i> is not a null pointer, upon successful completion it shall
       point to a <b>stack_t </b>structure that specifies the alternate signal
       stack that was in effect prior to the call to <i>sigaltstack</i>().  The
       <i>ss_sp</i> and <i>ss_size</i> members specify the address and size of that
       stack. The <i>ss_flags</i> member specifies the stack's state, and may
       contain one of the following values:

       SS_ONSTACK  The process is currently executing on the alternate
                   signal stack.  Attempts to modify the alternate
                   signal stack while the process is executing on it
                   fail. This flag shall not be modified by processes.

       SS_DISABLE  The alternate signal stack is currently disabled.

       The value SIGSTKSZ is a system default specifying the number of
       bytes that would be used to cover the usual case when manually
       allocating an alternate stack area. The value MINSIGSTKSZ is
       defined to be the minimum stack size for a signal handler. In
       computing an alternate stack size, a program should add that
       amount to its stack requirements to allow for the system
       implementation overhead. The constants SS_ONSTACK, SS_DISABLE,
       SIGSTKSZ, and MINSIGSTKSZ are defined in <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>.

       After a successful call to one of the <i>exec</i> functions, there are
       no alternate signal stacks in the new process image.

       In some implementations, a signal (whether or not indicated to
       execute on the alternate stack) shall always execute on the
       alternate stack if it is delivered while another signal is being
       caught using the alternate stack.

       Use of this function by library threads that are not bound to
       kernel-scheduled entities results in undefined behavior.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>sigaltstack</i>() shall return 0;
       otherwise, it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigaltstack</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>ss</i> argument is not a null pointer, and the <i>ss_flags</i>
              member pointed to by <i>ss</i> contains flags other than
              SS_DISABLE.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The size of the alternate stack area is less than
              MINSIGSTKSZ.

       <b>EPERM  </b>An attempt was made to modify an active stack.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Allocating Memory for an Alternate Stack</b>
       The following example illustrates a method for allocating memory
       for an alternate stack.

           #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
           ...
           if ((sigstk.ss_sp = malloc(SIGSTKSZ)) == NULL)
               /* Error return. */
           sigstk.ss_size = SIGSTKSZ;
           sigstk.ss_flags = 0;
           if (sigaltstack(&amp;sigstk,(stack_t *)0) &lt; 0)
               perror("sigaltstack");
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       On some implementations, stack space is automatically extended as
       needed. On those implementations, automatic extension is
       typically not available for an alternate stack. If the stack
       overflows, the behavior is undefined.
