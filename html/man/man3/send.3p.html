NAME </h2>
<pre>
       send — send a message on a socket
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       ssize_t send(int <i>socket</i>, const void *<i>buffer</i>, size_t <i>length</i>, int <i>flags</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>send</i>() function shall initiate transmission of a message from
       the specified socket to its peer. The <i>send</i>() function shall send
       a message only when the socket is connected. If the socket is a
       connectionless-mode socket, the message shall be sent to the pre-
       specified peer address.

       The <i>send</i>() function takes the following arguments:

       <i>socket</i>      Specifies the socket file descriptor.

       <i>buffer</i>      Points to the buffer containing the message to send.

       <i>length</i>      Specifies the length of the message in bytes.

       <i>flags</i>       Specifies the type of message transmission. Values of
                   this argument are formed by logically OR'ing zero or
                   more of the following flags:

                   MSG_EOR       Terminates a record (if supported by
                                 the protocol).

                   MSG_OOB       Sends out-of-band data on sockets that
                                 support out-of-band communications. The
                                 significance and semantics of out-of-
                                 band data are protocol-specific.

                   MSG_NOSIGNAL  Requests not to send the SIGPIPE signal
                                 if an attempt to send is made on a
                                 stream-oriented socket that is no
                                 longer connected. The <b>[EPIPE] </b>error
                                 shall still be returned.

       The length of the message to be sent is specified by the <i>length</i>
       argument. If the message is too long to pass through the
       underlying protocol, <i>send</i>() shall fail and no data shall be
       transmitted.

       Successful completion of a call to <i>send</i>() does not guarantee
       delivery of the message. A return value of -1 indicates only
       locally-detected errors.

       If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the
       message to be transmitted, and the socket file descriptor does
       not have O_NONBLOCK set, <i>send</i>() shall block until space is
       available. If space is not available at the sending socket to
       hold the message to be transmitted, and the socket file
       descriptor does have O_NONBLOCK set, <i>send</i>() shall fail. The
       <i>select</i>() and <i>poll</i>() functions can be used to determine when it is
       possible to send more data.

       The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate
       privileges to use the <i>send</i>() function.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>send</i>() shall return the number of
       bytes sent. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>send</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and the
              requested operation would block.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>socket</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.

       <b>EDESTADDRREQ</b>
              The socket is not connection-mode and no peer address is
              set.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal interrupted <i>send</i>() before any data was
              transmitted.

       <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              The message is too large to be sent all at once, as the
              socket requires.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              The socket is not connected.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <i>socket</i> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The <i>socket</i> argument is associated with a socket that does
              not support one or more of the values set in <i>flags</i>.

       <b>EPIPE  </b>The socket is shut down for writing, or the socket is
              connection-mode and is no longer connected. In the latter
              case, and if the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM or
              SOCK_SEQPACKET and the MSG_NOSIGNAL flag is not set, the
              SIGPIPE signal is generated to the calling thread.

       The <i>send</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The calling process does not have appropriate privileges.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
              file system.

       <b>ENETDOWN</b>
              The local network interface used to reach the destination
              is down.

       <b>ENETUNREACH</b>
              No route to the network is present.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to
              perform the operation.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the <i>socket</i> argument refers to a connection-mode socket, the
       <i>send</i>() function is equivalent to <i>sendto</i>() (with any value for the
       <i>dest_addr</i> and <i>dest_len</i> arguments, as they are ignored in this
       case). If the <i>socket</i> argument refers to a socket and the <i>flags</i>
       argument is 0, the <i>send</i>() function is equivalent to <i>write</i>().
