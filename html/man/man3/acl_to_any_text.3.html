NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>acl_to_any_text </b>— convert an ACL to text
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;<i>sys/types.h</i>&gt; &lt;<i>acl/libacl.h</i>&gt; <i>char *</i> <b>acl_to_any_text</b>(<i>acl_t acl</i>,
       <i>const char *prefix</i>, <i>char separator</i>, <i>int options</i>)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>acl_to_any_text</b>() function translates the ACL pointed to by
       the argument <i>acl</i> into a <b>NULL </b>terminated character string. This
       character string is composed of the ACL entries contained in <i>acl</i>,
       in the entry text format described on <i>acl</i>(5).  Entries are
       separated from each other by the <i>separator</i> character. If the
       argument <i>prefix</i> is not <b>(const char *)NULL</b>, each entry is prefixed
       by this character string.

       If the argument <i>options</i> is <b>0</b>, ACL entries are converted using the
       entry tag type keywords <b>user</b>, <b>group</b>, <b>mask</b>, and <b>other</b>.  User IDs
       and group IDs of ACL entries that contain such qualifiers are
       converted to their corresponding names; if an identifier has no
       corresponding name, a decimal number string is produced. The ACL
       text representation contains no additional comments.  A bitwise
       combinations of the following <i>options</i> can be used to modify the
       result:

       TEXT_ABBREVIATE
               Instead of the full tag type keywords, single letter
               abbreviations are used.  The abbreviation for <b>user </b>is <b>u</b>,
               the abbreviation for <b>group </b>is <b>g</b>, the abbreviation for
               <b>mask </b>is <b>m</b>, and the abbreviation for <b>other </b>is <b>o</b>.

       TEXT_NUMERIC_IDS
               User IDs and group IDs are included as decimal numbers
               instead of names.

       TEXT_SOME_EFFECTIVE
               A comment containing the effective permissions of the ACL
               entry is included after ACL entries that contain
               permissions which are ineffective because they are masked
               by an ACL_MASK entry. The ACL entry and the comment are
               separated by a tab character.

       TEXT_ALL_EFFECTIVE
               A comment containing the effective permissions of the ACL
               entry is included after all ACL entries that are affected
               by an ACL_MASK entry.  The comment is included even if
               the permissions contained in the ACL entry equal the
               effective permissions. The ACL entry and the comment are
               separated by a tab character.

       TEXT_SMART_INDENT
               This option is used in combination with the
               TEXT_SOME_EFFECTIVE or TEXT_ALL_EFFECTIVE option. The
               number of tab characters inserted between the ACL entry
               and the comment is increased so that the comment is
               aligned to the fourth tab stop position.  A tab width of
               8 characters is assumed.

       The ACL referred to by <i>acl</i> is not changed.

       This function allocates any memory necessary to contain the
       string and returns a pointer to the string.  The caller should
       free any releasable memory, when the new string is no longer
       required, by calling <b>acl_free</b>() with the <i>(void*)char</i> returned by
       <b>acl_to_any_text</b>() as an argument.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, this function returns a pointer to the text
       representation of the ACL.  On error, a value of <b>(char *)NULL </b>is
       returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set appropriately.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If any of the following conditions occur, the <b>acl_to_any_text</b>()
       function returns a value of <b>(char *)NULL </b>and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the
       corresponding value:

       [EINVAL]           The argument <i>acl</i> is not a valid pointer to an
                          ACL.

                          The ACL referenced by <i>acl</i> contains one or more
                          improperly formed ACL entries, or for some
                          other reason cannot be translated into the
                          text form of an ACL.

       [ENOMEM]           The character string to be returned requires
                          more memory than is allowed by the hardware or
                          system-imposed memory management constraints.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       This is a non-portable, Linux specific extension to the ACL
       manipulation functions defined in IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17
       (“POSIX.1e”, abandoned).
