NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_adl_grt - support for Intel Alderlake Gracemont (P-
       core) core PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: adl_grt</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Alderlake Goldencove (E-core)</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Alderlake Gracemont (E-core) core
       PMU. It should be noted that this PMU model only covers each
       core's PMU and not the socket level PMU.  Because the processor
       uses a hybrid architecture with a P-Core and E-Core with a
       different PMU model, it may be necessary to force a PMU instance
       name to get the desired encoding. For instance, to encode for the
       P-Core adl_grt::BR_INST_RETIRED and for the E-core
       adl_grt::BR_INST_RETIRED.

       On Adlerlake Gracemont (P-Core), there are 6 generic counters and
       3 fixed counters.

       The <b>pfm_get_pmu_info() </b>function returns the maximum number of
       generic counters in <b>num_cntrs</b>.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel SapphireRapid
       processors:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a counter mask modifier (m) with a value greater or equal
              to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       <b>ldlat  </b>Pass a latency threshold in core cycles to the
              MEM_TRANS_RETIRED:LOAD_LATENCY event.  This is an integer
              attribute that must be in the range [1:65535]. It is
              required for this event. The library provides a set of
              presets for specific latencies, such as 128.  Note that
              the event <b>must </b>be used with precise sampling (PEBS).
</pre> <h2>
OFFCORE_RESPONSE events </h2>
<pre>
       Intel Alderlake Gracemont (E-Core) supports two encodings for
       offcore_response events (0x1b7, 0x2b7). In the library, these are
       called OCR0 and OCR1. The two encodings are equivalent. On Linux,
       the kernel can schedule any OCR encoding into any of the two OCR
       counters.  The offcore_response events are exposed as a normal
       events by the library. The extra settings are exposed as regular
       umasks. The library takes care of encoding the events according
       to the underlying kernel interface.

       On Intel Alderlake Gracemont (E-Core), the event is treated as a
       regular event with a flat set of umasks to choose from.  It is
       not possible to combine the various requests, supplier, snoop
       bits anymore. The library offers the list of validated
       combinations as per Intel's official event list.
