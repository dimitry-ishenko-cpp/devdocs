DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Under normal circumstances every UNIX program has three streams
       opened for it when it starts up, one for input, one for output,
       and one for printing diagnostic or error messages.  These are
       typically attached to the user's terminal (see <a href="../man4/tty.4.html">tty(4)</a>) but might
       instead refer to files or other devices, depending on what the
       parent process chose to set up.  (See also the "Redirection"
       section of <b>sh</b>(1).)

       The input stream is referred to as "standard input"; the output
       stream is referred to as "standard output"; and the error stream
       is referred to as "standard error".  These terms are abbreviated
       to form the symbols used to refer to these files, namely <i>stdin</i>,
       <i>stdout</i>, and <i>stderr</i>.

       Each of these symbols is a <a href="stdio.3.html">stdio(3)</a> macro of type pointer to
       <i>FILE</i>, and can be used with functions like <a href="fprintf.3.html">fprintf(3)</a> or <a href="fread.3.html">fread(3)</a>.

       Since <i>FILE</i>s are a buffering wrapper around UNIX file descriptors,
       the same underlying files may also be accessed using the raw UNIX
       file interface, that is, the functions like <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</a>.

       On program startup, the integer file descriptors associated with
       the streams <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>, and <i>stderr</i> are 0, 1, and 2,
       respectively.  The preprocessor symbols <b>STDIN_FILENO</b>,
       <b>STDOUT_FILENO</b>, and <b>STDERR_FILENO </b>are defined with these values in
       <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i>.  (Applying <a href="freopen.3.html">freopen(3)</a> to one of these streams can
       change the file descriptor number associated with the stream.)

       Note that mixing use of <i>FILE</i>s and raw file descriptors can
       produce unexpected results and should generally be avoided.  (For
       the masochistic among you: POSIX.1, section 8.2.3, describes in
       detail how this interaction is supposed to work.)  A general rule
       is that file descriptors are handled in the kernel, while stdio
       is just a library.  This means for example, that after an
       <a href="exec.3.html">exec(3)</a>, the child inherits all open file descriptors, but all
       old streams have become inaccessible.

       Since the symbols <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>, and <i>stderr</i> are specified to be
       macros, assigning to them is nonportable.  The standard streams
       can be made to refer to different files with help of the library
       function <a href="freopen.3.html">freopen(3)</a>, specially introduced to make it possible to
       reassign <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>, and <i>stderr</i>.  The standard streams are
       closed by a call to <a href="exit.3.html">exit(3)</a> and by normal program termination.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       C11, POSIX.1-2008.

       The standards also stipulate that these three streams shall be
       open at program startup.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       C89, POSIX.1-2001.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The stream <i>stderr</i> is unbuffered.  The stream <i>stdout</i> is line-
       buffered when it points to a terminal.  Partial lines will not
       appear until <a href="fflush.3.html">fflush(3)</a> or <a href="exit.3.html">exit(3)</a> is called, or a newline is
       printed.  This can produce unexpected results, especially with
       debugging output.  The buffering mode of the standard streams (or
       any other stream) can be changed using the <a href="setbuf.3.html">setbuf(3)</a> or
       <a href="setvbuf.3.html">setvbuf(3)</a> call.  Note that in case <i>stdin</i> is associated with a
       terminal, there may also be input buffering in the terminal
       driver, entirely unrelated to stdio buffering.  (Indeed, normally
       terminal input is line buffered in the kernel.)  This kernel
       input handling can be modified using calls like <a href="tcsetattr.3.html">tcsetattr(3)</a>; see
       also <a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty(1)</a>, and <a href="termios.3.html">termios(3)</a>.
