DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_create</i>() function shall create an active trace
       stream. It allocates all the resources needed by the trace stream
       being created for tracing the process specified by <i>pid</i> in
       accordance with the <i>attr</i> argument. The <i>attr</i> argument represents
       the initial attributes of the trace stream and shall have been
       initialized by the function <i>posix_trace_attr_init</i>() prior to the
       <i>posix_trace_create</i>() call. If the argument <i>attr</i> is NULL, the
       default attributes shall be used. The <i>attr</i> attributes object
       shall be manipulated through a set of functions described in the
       <i>posix_trace_attr</i> family of functions. If the attributes of the
       object pointed to by <i>attr</i> are modified later, the attributes of
       the trace stream shall not be affected. The <i>creation-time</i>
       attribute of the newly created trace stream shall be set to the
       value of the system clock, if the Timers option is not supported,
       or to the value of the CLOCK_REALTIME clock, if the Timers option
       is supported.

       The <i>pid</i> argument represents the target process to be traced. If
       the process executing this function does not have appropriate
       privileges to trace the process identified by <i>pid</i>, an error shall
       be returned. If the <i>pid</i> argument is zero, the calling process
       shall be traced.

       The <i>posix_trace_create</i>() function shall store the trace stream
       identifier of the new trace stream in the object pointed to by
       the <i>trid</i> argument. This trace stream identifier shall be used in
       subsequent calls to control tracing. The <i>trid</i> argument may only
       be used by the following functions:
       <i>posix_trace_clear</i>()                      <i>posix_trace_getnext_event</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_eventid_equal</i>()              <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</i>()           <i>posix_trace_start</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id</i>()   <i>posix_trace_stop</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind</i>()       <i>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_get_attr</i>()                   <i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_get_status</i>()                 <i>posix_trace_trygetnext_event</i>()

       If the Trace Event Filter option is supported, the following
       additional functions may use the <i>trid</i> argument:
       <i>posix_trace_get_filter</i>()   <i>posix_trace_set_filter</i>()

       In particular, notice that the operations normally used by a
       trace analyzer process, such as <i>posix_trace_rewind</i>() or
       <i>posix_trace_close</i>(), cannot be invoked using the trace stream
       identifier returned by the <i>posix_trace_create</i>() function.

       A trace stream shall be created in a suspended state.  If the
       Trace Event Filter option is supported, its trace event type
       filter shall be empty.

       The <i>posix_trace_create</i>() function may be called multiple times
       from the same or different processes, with the system-wide limit
       indicated by the runtime invariant value {TRACE_SYS_MAX}, which
       has the minimum value {_POSIX_TRACE_SYS_MAX}.

       The trace stream identifier returned by the <i>posix_trace_create</i>()
       function in the argument pointed to by <i>trid</i> is valid only in the
       process that made the function call. If it is used from another
       process, that is a child process, in functions defined in
       POSIX.1‐2008, these functions shall return with the error
       <b>[EINVAL]</b>.

       The <i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>() function shall be equivalent to
       <i>posix_trace_create</i>(), except that it associates a trace log with
       this stream. The <i>file_desc</i> argument shall be the file descriptor
       designating the trace log destination. The function shall fail if
       this file descriptor refers to a file with a file type that is
       not compatible with the log policy associated with the trace log.
       The list of the appropriate file types that are compatible with
       each log policy is implementation-defined.

       The <i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>() function shall return in the
       parameter pointed to by <i>trid</i> the trace stream identifier, which
       uniquely identifies the newly created trace stream, and shall be
       used in subsequent calls to control tracing. The <i>trid</i> argument
       may only be used by the following functions:
       <i>posix_trace_clear</i>()                      <i>posix_trace_get_status</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_eventid_equal</i>()              <i>posix_trace_getnext_event</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</i>()           <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id</i>()   <i>posix_trace_start</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind</i>()       <i>posix_trace_stop</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_flush</i>()                      <i>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</i>()
       <i>posix_trace_get_attr</i>()                   <i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>()

       If the Trace Event Filter option is supported, the following
       additional functions may use the <i>trid</i> argument:
       <i>posix_trace_get_filter</i>()   <i>posix_trace_set_filter</i>()

       In particular, notice that the operations normally used by a
       trace analyzer process, such as <i>posix_trace_rewind</i>() or
       <i>posix_trace_close</i>(), cannot be invoked using the trace stream
       identifier returned by the <i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>() function.

       The <i>posix_trace_flush</i>() function shall initiate a flush operation
       which copies the contents of the trace stream identified by the
       argument <i>trid</i> into the trace log associated with the trace stream
       at the creation time. If no trace log has been associated with
       the trace stream pointed to by <i>trid</i>, this function shall return
       an error. The termination of the flush operation can be polled by
       the <i>posix_trace_get_status</i>() function. During the flush
       operation, it shall be possible to trace new trace events up to
       the point when the trace stream becomes full.  After flushing is
       completed, the space used by the flushed trace events shall be
       available for tracing new trace events.

       If flushing the trace stream causes the resulting trace log to
       become full, the trace log full policy shall be applied. If the
       trace <i>log-full-policy</i> attribute is set, the following occurs:

       POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL
             The trace events that have not yet been flushed shall be
             discarded.

       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP
             The trace events that have not yet been flushed shall be
             written to the beginning of the trace log, overwriting
             previous trace events stored there.

       POSIX_TRACE_APPEND
             The trace events that have not yet been flushed shall be
             appended to the trace log.

       The <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>() function shall stop the tracing of
       trace events in the trace stream identified by <i>trid</i>, as if
       <i>posix_trace_stop</i>() had been invoked. The <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>()
       function shall free all the resources associated with the trace
       stream.

       The <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>() function shall not return until all
       the resources associated with the trace stream have been freed.
       When the <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>() function returns, the <i>trid</i>
       argument becomes an invalid trace stream identifier. A call to
       this function shall unconditionally deallocate the resources
       regardless of whether all trace events have been retrieved by the
       analyzer process.  Any thread blocked on one of the
       <i>trace_getnext_event</i>() functions (which specified this <i>trid</i>)
       before this call is unblocked with the error <b>[EINVAL]</b>.

       If the process exits, invokes a member of the <i>exec</i> family of
       functions, or is terminated, the trace streams that the process
       had created and that have not yet been shut down, shall be
       automatically shut down as if an explicit call were made to the
       <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>() function.

       For an active trace stream with log, when the
       <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>() function is called, all trace events that
       have not yet been flushed to the trace log shall be flushed, as
       in the <i>posix_trace_flush</i>() function, and the trace log shall be
       closed.

       When a trace log is closed, all the information that may be
       retrieved later from the trace log through the trace interface
       shall have been written to the trace log. This information
       includes the trace attributes, the list of trace event types
       (with the mapping between trace event names and trace event type
       identifiers), and the trace status.

       In addition, unspecified information shall be written to the
       trace log to allow detection of a valid trace log during the
       <i>posix_trace_open</i>() operation.

       The <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>() function shall not return until all
       trace events have been flushed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value
       of zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error
       number.

       The <i>posix_trace_create</i>() and <i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>()
       functions store the trace stream identifier value in the object
       pointed to by <i>trid</i>, if successful.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_create</i>() and <i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>()
       functions shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>No more trace streams can be started now.  {TRACE_SYS_MAX}
              has been exceeded.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The operation was interrupted by a signal. No trace stream
              was created.

       <b>EINVAL </b>One or more of the trace parameters specified by the <i>attr</i>
              parameter is invalid.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The implementation does not currently have sufficient
              memory to create the trace stream with the specified
              parameters.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have appropriate privileges to trace
              the process specified by <i>pid</i>.

       <b>ESRCH  </b>The <i>pid</i> argument does not refer to an existing process.

       The <i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>file_desc</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor open
              for writing.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>file_desc</i> argument refers to a file with a file type
              that does not support the log policy associated with the
              trace log.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>No space left on device. The device corresponding to the
              argument <i>file_desc</i> does not contain the space required to
              create this trace log.

       The <i>posix_trace_flush</i>() and <i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>() functions
       shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>trid</i> argument does not correspond to an
              active trace stream with log.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>The trace log file has attempted to exceed an
              implementation-defined maximum file size.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>No space left on device.
