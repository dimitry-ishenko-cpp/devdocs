PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stderr, stdin, stdout — standard I/O streams
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       extern FILE *stderr, *stdin, *stdout;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       A file with associated buffering is called a <i>stream</i> and is
       declared to be a pointer to a defined type <b>FILE</b>.  The <i>fopen</i>()
       function shall create certain descriptive data for a stream and
       return a pointer to designate the stream in all further
       transactions. Normally, there are three open streams with
       constant pointers declared in the <i>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</i> header and associated
       with the standard open files.

       At program start-up, three streams shall be predefined and need
       not be opened explicitly: <i>standard input</i> (for reading
       conventional input), <i>standard output</i> (for writing conventional
       output), and <i>standard error</i> (for writing diagnostic output). When
       opened, the standard error stream is not fully buffered; the
       standard input and standard output streams are fully buffered if
       and only if the stream can be determined not to refer to an
       interactive device.

       The following symbolic values in <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> define the file
       descriptors that shall be associated with the C-language <i>stdin</i>,
       <i>stdout</i>, and <i>stderr</i> when the application is started:

       STDIN_FILENO  Standard input value, <i>stdin</i>.  Its value is 0.

       STDOUT_FILENO Standard output value, <i>stdout</i>.  Its value is 1.

       STDERR_FILENO Standard error value, <i>stderr</i>.  Its value is 2.

       The <i>stderr</i> stream is expected to be open for reading and writing.
