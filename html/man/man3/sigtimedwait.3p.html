NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sigtimedwait, sigwaitinfo — wait for queued signals
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int sigtimedwait(const sigset_t *restrict <i>set</i>,
           siginfo_t *restrict <i>info</i>,
           const struct timespec *restrict <i>timeout</i>);
       int sigwaitinfo(const sigset_t *restrict <i>set</i>,
           siginfo_t *restrict <i>info</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>sigwaitinfo</i>()
       except that if none of the signals specified by <i>set</i> are pending,
       <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall wait for the time interval specified in the
       <b>timespec </b>structure referenced by <i>timeout</i>.  If the <b>timespec</b>
       structure pointed to by <i>timeout</i> is zero-valued and if none of the
       signals specified by <i>set</i> are pending, then <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall
       return immediately with an error. If <i>timeout</i> is the null pointer,
       the behavior is unspecified.  If the Monotonic Clock option is
       supported, the CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock shall be used to measure the
       time interval specified by the <i>timeout</i> argument.

       The <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function selects the pending signal from the
       set specified by <i>set</i>.  Should any of multiple pending signals in
       the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX be selected, it shall be the
       lowest numbered one. The selection order between realtime and
       non-realtime signals, or between multiple pending non-realtime
       signals, is unspecified. If no signal in <i>set</i> is pending at the
       time of the call, the calling thread shall be suspended until one
       or more signals in <i>set</i> become pending or until it is interrupted
       by an unblocked, caught signal.

       The <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>sigwait</i>()
       function, except that the return value and the error reporting
       method are different (see RETURN VALUE), and that if the <i>info</i>
       argument is non-NULL, the selected signal number shall be stored
       in the <i>si_signo</i> member, and the cause of the signal shall be
       stored in the <i>si_code</i> member. If any value is queued to the
       selected signal, the first such queued value shall be dequeued
       and, if the <i>info</i> argument is non-NULL, the value shall be stored
       in the <i>si_value</i> member of <i>info</i>.  The system resource used to
       queue the signal shall be released and returned to the system for
       other use. If no value is queued, the content of the <i>si_value</i>
       member is undefined. If no further signals are queued for the
       selected signal, the pending indication for that signal shall be
       reset.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion (that is, one of the signals specified
       by <i>set</i> is pending or is generated) <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() and
       <i>sigtimedwait</i>() shall return the selected signal number.
       Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>No signal specified by <i>set</i> was generated within the
              specified timeout period.

       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() and <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() functions may fail if:

       <b>EINTR  </b>The wait was interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal.
              It shall be documented in system documentation whether
              this error causes these functions to fail.

       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function may also fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>timeout</i> argument specified a <i>tv_nsec</i> value less than
              zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       An implementation should only check for this error if no signal
       is pending in <i>set</i> and it is necessary to wait.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function times out and returns an <b>[EAGAIN]</b>
       error. Application developers should note that this is
       inconsistent with other functions such as
       <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() that return <b>[ETIMEDOUT]</b>.

       Note that in order to ensure that generated signals are queued
       and signal values passed to <i>sigqueue</i>() are available in <i>si_value</i>,
       applications which use <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() or <i>sigtimedwait</i>() need to
       set the SA_SIGINFO flag for each signal in the set (see <i>Section</i>
       <i>2.4</i>, <i>Signal Concepts</i>).  This means setting each signal to be
       handled by a three-argument signal-catching function, even if the
       handler will never be called.  It is not possible (portably) to
       set a signal handler to SIG_DFL while setting the SA_SIGINFO
       flag, because assigning to the <i>sa_handler</i> member of <b>struct</b>
       <b>sigaction </b>instead of the <i>sa_sigaction</i> member would result in
       undefined behavior, and SIG_DFL need not be assignment-compatible
       with <i>sa_sigaction</i>.  Even if an assignment of SIG_DFL to
       <i>sa_sigaction</i> is accepted by the compiler, the implementation need
       not treat this value as special—it could just be taken as the
       address of a signal-catching function.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Existing programming practice on realtime systems uses the
       ability to pause waiting for a selected set of events and handle
       the first event that occurs in-line instead of in a signal-
       handling function. This allows applications to be written in an
       event-directed style similar to a state machine. This style of
       programming is useful for largescale transaction processing in
       which the overall throughput of an application and the ability to
       clearly track states are more important than the ability to
       minimize the response time of individual event handling.

       It is possible to construct a signal-waiting macro function out
       of the realtime signal function mechanism defined in this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017. However, such a macro has to include the
       definition of a generalized handler for all signals to be waited
       on. A significant portion of the overhead of handler processing
       can be avoided if the signal-waiting function is provided by the
       kernel. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 therefore provides two
       signal-waiting functions—one that waits indefinitely and one with
       a timeout—as part of the overall realtime signal function
       specification.

       The specification of a function with a timeout allows an
       application to be written that can be broken out of a wait after
       a set period of time if no event has occurred. It was argued that
       setting a timer event before the wait and recognizing the timer
       event in the wait would also implement the same functionality,
       but at a lower performance level. Because of the performance
       degradation associated with the user-level specification of a
       timer event and the subsequent cancellation of that timer event
       after the wait completes for a valid event, and the complexity
       associated with handling potential race conditions associated
       with the user-level method, the separate function has been
       included.

       Note that the semantics of the <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() function are nearly
       identical to that of the <i>sigwait</i>() function defined by this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017. The only difference is that <i>sigwaitinfo</i>()
       returns the queued signal value in the <i>value</i> argument. The return
       of the queued value is required so that applications can
       differentiate between multiple events queued to the same signal
       number.

       The two distinct functions are being maintained because some
       implementations may choose to implement the POSIX Threads
       Extension functions and not implement the queued signals
       extensions. Note, though, that <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() does not return the
       queued value if the <i>value</i> argument is NULL, so the POSIX Threads
       Extension <i>sigwait</i>() function can be implemented as a macro on
       <i>sigwaitinfo</i>().

       The <i>sigtimedwait</i>() function was separated from the <i>sigwaitinfo</i>()
       function to address concerns regarding the overloading of the
       <i>timeout</i> pointer to indicate indefinite wait (no timeout), timed
       wait, and immediate return, and concerns regarding consistency
       with other functions where the conditional and timed waits were
       separate functions from the pure blocking function. The semantics
       of <i>sigtimedwait</i>() are specified such that <i>sigwaitinfo</i>() could be
       implemented as a macro with a null pointer for <i>timeout</i>.

       The <i>sigwait</i> functions provide a synchronous mechanism for threads
       to wait for asynchronously-generated signals. One important
       question was how many threads that are suspended in a call to a
       <i>sigwait</i>() function for a signal should return from the call when
       the signal is sent. Four choices were considered:

        1. Return an error for multiple simultaneous calls to <i>sigwait</i>
           functions for the same signal.

        2. One or more threads return.

        3. All waiting threads return.

        4. Exactly one thread returns.

       Prohibiting multiple calls to <i>sigwait</i>() for the same signal was
       felt to be overly restrictive. The ``one or more'' behavior made
       implementation of conforming packages easy at the expense of
       forcing POSIX threads clients to protect against multiple
       simultaneous calls to <i>sigwait</i>() in application code in order to
       achieve predictable behavior. There was concern that the ``all
       waiting threads'' behavior would result in ``signal broadcast
       storms'', consuming excessive CPU resources by replicating the
       signals in the general case. Furthermore, no convincing examples
       could be presented that delivery to all was either simpler or
       more powerful than delivery to one.

       Thus, the consensus was that exactly one thread that was
       suspended in a call to a <i>sigwait</i> function for a signal should
       return when that signal occurs. This is not an onerous
       restriction as:

        *  A multi-way signal wait can be built from the single-way
           wait.

        *  Signals should only be handled by application-level code, as
           library routines cannot guess what the application wants to
           do with signals generated for the entire process.

        *  Applications can thus arrange for a single thread to wait for
           any given signal and call any needed routines upon its
           arrival.

       In an application that is using signals for interprocess
       communication, signal processing is typically done in one place.
       Alternatively, if the signal is being caught so that process
       cleanup can be done, the signal handler thread can call separate
       process cleanup routines for each portion of the application.
       Since the application main line started each portion of the
       application, it is at the right abstraction level to tell each
       portion of the application to clean up.

       Certainly, there exist programming styles where it is logical to
       consider waiting for a single signal in multiple threads. A
       simple <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() routine can be constructed to achieve
       this goal. A possible implementation would be to have each
       <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() caller registered as having expressed interest
       in a set of signals.  The caller then waits on a thread-specific
       condition variable. A single server thread calls a <i>sigwait</i>()
       function on the union of all registered signals. When the
       <i>sigwait</i>() function returns, the appropriate state is set and
       condition variables are broadcast. New <i>sigwait_multiple</i>() callers
       may cause the pending <i>sigwait</i>() call to be canceled and reissued
       in order to update the set of signals being waited for.
