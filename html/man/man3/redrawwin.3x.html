DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>refresh/wrefresh</b>
       The  <b>refresh </b>and <b>wrefresh </b>routines (or <b>wnoutrefresh </b>and <b>doupdate</b>)
       must be called to get actual output to  the  terminal,  as  other
       routines merely manipulate data structures.  The routine <b>wrefresh</b>
       copies  the  named window to the <i>physical screen</i>, taking into ac‐
       count what is already there to  do  optimizations.   The  <b>refresh</b>
       routine  is the same, using <b>stdscr </b>as the default window.  Unless
       <b>leaveok</b>(3X) has been enabled, the physical cursor of the terminal
       is left at the location of the cursor for that window.

   <b>wnoutrefresh/doupdate</b>
       The <b>wnoutrefresh </b>and <b>doupdate  </b>routines  allow  multiple  updates
       with more efficiency than <b>wrefresh </b>alone.  In addition to all the
       window  structures, <b>curses </b>keeps two data structures representing
       the terminal screen:

       •   a <i>physical screen</i>, describing what is actually on the screen,
           and

       •   a <i>virtual screen</i>, describing what the programmer wants to
           have on the screen.

       The routine <b>wrefresh </b>works by

       •   first calling <b>wnoutrefresh</b>, which copies the named window to
           the <i>virtual screen</i>, and

       •   then calling <b>doupdate</b>, which compares the <i>virtual screen</i> to
           the <i>physical screen</i> and does the actual update.

       If the programmer wishes to output several windows at once, a se‐
       ries of calls to <b>wrefresh </b>results in alternating calls to
       <b>wnoutrefresh </b>and <b>doupdate</b>, causing several bursts of output to
       the screen.  By first calling <b>wnoutrefresh </b>for each window, it is
       then possible to call <b>doupdate </b>once, resulting in only one burst
       of output, with fewer total characters transmitted and less CPU
       time used.

       If the <i>win</i> argument to <b>wrefresh </b>is the <i>physical screen</i> (i.e., the
       global variable <b>curscr</b>), the screen is immediately cleared and
       repainted from scratch.

       The phrase “copies the named window to the virtual screen” above
       is ambiguous.  What actually happens is that all <i>touched</i>
       (changed) lines in the window are copied to the virtual screen.
       This affects programs that use overlapping windows; it means that
       if two windows overlap, you can refresh them in either order and
       the overlap region will be modified only when it is explicitly
       changed.  (But see the section on <b>PORTABILITY </b>below for a warning
       about exploiting this behavior.)

   <b>wredrawln/redrawwin</b>
       The <b>wredrawln </b>routine indicates to <b>curses </b>that some screen lines
       are corrupted and should be thrown away before anything is writ‐
       ten over them.  It touches the indicated lines (marking them
       changed).  The routine <b>redrawwin </b>touches the entire window.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Routines that return an integer return <b>ERR </b>upon failure, and <b>OK</b>
       (SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than <b>ERR</b>") upon suc‐
       cessful completion.

       X/Open does not define any error conditions.  In this implementa‐
       tion

          <b>wnoutrefresh</b>
               returns an error if the window pointer is null, or if the
               window is really a pad.

          <b>wredrawln</b>
               returns an error if the associated call to <b>touchln </b>re‐
               turns an error.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that <b>refresh </b>and <b>redrawwin </b>may be macros.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.

       Whether <b>wnoutrefresh </b>copies to the virtual screen the entire con‐
       tents of a window or just its changed portions has never been
       well-documented in historic curses versions (including SVr4).  It
       might be unwise to rely on either behavior in programs that might
       have to be linked with other curses implementations.  Instead,
       you can do an explicit <b>touchwin </b>before the <b>wnoutrefresh </b>call to
       guarantee an entire-contents copy anywhere.
