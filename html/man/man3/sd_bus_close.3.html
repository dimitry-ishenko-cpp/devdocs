</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sd_bus_close, sd_bus_flush, sd_bus_default_flush_close - Close
       and flush a bus connection
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;systemd/sd-bus.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void sd_bus_close(sd_bus *</b><i>bus</i><b>);</b>

       <b>int sd_bus_flush(sd_bus *</b><i>bus</i><b>);</b>

       <b>void sd_bus_default_flush_close(void);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_bus_close() </b>disconnects the specified bus connection. When
       this call is invoked and the specified bus object refers to an
       active connection it is immediately terminated. No further
       messages may be sent or received on it. Any messages queued in
       the bus object (both incoming and outgoing) are released. If
       invoked on <b>NULL </b>bus object or when the bus connection is already
       closed this function executes no operation. This call does not
       free or unreference the bus object itself. Use <a href="sd_bus_unref.3.html">sd_bus_unref(3)</a>
       for that.

       <b>sd_bus_flush() </b>synchronously writes out all outgoing queued
       message on a bus connection if there are any. This function call
       may block if the peer is not processing bus messages quickly.

       Before a program exits it is usually a good idea to flush any
       pending messages with <b>sd_bus_flush() </b>and then close connections
       with <b>sd_bus_close() </b>to ensure that no unwritten messages are
       lost, no further messages may be queued and all incoming but
       unprocessed messages are released. After both operations have
       been done, it is a good idea to also drop any remaining
       references to the bus object so that it may be freed. Since these
       three operations are frequently done together a helper call
       <a href="sd_bus_flush_close_unref.3.html">sd_bus_flush_close_unref(3)</a> is provided that combines them into
       one.

       <b>sd_bus_default_flush_close() </b>is similar to
       <b>sd_bus_flush_close_unref()</b>, but does not take a bus pointer
       argument and instead iterates over any of the "default" buses
       opened by <a href="sd_bus_default.3.html">sd_bus_default(3)</a>, <a href="sd_bus_default_user.3.html">sd_bus_default_user(3)</a>,
       <a href="sd_bus_default_system.3.html">sd_bus_default_system(3)</a>, and similar calls.
       <b>sd_bus_default_flush_close() </b>is particularly useful to clean up
       any buses opened using those calls before the program exits.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>sd_bus_flush() </b>returns a non-negative integer. On
       failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-ECHILD</b>
           The bus connection has been created in a different process,
           library or module instance.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
</pre> <h2>
