NAME </h2>
<pre>
       iconv — codeset conversion function
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;iconv.h&gt;

       size_t iconv(iconv_t <i>cd</i>, char **restrict <i>inbuf</i>,
           size_t *restrict <i>inbytesleft</i>, char **restrict <i>outbuf</i>,
           size_t *restrict <i>outbytesleft</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>iconv</i>() function shall convert the sequence of characters
       from one codeset, in the array specified by <i>inbuf</i>, into a
       sequence of corresponding characters in another codeset, in the
       array specified by <i>outbuf</i>.  The codesets are those specified in
       the <i>iconv_open</i>() call that returned the conversion descriptor,
       <i>cd</i>.  The <i>inbuf</i> argument points to a variable that points to the
       first character in the input buffer and <i>inbytesleft</i> indicates the
       number of bytes to the end of the buffer to be converted. The
       <i>outbuf</i> argument points to a variable that points to the first
       available byte in the output buffer and <i>outbytesleft</i> indicates
       the number of the available bytes to the end of the buffer.

       For state-dependent encodings, the conversion descriptor <i>cd</i> is
       placed into its initial shift state by a call for which <i>inbuf</i> is
       a null pointer, or for which <i>inbuf</i> points to a null pointer. When
       <i>iconv</i>() is called in this way, and if <i>outbuf</i> is not a null
       pointer or a pointer to a null pointer, and <i>outbytesleft</i> points
       to a positive value, <i>iconv</i>() shall place, into the output buffer,
       the byte sequence to change the output buffer to its initial
       shift state. If the output buffer is not large enough to hold the
       entire reset sequence, <i>iconv</i>() shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       <b>[E2BIG]</b>.  Subsequent calls with <i>inbuf</i> as other than a null
       pointer or a pointer to a null pointer cause the conversion to
       take place from the current state of the conversion descriptor.

       If a sequence of input bytes does not form a valid character in
       the specified codeset, conversion shall stop after the previous
       successfully converted character. If the input buffer ends with
       an incomplete character or shift sequence, conversion shall stop
       after the previous successfully converted bytes. If the output
       buffer is not large enough to hold the entire converted input,
       conversion shall stop just prior to the input bytes that would
       cause the output buffer to overflow. The variable pointed to by
       <i>inbuf</i> shall be updated to point to the byte following the last
       byte successfully used in the conversion. The value pointed to by
       <i>inbytesleft</i> shall be decremented to reflect the number of bytes
       still not converted in the input buffer. The variable pointed to
       by <i>outbuf</i> shall be updated to point to the byte following the
       last byte of converted output data. The value pointed to by
       <i>outbytesleft</i> shall be decremented to reflect the number of bytes
       still available in the output buffer. For state-dependent
       encodings, the conversion descriptor shall be updated to reflect
       the shift state in effect at the end of the last successfully
       converted byte sequence.

       If <i>iconv</i>() encounters a character in the input buffer that is
       valid, but for which an identical character does not exist in the
       target codeset, <i>iconv</i>() shall perform an implementation-defined
       conversion on this character.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>iconv</i>() function shall update the variables pointed to by the
       arguments to reflect the extent of the conversion and return the
       number of non-identical conversions performed. If the entire
       string in the input buffer is converted, the value pointed to by
       <i>inbytesleft</i> shall be 0. If the input conversion is stopped due to
       any conditions mentioned above, the value pointed to by
       <i>inbytesleft</i> shall be non-zero and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate
       the condition. If an error occurs, <i>iconv</i>() shall return
       (<b>size_t</b>)-1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>iconv</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ </b>Input conversion stopped due to an input byte that does
              not belong to the input codeset.

       <b>E2BIG  </b>Input conversion stopped due to lack of space in the
              output buffer.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Input conversion stopped due to an incomplete character or
              shift sequence at the end of the input buffer.

       The <i>iconv</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>cd</i> argument is not a valid open conversion descriptor.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>inbuf</i> argument indirectly points to the memory area which
       contains the conversion input data. The <i>outbuf</i> argument
       indirectly points to the memory area which is to contain the
       result of the conversion. The objects indirectly pointed to by
       <i>inbuf</i> and <i>outbuf</i> are not restricted to containing data that is
       directly representable in the ISO C standard language <b>char </b>data
       type. The type of <i>inbuf</i> and <i>outbuf</i>, <b>char **</b>, does not imply that
       the objects pointed to are interpreted as null-terminated C
       strings or arrays of characters. Any interpretation of a byte
       sequence that represents a character in a given character set
       encoding scheme is done internally within the codeset converters.
       For example, the area pointed to indirectly by <i>inbuf</i> and/or
       <i>outbuf</i> can contain all zero octets that are not interpreted as
       string terminators but as coded character data according to the
       respective codeset encoding scheme. The type of the data (<b>char</b>,
       <b>short</b>, <b>long</b>, and so on) read or stored in the objects is not
       specified, but may be inferred for both the input and output data
       by the converters determined by the <i>fromcode</i> and <i>tocode</i> arguments
       of <i>iconv_open</i>().

       Regardless of the data type inferred by the converter, the size
       of the remaining space in both input and output objects (the
       <i>intbytesleft</i> and <i>outbytesleft</i> arguments) is always measured in
       bytes.

       For implementations that support the conversion of state-
       dependent encodings, the conversion descriptor must be able to
       accurately reflect the shift-state in effect at the end of the
       last successful conversion. It is not required that the
       conversion descriptor itself be updated, which would require it
       to be a pointer type. Thus, implementations are free to implement
       the descriptor as a handle (other than a pointer type) by which
       the conversion information can be accessed and updated.
