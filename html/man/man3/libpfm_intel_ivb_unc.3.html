NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_ivb_unc - support for Intel Ivy Bridge uncore PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: ivb_unc_cbo0, ivb_unc_cbo1, ivb_unc_cbo2, ivb_unc_cbo3</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Ivy Bridge C-box uncore</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Ivy Bridge client part (model 58)
       uncore PMU.  The support is currently limited to the Coherency
       Box, so called C-Box for up to 4 physical cores.

       Each physical core has an associated C-Box which it uses to
       communicate with the L3 cache. The C-boxes all support the same
       set of events. However, Core 0 C-box (snb_unc_cbo0) supports an
       additional uncore clock ticks event: <b>UNC_CLOCKTICKS</b>.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Ivy Bridge C-Box
       uncore PMU:

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a counter mask modifier (m) with a value greater or equal
              to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       Both the <b>UNC_CBO_CACHE_LOOKUP </b>and <b>UNC_CBO_XSNP_RESPONSE </b>requires
       two umasks to be valid.  For <b>UNC_CBO_CACHE_LOOKUP </b>the first umask
       must be one of the MESI state umasks, the second has to be one of
       the filters.  For <b>UNC_CBO_XSNP_RESPONSE </b>the first umask must be
       one of the snoop types, the second has to be one of the filters.
