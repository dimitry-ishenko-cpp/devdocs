NAME </h2>
<pre>
       readdir, readdir_r — read a directory
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;

       struct dirent *readdir(DIR *<i>dirp</i>);
       int readdir_r(DIR *restrict <i>dirp</i>, struct dirent *restrict <i>entry</i>,
           struct dirent **restrict <i>result</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The type <b>DIR</b>, which is defined in the <i>&lt;dirent.h&gt;</i> header,
       represents a <i>directory stream</i>, which is an ordered sequence of
       all the directory entries in a particular directory. Directory
       entries represent files; files may be removed from a directory or
       added to a directory asynchronously to the operation of
       <i>readdir</i>().

       The <i>readdir</i>() function shall return a pointer to a structure
       representing the directory entry at the current position in the
       directory stream specified by the argument <i>dirp</i>, and position the
       directory stream at the next entry. It shall return a null
       pointer upon reaching the end of the directory stream. The
       structure <b>dirent </b>defined in the <i>&lt;dirent.h&gt;</i> header describes a
       directory entry. The value of the structure's <i>d_ino</i> member shall
       be set to the file serial number of the file named by the <i>d_name</i>
       member. If the <i>d_name</i> member names a symbolic link, the value of
       the <i>d_ino</i> member shall be set to the file serial number of the
       symbolic link itself.

       The <i>readdir</i>() function shall not return directory entries
       containing empty names. If entries for dot or dot-dot exist, one
       entry shall be returned for dot and one entry shall be returned
       for dot-dot; otherwise, they shall not be returned.

       The application shall not modify the structure to which the
       return value of <i>readdir</i>() points, nor any storage areas pointed
       to by pointers within the structure. The returned pointer, and
       pointers within the structure, might be invalidated or the
       structure or the storage areas might be overwritten by a
       subsequent call to <i>readdir</i>() on the same directory stream. They
       shall not be affected by a call to <i>readdir</i>() on a different
       directory stream. The returned pointer, and pointers within the
       structure, might also be invalidated if the calling thread is
       terminated.

       If a file is removed from or added to the directory after the
       most recent call to <i>opendir</i>() or <i>rewinddir</i>(), whether a
       subsequent call to <i>readdir</i>() returns an entry for that file is
       unspecified.

       The <i>readdir</i>() function may buffer several directory entries per
       actual read operation; <i>readdir</i>() shall mark for update the last
       data access timestamp of the directory each time the directory is
       actually read.

       After a call to <i>fork</i>(), either the parent or child (but not both)
       may continue processing the directory stream using <i>readdir</i>(),
       <i>rewinddir</i>(), or <i>seekdir</i>().  If both the parent and child
       processes use these functions, the result is undefined.

       The <i>readdir</i>() function need not be thread-safe.

       Applications wishing to check for error situations should set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to 0 before calling <i>readdir</i>().  If <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to non-zero
       on return, an error occurred.

       The <i>readdir_r</i>() function shall initialize the <b>dirent </b>structure
       referenced by <i>entry</i> to represent the directory entry at the
       current position in the directory stream referred to by <i>dirp</i>,
       store a pointer to this structure at the location referenced by
       <i>result</i>, and position the directory stream at the next entry.

       The storage pointed to by <i>entry</i> shall be large enough for a
       <b>dirent </b>with an array of <b>char </b><i>d_name</i> members containing at least
       {NAME_MAX}+1 elements.

       Upon successful return, the pointer returned at *<i>result</i> shall
       have the same value as the argument <i>entry</i>.  Upon reaching the end
       of the directory stream, this pointer shall have the value NULL.

       The <i>readdir_r</i>() function shall not return directory entries
       containing empty names.

       If a file is removed from or added to the directory after the
       most recent call to <i>opendir</i>() or <i>rewinddir</i>(), whether a
       subsequent call to <i>readdir_r</i>() returns an entry for that file is
       unspecified.

       The <i>readdir_r</i>() function may buffer several directory entries per
       actual read operation; <i>readdir_r</i>() shall mark for update the last
       data access timestamp of the directory each time the directory is
       actually read.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>readdir</i>() shall return a pointer to
       an object of type <b>struct dirent</b>.  When an error is encountered, a
       null pointer shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate
       the error. When the end of the directory is encountered, a null
       pointer shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is not changed.

       If successful, the <i>readdir_r</i>() function shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              One of the values in the structure to be returned cannot
              be represented correctly.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>dirp</i> argument does not refer to an open directory
              stream.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The current position of the directory stream is invalid.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following sample program searches the current directory for
       each of the arguments supplied on the command line.

           #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;
           #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;string.h&gt;

           static void lookup(const char *arg)
           {
               DIR *dirp;
               struct dirent *dp;

               if ((dirp = opendir(".")) == NULL) {
                   perror("couldn't open '.'");
                   return;
               }

               do {
                   errno = 0;
                   if ((dp = readdir(dirp)) != NULL) {
                       if (strcmp(dp-&gt;d_name, arg) != 0)
                           continue;

                       (void) printf("found %s\n", arg);
                       (void) closedir(dirp);
                           return;

                   }
               } while (dp != NULL);

               if (errno != 0)
                   perror("error reading directory");
               else
                   (void) printf("failed to find %s\n", arg);
               (void) closedir(dirp);
               return;
           }

           int main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               int i;
               for (i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++)
                   lookup(argv[i]);
               return (0);
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>readdir</i>() function should be used in conjunction with
       <i>opendir</i>(), <i>closedir</i>(), and <i>rewinddir</i>() to examine the contents of
       the directory.

       The <i>readdir_r</i>() function is thread-safe and shall return values
       in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a static data
       area that may be overwritten by each call.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The returned value of <i>readdir</i>() merely <i>represents</i> a directory
       entry. No equivalence should be inferred.

       Historical implementations of <i>readdir</i>() obtain multiple directory
       entries on a single read operation, which permits subsequent
       <i>readdir</i>() operations to operate from the buffered information.
       Any wording that required each successful <i>readdir</i>() operation to
       mark the directory last data access timestamp for update would
       disallow such historical performance-oriented implementations.

       When returning a directory entry for the root of a mounted file
       system, some historical implementations of <i>readdir</i>() returned the
       file serial number of the underlying mount point, rather than of
       the root of the mounted file system. This behavior is considered
       to be a bug, since the underlying file serial number has no
       significance to applications.

       Since <i>readdir</i>() returns NULL when it detects an error and when
       the end of the directory is encountered, an application that
       needs to tell the difference must set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to zero before the
       call and check it if NULL is returned.  Since the function must
       not change <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> in the second case and must set it to a non-zero
       value in the first case, a zero <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> after a call returning NULL
       indicates end-of-directory; otherwise, an error.

       Routines to deal with this problem more directly were proposed:

           int derror (<i>dirp</i>)
           DIR *<i>dirp</i>;

           void clearderr (<i>dirp</i>)
           DIR *<i>dirp</i>;

       The first would indicate whether an error had occurred, and the
       second would clear the error indication. The simpler method
       involving <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> was adopted instead by requiring that <i>readdir</i>()
       not change <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> when end-of-directory is encountered.

       An error or signal indicating that a directory has changed while
       open was considered but rejected.

       The thread-safe version of the directory reading function returns
       values in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a
       static data area that may be overwritten by each call. Either the
       {NAME_MAX} compile-time constant or the corresponding <i>pathconf</i>()
       option can be used to determine the maximum sizes of returned
       pathnames.
