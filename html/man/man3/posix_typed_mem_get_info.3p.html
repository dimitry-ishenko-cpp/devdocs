<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_typed_mem_get_info — query typed memory information
       (<b>ADVANCED REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int posix_typed_mem_get_info(int <i>fildes</i>,
           struct posix_typed_mem_info *<i>info</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_typed_mem_get_info</i>() function shall return, in the
       <i>posix_tmi_length</i> field of the <b>posix_typed_mem_info </b>structure
       pointed to by <i>info</i>, the maximum length which may be successfully
       allocated by the typed memory object designated by <i>fildes</i>.  This
       maximum length shall take into account the flag
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE or POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG
       specified when the typed memory object represented by <i>fildes</i> was
       opened. The maximum length is dynamic; therefore, the value
       returned is valid only while the current mapping of the
       corresponding typed memory pool remains unchanged.

       If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with neither
       the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag nor the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag specified, the returned
       value of <i>info</i>-&gt;<i>posix_tmi_length</i> is unspecified.

       The <i>posix_typed_mem_get_info</i>() function may return additional
       implementation-defined information in other fields of the
       <b>posix_typed_mem_info </b>structure pointed to by <i>info</i>.

       If the memory object specified by <i>fildes</i> is not a typed memory
       object, then the behavior of this function is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>posix_typed_mem_get_info</i>()
       function shall return zero; otherwise, the corresponding error
       status value shall be returned.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_typed_mem_get_info</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>ENODEV </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not connected to a memory object
              supported by this function.

       This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       An application that needs to allocate a block of typed memory
       with length dependent upon the amount of memory currently
       available must either query the typed memory object to obtain the
       amount available, or repeatedly invoke <i>mmap</i>() attempting to guess
       an appropriate length. While the latter method is existing
       practice with <i>malloc</i>(), it is awkward and imprecise. The
       <i>posix_typed_mem_get_info</i>() function allows an application to
       immediately determine available memory. This is particularly
       important for typed memory objects that may in some cases be
       scarce resources. Note that when a typed memory pool is a shared
       resource, some form of mutual-exclusion or synchronization may be
       required while typed memory is being queried and allocated to
       prevent race conditions.

       The existing <i>fstat</i>() function is not suitable for this purpose.
       We realize that implementations may wish to provide other
       attributes of typed memory objects (for example, alignment
       requirements, page size, and so on).  The <i>fstat</i>() function
       returns a structure which is not extensible and, furthermore,
       contains substantial information that is inappropriate for typed
       memory objects.
