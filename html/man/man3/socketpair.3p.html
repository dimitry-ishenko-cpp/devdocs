NAME </h2>
<pre>
       socketpair — create a pair of connected sockets
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int socketpair(int <i>domain</i>, int <i>type</i>, int <i>protocol</i>,
           int <i>socket_vector</i>[2]);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>socketpair</i>() function shall create an unbound pair of
       connected sockets in a specified <i>domain</i>, of a specified <i>type</i>,
       under the protocol optionally specified by the <i>protocol</i> argument.
       The two sockets shall be identical. The file descriptors used in
       referencing the created sockets shall be returned in
       <i>socket_vector</i>[0] and <i>socket_vector</i>[1].  The file descriptors
       shall be allocated as described in <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>File Descriptor</i>
       <i>Allocation</i>.

       The <i>socketpair</i>() function takes the following arguments:

       <i>domain</i>      Specifies the communications domain in which the
                   sockets are to be created.

       <i>type</i>        Specifies the type of sockets to be created.

       <i>protocol</i>    Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the
                   sockets.  Specifying a <i>protocol</i> of 0 causes
                   <i>socketpair</i>() to use an unspecified default protocol
                   appropriate for the requested socket type.

       <i>socket_vector</i>
                   Specifies a 2-integer array to hold the file
                   descriptors of the created socket pair.

       The <i>type</i> argument specifies the socket type, which determines the
       semantics of communications over the socket. The following socket
       types are defined; implementations may specify additional socket
       types:

       SOCK_STREAM   Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional,
                     connection-mode byte streams, and may provide a
                     transmission mechanism for out-of-band data.

       SOCK_DGRAM    Provides datagrams, which are connectionless-mode,
                     unreliable messages of fixed maximum length.

       SOCK_SEQPACKET
                     Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional,
                     connection-mode transmission paths for records. A
                     record can be sent using one or more output
                     operations and received using one or more input
                     operations, but a single operation never transfers
                     part of more than one record. Record boundaries are
                     visible to the receiver via the MSG_EOR flag.

       If the <i>protocol</i> argument is non-zero, it shall specify a protocol
       that is supported by the address family. If the <i>protocol</i> argument
       is zero, the default protocol for this address family and type
       shall be used. The protocols supported by the system are
       implementation-defined.

       The process may need to have appropriate privileges to use the
       <i>socketpair</i>() function or to create some sockets.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, this function shall return 0;
       otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the
       error, no file descriptors shall be allocated, and the contents
       of <i>socket_vector</i> shall be left unmodified.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>socketpair</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAFNOSUPPORT</b>
              The implementation does not support the specified address
              family.

       <b>EMFILE </b>All, or all but one, of the file descriptors available to
              the process are currently open.

       <b>ENFILE </b>No more file descriptors are available for the system.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The specified protocol does not permit creation of socket
              pairs.

       <b>EPROTONOSUPPORT</b>
              The protocol is not supported by the address family, or
              the protocol is not supported by the implementation.

       <b>EPROTOTYPE</b>
              The socket type is not supported by the protocol.

       The <i>socketpair</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The process does not have appropriate privileges.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to
              perform the operation.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The documentation for specific address families specifies which
       protocols each address family supports. The documentation for
       specific protocols specifies which socket types each protocol
       supports.

       The <i>socketpair</i>() function is used primarily with UNIX domain
       sockets and need not be supported for other domains.
