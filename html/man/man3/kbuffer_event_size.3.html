</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The function <b>kbuffer_read_event() </b>reads the next event in the
       <i>kbuf</i> descriptor and if <i>ts</i> is non NULL, will place its timestamp
       into it. This does not modify the <i>kbuf</i> descriptor, and calling
       this function mulitple times will return the same result.

       The function <b>kbuffer_next_event() </b>will return the next event in
       the <i>kbuf</i> descriptor. It will also set the <i>ts</i> to the timestamp of
       the returned event. NULL is returned if there are no more events
       and <i>ts</i> will be undefined. Note, if this is called directly after
       a <b>kbuffer_load_subbuffer() </b>then it will likely give an unexpected
       result, as it will return the second event and not the first
       event. Usually this function is only used to move to the next
       event and to know if there’s any more events to read, and
       <b>kbuffer_read_event() </b>is always called first.

       The function <b>kbuffer_read_at_offset() </b>returns the event located
       at a given <i>offset</i> from the beginning of the sub-buffer. This
       offset can be retrieved by <b>kbuffer_curr_offset()</b>. If <i>ts</i> points to
       an unsigned long long, then it will be set to the event at the
       given offset’s timestamp.

       If the sub-buffer had missed events before it, then
       <b>kbuffer_missed_events() </b>will return the non zero. If it returns
       -1, that means there were missed events, but the exact number of
       missed events is unknown. If it returns a positive number, then
       the number of missed events is the return value.

       The <b>kbuffer_event_size() </b>function returns the size of the data
       portion of the current event (the one that would be returned by
       <b>kbuffer_read_event()</b>.

       The <b>kbuffer_curr_size() </b>function returns the entire record size
       of the current event (the one that would be returned by
       <b>kbuffer_read_event()</b>. The difference here is that the return
       value includes the size of the event record meta data that is not
       part of what is returned by <b>kbuffer_read_event()</b>.

       The <b>kbuffer_curr_offset() </b>function returns the offset from the
       beginning of the sub-buffer of where the current event’s meta
       data for the record begins. The first event will not be at offset
       zero. This offset can be used to retrieve the event with
       <b>kbuffer_read_at_offset()</b>.

       The <b>kbuffer_curr_index() </b>function returns the index from the
       beginning of the data portion of the sub-buffer where the current
       evnet’s meta data is located. The first event will likely be
       zero, but may not be if there’s a timestamp attached to it.

       The <b>kbuffer_read_buffer() </b>function will fill the given <i>buffer</i>
       from the <i>kbuf</i> the same way the kernel would do a read system
       call. That is, if the length <i>len</i> is less than the sub buffer
       size, or the kbuffer current index is non-zero, it will start
       copying from the <i>kbuf</i> current event and create <i>buffer</i> as a new
       sub buffer (with a timestamp and commit header) with that event
       that was found and including all events after that can fit within
       <i>len</i>. The <i>len</i> must include the size of the sub buffer header as
       well as the events to include. That is, <i>len</i> is the allocate size
       of <i>buffer</i> that can be filled. The return from this function is
       the index of the end of the last event that was added. If there
       are no more events then zero is returned, and if the buffer can
       not copy any events because <i>len</i> was too small, then -1 is
       returned.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>kbuffer_read_event() </b>returns the event that the <i>kbuf</i> descriptor
       is currently at, or NULL if the last event was passed (by
       <b>kbuffer_next_event()</b>).

       <b>kbuffer_next_event() </b>returns the next event after the current
       event or NULL if there are no more events.

       <b>kbuffer_read_at_offset() </b>returns the event at a given <i>offset</i> from
       the start of the sub-buffer stored in <i>kbuf</i>, or NULL if there
       exists no event. Note, <i>offset</i> only needs to be an offset that
       lands on the record, or is at the start of it. It does not need
       to be exactly at the beginning of the record.

       <b>kbuffer_missed_events() </b>returns 0 if there were no missed events
       before loaded sub-buffer. Returns -1 if there were an unknown
       number of missed events, or if the number of missed events is
       known, that number will be returned.

       <b>kbuffer_event_size() </b>returns the size of the data payload of the
       current event of <i>kbuf</i>.

       <b>kbuffer_curr_size() </b>returns the size of the entire record of the
       current event of <i>kbuf</i>. This includes the size of the meta data
       for that record.

       <b>kbuf_curr_offset() </b>returns the offset of the current record from
       the beginning of the <i>kbuf</i> sub-buffer.

       <b>kbuf_curr_index() </b>returns the index of the current record from
       the beginning of the <i>kbuf</i> data section.

       <b>kbuf_read_buffer() </b>returns the index of the end of the last event
       that was filled in <i>buffer</i>. If there are no more events to copy
       from <i>start</i> then 0 is returned. If <i>len</i> is not big enough to hold
       any events, then -1 is returned.
