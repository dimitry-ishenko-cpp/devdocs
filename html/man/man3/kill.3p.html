NAME </h2>
<pre>
       kill — send a signal to a process or a group of processes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int kill(pid_t <i>pid</i>, int <i>sig</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>kill</i>() function shall send a signal to a process or a group
       of processes specified by <i>pid</i>.  The signal to be sent is
       specified by <i>sig</i> and is either one from the list given in
       <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> or 0. If <i>sig</i> is 0 (the null signal), error checking is
       performed but no signal is actually sent. The null signal can be
       used to check the validity of <i>pid</i>.

       For a process to have permission to send a signal to a process
       designated by <i>pid</i>, unless the sending process has appropriate
       privileges, the real or effective user ID of the sending process
       shall match the real or saved set-user-ID of the receiving
       process.

       If <i>pid</i> is greater than 0, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to the process whose
       process ID is equal to <i>pid</i>.

       If <i>pid</i> is 0, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an
       unspecified set of system processes) whose process group ID is
       equal to the process group ID of the sender, and for which the
       process has permission to send a signal.

       If <i>pid</i> is -1, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to all processes (excluding an
       unspecified set of system processes) for which the process has
       permission to send that signal.

       If <i>pid</i> is negative, but not -1, <i>sig</i> shall be sent to all
       processes (excluding an unspecified set of system processes)
       whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of <i>pid</i>, and
       for which the process has permission to send a signal.

       If the value of <i>pid</i> causes <i>sig</i> to be generated for the sending
       process, and if <i>sig</i> is not blocked for the calling thread and if
       no other thread has <i>sig</i> unblocked or is waiting in a <i>sigwait</i>()
       function for <i>sig</i>, either <i>sig</i> or at least one pending unblocked
       signal shall be delivered to the sending thread before <i>kill</i>()
       returns.

       The user ID tests described above shall not be applied when
       sending SIGCONT to a process that is a member of the same session
       as the sending process.

       An implementation that provides extended security controls may
       impose further implementation-defined restrictions on the sending
       of signals, including the null signal. In particular, the system
       may deny the existence of some or all of the processes specified
       by <i>pid</i>.

       The <i>kill</i>() function is successful if the process has permission
       to send <i>sig</i> to any of the processes specified by <i>pid</i>.  If <i>kill</i>()
       fails, no signal shall be sent.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>kill</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>sig</i> argument is an invalid or unsupported
              signal number.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The process does not have permission to send the signal to
              any receiving process.

       <b>ESRCH  </b>No process or process group can be found corresponding to
              that specified by <i>pid</i>.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The semantics for permission checking for <i>kill</i>() differed between
       System V and most other implementations, such as Version 7 or 4.3
       BSD. The semantics chosen for this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 agree
       with System V.  Specifically, a set-user-ID process cannot
       protect itself against signals (or at least not against SIGKILL)
       unless it changes its real user ID.  This choice allows the user
       who starts an application to send it signals even if it changes
       its effective user ID.  The other semantics give more power to an
       application that wants to protect itself from the user who ran
       it.

       Some implementations provide semantic extensions to the <i>kill</i>()
       function when the absolute value of <i>pid</i> is greater than some
       maximum, or otherwise special, value. Negative values are a flag
       to <i>kill</i>().  Since most implementations return <b>[ESRCH] </b>in this
       case, this behavior is not included in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, although a conforming implementation could provide
       such an extension.

       The unspecified processes to which a signal cannot be sent may
       include the scheduler or <i>init</i>.

       There was initially strong sentiment to specify that, if <i>pid</i>
       specifies that a signal be sent to the calling process and that
       signal is not blocked, that signal would be delivered before
       <i>kill</i>() returns. This would permit a process to call <i>kill</i>() and be
       guaranteed that the call never return. However, historical
       implementations that provide only the <i>signal</i>() function make only
       the weaker guarantee in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, because they
       only deliver one signal each time a process enters the kernel.
       Modifications to such implementations to support the <i>sigaction</i>()
       function generally require entry to the kernel following return
       from a signal-catching function, in order to restore the signal
       mask. Such modifications have the effect of satisfying the
       stronger requirement, at least when <i>sigaction</i>() is used, but not
       necessarily when <i>signal</i>() is used. The standard developers
       considered making the stronger requirement except when <i>signal</i>()
       is used, but felt this would be unnecessarily complex.
       Implementors are encouraged to meet the stronger requirement
       whenever possible. In practice, the weaker requirement is the
       same, except in the rare case when two signals arrive during a
       very short window. This reasoning also applies to a similar
       requirement for <i>sigprocmask</i>().

       In 4.2 BSD, the SIGCONT signal can be sent to any descendant
       process regardless of user-ID security checks.  This allows a job
       control shell to continue a job even if processes in the job have
       altered their user IDs (as in the <i>su</i> command). In keeping with
       the addition of the concept of sessions, similar functionality is
       provided by allowing the SIGCONT signal to be sent to any process
       in the same session regardless of user ID security checks. This
       is less restrictive than BSD in the sense that ancestor processes
       (in the same session) can now be the recipient.  It is more
       restrictive than BSD in the sense that descendant processes that
       form new sessions are now subject to the user ID checks. A
       similar relaxation of security is not necessary for the other job
       control signals since those signals are typically sent by the
       terminal driver in recognition of special characters being typed;
       the terminal driver bypasses all security checks.

       In secure implementations, a process may be restricted from
       sending a signal to a process having a different security label.
       In order to prevent the existence or nonexistence of a process
       from being used as a covert channel, such processes should appear
       nonexistent to the sender; that is, <b>[ESRCH] </b>should be returned,
       rather than <b>[EPERM]</b>, if <i>pid</i> refers only to such processes.

       Historical implementations varied on the result of a <i>kill</i>() with
       <i>pid</i> indicating a zombie process. Some indicated success on such a
       call (subject to permission checking), while others gave an error
       of <b>[ESRCH]</b>.  Since the definition of process lifetime in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 covers zombie processes, the <b>[ESRCH] </b>error
       as described is inappropriate in this case and implementations
       that give this error do not conform. This means that an
       application cannot have a parent process check for termination of
       a particular child by sending it the null signal with <i>kill</i>(), but
       must instead use <i>waitpid</i>() or <i>waitid</i>().

       There is some belief that the name <i>kill</i>() is misleading, since
       the function is not always intended to cause process termination.
       However, the name is common to all historical implementations,
       and any change would be in conflict with the goal of minimal
       changes to existing application code.
