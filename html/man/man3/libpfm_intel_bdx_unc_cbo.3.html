NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_bdx_unc_cbo - support for Intel Broadwell Server C-
       Box uncore PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: bdx_unc_cbo[0-21]</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Broadwell Server C-Box uncore PMU</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Broadwell Server C-Box (coherency
       engine) uncore PMU.  This PMU model exists on various Broadwell
       server models (79, 86) . There is one C-box PMU per physical
       core. Therefore there are up to twenty-one identical C-Box PMU
       instances numbered from 0 to 21. On dual-socket systems, the
       number refers to the C-Box PMU on the socket where the program
       runs. For instance, if running on CPU18, then bdx_unc_cbo0 refers
       to the C-Box for physical core 0 on socket 1. Conversely, if
       running on CPU0, then the same bdx_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box
       for physical core 0 but on socket 0.

       Each C-Box PMU implements 4 generic counters and two filter
       registers used only with certain events and umasks.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Broadwell C-Box
       uncore PMU:

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to
              one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t      </b>Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the
              counter counts the number of C-Box cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       <b>nf     </b>Node filter. Certain events, such as UNC_C_LLC_LOOKUP,
              UNC_C_LLC_VICTIMS, provide a <b>NID </b>umask.  Sometimes the <b>NID</b>
              is combined with other filtering capabilities, such as
              opcodes.  The node filter is an 8-bit max bitmask. A node
              corresponds to a processor socket. The legal values
              therefore depend on the underlying hardware configuration.
              For dual-socket systems, the bitmask has two valid bits
              [0:1].

       <b>cf     </b>Core Filter. This is a 5-bit filter which is used to
              filter based on physical core origin of the C-Box request.
              Possible values are 0-63. If the filter is not specified,
              then no filtering takes place. Bit  0-3 indicate  the
              physical core id and bit 4 filters on non thread-related
              data.

       <b>tf     </b>Thread Filter. This is a 1-bit filter which is used to
              filter C-Box requests based on logical processor (hyper-
              thread) identification. Possibles values are 0-1. If the
              filter is not specified, then no filtering takes place.

       <b>nc     </b>Non-Coherent. This is a 1-bit filter which is used to
              filter C-Box requests only for the TOR_INSERTS and
              TOR_OCCUPANCY umasks using the OPCODE matcher. If the
              filter is not specified, then no filtering takes place.

       <b>isoc   </b>Isochronous. This is a 1-bit filter which is used to
              filter C-Box requests only for the TOR_INSERTS and
              TOR_OCCUPANCY umasks using the OPCODE matcher. If the
              filter is not specified, then no filtering takes place.
</pre> <h2>
Opcode filtering </h2>
<pre>
       Certain events, such as UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS supports opcode
       matching on the C-BOX transaction type. To use this feature,
       first an opcode matching umask must be selected, e.g.,
       MISS_OPCODE.  Second, the opcode to match on must be selected via
       a second umask among the OPC_* umasks.  For instance,
       UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS:OPCODE:OPC_RFO, counts the number of TOR
       insertions for RFO transactions.

       Opcode matching may be combined with node filtering with certain
       umasks. In general, the filtering support is encoded into the
       umask name, e.g., NID_OPCODE supports both node and opcode
       filtering. For instance,
       UNC_C_TOR_INSERTS:NID_OPCODE:OPC_RFO:nf=1.
