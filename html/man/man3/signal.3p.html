PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       signal — signal management
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       void (*signal(int <i>sig</i>, void (*<i>func</i>)(int)))(int);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>signal</i>() function chooses one of three ways in which receipt
       of the signal number <i>sig</i> is to be subsequently handled. If the
       value of <i>func</i> is SIG_DFL, default handling for that signal shall
       occur.  If the value of <i>func</i> is SIG_IGN, the signal shall be
       ignored.  Otherwise, the application shall ensure that <i>func</i>
       points to a function to be called when that signal occurs. An
       invocation of such a function because of a signal, or
       (recursively) of any further functions called by that invocation
       (other than functions in the standard library), is called a
       ``signal handler''.

       When a signal occurs, and <i>func</i> points to a function, it is
       implementation-defined whether the equivalent of a:

           signal(<i>sig</i>, SIG_DFL);

       is executed or the implementation prevents some implementation-
       defined set of signals (at least including <i>sig</i>) from occurring
       until the current signal handling has completed. (If the value of
       <i>sig</i> is SIGILL, the implementation may alternatively define that
       no action is taken.) Next the equivalent of:

           (*func)(sig);

       is executed. If and when the function returns, if the value of
       <i>sig</i> was SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV or any other implementation-
       defined value corresponding to a computational exception, the
       behavior is undefined. Otherwise, the program shall resume
       execution at the point it was interrupted. The ISO C standard
       places a restriction on applications relating to the use of
       <i>raise</i>() from signal handlers.  This restriction does not apply to
       POSIX applications, as POSIX.1‐2008 requires <i>raise</i>() to be async-
       signal-safe (see <i>Section 2.4.3</i>, <i>Signal Actions</i>).

       If the process is multi-threaded, or if the process is single-
       threaded and a signal handler is executed other than as the
       result of:

        *  The process calling <i>abort</i>(), <i>raise</i>(), <i>kill</i>(), <i>pthread_kill</i>(),
           or <i>sigqueue</i>() to generate a signal that is not blocked

        *  A pending signal being unblocked and being delivered before
           the call that unblocked it returns

       the behavior is undefined if the signal handler refers to any
       object other than <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> with static storage duration other than
       by assigning a value to an object declared as <b>volatile</b>
       <b>sig_atomic_t</b>, or if the signal handler calls any function defined
       in this standard other than one of the functions listed in
       <i>Section 2.4</i>, <i>Signal Concepts</i>.

       At program start-up, the equivalent of:

           signal(<i>sig</i>, SIG_IGN);

       is executed for some signals, and the equivalent of:

           signal(<i>sig</i>, SIG_DFL);

       is executed for all other signals (see <i>exec</i>).

       The <i>signal</i>() function shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the request can be honored, <i>signal</i>() shall return the value of
       <i>func</i> for the most recent call to <i>signal</i>() for the specified
       signal <i>sig</i>.  Otherwise, SIG_ERR shall be returned and a positive
       value shall be stored in <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>signal</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>sig</i> argument is not a valid signal number or an
              attempt is made to catch a signal that cannot be caught or
              ignore a signal that cannot be ignored.

       The <i>signal</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>An attempt was made to set the action to SIG_DFL for a
              signal that cannot be caught or ignored (or both).

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigaction</i>() function provides a more comprehensive and
       reliable mechanism for controlling signals; new applications
       should use <i>sigaction</i>() rather than <i>signal</i>().
