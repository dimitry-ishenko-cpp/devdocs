PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fstatvfs, statvfs — get file system information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/statvfs.h&gt;

       int fstatvfs(int <i>fildes</i>, struct statvfs *<i>buf</i>);
       int statvfs(const char *restrict <i>path</i>, struct statvfs *restrict <i>buf</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fstatvfs</i>() function shall obtain information about the file
       system containing the file referenced by <i>fildes</i>.

       The <i>statvfs</i>() function shall obtain information about the file
       system containing the file named by <i>path</i>.

       For both functions, the <i>buf</i> argument is a pointer to a <b>statvfs</b>
       structure that shall be filled. Read, write, or execute
       permission of the named file is not required.

       The following flags can be returned in the <i>f_flag</i> member:

       ST_RDONLY   Read-only file system.

       ST_NOSUID   Setuid/setgid bits ignored by <i>exec</i>.

       It is unspecified whether all members of the <b>statvfs </b>structure
       have meaningful values on all file systems.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>statvfs</i>() shall return 0. Otherwise,
       it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fstatvfs</i>() and <i>statvfs</i>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading the file system.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during execution of the function.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              One of the values to be returned cannot be represented
              correctly in the structure pointed to by <i>buf</i>.

       The <i>fstatvfs</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not an open file descriptor.

       The <i>statvfs</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       The <i>statvfs</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Obtaining File System Information Using fstatvfs()</b>
       The following example shows how to obtain file system information
       for the file system upon which the file named <b>/home/cnd/mod1</b>
       resides, using the <i>fstatvfs</i>() function. The <b>/home/cnd/mod1 </b>file
       is opened with read/write privileges and the open file descriptor
       is passed to the <i>fstatvfs</i>() function.

           #include &lt;sys/statvfs.h&gt;
           #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

           struct statvfs buffer;
           int            status;
           ...
           fildes = open("/home/cnd/mod1", O_RDWR);
           status  = fstatvfs(fildes, &amp;buffer);

   <b>Obtaining File System Information Using statvfs()</b>
       The following example shows how to obtain file system information

           #include &lt;sys/statvfs.h&gt;
