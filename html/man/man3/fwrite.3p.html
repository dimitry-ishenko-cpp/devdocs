PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fwrite — binary output
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       size_t fwrite(const void *restrict <i>ptr</i>, size_t <i>size</i>, size_t <i>nitems</i>,
           FILE *restrict <i>stream</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fwrite</i>() function shall write, from the array pointed to by
       <i>ptr</i>, up to <i>nitems</i> elements whose size is specified by <i>size</i>, to
       the stream pointed to by <i>stream</i>.  For each object, <i>size</i> calls
       shall be made to the <i>fputc</i>() function, taking the values (in
       order) from an array of <b>unsigned char </b>exactly overlaying the
       object. The file-position indicator for the stream (if defined)
       shall be advanced by the number of bytes successfully written. If
       an error occurs, the resulting value of the file-position
       indicator for the stream is unspecified.

       The last data modification and last file status change timestamps
       of the file shall be marked for update between the successful
       execution of <i>fwrite</i>() and the next successful completion of a
       call to <i>fflush</i>() or <i>fclose</i>() on the same stream, or a call to
       <i>exit</i>() or <i>abort</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fwrite</i>() function shall return the number of elements
       successfully written, which may be less than <i>nitems</i> if a write
       error is encountered. If <i>size</i> or <i>nitems</i> is 0, <i>fwrite</i>() shall
       return 0 and the state of the stream remains unchanged.
       Otherwise, if a write error occurs, the error indicator for the
       stream shall be set, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the
       error.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Because of possible differences in element length and byte
       ordering, files written using <i>fwrite</i>() are application-dependent,
       and possibly cannot be read using <i>fread</i>() by a different
       application or by the same application on a different processor.
