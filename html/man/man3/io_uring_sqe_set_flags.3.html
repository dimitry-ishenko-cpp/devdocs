SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;liburing.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void io_uring_sqe_set_flags(struct io_uring_sqe *</b><i>sqe</i><b>,</b>
                                   <b>unsigned </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <a href="io_uring_sqe_set_flags.3.html">io_uring_sqe_set_flags(3)</a> function allows the caller to
       change the behavior of the submission queue entry by specifying
       flags. It enables the <i>flags</i> belonging to the <i>sqe</i> submission queue
       entry param.

       <i>flags</i> is a bit mask of 0 or more of the following values ORed
       together:

       <b>IOSQE_FIXED_FILE</b>
              The file descriptor in the SQE refers to the index of a
              previously registered file or direct file descriptor, not
              a normal file descriptor.

       <b>IOSQE_ASYNC</b>
              Normal operation for io_uring is to try and issue an sqe
              as non-blocking first, and if that fails, execute it in an
              async manner. To support more efficient overlapped
              operation of requests that the application knows/assumes
              will always (or most of the time) block, the application
              can ask for an sqe to be issued async from the start. Note
              that this flag immediately causes the SQE to be offloaded
              to an async helper thread with no initial non-blocking
              attempt.  This may be less efficient and should not be
              used liberally or without understanding the performance
              and efficiency tradeoffs.

       <b>IOSQE_IO_LINK</b>
              When this flag is specified, the SQE forms a link with the
              next SQE in the submission ring. That next SQE will not be
              started before the previous request completes. This, in
              effect, forms a chain of SQEs, which can be arbitrarily
              long. The tail of the chain is denoted by the first SQE
              that does not have this flag set. Chains are not supported
              across submission boundaries. Even if the last SQE in a
              submission has this flag set, it will still terminate the
              current chain. This flag has no effect on previous SQE
              submissions, nor does it impact SQEs that are outside of
              the chain tail. This means that multiple chains can be
              executing in parallel, or chains and individual SQEs. Only
              members inside the chain are serialized. A chain of SQEs
              will be broken if any request in that chain ends in error.

       <b>IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK</b>
              Like <b>IOSQE_IO_LINK , </b>except the links aren't severed if an
              error or unexpected result occurs.

       <b>IOSQE_IO_DRAIN</b>
              When this flag is specified, the SQE will not be started
              before previously submitted SQEs have completed, and new
              SQEs will not be started before this one completes.

       <b>IOSQE_CQE_SKIP_SUCCESS</b>
              Request that no CQE be generated for this request, if it
              completes successfully.  This can be useful in cases where
              the application doesn't need to know when a specific
              request completed, if it completed successfully.

       <b>IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT</b>
              If set, and if the request types supports it, select an IO
              buffer from the indicated buffer group. This can be used
              with requests that read or receive data from a file or
              socket, where buffer selection is deferred until the
              kernel is ready to transfer data, instead of when the IO
              is originally submitted. The application must also set the
              <i>buf_group</i> field in the SQE, indicating which previously
              registered buffer group to select a buffer from.
