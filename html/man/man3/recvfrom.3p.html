       ssize_t recvfrom(int <i>socket</i>, void *restrict <i>buffer</i>, size_t <i>length</i>,

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>recvfrom</i>() function shall receive a message from a
       connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket. It is normally
       used with connectionless-mode sockets because it permits the
       application to retrieve the source address of received data.

       The <i>recvfrom</i>() function takes the following arguments:

       <i>socket</i>      Specifies the socket file descriptor.

       <i>buffer</i>      Points to the buffer where the message should be
                   stored.

       <i>length</i>      Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer pointed
                   to by the <i>buffer</i> argument.

       <i>flags</i>       Specifies the type of message reception. Values of
                   this argument are formed by logically OR'ing zero or
                   more of the following values:

                   MSG_PEEK    Peeks at an incoming message. The data is
                               treated as unread and the next <i>recvfrom</i>()
                               or similar function shall still return
                               this data.

                   MSG_OOB     Requests out-of-band data. The
                               significance and semantics of out-of-band
                               data are protocol-specific.

                   MSG_WAITALL On SOCK_STREAM sockets this requests that
                               the function block until the full amount
                               of data can be returned. The function may
                               return the smaller amount of data if the
                               socket is a message-based socket, if a
                               signal is caught, if the connection is
                               terminated, if MSG_PEEK was specified, or
                               if an error is pending for the socket.

       <i>address</i>     A null pointer, or points to a <b>sockaddr </b>structure in
                   which the sending address is to be stored. The length
                   and format of the address depend on the address
                   family of the socket.

       <i>address_len</i> Either a null pointer, if <i>address</i> is a null pointer,
                   or a pointer to a <b>socklen_t </b>object which on input
                   specifies the length of the supplied <b>sockaddr</b>
                   structure, and on output specifies the length of the
                   stored address.

       The <i>recvfrom</i>() function shall return the length of the message
       written to the buffer pointed to by the <i>buffer</i> argument. For
       message-based sockets, such as SOCK_RAW, SOCK_DGRAM, and
       SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message shall be read in a single
       operation. If a message is too long to fit in the supplied
       buffer, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the <i>flags</i> argument, the excess
       bytes shall be discarded. For stream-based sockets, such as
       SOCK_STREAM, message boundaries shall be ignored. In this case,
       data shall be returned to the user as soon as it becomes
       available, and no data shall be discarded.

       If the MSG_WAITALL flag is not set, data shall be returned only
       up to the end of the first message.

       Not all protocols provide the source address for messages. If the
       <i>address</i> argument is not a null pointer and the protocol provides
       the source address of messages, the source address of the
       received message shall be stored in the <b>sockaddr </b>structure
       pointed to by the <i>address</i> argument, and the length of this
       address shall be stored in the object pointed to by the
       <i>address_len</i> argument.

       If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of
       the supplied <b>sockaddr </b>structure, the stored address shall be
       truncated.

       If the <i>address</i> argument is not a null pointer and the protocol
       does not provide the source address of messages, the value stored
       in the object pointed to by <i>address</i> is unspecified.

       If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is not
       set on the socket's file descriptor, <i>recvfrom</i>() shall block until
       a message arrives. If no messages are available at the socket and
       O_NONBLOCK is set on the socket's file descriptor, <i>recvfrom</i>()
       shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EAGAIN] </b>or <b>[EWOULDBLOCK]</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>recvfrom</i>() shall return the length of
       the message in bytes. If no messages are available to be received
       and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown, <i>recvfrom</i>() shall
       return 0. Otherwise, the function shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>recvfrom</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and no
              data is waiting to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and no
              out-of-band data is available and either the socket's file
              descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK or the socket does not
              support blocking to await out-of-band data.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>socket</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal interrupted <i>recvfrom</i>() before any data was
              available.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data is
              available.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              A receive is attempted on a connection-mode socket that is
              not connected.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <i>socket</i> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The specified flags are not supported for this socket
              type.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The connection timed out during connection establishment,
              or due to a transmission timeout on active connection.

       The <i>recvfrom</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
              file system.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to
              perform the operation.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
