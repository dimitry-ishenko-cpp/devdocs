NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_knc - support for Intel Knights Corner
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: knc</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Knights Corner</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports Intel Knights Corner processors.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Knights Corner
       processors:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       <b>t      </b>Measure on all threads at the same time assuming hyper-
              threading is enabled. This is a boolean modifier.
