DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <a href="io_uring_prep_provide_buffers.3.html">io_uring_prep_provide_buffers(3)</a> function prepares a request
       for providing the kernel with buffers. The submission queue entry
       <i>sqe</i> is setup to consume <i>nr</i> number of <i>len</i> sized buffers starting
       at <i>addr</i> and identified by the buffer group ID of <i>bgid</i> and
       numbered sequentially starting at <i>bid</i>.

       This function sets up a request to provide buffers to the
       io_uring context that can be used by read or receive operations.
       This is done by filling in the SQE <i>buf_group</i> field and setting
       <b>IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT </b>in the SQE <i>flags</i> member. If buffer selection
       is used for a request, no buffer should be provided in the
       address field. Instead, the group ID is set to match one that was
       previously provided to the kernel. The kernel will then select a
       buffer from this group for the IO operation. On successful
       completion of the IO request, the CQE <i>flags</i> field will have
       <b>IORING_CQE_F_BUFFER </b>set and the selected buffer ID will be
       indicated by the upper 16-bits of the <i>flags</i> field.

       Different buffer group IDs can be used by the application to have
       different sizes or types of buffers available. Once a buffer has
       been consumed for an operation, it is no longer known to
       io_uring. It must be re-provided if so desired or freed by the
       application if no longer needed.

       The buffer IDs are internally tracked from <i>bid</i> and sequentially
       ascending from that value. If <b>16 </b>buffers are provided and start
       with an initial <i>bid</i> of 0, then the buffer IDs will range from
       <b>0..15</b>.  The application must be aware of this to make sense of
       the buffer ID passed back in the CQE.

       Buffer IDs always range from <b>0 </b>to <b>65535 , </b>as there are only
       16-bits available in the CQE to pass them back. This range is
       independent of how the buffer group initially got created.
       Attempting to add buffer IDs larger than that, or buffer IDs that
       will wrap when cast to a 16-bit value, will cause the request to
       fail with <b>-E2BIG </b>or <b>-EINVAL .</b>

       Not all requests support buffer selection, as it only really
       makes sense for requests that receive data from the kernel rather
       than write or provide data.  Currently, this mode of operation is
       supported for any file read or socket receive request. Attempting
       to use <b>IOSQE_BUFFER_SELECT </b>with a command that doesn't support it
       will result in a CQE <i>res</i> error of <b>-EINVAL</b>.  Buffer selection will
       work with operations that take a <b>struct iovec </b>as its data
       destination, but only if 1 iovec is provided.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       None
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These are the errors that are reported in the CQE <i>res</i> field. On
       success, <i>res</i> will contain <b>0 </b>or the number of successfully
       provided buffers.

       <b>-ENOMEM</b>
              The kernel was unable to allocate memory for the request.

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
              One of the fields set in the SQE was invalid.

       <b>-E2BIG </b>The number of buffers provided was too big, or the <i>bid</i> was
              too big. A max value of <b>USHRT_MAX </b>buffers can be
              specified.

       <b>-EFAULT</b>
              Some of the user memory given was invalid for the
              application.

       <b>-EOVERFLOW</b>
              The product of <i>len</i> and <i>nr</i> exceed the valid amount or
              overflowed, or the sum of <i>addr</i> and the length of buffers
              overflowed.

       <b>-EBUSY </b>Attempt to update a slot that is already used.
