NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_trace_event, posix_trace_eventid_open — trace functions for
       instrumenting application code (<b>TRACING</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;trace.h&gt;

       void posix_trace_event(trace_event_id_t <i>event_id</i>,
           const void *restrict <i>data_ptr</i>, size_t <i>data_len</i>);
       int posix_trace_eventid_open(const char *restrict <i>event_name</i>,
           trace_event_id_t *restrict <i>event_id</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_event</i>() function shall record the <i>event_id</i> and
       the user data pointed to by <i>data_ptr</i> in the trace stream into
       which the calling process is being traced and in which <i>event_id</i>
       is not filtered out. If the total size of the user trace event
       data represented by <i>data_len</i> is not greater than the declared
       maximum size for user trace event data, then the <i>truncation-</i>
       <i>status</i> attribute of the trace event recorded is
       POSIX_TRACE_NOT_TRUNCATED.  Otherwise, the user trace event data
       is truncated to this declared maximum size and the <i>truncation-</i>
       <i>status</i> attribute of the trace event recorded is
       POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_RECORD.

       If there is no trace stream created for the process or if the
       created trace stream is not running, or if the trace event
       specified by <i>event_id</i> is filtered out in the trace stream, the
       <i>posix_trace_event</i>() function shall have no effect.

       The <i>posix_trace_eventid_open</i>() function shall associate a user
       trace event name with a trace event type identifier for the
       calling process. The trace event name is the string pointed to by
       the argument <i>event_name</i>.  It shall have a maximum of
       {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which has the minimum value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).  The number of user trace event
       type identifiers that can be defined for any given process is
       limited by the maximum value {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}, which has
       the minimum value {POSIX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}.

       If the Trace Inherit option is not supported, the
       <i>posix_trace_eventid_open</i>() function shall associate the user
       trace event name pointed to by the <i>event_name</i> argument with a
       trace event type identifier that is unique for the traced
       process, and is returned in the variable pointed to by the
       <i>event_id</i> argument. If the user trace event name has already been
       mapped for the traced process, then the previously assigned trace
       event type identifier shall be returned. If the per-process user
       trace event name limit represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has
       been reached, the pre-defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see
       <i>Table 2-7</i>, <i>Trace Option: User Trace Event</i>) user trace event shall
       be returned.

       If the Trace Inherit option is supported, the
       <i>posix_trace_eventid_open</i>() function shall associate the user
       trace event name pointed to by the <i>event_name</i> argument with a
       trace event type identifier that is unique for all the processes
       being traced in this same trace stream, and is returned in the
       variable pointed to by the <i>event_id</i> argument. If the user trace
       event name has already been mapped for the traced processes, then
       the previously assigned trace event type identifier shall be
       returned. If the per-process user trace event name limit
       represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the pre-
       defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (<i>Table 2-7</i>, <i>Trace Option:</i>
       <i>User Trace Event</i>) user trace event shall be returned.

       <b>Note:  </b>The above procedure, together with the fact that multiple
              processes can only be traced into the same trace stream by
              inheritance, ensure that all the processes that are traced
              into a trace stream have the same mapping of trace event
              names to trace event type identifiers.

       If there is no trace stream created, the
       <i>posix_trace_eventid_open</i>() function shall store this information
       for future trace streams created for this process.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       No return value is defined for the <i>posix_trace_event</i>() function.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>posix_trace_eventid_open</i>()
       function shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, it shall return
       the corresponding error number. The <i>posix_trace_eventid_open</i>()
       function stores the trace event type identifier value in the
       object pointed to by <i>event_id</i>, if successful.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_eventid_open</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The size of the name pointed to by the <i>event_name</i> argument
              was longer than the implementation-defined value
              {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}.
