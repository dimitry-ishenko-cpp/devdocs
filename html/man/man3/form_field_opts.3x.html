SYNOPSIS </h2>

       <b>#include &lt;form.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int set_field_opts(FIELD *</b><i>field</i><b>, Field_Options </b><i>opts</i><b>);</b>

       <b>int field_opts_on(FIELD *</b><i>field</i><b>, Field_Options </b><i>opts</i><b>);</b>

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The function <b>set_field_opts </b>sets all the given field's option
       bits (field option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).

       The function <b>field_opts_on </b>turns on the given option bits, and
       leaves others alone.

       The function <b>field_opts_off </b>turns off the given option bits, and
       leaves others alone.

       The function <b>field_opts </b>returns the field's current option bits.

       The following standard options are defined (all are on by
       default):

       O_ACTIVE
            The field is visited during processing.  If this option is
            off, the field will not be reachable by navigation keys.
            Please notice that an invisible field appears to be inactive
            also.

       O_AUTOSKIP
            Skip to the next field when this one fills.

       O_BLANK
            The field is cleared whenever a character is entered at the
            first position.

       O_EDIT
            The field can be edited.

       O_NULLOK
            Allow a blank field.

       O_PASSOK
            Validate field only if modified by user.

       O_PUBLIC
            The field contents are displayed as data is entered.

       O_STATIC
            Field buffers are fixed to field's original size.  Turn this
            option off to create a dynamic field.

       O_VISIBLE
            The field is displayed.  If this option is off, display of
            the field is suppressed.

       O_WRAP
            Words that do not fit on a line are wrapped to the next
            line.  Words are blank-separated.

       These extension options are defined (extensions are off by
       default):

       O_DYNAMIC_JUSTIFY
            Permit dynamic fields to be justified, like static fields.

       O_NO_LEFT_STRIP
            Preserve leading whitespace in the field buffer, which is
            normally discarded.

       O_EDGE_INSERT_STAY
            When inserting into a field up to the boundary position,
            optionally delay the scrolling, so that the last inserted
            character remains visible, but advance the cursor to reflect
            the insertion.  This allows the form library to display the
            inserted character in one-character fields as well as
            allowing the library to maintain consistent state.

       O_INPUT_FIELD
            The <b>set_max_field </b>function checks for this extension, which
            allows a dynamic field to shrink if the new limit is smaller
            than the current field size.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Except for <b>field_opts</b>, each routine returns one of the following:

       <b>E_OK </b>The routine succeeded.

       <b>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</b>
            Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       <b>E_CURRENT</b>
            The field is the current field.

       <b>E_SYSTEM_ERROR</b>
            System error occurred (see <a href="errno.3.html">errno(3)</a>).
