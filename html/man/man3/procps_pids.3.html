DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Overview</b>
       Central to this interface is a simple ‘result’ structure
       reflecting an ‘item’ plus its value (in a union with standard C
       language types as members).  All ‘result’ structures are
       automatically allocated and provided by the library.

       By specifying an array of ‘items’, these structures can be
       organized as a ‘stack’, potentially yielding many results with a
       single function call.  Thus, a ‘stack’ can be viewed as a
       variable length record whose content and order is determined
       solely by the user.

       As part of this interface there are two unique enumerators.  The
       ‘noop’ and ‘extra’ items exist to hold user values.  They are
       never set by the library, but the ‘extra’ result will be zeroed
       with each library interaction.

       The pids.h file will be an essential document during user program
       development.  There you will find available items, their return
       type (the ‘result’ struct member name) and the source for such
       values.  Additional enumerators and structures are also
       documented there.

   <b>Usage</b>
       The following would be a typical sequence of calls to this
       interface.

       1. <b>fatal_proc_unmounted()</b>
       2. <b>procps_pids_new()</b>
       3. <b>procps_pids_get()</b>, <b>procps_pids_reap() </b>or <b>procps_pids_select()</b>
       4. <b>procps_pids_unref()</b>

       The <b>get </b>function is an iterator for successive PIDs/TIDs,
       returning those ‘items’ previously identified via <b>new </b>or <b>reset</b>.

       Two functions support unpredictable variable outcomes.  The <b>reap</b>
       function gathers data for all processes while the <b>select </b>function
       deals with specific PIDs or UIDs.  Both can return multiple
       ‘stacks’ each containing multiple ‘result’ structures.
       Optionally, a user may choose to <b>sort </b>such results

       To exploit any ‘stack’, and access individual ‘result’
       structures, a <i>relative_enum</i> is required as shown in the <b>VAL </b>macro
       defined in the header file.  Such values could be hard coded as:
       0 through numitems-1.  However, this need is typically satisfied
       by creating your own enumerators corresponding to the order of
       the ‘items’ array.

   <b>Caveats</b>
       The &lt;pids&gt; API differs from others in that those items of
       interest must be provided at <b>new </b>or <b>reset </b>time, the latter being
       unique to this API.  If either the <i>items</i> or <i>numitems</i> parameter is
       zero at <b>new </b>time, then <b>reset </b>becomes mandatory before issuing any
       other call.

       For the <b>new </b>and <b>unref </b>functions, the address of an <i>info</i> struct
       pointer must be supplied.  With <b>new </b>it must have been initialized
       to NULL.  With <b>unref </b>it will be reset to NULL if the reference
       count reaches zero.

       The <b>get </b>and <b>reap </b>functions use the <i>which</i> parameter to specify
       whether just tasks or both tasks and threads are to be fetched.

       The <b>select </b>function requires an array of PIDs or UIDs as <i>these</i>
       along with <i>numthese</i> to identify which processes are to be
       fetched.  This function then operates as a subset of <b>reap</b>.

       When using the <b>sort </b>function, the parameters <i>stacks</i> and
       <i>numstacked</i> would normally be those returned in the ‘pids_fetch’
       structure.

       Lastly, a <b>fatal_proc_unmounted </b>function may be called before any
       other function to ensure that the /proc/ directory is mounted.
       As such, the <i>info</i> parameter would be NULL and the <i>return_self</i>
       parameter zero.  If, however, some items are desired for the
       issuing program (a <i>return_self</i> other than zero) then the <b>new </b>call
       must precede it to identify the <i>items</i> and obtain the required
       <i>info</i> pointer.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Functions Returning an ‘int’</b>
       An error will be indicated by a negative number that is always
       the inverse of some well known errno.h value.

       Success is indicated by a zero return value.  However, the <b>ref</b>
       and <b>unref </b>functions return the current <i>info</i> structure reference
       count.

   <b>Functions Returning an ‘address’</b>
       An error will be indicated by a NULL return pointer with the
       reason found in the formal errno value.

       Success is indicated by a pointer to the named structure.
       However, if one survives the <b>fatal_proc_unmounted </b>call, NULL is
       always returned when <i>return_self</i> is zero.
</pre> <h2>
DEBUGGING </h2>
<pre>
       To aid in program development, there are two procps-ng provisions
       that can be exploited.

       The first is a supplied file named ‘libproc.supp’ which may be
       useful when developing a <i>multi-threaded</i> application.  When used
       with the valgrind ‘--suppressions=’ option, warnings associated
       with the procps library itself are avoided.

       Such warnings arise because the library handles heap based
       allocations in a thread-safe manner.  A <i>single-threaded</i>
       application will not receive those warnings.

       The second provision can help ensure ‘result’ member references
       agree with library expectations.  It assumes that a supplied
       macro in the header file is used to access the ‘result’ value.

       This feature can be activated through either of the following
       methods and any discrepancies will be written to <b>stderr</b>.

       1) Add CFLAGS='-DXTRA_PROCPS_DEBUG' to any other ./configure
          options your project may employ.

       2) Add #include &lt;libproc2/xtra-procps-debug.h&gt; to any program
          <i>after</i> the #include &lt;libproc2/pids.h&gt;.

       This verification feature incurs substantial overhead.
       Therefore, it is important that it <i>not</i> be activated for a
       production/release build.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE(S) </h2>
<pre>
       The value set for the following is unimportant, just its
       presence.

       LIBPROC_HIDE_KERNEL
              This will hide kernel threads which would otherwise be
              returned with a <b>procps_pids_get</b>, <b>procps_pids_select </b>or
              <b>procps_pids_reap </b>call.
