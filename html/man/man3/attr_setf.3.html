DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>attr_set </b>and <b>attr_setf </b>functions provide a way to create
       attributes and set/change their values.

       <i>Path</i> points to a path name for a filesystem object, and <i>fd</i> refers
       to the file descriptor associated with a file.  If the attribute
       <i>attrname</i> does not exist, an attribute with the given name and
       value will be created and associated with that indicated
       filesystem object.  If an attribute with that name already exists
       on that filesystem object, the existing value is replaced with
       the new value given in this call.  The new attribute value is
       copied from the <i>attrvalue</i> buffer for a total of <i>valuelength</i>
       bytes.  The <i>flags</i> argument can contain the following symbols
       bitwise OR'ed together:

       ATTR_ROOT
              Look for <i>attrname</i> in the <b>root </b>address space, not in the
              <b>user </b>address space.  (limited to use by super-user only)

       ATTR_DONTFOLLOW
              Do not follow symbolic links when resolving a <i>path</i> on an
              <b>attr_set </b>function call.  The default is to follow symbolic
              links.

       ATTR_CREATE
              Return an error (EEXIST) if an attribute of the given name
              already exists on the indicated filesystem object,
              otherwise create an attribute with the given name and
              value.  This flag is used to implement a pure create
              operation, without this flag <b>attr_set </b>will create the
              attribute if it does not already exist.  An error (EINVAL)
              will be returned if both ATTR_CREATE and ATTR_REPLACE are
              set in the same call.

       ATTR_REPLACE
              Return an error (ENOATTR) if an attribute of the given
              name does not already exist on the indicated filesystem
              object, otherwise replace the existing attribute's value
              with the given value.  This flag is used to implement a
              pure replacement operation, without this flag <b>attr_set</b>
              will create the attribute if it does not already exist.
              An error (EINVAL) will be returned if both ATTR_CREATE and
              ATTR_REPLACE are set in the same call.

       <b>attr_set </b>will fail if one or more of the following are true:

       [ENOATTR]
              The attribute name given is not associated with the
              indicated filesystem object and the ATTR_REPLACE flag bit
              was set.

       [E2BIG]
              The value of the given attribute is too large, it exceeds
              the maximum allowable size of an attribute value.

       [EEXIST]
              The attribute name given is already associated with the
              indicated filesystem object and the ATTR_CREATE flag bit
              was set.

       [ENOENT]
              The named file does not exist.

       [EPERM]
              The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file
              and the effective user ID is not super-user.

       [ENOTDIR]
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EACCES]
              Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix.

       [EINVAL]
              A bit was set in the <i>flag</i> argument that is not defined for
              this system call, or both the ATTR_CREATE and ATTR_REPLACE
              flags bits were set.

       [EFAULT]
              <i>Path, attrname,</i> or <i>attrvalue</i> points outside the allocated
              address space of the process.

       [ELOOP]
              A path name lookup involved too many symbolic links.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
              The length of <i>path</i> exceeds {<i>MAXPATHLEN</i>}, or a pathname
              component is longer than {<i>MAXNAMELEN</i>}.

       <b>attr_setf </b>will fail if:

       [ENOATTR]
              The attribute name given is not associated with the
              indicated filesystem object and the ATTR_REPLACE flag bit
              was set.

       [E2BIG]
              The value of the given attribute is too large, it exceeds
              the maximum allowable size of an attribute value.

       [EEXIST]
              The attribute name given is already associated with the
              indicated filesystem object and the ATTR_CREATE flag bit
              was set.

       [EINVAL]
              A bit was set in the <i>flag</i> argument that is not defined for
              this system call, or both the ATTR_CREATE and ATTR_REPLACE
              flags bits were set, or <i>fd</i> refers to a socket, not a file.

       [EFAULT]
              <i>Attrname,</i> or <i>attrvalue</i> points outside the allocated
              address space of the process.

       [EBADF]
              <i>Fd</i> does not refer to a valid descriptor.

DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set appropriately.
