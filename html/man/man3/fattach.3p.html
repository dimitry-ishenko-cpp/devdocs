NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fattach — attach a STREAMS-based file descriptor to a file in the
       file system name space (<b>STREAMS</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;

       int fattach(int <i>fildes</i>, const char *<i>path</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fattach</i>() function shall attach a STREAMS-based file
       descriptor to a file, effectively associating a pathname with
       <i>fildes</i>.  The application shall ensure that the <i>fildes</i> argument is
       a valid open file descriptor associated with a STREAMS file. The
       <i>path</i> argument points to a pathname of an existing file. The
       application shall have appropriate privileges or be the owner of
       the file named by <i>path</i> and have write permission. A successful
       call to <i>fattach</i>() shall cause all pathnames that name the file
       named by <i>path</i> to name the STREAMS file associated with <i>fildes</i>,
       until the STREAMS file is detached from the file. A STREAMS file
       can be attached to more than one file and can have several
       pathnames associated with it.

       The attributes of the named STREAMS file shall be initialized as
       follows: the permissions, user ID, group ID, and times are set to
       those of the file named by <i>path</i>, the number of links is set to 1,
       and the size and device identifier are set to those of the
       STREAMS file associated with <i>fildes</i>.  If any attributes of the
       named STREAMS file are subsequently changed (for example, by
       <i>chmod</i>()), neither the attributes of the underlying file nor the
       attributes of the STREAMS file to which <i>fildes</i> refers shall be
       affected.

       File descriptors referring to the underlying file, opened prior
       to an <i>fattach</i>() call, shall continue to refer to the underlying
       file.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>fattach</i>() shall return 0. Otherwise,
       -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fattach</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied for a component of the path
              prefix, or the process is the owner of <i>path</i> but does not
              have write permissions on the file named by <i>path</i>.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The file named by <i>path</i> is currently a mount point or has a
              STREAMS file attached to it.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The effective user ID of the process is not the owner of
              the file named by <i>path</i> and the process does not have
              appropriate privileges.

       The <i>fattach</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument does not refer to a STREAMS file.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>EXDEV  </b>A link to a file on another file system was attempted.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Attaching a File Descriptor to a File</b>
       In the following example, <i>fd</i> refers to an open STREAMS file. The
       call to <i>fattach</i>() associates this STREAM with the file
       <b>/tmp/named-STREAM</b>, such that any future calls to open <b>/tmp/named-</b>
       <b>STREAM</b>, prior to breaking the attachment via a call to <i>fdetach</i>(),
       will instead create a new file handle referring to the STREAMS
       file associated with <i>fd</i>.

           #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;
           ...
               int fd;
               char *pathname = "/tmp/named-STREAM";
               int ret;

               ret = fattach(fd, pathname);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fattach</i>() function behaves similarly to the traditional
       <i>mount</i>() function in the way a file is temporarily replaced by the
       root directory of the mounted file system. In the case of
       <i>fattach</i>(), the replaced file need not be a directory and the
       replacing file is a STREAMS file.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The file attributes of a file which has been the subject of an
       <i>fattach</i>() call are specifically set because of an artifact of the
       original implementation. The internal mechanism was the same as
       for the <i>mount</i>() function. Since <i>mount</i>() is typically only applied
       to directories, the effects when applied to a regular file are a
       little surprising, especially as regards the link count which
       rigidly remains one, even if there were several links originally
       and despite the fact that all original links refer to the STREAM
       as long as the <i>fattach</i>() remains in effect.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fattach</i>() function may be removed in a future version.
