PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sigwait — wait for queued signals
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int sigwait(const sigset_t *restrict <i>set</i>, int *restrict <i>sig</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigwait</i>() function shall select a pending signal from <i>set</i>,
       atomically clear it from the system's set of pending signals, and
       return that signal number in the location referenced by <i>sig</i>.  If
       prior to the call to <i>sigwait</i>() there are multiple pending
       instances of a single signal number, it is implementation-defined
       whether upon successful return there are any remaining pending
       signals for that signal number.  If the implementation supports
       queued signals and there are multiple signals queued for the
       signal number selected, the first such queued signal shall cause
       a return from <i>sigwait</i>() and the remainder shall remain queued. If
       no signal in <i>set</i> is pending at the time of the call, the thread
       shall be suspended until one or more becomes pending. The signals
       defined by <i>set</i> shall have been blocked at the time of the call to
       <i>sigwait</i>(); otherwise, the behavior is undefined. The effect of
       <i>sigwait</i>() on the signal actions for the signals in <i>set</i> is
       unspecified.

       If more than one thread is using <i>sigwait</i>() to wait for the same
       signal, no more than one of these threads shall return from
       <i>sigwait</i>() with the signal number. If more than a single thread is
       blocked in <i>sigwait</i>() for a signal when that signal is generated
       for the process, it is unspecified which of the waiting threads
       returns from <i>sigwait</i>().  If the signal is generated for a
       specific thread, as by <i>pthread_kill</i>(), only that thread shall
       return.

       Should any of the multiple pending signals in the range SIGRTMIN
       to SIGRTMAX be selected, it shall be the lowest numbered one. The
       selection order between realtime and non-realtime signals, or
       between multiple pending non-realtime signals, is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>sigwait</i>() shall store the signal
       number of the received signal at the location referenced by <i>sig</i>
       and return zero. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigwait</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>set</i> argument contains an invalid or unsupported signal
              number.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       To provide a convenient way for a thread to wait for a signal,
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 provides the <i>sigwait</i>() function. For
       most cases where a thread has to wait for a signal, the <i>sigwait</i>()
       function should be quite convenient, efficient, and adequate.

       However, requests were made for a lower-level primitive than
       <i>sigwait</i>() and for semaphores that could be used by threads. After
       some consideration, threads were allowed to use semaphores and
       <i>sem_post</i>() was defined to be async-signal-safe.

       In summary, when it is necessary for code run in response to an
       asynchronous signal to notify a thread, <i>sigwait</i>() should be used
       to handle the signal. Alternatively, if the implementation
       provides semaphores, they also can be used, either following
       <i>sigwait</i>() or from within a signal handling routine previously
       registered with <i>sigaction</i>().
