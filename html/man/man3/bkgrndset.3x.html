DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>bkgrndset</b>
       The <b>bkgrndset </b>and <b>wbkgrndset </b>routines manipulate the background
       of the named window.  The window background is a <b>cchar_t</b>
       consisting of any combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and
       a complex character.

       •   The attribute part of the background is combined (OR'ed) with
           all non-blank characters that are written into the window
           with <b>waddch</b>.

       •   Both the character and attribute parts of the background are
           combined with the blank characters.

       The background becomes a property of the character and moves with
       the character through any scrolling and insert/delete
       line/character operations.

       To the extent possible on a particular terminal, the attribute
       part of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of
       the character put on the screen.

   <b>bkgrnd</b>
       The <b>bkgrnd </b>and <b>wbkgrnd </b>functions set the background property of
       the current or specified window and then apply this setting to
       every character position in that window:

       •   The rendition of every character on the screen is changed to
           the new background rendition.

       •   Wherever the former background character appears, it is
           changed to the new background character.

   <b>getbkgrnd</b>
       The <b>getbkgrnd </b>function returns the given window's current
       background character/attribute pair via the <b>wch </b>pointer.  If the
       given window pointer is null, the character is not updated (but
       no error returned).
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that <b>bkgrnd</b>, <b>bkgrndset</b>, and <b>getbkgrnd </b>may be macros.

       X/Open Curses does not provide details on how the rendition is
       changed.  This implementation follows the approach used in SVr4
       curses, which is explained in the manual page for <b>wbkgd</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>bkgrndset </b>and <b>wbkgrndset </b>routines do not return a value.

       Upon successful completion, the other functions return <b>OK</b>.
       Otherwise, they return <b>ERR</b>:

       •   A null window pointer is treated as an error.

       •   A null character pointer is treated as an error.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4
       (X/Open Curses).
