NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_breakloop - force a pcap_dispatch() or pcap_loop() call to
       return
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void pcap_breakloop(pcap_t *);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() sets a flag that will force <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP)
       or <b>pcap_loop</b>(3PCAP) to return rather than looping; they will
       return the number of packets that have been processed so far, or
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK </b>if no packets have been processed so far.  If
       the loop is currently blocked waiting for packets to arrive,
       <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() will also, on some platforms, wake up the thread
       that is blocked.  In this version of libpcap, the only platforms
       on which a wakeup is caused by <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() are Linux and
       Windows, and the wakeup will only be caused when capturing on
       network interfaces; it will not be caused on other operating
       systems, and will not be caused on any OS when capturing on other
       types of devices.

       This routine is safe to use inside a signal handler on UNIX or a
       console control handler on Windows, or in a thread other than the
       one in which the loop is running, as it merely sets a flag that
       is checked within the loop and, on some platforms, performs a
       signal-safe and thread-safe API call.

       The flag is checked in loops reading packets from the OS - a
       signal by itself will not necessarily terminate those loops - as
       well as in loops processing a set of packets returned by the OS.
       <b>Note that if you are catching signals on UNIX systems that</b>
       <b>support restarting system calls after a signal, and calling</b>
       <b>pcap_breakloop() in the signal handler, you must specify, when</b>
       <b>catching those signals, that system calls should NOT be restarted</b>
       <b>by that signal.  Otherwise, if the signal interrupted a call</b>
       <b>reading packets in a live capture, when your signal handler</b>
       <b>returns after calling pcap_breakloop(), the call will be</b>
       <b>restarted, and the loop will not terminate until more packets</b>
       <b>arrive and the call completes.</b>

       <b>Note also that, in a multi-threaded application, if one thread is</b>
       <b>blocked in pcap_dispatch(), pcap_loop(), pcap_next(3PCAP), or</b>
       <b>pcap_next_ex(3PCAP), a call to pcap_breakloop() in a different</b>
       <b>thread will only unblock that thread on the platforms and capture</b>
       <b>devices listed above.</b>

       If a non-zero packet buffer timeout is set on the <b>pcap_t</b>, and you
       are capturing on a network interface, the thread will be
       unblocked with the timeout expires.  This is not guaranteed to
       happen unless at least one packet has arrived; the only platforms
       on which it happens are macOS, the BSDs, Solaris 11, AIX, and
       Windows.

       If you want to ensure that the loop will eventually be unblocked
       on any other platforms, or unblocked when capturing on a device
       other than a network interface, you will need to use whatever
       mechanism the OS provides for breaking a thread out of blocking
       calls in order to unblock the thread, such as thread cancellation
       or thread signalling in systems that support POSIX threads.

       <b>Note that if pcap_breakloop() unblocks the thread capturing</b>
       <b>packets, and you are running on a platform that supports packet</b>
       <b>buffering, there may be packets in the buffer that arrived before</b>
       <b>pcap_breakloop() were called but that weren't yet provided to</b>
       <b>libpcap, those packets will not have been processed by</b>
       <b>pcap_dispatch() or pcap_loop().  If pcap_breakloop() was called</b>
       <b>in order to terminate the capture process, then, in order to</b>
       <b>process those packets, you would have to call pcap_dispatch() one</b>
       <b>time in order to process the last batch of packets.  This may</b>
       <b>block until the packet buffer timeout expires, so a non-zero</b>
       <b>packet buffer timeout must be used.</b>

       Note that <b>pcap_next</b>() and <b>pcap_next_ex</b>() will, on some platforms,
       loop reading packets from the OS; that loop will not necessarily
       be terminated by a signal, so <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() should be used to
       terminate packet processing even if <b>pcap_next</b>() or <b>pcap_next_ex</b>()
       is being used.

       <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() does not guarantee that no further packets will
       be processed by <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() or <b>pcap_loop</b>() after it is
       called; at most one more packet might be processed.

       If <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK </b>is returned from <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() or
       <b>pcap_loop</b>(), the flag is cleared, so a subsequent call will
       resume reading packets.  If a positive number is returned, the
       flag is not cleared, so a subsequent call will return
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK </b>and clear the flag.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       This function became available in libpcap release 0.8.1.

       In releases prior to libpcap 1.10.0, <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() will not
       wake up a blocked thread on any platform.
