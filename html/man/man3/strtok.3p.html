PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       strtok, strtok_r — split string into tokens
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       char *strtok(char *restrict <i>s</i>, const char *restrict <i>sep</i>);
       char *strtok_r(char *restrict <i>s</i>, const char *restrict <i>sep</i>,
           char **restrict <i>state</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For <i>strtok</i>(): The functionality described on this reference page
       is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is
       unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C
       standard.

       A sequence of calls to <i>strtok</i>() breaks the string pointed to by <i>s</i>
       into a sequence of tokens, each of which is delimited by a byte
       from the string pointed to by <i>sep</i>.  The first call in the
       sequence has <i>s</i> as its first argument, and is followed by calls
       with a null pointer as their first argument. The separator string
       pointed to by <i>sep</i> may be different from call to call.

       The first call in the sequence searches the string pointed to by
       <i>s</i> for the first byte that is <i>not</i> contained in the current
       separator string pointed to by <i>sep</i>.  If no such byte is found,
       then there are no tokens in the string pointed to by <i>s</i> and
       <i>strtok</i>() shall return a null pointer. If such a byte is found, it
       is the start of the first token.

       The <i>strtok</i>() function then searches from there for a byte that <i>is</i>
       contained in the current separator string. If no such byte is
       found, the current token extends to the end of the string pointed
       to by <i>s</i>, and subsequent searches for a token shall return a null
       pointer. If such a byte is found, it is overwritten by a NUL
       character, which terminates the current token. The <i>strtok</i>()
       function saves a pointer to the following byte, from which the
       next search for a token shall start.

       Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value of the
       first argument, starts searching from the saved pointer and
       behaves as described above.

       The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 calls <i>strtok</i>().

       The <i>strtok</i>() function need not be thread-safe.

       The <i>strtok_r</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>strtok</i>(), except
       that <i>strtok_r</i>() shall be thread-safe and the argument <i>state</i>
       points to a user-provided pointer that allows <i>strtok_r</i>() to
       maintain state between calls which scan the same string. The
       application shall ensure that the pointer pointed to by <i>state</i> is
       unique for each string (<i>s</i>) being processed concurrently by
       <i>strtok_r</i>() calls. The application need not initialize the pointer
       pointed to by <i>state</i> to any particular value. The implementation
       shall not update the pointer pointed to by <i>state</i> to point
       (directly or indirectly) to resources, other than within the
       string <i>s</i>, that need to be freed or released by the caller.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>strtok</i>() shall return a pointer to
       the first byte of a token. Otherwise, if there is no token,
       <i>strtok</i>() shall return a null pointer.

       The <i>strtok_r</i>() function shall return a pointer to the token
       found, or a null pointer when no token is found.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Searching for Word Separators</b>
       The following example searches for tokens separated by &lt;space&gt;
       characters.

           #include &lt;string.h&gt;
           ...
           char *token;
           char line[] = "LINE TO BE SEPARATED";
           char *search = " ";

           /* Token will point to "LINE". */
           token = strtok(line, search);

           /* Token will point to "TO". */
           token = strtok(NULL, search);

   <b>Find First two Fields in a Buffer</b>
       The following example uses <i>strtok</i>() to find two character strings
       (a key and data associated with that key) separated by any
       combination of &lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;, or &lt;newline&gt; characters at the
       start of the array of characters pointed to by <i>buffer</i>.

           #include &lt;string.h&gt;
           ...
           char    *buffer;
           ...
           struct element {
               char *key;
               char *data;
           } e;
           ...
           // Load the buffer...
           ...
           // Get the key and its data...
           e.key = strtok(buffer, " \t\n");
           e.data = strtok(NULL, " \t\n");
           // Process the rest of the contents of the buffer...
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Note that if <i>sep</i> is the empty string, <i>strtok</i>() and <i>strtok_r</i>()
       return a pointer to the remainder of the string being tokenized.

       The <i>strtok_r</i>() function is thread-safe and stores its state in a
       user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a static data area
       that may be overwritten by an unrelated call from another thread.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>strtok</i>() function searches for a separator string within a
       larger string. It returns a pointer to the last substring between
       separator strings.  This function uses static storage to keep
       track of the current string position between calls. The new
       function, <i>strtok_r</i>(), takes an additional argument, <i>state</i>, to
       keep track of the current position in the string.
