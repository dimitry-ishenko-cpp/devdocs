SYNOPSIS </h2>

       int timer_create(clockid_t <i>clockid</i>, struct sigevent *restrict <i>evp</i>,
           timer_t *restrict <i>timerid</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>timer_create</i>() function shall create a per-process timer
       using the specified clock, <i>clock_id</i>, as the timing base. The
       <i>timer_create</i>() function shall return, in the location referenced
       by <i>timerid</i>, a timer ID of type <b>timer_t </b>used to identify the timer
       in timer requests. This timer ID shall be unique within the
       calling process until the timer is deleted. The particular clock,
       <i>clock_id</i>, is defined in <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.  The timer whose ID is returned
       shall be in a disarmed state upon return from <i>timer_create</i>().

       The <i>evp</i> argument, if non-NULL, points to a <b>sigevent </b>structure.
       This structure, allocated by the application, defines the
       asynchronous notification to occur as specified in <i>Section 2.4.1</i>,
       <i>Signal Generation and Delivery</i> when the timer expires. If the <i>evp</i>
       argument is NULL, the effect is as if the <i>evp</i> argument pointed to
       a <b>sigevent </b>structure with the <i>sigev_notify</i> member having the
       value SIGEV_SIGNAL, the <i>sigev_signo</i> having a default signal
       number, and the <i>sigev_value</i> member having the value of the timer
       ID.

       Each implementation shall define a set of clocks that can be used
       as timing bases for per-process timers. All implementations shall
       support a <i>clock_id</i> of CLOCK_REALTIME.  If the Monotonic Clock
       option is supported, implementations shall support a <i>clock_id</i> of
       CLOCK_MONOTONIC.

       Per-process timers shall not be inherited by a child process
       across a <i>fork</i>() and shall be disarmed and deleted by an <i>exec</i>.

       If _POSIX_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall support
       <i>clock_id</i> values representing the CPU-time clock of the calling
       process.

       If _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall
       support <i>clock_id</i> values representing the CPU-time clock of the
       calling thread.

       It is implementation-defined whether a <i>timer_create</i>() function
       will succeed if the value defined by <i>clock_id</i> corresponds to the
       CPU-time clock of a process or thread different from the process
       or thread invoking the function.

       If <i>evp</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_sigev_notify</i> is SIGEV_THREAD and
       <i>sev</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> is not NULL, if the attribute
       pointed to by <i>sev</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> has a thread stack
       address specified by a call to <i>pthread_attr_setstack</i>(), the
       results are unspecified if the signal is generated more than
       once.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the call succeeds, <i>timer_create</i>() shall return zero and update
       the location referenced by <i>timerid</i> to a <b>timer_t</b>, which can be
       passed to the per-process timer calls. If an error occurs, the
       function shall return a value of -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error. The value of <i>timerid</i> is undefined if an error occurs.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>timer_create</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The system lacks sufficient signal queuing resources to
              honor the request.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The calling process has already created all of the timers
              it is allowed by this implementation.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The specified clock ID is not defined.

       <b>ENOTSUP</b>
              The implementation does not support the creation of a
              timer attached to the CPU-time clock that is specified by
              <i>clock_id</i> and associated with a process or thread different
              from the process or thread invoking <i>timer_create</i>().

EXAMPLES </h2>

       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If a timer is created which has <i>evp</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_sigev_notify</i> set to
       SIGEV_THREAD and the attribute pointed to by
       <i>evp</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> has a thread stack address specified
       by a call to <i>pthread_attr_setstack</i>(), the memory dedicated as a
       thread stack cannot be recovered. The reason for this is that the
       threads created in response to a timer expiration are created
       detached, or in an unspecified way if the thread attribute's
       <i>detachstate</i> is PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE. In neither case is it
       valid to call <i>pthread_join</i>(), which makes it impossible to
       determine the lifetime of the created thread which thus means the
       stack memory cannot be reused.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Periodic Timer Overrun and Resource Allocation</b>
       The specified timer facilities may deliver realtime signals (that
       is, queued signals) on implementations that support this option.
       Since realtime applications cannot afford to lose notifications
       of asynchronous events, like timer expirations or asynchronous
       I/O completions, it must be possible to ensure that sufficient
       resources exist to deliver the signal when the event occurs. In
       general, this is not a difficulty because there is a one-to-one
       correspondence between a request and a subsequent signal
       generation. If the request cannot allocate the signal delivery
       resources, it can fail the call with an <b>[EAGAIN] </b>error.

       Periodic timers are a special case. A single request can generate
       an unspecified number of signals. This is not a problem if the
       requesting process can service the signals as fast as they are
       generated, thus making the signal delivery resources available
       for delivery of subsequent periodic timer expiration signals.
       But, in general, this cannot be assured—processing of periodic
       timer signals may ``overrun''; that is, subsequent periodic timer
       expirations may occur before the currently pending signal has
       been delivered.

       Also, for signals, according to the POSIX.1‐1990 standard, if
       subsequent occurrences of a pending signal are generated, it is
       implementation-defined whether a signal is delivered for each
       occurrence. This is not adequate for some realtime applications.
       So a mechanism is required to allow applications to detect how
       many timer expirations were delayed without requiring an
       indefinite amount of system resources to store the delayed
       expirations.

       The specified facilities provide for an overrun count. The
       overrun count is defined as the number of extra timer expirations
       that occurred between the time a timer expiration signal is
       generated and the time the signal is delivered. The signal-
       catching function, if it is concerned with overruns, can retrieve
       this count on entry. With this method, a periodic timer only
       needs one ``signal queuing resource'' that can be allocated at
       the time of the <i>timer_create</i>() function call.

       A function is defined to retrieve the overrun count so that an
       application need not allocate static storage to contain the
       count, and an implementation need not update this storage
       asynchronously on timer expirations. But, for some high-frequency
       periodic applications, the overhead of an additional system call
       on each timer expiration may be prohibitive. The functions, as
       defined, permit an implementation to maintain the overrun count
       in user space, associated with the <i>timerid</i>.  The
       <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() function can then be implemented as a macro
       that uses the <i>timerid</i> argument (which may just be a pointer to a
       user space structure containing the counter) to locate the
       overrun count with no system call overhead. Other
       implementations, less concerned with this class of applications,
       can avoid the asynchronous update of user space by maintaining
       the count in a system structure at the cost of the extra system
       call to obtain it.

   <b>Timer Expiration Signal Parameters</b>
       The Realtime Signals Extension option supports an application-
       specific datum that is delivered to the extended signal handler.
       This value is explicitly specified by the application, along with
       the signal number to be delivered, in a <b>sigevent </b>structure. The
       type of the application-defined value can be either an integer
       constant or a pointer. This explicit specification of the value,
       as opposed to always sending the timer ID, was selected based on
       existing practice.

       It is common practice for realtime applications (on non-POSIX
       systems or realtime extended POSIX systems) to use the parameters
       of event handlers as the case label of a switch statement or as a
       pointer to an application-defined data structure. Since <i>timer_id</i>s
       are dynamically allocated by the <i>timer_create</i>() function, they
       can be used for neither of these functions without additional
       application overhead in the signal handler; for example, to
       search an array of saved timer IDs to associate the ID with a
       constant or application data structure.
