       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the

       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pclose — close a pipe stream to or from a process
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int pclose(FILE *<i>stream</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pclose</i>() function shall close a stream that was opened by
       <i>popen</i>(), wait for the command to terminate, and return the
       termination status of the process that was running the command
       language interpreter.  However, if a call caused the termination
       status to be unavailable to <i>pclose</i>(), then <i>pclose</i>() shall return
       -1 with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[ECHILD] </b>to report this situation. This can
       happen if the application calls one of the following functions:

        *  <i>wait</i>()

        *  <i>waitpid</i>() with a <i>pid</i> argument less than or equal to 0 or
           equal to the process ID of the command line interpreter

        *  Any other function not defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
           that could do one of the above

       In any case, <i>pclose</i>() shall not return before the child process
       created by <i>popen</i>() has terminated.

       If the command language interpreter cannot be executed, the child
       termination status returned by <i>pclose</i>() shall be as if the
       command language interpreter terminated using <i>exit</i>(127) or
       <i>_exit</i>(127).

       The <i>pclose</i>() function shall not affect the termination status of
       any child of the calling process other than the one created by
       <i>popen</i>() for the associated stream.

       If the argument <i>stream</i> to <i>pclose</i>() is not a pointer to a stream
       created by <i>popen</i>(), the result of <i>pclose</i>() is undefined.

       If a thread is canceled during execution of <i>pclose</i>(), the
       behavior is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful return, <i>pclose</i>() shall return the termination
       status of the command language interpreter. Otherwise, <i>pclose</i>()
       shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pclose</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ECHILD </b>The status of the child process could not be obtained, as
              described above.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       There is a requirement that <i>pclose</i>() not return before the child
       process terminates. This is intended to disallow implementations
       that return <b>[EINTR] </b>if a signal is received while waiting. If
       <i>pclose</i>() returned before the child terminated, there would be no
       way for the application to discover which child used to be
       associated with the stream, and it could not do the cleanup
       itself.

       If the stream pointed to by <i>stream</i> was not created by <i>popen</i>(),
       historical implementations of <i>pclose</i>() return -1 without setting
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.  To avoid requiring <i>pclose</i>() to set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> in this case,
       POSIX.1‐2008 makes the behavior unspecified. An application
       should not use <i>pclose</i>() to close any stream that was not created
       by <i>popen</i>().

       Some historical implementations of <i>pclose</i>() either block or
       ignore the signals SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and SIGHUP while waiting for
       the child process to terminate. Since this behavior is not
       described for the <i>pclose</i>() function in POSIX.1‐2008, such
       implementations are not conforming. Also, some historical
       implementations return <b>[EINTR] </b>if a signal is received, even
       though the child process has not terminated. Such implementations
       are also considered non-conforming.

       Consider, for example, an application that uses:

           popen("command", "r")

       to start <i>command</i>, which is part of the same application. The
       parent writes a prompt to its standard output (presumably the
       terminal) and then reads from the <i>popen</i>()ed stream. The child
       reads the response from the user, does some transformation on the
       response (pathname expansion, perhaps) and writes the result to
       its standard output. The parent process reads the result from the
       pipe, does something with it, and prints another prompt. The
       cycle repeats. Assuming that both processes do appropriate buffer
       flushing, this would be expected to work.

       To conform to POSIX.1‐2008, <i>pclose</i>() must use <i>waitpid</i>(), or some
       similar function, instead of <i>wait</i>().

       The code sample below illustrates how the <i>pclose</i>() function might
       be implemented on a system conforming to POSIX.1‐2008.

           int pclose(FILE *stream)
           {
               int stat;
               pid_t pid;

               pid = &lt;pid for process created for stream by popen()&gt;
               (void) fclose(stream);
               while (waitpid(pid, &amp;stat, 0) == -1) {
                   if (errno != EINTR){
                       stat = -1;
                       break;
                   }
               }
               return(stat);
           }
