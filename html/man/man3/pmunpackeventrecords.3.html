DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Event records are encoded as a packed array of records within a
       <i>pmResult</i> using a container metric with a value of type
       <b>PM_TYPE_EVENT , </b>and a <i>pmHighResResult</i> when using a metric of type
       <b>PM_TYPE_HIGHRES_EVENT</b>.

       <b>pmUnpackEventRecords </b>and <b>pmUnpackHighResEventRecords </b>may be used
       to unpack event records from a metric value identified by <i>vsp</i> and
       <i>idx</i>.  If the metric has a singular value, <i>idx</i> should be 0, else
       the ordinal instance value identified by <i>idx</i> will be unpacked,
       i.e. vsp-&gt;vlist[idx].  The unpacked records are turned into
       either <i>pmResult</i> or <i>pmHighResResult</i> structures, one per event
       record and one metric per event parameter, and <i>rap</i> is returned as
       a pointer to an array (NULL pointer terminated) of pointers to
       the result structures.

       The only difference between the two result types is the timestamp
       scale; the <i>pmHighResResult</i> allows for nanosecond precision,
       whereas <i>pmResult</i> allows for microsecond resolution.

       Some control information from the packed event records is
       unpacked into additional ``anonymous'' metrics as follows:

       1.  If the event record has a non-zero flags value, then the
           corresponding <i>pmResult</i>/<i>pmHighResResult</i> will have the flags
           value encoded with the additional metric <b>event.flags </b>that is
           inserted ahead of all other event parameters.

       2.  If the event record flag is set to <b>PM_EVENT_FLAG_MISSED</b>, then
           the corresponding <i>pmResult</i>/<i>pmHighResResult</i> will have one
           metric <b>event.missed </b>with a value that equals the number of
           event records ``missed'' because either the PMDA could not
           keep up, or the PMAPI client did not collect the event
           records fast enough.

       <b>pmUnpackEventRecords </b>returns the number of <i>pmResult</i> structures as
       the return value, which is &gt;= 0 for success.  Similarly,
       <b>pmUnpackHighResEventRecords </b>returns the number of <i>pmHighResResult</i>
       structures as the return value, which is &gt;= 0 for success.

       <i>rap</i> and the associated <i>pmResult</i> structures may be freed using the
       convenience function <a href="pmfreeeventresult.3.html">pmFreeEventResult(3)</a>.

       Similarly, the <i>hrap</i> and the associated <i>pmHighResResult</i> structures
       may be freed using the convenience function
       <b>pmFreeHighResEventResult</b>.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The following errors are possible:

       PM_ERR_CONV
              The values associated with <i>vsp</i> are not encoded using the
              format PM_VAL_DPTR or PM_VAL_SPTR, or the flags at the
              head of the event record has an unexpected value.

       PM_ERR_INST
              The value associated with <i>vsp</i> is not singular as expected.

       PM_ERR_TYPE
              <i>vsp</i> is not a value of type <b>PM_TYPE_EVENT</b>.

       PM_ERR_TOOSMALL
              The value identified by <i>vsp</i> is not legal because the value
              length is less than the minimum size, or the number of
              event records encoded in the (value header)
              <i>pmEventArray</i>/<i>pmHighResEventArray</i> structure is negative, or
              the number of missed event records in the array is
              negative.

       PM_ERR_TOOBIG
              Either <b>vsp </b>indicates more than one value is present (all
              the event records are expected to be packed in a single
              metric value), or when unpacking the event records, the
              processing continues past the end of the enclosing value.
              Indicates corruption of the packed event record.

       PM_ERR_TYPE
              Event parameters must have one of the arithmetic types,
              else <b>PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE</b>, <b>PM_TYPE_STRING </b>or
              <b>PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE_STATIC</b>.

       other values &lt; 0
