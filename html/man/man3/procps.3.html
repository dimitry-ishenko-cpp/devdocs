NAME </h2>
<pre>
       procps - API to access system level information in the /proc
       filesystem
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       Five distinct interfaces are represented in this synopsis and
       named after the files they access in the /proc pseudo filesystem:
       <b>diskstats</b>, <b>meminfo</b>, <b>slabinfo</b>, <b>stat </b>and <b>vmstat</b>.
           #include &lt;libproc2/<b>named_interface</b>.h&gt;

           int <b>procps_new   </b>(struct info **<i>info</i>);
           int <b>procps_ref   </b>(struct info  *<i>info</i>);
           int <b>procps_unref </b>(struct info **<i>info</i>);

           struct result *<b>procps_get </b>(
               struct info *<i>info</i>,
           [   const char *<i>name</i>,      ]   <b>diskstats </b>api only
               enum item <i>item</i>);

           struct stack *<b>procps_select </b>(
               struct info *<i>info</i>,
           [   const char *<i>name</i>,      ]   <b>diskstats </b>api only
               enum item *<i>items</i>,
               int <i>numitems</i>);

           struct reaped *<b>procps_reap </b>(
               struct info *<i>info</i>,
           [   enum reap_type <i>what</i>,   ]   <b>stat </b>api only
               enum item *<i>items</i>,
               int <i>numitems</i>);

           struct stack **<b>procps_sort </b>(
               struct info *<i>info</i>,
               struct stack *<i>stacks</i>[],
               int <i>numstacked</i>,
               enum item <i>sortitem</i>,
               enum sort_order <i>order</i>);

           The above functions and structures are generic but the
           specific <b>named_interface </b>would also be part of any
           identifiers.  For example, ‘procps_new’ would actually be
           ‘procps_<b>meminfo</b>_new’ and ‘info’ would really be
           ‘<b>diskstats</b>_info’, etc.

           The same <b>named_interface </b>is used in each header file name
           with an appended ‘.h’ suffix.

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Overview</b>
       Central to these interfaces is a simple ‘result’ structure
       reflecting an ‘item’ plus its value (in a union with standard C
       language types as members).  All ‘result’ structures are
       automatically allocated and provided by the library.

       By specifying an array of ‘items’, these structures can be
       organized as a ‘stack’, potentially yielding many results with a
       single function call.  Thus, a ‘stack’ can be viewed as a
       variable length record whose content and order is determined
       solely by the user.

       As part of each interface there are two unique enumerators.  The
       ‘noop’ and ‘extra’ items exist to hold user values.  They are
       never set by the library, but the ‘extra’ result will be zeroed
       with each library interaction.

       The <b>named_interface </b>header file will be an essential document
       during user program development.  There you will find available
       items, their return type (the ‘result’ struct member name) and
       the source for such values.  Additional enumerators and
       structures are also documented there.

   <b>Usage</b>
       The following would be a typical sequence of calls to these
       interfaces.

       1. <b>procps_new()</b>
       2. <b>procps_get()</b>, <b>procps_select() </b>or <b>procps_reap()</b>
       3. <b>procps_unref()</b>

       The <b>get </b>function is used to retrieve a ‘result’ structure for a
       single ‘item’.  Alternatively, a <b>GET </b>macro is available when only
       the return value is of interest.

       The <b>select </b>function can retrieve multiple ‘result’ structures in
       a single ‘stack’.

       For unpredictable variable outcomes, the <b>diskstats</b>, <b>slabinfo </b>and
       <b>stat </b>interfaces export a <b>reap </b>function.  It is used to retrieve
       multiple ‘stacks’ each containing multiple ‘result’ structures.
       Optionally, a user may choose to <b>sort </b>those results.

       To exploit any ‘stack’, and access individual ‘result’
       structures, a <i>relative_enum</i> is required as shown in the <b>VAL </b>macro
       defined in the header file.  Such values could be hard coded as:
       0 through numitems-1.  However, this need is typically satisfied
       by creating your own enumerators corresponding to the order of
       the ‘items’ array.

   <b>Caveats</b>
       The <b>new</b>, <b>ref</b>, <b>unref</b>, <b>get </b>and <b>select </b>functions are available in
       all five interfaces.

       For the <b>new </b>and <b>unref </b>functions, the address of an <i>info</i> struct
       pointer must be supplied.  With <b>new </b>it must have been initialized
       to NULL.  With <b>unref </b>it will be reset to NULL if the reference
       count reaches zero.

       In the case of the <b>diskstats </b>interface, a <i>name</i> parameter on the
       <b>get </b>and <b>select </b>functions identifies a disk or partition name

       For the <b>stat </b>interface, a <i>what</i> parameter on the <b>reap </b>function
       identifies whether data for just CPUs or both CPUs and NUMA nodes
       is to be gathered.

       When using the <b>sort </b>function, the parameters <i>stacks</i> and
       <i>numstacked</i> would normally be those returned in the ‘reaped’
       structure.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Functions Returning an ‘int’</b>
       An error will be indicated by a negative number that is always
       the inverse of some well known errno.h value.

       Success is indicated by a zero return value.  However, the <b>ref</b>
       and <b>unref </b>functions return the current <i>info</i> structure reference
       count.

   <b>Functions Returning an ‘address’</b>
       An error will be indicated by a NULL return pointer with the
       reason found in the formal errno value.

       Success is indicated by a pointer to the named structure.
</pre> <h2>
DEBUGGING </h2>
<pre>
       To aid in program development, there is a provision that can help
       ensure ‘result’ member references agree with library
       expectations.  It assumes that a supplied macro in the header
       file is used to access the ‘result’ value.

       This feature can be activated through either of the following
       methods and any discrepancies will be written to <b>stderr</b>.

       1) Add CFLAGS='-DXTRA_PROCPS_DEBUG' to any other ./configure
          options employed.

       2) Add #include &lt;libproc2/xtra-procps-debug.h&gt; to any program
          <i>after</i> the named interface includes.

       This verification feature incurs substantial overhead.
       Therefore, it is important that it <i>not</i> be activated for a
       production/release build.
