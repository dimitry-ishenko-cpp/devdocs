NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_rapl - support for Intel RAPL PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: rapl</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel RAPL (Intel SandyBridge, IvyBridge, Haswell)</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL)
       energy consumption counters. This is a socket-level set of
       counters which reports energy consumption in Joules. There are up
       to 3 counters each measuring only one event. The following events
       are defined:

       <b>RAPL_ENERGY_CORES</b>
              On all processors, the event reports the number of Joules
              consumed by all cores.
               On all processors,

       <b>RAPL_ENERGYC_PKG</b>
              On all processors, th event reports the number of Joules
              consumed by all the cores and Last Level cache (L3).

       <b>RAPL_ENERGY_DRAM</b>
              On server processors, the event reports the number of
              Joules consumed n by the DRAM controller.

              By construction, the events are socket-level and can only
              be measured in system-wide mode. It is necessary and
              sufficient to measure only one CPU per socket to get
              meaningful results.

MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The PMU does not support any modifiers.
