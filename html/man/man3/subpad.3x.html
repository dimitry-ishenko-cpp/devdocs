DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>newpad</b>
       The <b>newpad </b>routine creates and returns a pointer to a new pad da‐
       ta structure with the given number of lines, <i>nlines</i>, and columns,
       <i>ncols</i>.   A pad is like a window, except that it is not restricted
       by the screen size, and is not necessarily associated with a par‐
       ticular part of the screen.  Pads can be used when a large window
       is needed, and only a part of the window will be on the screen at
       one time.  Automatic refreshes of pads (e.g., from  scrolling  or
       echoing of input) do not occur.

       It  is  not legal to call <b>wrefresh </b>with a <i>pad</i> as an argument; the
       routines <b>prefresh </b>or <b>pnoutrefresh </b>should be called instead.  Note
       that these routines require additional parameters to specify  the
       part of the pad to be displayed and the location on the screen to
       be used for the display.

   <b>subpad</b>
       The  <b>subpad  </b>routine creates and returns a pointer to a subwindow
       within a pad with the given number of lines, <i>nlines</i>, and columns,
       <i>ncols</i>.  Unlike <b>subwin</b>, which uses screen coordinates, the  window
       is at position (<i>begin</i>_<i>x</i><b>, </b><i>begin</i>_<i>y</i>) on the pad.  The window is made
       in  the  middle  of  the window <i>orig</i>, so that changes made to one
       window affect both windows.  During the use of this  routine,  it
       will often be necessary to call <b>touchwin </b>or <b>touchline </b>on <i>orig</i> be‐
       fore calling <b>prefresh</b>.

   <b>prefresh, pnoutrefresh</b>
       The  <b>prefresh </b>and <b>pnoutrefresh </b>routines are analogous to <b>wrefresh</b>
       and <b>wnoutrefresh </b>except that they relate to pads instead of  win‐
       dows.  The additional parameters are needed to indicate what part
       of the pad and screen are involved.

       •   The <i>pminrow</i> and <i>pmincol</i> parameters specify the upper left-
           hand corner of the rectangle to be displayed in the pad.

       •   The <i>sminrow</i>, <i>smincol</i>, <i>smaxrow</i>, and <i>smaxcol</i> parameters specify
           the edges of the rectangle to be displayed on the screen.

       The lower right-hand corner of the rectangle to be displayed in
       the pad is calculated from the screen coordinates, since the rec‐
       tangles must be the same size.  Both rectangles must be entirely
       contained within their respective structures.  Negative values of
       <i>pminrow</i>, <i>pmincol</i>, <i>sminrow</i>, or <i>smincol</i> are treated as if they were
       zero.

   <b>pechochar</b>
       The <b>pechochar </b>routine is functionally equivalent to a call to <b>ad‐</b>
       <b>dch </b>followed by a call to <b>refresh</b>(3X), a call to <b>waddch </b>followed
       by a call to <b>wrefresh</b>, or a call to <b>waddch </b>followed by a call to
       <b>prefresh</b>.  The knowledge that only a single character is being
       output is taken into consideration and, for non-control charac‐
       ters, a considerable performance gain might be seen by using
       these routines instead of their equivalents.  In the case of <b>pe‐</b>
       <b>chochar</b>, the last location of the pad on the screen is reused for
       the arguments to <b>prefresh</b>.

   <b>pecho_wchar</b>
       The <b>pecho_wchar </b>function is the analogous wide-character form of
       <b>pechochar</b>.  It outputs one character to a pad and immediately re‐
       freshes the pad.  It does this by a call to <b>wadd_wch </b>followed by
       a call to <b>prefresh</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Routines that return an integer return <b>ERR </b>upon failure and <b>OK</b>
       (SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other than <b>ERR</b>") upon suc‐
       cessful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return <b>NULL </b>on error, and set <b>errno</b>
       to <b>ENOMEM</b>.

       X/Open does not define any error conditions.  In this implementa‐
       tion

          <b>prefresh </b>and <b>pnoutrefresh</b>
               return an error if the window pointer is null, or if the
               window is not really a pad or if the area to refresh ex‐
               tends off-screen or if the minimum coordinates are
               greater than the maximum.

          <b>pechochar</b>
               returns an error if the window is not really a pad, and
               the associated call to <b>wechochar </b>returns an error.

          <b>pecho_wchar</b>
               returns an error if the window is not really a pad, and
               the associated call to <b>wecho_wchar </b>returns an error.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that <b>pechochar </b>may be a macro.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       BSD curses has no <i>pad</i> feature.

       SVr2 curses (1986) provided the <b>newpad </b>and related functions,
       documenting them in a single line each.  SVr3 (1987) provided
       more extensive documentation.

       The documentation does not explain the term <i>pad</i>.  However, the
       Apollo <i>Aegis</i> workstation operating system supported a graphical
       <i>pad</i> feature:

       •   These graphical pads could be much larger than the computer's
           display.

       •   The read-only output from a command could be scrolled back to
           inspect, and select text from the pad.

       The two uses may be related.

       The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions, with‐
       out significant change from the SVr3 documentation.  It describes
       no error conditions.  The behavior of <b>subpad </b>if the parent window
       is not a pad is undocumented, and is not checked by the vendor
       Unix implementations:

       •   SVr4 curses sets a flag in the <b>WINDOW </b>structure in <b>newpad</b>
           which tells if the window is a <i>pad</i>.

           However, it uses this information only in <b>waddch </b>(to decide
           if it should call <b>wrefresh</b>) and <b>wscrl </b>(to avoid scrolling a
           pad), and does not check in <b>wrefresh </b>to ensure that the pad
           is refreshed properly.

       •   Solaris X/Open Curses checks if a window is a pad in <b>wnoutre‐</b>
           <b>fresh</b>, returning <b>ERR </b>in that case.

           However, it only sets the flag for subwindows if the parent
           window is a pad.  Its <b>newpad </b>function does not set this in‐
           formation.  Consequently, the check will never fail.

           It makes no comparable check in <b>pnoutrefresh</b>, though inter‐
           estingly enough, a comment in the source code states that the
           lack of a check was an MKS extension.

       •   NetBSD 7 curses sets a flag in the <b>WINDOW </b>structure for <b>new‐</b>
           <b>pad </b>and <b>subpad</b>, using this to help with the distinction be‐
           tween <b>wnoutrefresh </b>and <b>pnoutrefresh</b>.

           It does not check for the case where a subwindow is created
           in a pad using <b>subwin </b>or <b>derwin</b>.

           The <b>dupwin </b>function returns a regular window when duplicating
           a pad.  Likewise, <b>getwin </b>always returns a window, even if the
           saved data was from a pad.

       This implementation

       •   sets a flag in the <b>WINDOW </b>structure for <b>newpad </b>and <b>subpad</b>,

       •   allows a <b>subwin </b>or <b>derwin </b>call to succeed having a pad parent
           by forcing the subwindow to be a pad,

       •   checks in both <b>wnoutrefresh </b>and <b>pnoutrefresh </b>to ensure that
           pads and windows are handled distinctly, and

       •   ensures that <b>dupwin </b>and <b>getwin </b>treat pads versus windows con‐
           sistently.
