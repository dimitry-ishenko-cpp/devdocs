NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_open_live - open a device for capturing
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];</b>

       <b>pcap_t *pcap_open_live(const char *device, int snaplen,</b>
           <b>int promisc, int to_ms, char *errbuf);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_open_live</b>() is used to obtain a packet capture handle to
       look at packets on the network.  <i>device</i> is a string that
       specifies the network device to open; on all supported Linux
       systems, as well as on recent versions of macOS and Solaris, a
       <i>device</i> argument of "any" or <b>NULL </b>can be used to capture packets
       from all network interfaces.  The latter should not be confused
       with all available capture devices as seen by
       <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>(3PCAP), which may also include D-Bus, USB etc.

       <i>snaplen</i> specifies the snapshot length to be set on the handle.
       If the packet data should not be truncated at the end, a value of
       262144 should be sufficient for most devices, but D-Bus devices
       require a value of 128Mb (128*1024*1024).

       <i>promisc</i> specifies whether the interface is to be put into
       promiscuous mode.  If <i>promisc</i> is non-zero, promiscuous mode will
       be set, otherwise it will not be set.

       <i>to_ms</i> specifies the packet buffer timeout, as a non-negative
       value, in milliseconds.  (See <b>pcap</b>(3PCAP) for an explanation of
       the packet buffer timeout.)

       <i>errbuf</i> is a buffer large enough to hold at least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</b>
       chars.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_open_live</b>() returns a <b>pcap_t * </b>on success and <b>NULL </b>on
       failure.  If <b>NULL </b>is returned, <i>errbuf</i> is filled in with an
       appropriate error message.  <i>errbuf</i> may also be set to warning
       text when <b>pcap_open_live</b>() succeeds; to detect this case the
       caller should store a zero-length string in <i>errbuf</i> before calling
       <b>pcap_open_live</b>() and display the warning to the user if <i>errbuf</i> is
       no longer a zero-length string.
