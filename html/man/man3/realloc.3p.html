PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       realloc — memory reallocator
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       void *realloc(void *<i>ptr</i>, size_t <i>size</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>realloc</i>() function shall deallocate the old object pointed to
       by <i>ptr</i> and return a pointer to a new object that has the size
       specified by <i>size</i>.  The contents of the new object shall be the
       same as that of the old object prior to deallocation, up to the
       lesser of the new and old sizes. Any bytes in the new object
       beyond the size of the old object have indeterminate values. If
       the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior shall be
       implementation-defined: either a null pointer is returned, or the
       behavior shall be as if the size were some non-zero value, except
       that the behavior is undefined if the returned pointer is used to
       access an object. If the space cannot be allocated, the object
       shall remain unchanged.

       If <i>ptr</i> is a null pointer, <i>realloc</i>() shall be equivalent to
       <i>malloc</i>() for the specified size.

       If <i>ptr</i> does not match a pointer returned earlier by <i>calloc</i>(),
       <i>malloc</i>(), or <i>realloc</i>() or if the space has previously been
       deallocated by a call to <i>free</i>() or <i>realloc</i>(), the behavior is
       undefined.

       The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls
       to <i>realloc</i>() is unspecified. The pointer returned if the
       allocation succeeds shall be suitably aligned so that it may be
       assigned to a pointer to any type of object and then used to
       access such an object in the space allocated (until the space is
       explicitly freed or reallocated). Each such allocation shall
       yield a pointer to an object disjoint from any other object. The
       pointer returned shall point to the start (lowest byte address)
       of the allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null
       pointer shall be returned.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>realloc</i>() shall return a pointer to
       the (possibly moved) allocated space. If <i>size</i> is 0, either:

        *  A null pointer shall be returned and, if <i>ptr</i> is not a null
           pointer, <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to an implementation-defined
           value.

        *  A pointer to the allocated space shall be returned, and the
           memory object pointed to by <i>ptr</i> shall be freed. The
           application shall ensure that the pointer is not used to
           access an object.

       If there is not enough available memory, <i>realloc</i>() shall return a
       null pointer and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[ENOMEM]</b>.  If <i>realloc</i>() returns a
       null pointer and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> has been set to <b>[ENOMEM]</b>, the memory
       referenced by <i>ptr</i> shall not be changed.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>realloc</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory is available.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The description of <i>realloc</i>() has been modified from previous
       versions of this standard to align with the ISO/IEC 9899:1999
       standard. Previous versions explicitly permitted a call to
       <i>realloc</i>(<i>p, 0) to free the space pointed to by p</i> and return a null
       pointer. While this behavior could be interpreted as permitted by
       this version of the standard, the C language committee have
       indicated that this interpretation is incorrect. Applications
       should assume that if <i>realloc</i>() returns a null pointer, the space
       pointed to by <i>p</i> has not been freed. Since this could lead to
       double-frees, implementations should also set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if a null
       pointer actually indicates a failure, and applications should
       only free the space if <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> was changed.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       This standard defers to the ISO C standard. While that standard
       currently has language that might permit <i>realloc</i>(<i>p, 0), where p</i>
       is not a null pointer, to free <i>p</i> while still returning a null
       pointer, the committee responsible for that standard is
       considering clarifying the language to explicitly prohibit that
       alternative.
