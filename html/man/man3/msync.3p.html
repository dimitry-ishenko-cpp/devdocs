<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       msync — synchronize memory with physical storage
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int msync(void *<i>addr</i>, size_t <i>len</i>, int <i>flags</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>msync</i>() function shall write all modified data to permanent
       storage locations, if any, in those whole pages containing any
       part of the address space of the process starting at address <i>addr</i>
       and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes. If no such storage exists, <i>msync</i>()
       need not have any effect. If requested, the <i>msync</i>() function
       shall then invalidate cached copies of data.

       The implementation may require that <i>addr</i> be a multiple of the
       page size as returned by <i>sysconf</i>().

       For mappings to files, the <i>msync</i>() function shall ensure that all
       write operations are completed as defined for synchronized I/O
       data integrity completion. It is unspecified whether the
       implementation also writes out other file attributes. When the
       <i>msync</i>() function is called on MAP_PRIVATE mappings, any modified
       data shall not be written to the underlying object and shall not
       cause such data to be made visible to other processes. It is
       unspecified whether data in MAP_PRIVATE mappings has any
       permanent storage locations.  The effect of <i>msync</i>() on a shared
       memory object or a typed memory object is unspecified.  The
       behavior of this function is unspecified if the mapping was not
       established by a call to <i>mmap</i>().

       The <i>flags</i> argument is constructed from the bitwise-inclusive OR
       of one or more of the following flags defined in the <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i>
       header:
             ┌───────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
             │ <b>Symbolic Constant </b>│         <b>Description          </b>│
             ├───────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
             │ MS_ASYNC          │ Perform asynchronous writes. │
             │ MS_SYNC           │ Perform synchronous writes.  │
             │ MS_INVALIDATE     │ Invalidate cached data.      │
             └───────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘

       When MS_ASYNC is specified, <i>msync</i>() shall return immediately once
       all the write operations are initiated or queued for servicing;
       when MS_SYNC is specified, <i>msync</i>() shall not return until all
       write operations are completed as defined for synchronized I/O
       data integrity completion. Either MS_ASYNC or MS_SYNC shall be
       specified, but not both.

       When MS_INVALIDATE is specified, <i>msync</i>() shall invalidate all
       cached copies of mapped data that are inconsistent with the
       permanent storage locations such that subsequent references shall
       obtain data that was consistent with the permanent storage
       locations sometime between the call to <i>msync</i>() and the first
       subsequent memory reference to the data.

       If <i>msync</i>() causes any write to a file, the file's last data
       modification and last file status change timestamps shall be
       marked for update.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>msync</i>() shall return 0; otherwise, it
       shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>msync</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBUSY  </b>Some or all of the addresses in the range starting at <i>addr</i>
              and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes are locked, and MS_INVALIDATE
              is specified.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>flags</i> is invalid.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The addresses in the range starting at <i>addr</i> and continuing
              for <i>len</i> bytes are outside the range allowed for the
              address space of a process or specify one or more pages
              that are not mapped.

       The <i>msync</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>addr</i> is not a multiple of the page size as
              returned by <i>sysconf</i>().

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>msync</i>() function is only supported if the Synchronized Input
       and Output option is supported, and thus need not be available on
       all implementations.

       The <i>msync</i>() function should be used by programs that require a
       memory object to be in a known state; for example, in building
       transaction facilities.

       Normal system activity can cause pages to be written to disk.
       Therefore, there are no guarantees that <i>msync</i>() is the only
       control over when pages are or are not written to disk.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>msync</i>() function writes out data in a mapped region to the
       permanent storage for the underlying object. The call to <i>msync</i>()
       ensures data integrity of the file.

       After the data is written out, any cached data may be invalidated
       if the MS_INVALIDATE flag was specified. This is useful on
       systems that do not support read/write consistency.
