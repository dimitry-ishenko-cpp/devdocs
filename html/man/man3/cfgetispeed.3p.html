       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the

       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cfgetispeed — get input baud rate
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;termios.h&gt;

       speed_t cfgetispeed(const struct termios *<i>termios_p</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cfgetispeed</i>() function shall extract the input baud rate from
       the <b>termios </b>structure to which the <i>termios_p</i> argument points.

       This function shall return exactly the value in the <b>termios </b>data
       structure, without interpretation.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>cfgetispeed</i>() shall return a value of
       type <b>speed_t </b>representing the input baud rate.
</pre> <h2>

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The term ``baud'' is used historically here, but is not
       technically correct. This is properly ``bits per second'', which
       may not be the same as baud. However, the term is used because of
       the historical usage and understanding.

       The <i>cfgetospeed</i>(), <i>cfgetispeed</i>(), <i>cfsetospeed</i>(), and
       <i>cfsetispeed</i>() functions do not take arguments as numbers, but
       rather as symbolic names. There are two reasons for this:

        1. Historically, numbers were not used because of the way the
           rate was stored in the data structure. This is retained even
           though a function is now used.

        2. More importantly, only a limited set of possible rates is at
           all portable, and this constrains the application to that
           set.

       There is nothing to prevent an implementation accepting as an
       extension a number (such as 126), and since the encoding of the
       Bxxx symbols is not specified, this can be done to avoid
       introducing ambiguity.

       Setting the input baud rate to zero was a mechanism to allow for
       split baud rates. Clarifications in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       have made it possible to determine whether split rates are
       supported and to support them without having to treat zero as a
       special case. Since this functionality is also confusing, it has
       been declared obsolescent.  The 0 argument referred to is the
       literal constant 0, not the symbolic constant B0. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 does not preclude B0 from being defined as the value
       0; in fact, implementations would likely benefit from the two
       being equivalent. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not fully
       specify whether the previous <i>cfsetispeed</i>() value is retained
       after a <i>tcgetattr</i>() as the actual value or as zero. Therefore,
       conforming applications should always set both the input speed
       and output speed when setting either.

       In historical implementations, the baud rate information is
       traditionally kept in <b>c_cflag</b>.  Applications should be written to
       presume that this might be the case (and thus not blindly copy
       <b>c_cflag</b>), but not to rely on it in case it is in some other field
       of the structure. Setting the <b>c_cflag </b>field absolutely after
       setting a baud rate is a non-portable action because of this. In
       general, the unused parts of the flag fields might be used by the
       implementation and should not be blindly copied from the
       descriptions of one terminal device to another.
