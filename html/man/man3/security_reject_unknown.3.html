NAME </h2>
<pre>
       security_getenforce, security_setenforce, security_deny_unknown,
       security_reject_unknown, security_get_checkreqprot - get or set
       the enforcing state of SELinux
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;selinux/selinux.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int security_getenforce(void);</b>

       <b>int security_setenforce(int </b><i>value</i><b>);</b>

       <b>int security_deny_unknown(void);</b>

       <b>int security_reject_unknown(void);</b>

       <b>int security_get_checkreqprot(void);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>security_getenforce</b>() returns 0 if SELinux is running in
       permissive mode, 1 if it is running in enforcing mode, and -1 on
       error.

       <b>security_setenforce</b>() sets SELinux to enforcing mode if the value
       1 is passed in, and sets it to permissive mode if 0 is passed in.
       On success 0 is returned, on error -1 is returned.

       <b>security_deny_unknown</b>() returns 0 if SELinux treats policy
       queries on undefined object classes or permissions as being
       allowed, 1 if such queries are denied, and -1 on error.

       <b>security_reject_unknown</b>() returns 1 if the current policy was
       built with handle-unknown=reject and SELinux would reject loading
       it, if it did not define all kernel object classes and
       permissions. In this state, when <b>selinux_set_mapping() </b>and
       <b>selinux_check_access() </b>are used with an undefined userspace class
       or permission, an error is returned and errno is set to EINVAL.

       It returns 0 if the current policy was built with handle-
       unknown=allow or handle-unknown=deny. In this state, policy
       queries are treated according to <b>security_deny_unknown().  </b>-1 is
       returned on error.

       <b>security_get_checkreqprot</b>() can be used to determine whether
       SELinux is configured to check the protection requested by the
       application or the actual protection that will be applied by the
       kernel (including the effects of READ_IMPLIES_EXEC) on mmap and
       mprotect calls.  It returns 0 if SELinux checks the actual
       protection, 1 if it checks the requested protection, and -1 on
       error.
