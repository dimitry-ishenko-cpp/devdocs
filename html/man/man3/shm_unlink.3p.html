PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       shm_unlink — remove a shared memory object (<b>REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int shm_unlink(const char *<i>name</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>shm_unlink</i>() function shall remove the name of the shared
       memory object named by the string pointed to by <i>name</i>.

       If one or more references to the shared memory object exist when
       the object is unlinked, the name shall be removed before
       <i>shm_unlink</i>() returns, but the removal of the memory object
       contents shall be postponed until all open and map references to
       the shared memory object have been removed.

       Even if the object continues to exist after the last
       <i>shm_unlink</i>(), reuse of the name shall subsequently cause
       <i>shm_open</i>() to behave as if no shared memory object of this name
       exists (that is, <i>shm_open</i>() will fail if O_CREAT is not set, or
       will create a new shared memory object if O_CREAT is set).
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, a value of zero shall be returned.
       Otherwise, a value of -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to
       indicate the error. If -1 is returned, the named shared memory
       object shall not be changed by this function call.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>shm_unlink</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Permission is denied to unlink the named shared memory
              object.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The named shared memory object does not exist.

       The <i>shm_unlink</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of the <i>name</i> argument exceeds {_POSIX_PATH_MAX}
              on systems that do not support the XSI option or exceeds
              {_XOPEN_PATH_MAX} on XSI systems, or has a pathname
              component that is longer than {_POSIX_NAME_MAX} on systems
              that do not support the XSI option or longer than
              {_XOPEN_NAME_MAX} on XSI systems.  A call to <i>shm_unlink</i>()
              with a <i>name</i> argument that contains the same shared memory
              object name as was previously used in a successful
              <i>shm_open</i>() call shall not give an <b>[ENAMETOOLONG] </b>error.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Names of memory objects that were allocated with <i>open</i>() are
       deleted with <i>unlink</i>() in the usual fashion. Names of memory
       objects that were allocated with <i>shm_open</i>() are deleted with
       <i>shm_unlink</i>().  Note that the actual memory object is not
       destroyed until the last close and unmap on it have occurred if
       it was already in use.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version might require the <i>shm_open</i>() and <i>shm_unlink</i>()
       functions to have semantics similar to normal file system
       operations.
