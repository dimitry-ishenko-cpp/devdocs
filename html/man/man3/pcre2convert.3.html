EXPERIMENTAL PATTERN CONVERSION FUNCTIONS </h2>
<pre>

       This document describes a set of functions that can be used to
       convert "foreign" patterns into PCRE2 regular expressions. This
       facility is currently experimental, and may be changed in future
       releases. Two kinds of pattern, globs and POSIX patterns, are
       supported.
</pre> <h2>
THE CONVERT CONTEXT </h2>
<pre>

       <b>pcre2_convert_context *pcre2_convert_context_create(</b>
         <b>pcre2_general_context *</b><i>gcontext</i><b>);</b>

       <b>pcre2_convert_context *pcre2_convert_context_copy(</b>
         <b>pcre2_convert_context *</b><i>cvcontext</i><b>);</b>

       <b>void pcre2_convert_context_free(pcre2_convert_context *</b><i>cvcontext</i><b>);</b>

       <b>int pcre2_set_glob_escape(pcre2_convert_context *</b><i>cvcontext</i><b>,</b>
         <b>uint32_t </b><i>escape_char</i><b>);</b>

       <b>int pcre2_set_glob_separator(pcre2_convert_context *</b><i>cvcontext</i><b>,</b>
         <b>uint32_t </b><i>separator_char</i><b>);</b>

       A convert context is used to hold parameters that affect the way
       that pattern conversion works. Like all PCRE2 contexts, you need
       to use a context only if you want to override the defaults. There
       are the usual create, copy, and free functions. If custom memory
       management functions are set in a general context that is passed
       to <b>pcre2_convert_context_create()</b>, they are used for all memory
       management within the conversion functions.

       There are only two parameters in the convert context at present.
       Both apply only to glob conversions. The escape character
       defaults to grave accent under Windows, otherwise backslash. It
       can be set to zero, meaning no escape character, or to any
       punctuation character with a code point less than 256.  The
       separator character defaults to backslash under Windows,
       otherwise forward slash. It can be set to forward slash,
       backslash, or dot.

       The two setting functions return zero on success, or
       PCRE2_ERROR_BADDATA if their second argument is invalid.
</pre> <h2>
THE CONVERSION FUNCTION </h2>
<pre>

       <b>int pcre2_pattern_convert(PCRE2_SPTR </b><i>pattern</i><b>, PCRE2_SIZE </b><i>length</i><b>,</b>
         <b>uint32_t </b><i>options</i><b>, PCRE2_UCHAR **</b><i>buffer</i><b>,</b>
         <b>PCRE2_SIZE *</b><i>blength</i><b>, pcre2_convert_context *</b><i>cvcontext</i><b>);</b>

       <b>void pcre2_converted_pattern_free(PCRE2_UCHAR *</b><i>converted_pattern</i><b>);</b>

       The first two arguments of <b>pcre2_pattern_convert() </b>define the
       foreign pattern that is to be converted. The length may be given
       as PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED. The <b>options </b>argument defines how the
       pattern is to be processed. If the input is UTF, the
       PCRE2_CONVERT_UTF option should be set.
       PCRE2_CONVERT_NO_UTF_CHECK may also be set if you are sure the
       input is valid.  One or more of the glob options, or one of the
       following POSIX options must be set to define the type of
       conversion that is required:

         PCRE2_CONVERT_GLOB
         PCRE2_CONVERT_GLOB_NO_WILD_SEPARATOR
         PCRE2_CONVERT_GLOB_NO_STARSTAR
         PCRE2_CONVERT_POSIX_BASIC
         PCRE2_CONVERT_POSIX_EXTENDED

       Details of the conversions are given below. The <b>buffer </b>and
       <b>blength </b>arguments define how the output is handled:

       If <b>buffer </b>is NULL, the function just returns the length of the
       converted pattern via <b>blength</b>. This is one less than the length
       of buffer needed, because a terminating zero is always added to
       the output.

       If <b>buffer </b>points to a NULL pointer, an output buffer is obtained
       using the allocator in the context or <b>malloc() </b>if no context is
       supplied. A pointer to this buffer is placed in the variable to
       which <b>buffer </b>points.  When no longer needed the output buffer
       must be freed by calling <b>pcre2_converted_pattern_free()</b>. If this
       function is called with a NULL argument, it returns immediately
       without doing anything.

       If <b>buffer </b>points to a non-NULL pointer, <b>blength </b>must be set to
       the actual length of the buffer provided (in code units).

       In all cases, after successful conversion, the variable pointed
       to by <b>blength </b>is updated to the length actually used (in code
       units), excluding the terminating zero that is always added.

       If an error occurs, the length (via <b>blength</b>) is set to the offset
       within the input pattern where the error was detected. Only gross
       syntax errors are caught; there are plenty of errors that will
       get passed on for <b>pcre2_compile() </b>to discover.

       The return from <b>pcre2_pattern_convert() </b>is zero on success or a
       non-zero PCRE2 error code. Note that PCRE2 error codes may be
       positive or negative: <b>pcre2_compile() </b>uses mostly positive codes
       and <b>pcre2_match() </b>negative ones; <b>pcre2_convert() </b>uses existing
       codes of both kinds. A textual error message can be obtained by
       calling <b>pcre2_get_error_message()</b>.
</pre> <h2>
CONVERTING GLOBS </h2>
<pre>

       Globs are used to match file names, and consequently have the
       concept of a "path separator", which defaults to backslash under
       Windows and forward slash otherwise. If PCRE2_CONVERT_GLOB is
       set, the wildcards * and ? are not permitted to match separator
       characters, but the double-star (**) feature (which does match
       separators) is supported.

       PCRE2_CONVERT_GLOB_NO_WILD_SEPARATOR matches globs with wildcards
       allowed to match separator characters.
       PCRE2_CONVERT_GLOB_NO_STARSTAR matches globs with the double-star
       feature disabled. These options may be given together.
</pre> <h2>
CONVERTING POSIX PATTERNS </h2>
<pre>

       POSIX defines two kinds of regular expression pattern: basic and
       extended.  These can be processed by setting
       PCRE2_CONVERT_POSIX_BASIC or PCRE2_CONVERT_POSIX_EXTENDED,
       respectively.

       In POSIX patterns, backslash is not special in a character class.
       Unmatched closing parentheses are treated as literals.

       In basic patterns, ? + | {} and () must be escaped to be
       recognized as metacharacters outside a character class. If the
       first character in the pattern is * it is treated as a literal. ^
       is a metacharacter only at the start of a branch.

       In extended patterns, a backslash not in a character class always
       makes the next character literal, whatever it is. There are no
       backreferences.

       Note: POSIX mandates that the longest possible match at the first
       matching position must be found. This is not what <b>pcre2_match()</b>
       does; it yields the first match that is found. An application can
       use <b>pcre2_dfa_match() </b>to find the longest match, but that does
       not support backreferences (but then neither do POSIX extended
       patterns).
