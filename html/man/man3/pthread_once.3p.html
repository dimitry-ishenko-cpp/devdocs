<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_once — dynamic package initialization
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_once(pthread_once_t *<i>once_control</i>,
           void (*<i>init_routine</i>)(void));
       pthread_once_t <i>once_control</i> = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The first call to <i>pthread_once</i>() by any thread in a process, with
       a given <i>once_control</i>, shall call the <i>init_routine</i> with no
       arguments. Subsequent calls of <i>pthread_once</i>() with the same
       <i>once_control</i> shall not call the <i>init_routine</i>.  On return from
       <i>pthread_once</i>(), <i>init_routine</i> shall have completed. The
       <i>once_control</i> parameter shall determine whether the associated
       initialization routine has been called.

       The <i>pthread_once</i>() function is not a cancellation point. However,
       if <i>init_routine</i> is a cancellation point and is canceled, the
       effect on <i>once_control</i> shall be as if <i>pthread_once</i>() was never
       called.

       If the call to <i>init_routine</i> is terminated by a call to <i>longjmp</i>(),
       <i>_longjmp</i>(), or <i>siglongjmp</i>(), the behavior is undefined.

       The constant PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT is defined in the <i>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</i>
       header.

       The behavior of <i>pthread_once</i>() is undefined if <i>once_control</i> has
       automatic storage duration or is not initialized by
       PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>pthread_once</i>() shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_once</i>() function shall not return an error code of
       <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>init_routine</i> recursively calls <i>pthread_once</i>() with the same
       <i>once_control</i>, the recursive call will not call the specified
       <i>init_routine</i>, and thus the specified <i>init_routine</i> will not
       complete, and thus the recursive call to <i>pthread_once</i>() will not
       return. Use of <i>longjmp</i>(), <i>_longjmp</i>(), or <i>siglongjmp</i>() within an
       <i>init_routine</i> to jump to a point outside of <i>init_routine</i> prevents
       <i>init_routine</i> from returning.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Some C libraries are designed for dynamic initialization. That
       is, the global initialization for the library is performed when
       the first procedure in the library is called. In a single-
       threaded program, this is normally implemented using a static
       variable whose value is checked on entry to a routine, as
       follows:

           static int random_is_initialized = 0;
           extern void initialize_random(void);

           int random_function()
           {
               if (random_is_initialized == 0) {
                   initialize_random();
                   random_is_initialized = 1;
               }
               ... /* Operations performed after initialization. */
           }

       To keep the same structure in a multi-threaded program, a new
       primitive is needed. Otherwise, library initialization has to be
       accomplished by an explicit call to a library-exported
       initialization function prior to any use of the library.

       For dynamic library initialization in a multi-threaded process,
       if an initialization flag is used the flag needs to be protected
       against modification by multiple threads simultaneously calling
       into the library. This can be done by using a mutex (initialized
       by assigning PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER). However, the better
       solution is to use <i>pthread_once</i>() which is designed for exactly
       this purpose, as follows:

           #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
           static pthread_once_t random_is_initialized = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
           extern void initialize_random(void);

           int random_function()
           {
               (void) pthread_once(&amp;random_is_initialized, initialize_random);
               ... /* Operations performed after initialization. */
           }

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>once_control</i> argument to <i>pthread_once</i>() does not refer to a
       <b>pthread_once_t </b>object initialized by PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT, it is
       recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b>
       error.
