PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_madvise — memory advisory information and alignment control
       (<b>ADVANCED REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int posix_madvise(void *<i>addr</i>, size_t <i>len</i>, int <i>advice</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_madvise</i>() function shall advise the implementation on
       the expected behavior of the application with respect to the data
       in the memory starting at address <i>addr</i>, and continuing for <i>len</i>
       bytes. The implementation may use this information to optimize
       handling of the specified data. The <i>posix_madvise</i>() function
       shall have no effect on the semantics of access to memory in the
       specified range, although it may affect the performance of
       access.

       The implementation may require that <i>addr</i> be a multiple of the
       page size, which is the value returned by <i>sysconf</i>() when the name
       value _SC_PAGESIZE is used.

       The advice to be applied to the memory range is specified by the
       <i>advice</i> parameter and may be one of the following values:

       POSIX_MADV_NORMAL
             Specifies that the application has no advice to give on its
             behavior with respect to the specified range. It is the
             default characteristic if no advice is given for a range of
             memory.

       POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL
             Specifies that the application expects to access the
             specified range sequentially from lower addresses to higher
             addresses.

       POSIX_MADV_RANDOM
             Specifies that the application expects to access the
             specified range in a random order.

       POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED
             Specifies that the application expects to access the
             specified range in the near future.

       POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED
             Specifies that the application expects that it will not
             access the specified range in the near future.

       These values are defined in the <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i> header.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>posix_madvise</i>() shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_madvise</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>advice</i> is invalid.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Addresses in the range starting at <i>addr</i> and continuing for
              <i>len</i> bytes are partly or completely outside the range
              allowed for the address space of the calling process.

       The <i>posix_madvise</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>addr</i> is not a multiple of the value returned
              by <i>sysconf</i>() when the name value _SC_PAGESIZE is used.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>len</i> is zero.
