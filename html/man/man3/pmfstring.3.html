NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmfstring </b>- safe string scanning
</pre> <h2>
C SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcp/pmapi.h&gt;</b>

       <b>ssize_t pmfstring(FILE *</b><i>f</i><b>, char **</b><i>str</i><b>);</b>

       <b>cc ... -lpcp</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmfstring </b>is a safe string scanning routine with semantics
       similar to <a href="fscanf.3.html">fscanf(3)</a> with the <b>%s </b>format specifier.  It scans the
       input stream from <i>f</i> skipping initial whitespace characters, then
       accumulating all the subsequent non-whitespace characters.

       The main difference is that <b>pmfstring </b>allocates the result buffer
       <i>str</i> using the <a href="malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a> family and ensures that <i>str</i> is (a) large
       enough and (b) null-byte terminated.

       Additionally <b>pmfstring </b>does not consider \n to be a whitespace
       character in the initial scan (before filling <i>str</i>) and so will
       not scan past the end of the current line, which is different to
       <a href="fscanf.3.html">fscanf(3)</a> and better aligned with the PCP use cases.

       The caller is responsible for maintaining a reference to <i>str</i> or
       calling <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a> to release the associated storage.

       On success, <b>pmfstring </b>returns the length of <i>str</i> (the same length
       as <a href="strlen.3.html">strlen(3)</a> would return) that is guaranteed to be not less than
       1.

       Failure is indicated by one of the following, and <i>str</i> is not
       assigned a value:
        • 0 to indicate no non-whitespace characters were found before
          the end of the current line from the stream <i>f</i>
        • -1 ( aka <b>EOF</b>) to indicate end of file on the stream <i>f</i>
        • -2 to indicate some more serious failure, probably in the
          <a href="malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a> routines; refer to <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> for more information
</pre> <h2>
COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmfstring </b>has similar semantics to the <b>%ms </b>format specifier in
       some versions of <a href="fscanf.3.html">fscanf(3)</a> and the C99 <b>fscanf_s</b>(3) routine -
       unfortunately neither of these is portable.
