NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_lookupdev - find the default device on which to capture
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];</b>

       <b>[DEPRECATED] char *pcap_lookupdev(char *errbuf);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>This interface is obsoleted by pcap_findalldevs</b>(3PCAP).  To find
       a default device on which to capture, call <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>()
       and, if the list it returns is not empty, use the first device in
       the list.  (If the list is empty, there are no devices on which
       capture is possible.)  <i>errbuf</i> is a buffer large enough to hold at
       least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE </b>chars.

       <b>If pcap_init</b>(3PCAP) <b>has been called, this interface always</b>
       <b>returns NULL</b>.

       <b>pcap_lookupdev</b>() returns a pointer to a string giving the name of
       a network device suitable for use with <b>pcap_create</b>(3PCAP) and
       <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP), or with <b>pcap_open_live</b>(3PCAP), and with
       <b>pcap_lookupnet</b>(3PCAP).  If there is an error, or if
       <b>pcap_init</b>(3PCAP) has been called, <b>NULL </b>is returned and <i>errbuf</i> is
       filled in with an appropriate error message.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The pointer returned by <b>pcap_lookupdev</b>() points to a static
       buffer; subsequent calls to <b>pcap_lookupdev</b>() in the same thread,
       or calls to <b>pcap_lookupdev</b>() in another thread, may overwrite
       that buffer.

       In WinPcap and Npcap, this function may return a UTF-16 string
       rather than an ASCII or UTF-8 string.
