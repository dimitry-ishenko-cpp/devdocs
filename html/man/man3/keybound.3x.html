NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>keybound </b>- return definition of keycode
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;curses.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char * keybound(int </b><i>keycode</i><b>, int </b><i>count);</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to determine the string which is defined in the
       terminfo for specific keycodes.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>keycode</i> parameter must be greater than zero, else NULL is
       returned.  If it does not correspond to a defined key, then NULL
       is returned.  The <i>count</i> parameter is used to allow the
       application to iterate through multiple definitions, counting
       from zero.  When successful, the function returns a string which
       must be freed by the caller.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported
       on Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended
       that any code depending on them be conditioned using
       NCURSES_VERSION.
