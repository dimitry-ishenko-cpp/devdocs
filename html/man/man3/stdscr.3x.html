DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This page summarizes variables provided by the <b>curses </b>library.  A
       more complete description is given in the <b>curses</b>(3X) manual page.

       Depending on the configuration, these may be actual variables, or
       macros  (see  <b>curs_threads</b>(3X) and <b>curs_opaque</b>(3X)) which provide
       read-only access to <i>curses</i>'s state.  In either case, applications
       should treat them as read-only to avoid confusing the library.

   <b>COLOR_PAIRS</b>
       After initializing curses, this variable contains the  number  of
       color  pairs  which the terminal can support.  Usually the number
       of color pairs will be the product <b>COLORS</b>*<b>COLORS</b>, however this is
       not always true:

       •   a few terminals use HLS colors, which do not follow this rule

       •   terminals supporting a large number of colors are limited by
           the number of color pairs that can be represented in a <i>signed</i>
           <i>short</i> value.

   <b>COLORS</b>
       After initializing curses, this variable contains the number of
       colors which the terminal can support.

   <b>COLS</b>
       After initializing curses, this variable contains the width of
       the screen, i.e., the number of columns.

   <b>ESCDELAY</b>
       This variable holds the number of milliseconds to wait after
       reading an escape character, to distinguish between an individual
       escape character entered on the keyboard from escape sequences
       sent by cursor- and function-keys (see curses(3X)).

   <b>LINES</b>
       After initializing curses, this variable contains the height of
       the screen, i.e., the number of lines.

   <b>TABSIZE</b>
       This variable holds the number of columns used by the <i>curses</i> li‐
       brary when converting a tab character to spaces as it adds the
       tab to a window (see <b>curs_addch</b>(3X).

   <b>The Current Screen</b>
       This implementation of curses uses a special window <b>curscr </b>to
       record its updates to the terminal screen.

       This is referred to as the “physical screen” in the <b>curs_re‐</b>
       <b>fresh</b>(3X) and <b>curs_outopts</b>(3X) manual pages.

   <b>The New Screen</b>
       This implementation of curses uses a special window <b>newscr </b>to
       hold updates to the terminal screen before applying them to
       <b>curscr</b>.

       This is referred to as the “virtual screen” in the <b>curs_ker‐</b>
       <b>nel</b>(3X), <b>curs_refresh</b>(3X) and <b>curs_outopts</b>(3X) manual pages.

   <b>The Standard Screen</b>
       Upon initializing curses, a default window called <b>stdscr</b>, which
       is the size of the terminal screen, is created.  Many curses
       functions use this window.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The curses library is initialized using either <b>initscr</b>(3X), or
       <b>newterm</b>(3X).

       If <b>curses </b>is configured to use separate curses/terminfo li‐
       braries, most of these variables reside in the curses library.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>TABSIZE </b>is a feature of SVr4 curses which is not documented by
       X/Open curses.

       •   In SVr4 curses, <b>TABSIZE </b>is initially set from the terminal
           description's <b>init_tabs </b>capability.  After that, it can be
           altered by the applications using SVr4 curses.

           SVr4 curses uses the current value of <b>TABSIZE </b>to compute the
           position of tabstops for updating both the virtual screen
           with <b>addch</b>(3X) as well as the physical screen with <b>mvcur</b>(3X).

       •   This implementation uses the current value of <b>TABSIZE </b>only
           for updating the virtual screen.  It uses the terminal de‐
           scription's <b>it </b>(<b>init_tabs</b>) capability for computing hardware
           tabs (i.e., tab stops on the physical screen).

       •   Other implementations differ.  For instance, NetBSD curses
           allows <b>TABSIZE </b>to be set through an environment variable.
           This implementation does not.

           NetBSD curses does not support hardware tabs; it uses the
           <b>init_tabs </b>capability and the <b>TABSIZE </b>variable only for updat‐
           ing the virtual screen.

       <b>ESCDELAY </b>is an extension in AIX curses:

       •   In AIX, the units for <b>ESCDELAY </b>are <i>fifths</i> of a millisecond.

       •   The default value for AIX's <b>ESCDELAY </b>is 0.1 seconds.

       •   AIX also enforces a limit of 10,000 seconds for <b>ESCDELAY</b>;
           this implementation currently has no upper limit.

       This implementation has long used <b>ESCDELAY </b>with units of mil‐
       liseconds, making it impossible to be completely compatible with
       AIX.  Likewise, most users have either decided to override the
       value, or rely upon its default value.
