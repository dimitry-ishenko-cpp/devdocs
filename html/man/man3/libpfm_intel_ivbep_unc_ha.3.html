NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_ivbep_unc_ha - support for Intel Ivy Bridge-EP Home
       Agent (HA) uncore PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: ivbep_unc_ha0, ivbep_unc_ha1</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Ivy Bridge-EP HA uncore PMU</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Ivy Bridge Home Agent (HA) uncore
       PMU.  This PMU model only exists on Ivy Bridge model 62.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Ivy Bridge HA
       uncore PMU:

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to
              one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t      </b>Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the
              counter counts the number of HA cycles in which the number
              of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to the
              threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in the
              range [0:255].
