</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>acl_copy_ext </b>— copy an ACL from internal to external
       representation
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;<i>sys/types.h</i>&gt; &lt;<i>sys/acl.h</i>&gt; <i>ssize_t</i> <b>acl_copy_ext</b>(<i>void *buf_p</i>, <i>acl_t</i>
       <i>acl</i>, <i>ssize_t size</i>)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>acl_copy_ext</b>() function copies the ACL pointed to by <i>acl</i> from
       system-managed space to the user managed space pointed to by
       <i>buf_p</i>.  The <i>size</i> parameter represents the size in bytes of the
       buffer pointed to by <i>buf_p</i>.  The format of the ACL placed in the
       buffer pointed to by <i>buf_p</i> is a contiguous, persistent data item,
       the format of which is unspecified.  It is the responsibility of
       the invoker to allocate an area large enough to hold the copied
       ACL. The size of the exportable, contiguous, persistent form of
       the ACL may be obtained by invoking the <b>acl_size</b>() function.

       Any ACL entry descriptors that refer to an entry in the ACL
       referenced by <i>acl</i> continue to refer to those entries. Any
       existing ACL pointers that refer to the ACL referenced by <i>acl</i>
       continue to refer to the ACL.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon success, this function returns the number of bytes placed in
       the buffer pointed to by <i>buf_p</i>.  On error, a value of <b>(ssize_t)-1</b>
       is returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set appropriately.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If any of the following conditions occur, the <b>acl_copy_ext</b>()
       function returns a value of <b>(ssize_t)-1 </b>and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the
       corresponding value:

       [EINVAL]           The <i>size</i> parameter is zero or negative.

                          The argument <i>acl</i> is not a valid pointer to an
                          ACL.

                          The ACL referenced by <i>acl</i> contains one or more
                          improperly formed ACL entries, or for some
                          other reason cannot be translated into the
                          external form of an ACL.

       [ERANGE]           The <i>size</i> parameter is greater than zero but
                          smaller than the length of the contiguous,
                          persistent form of the ACL.
