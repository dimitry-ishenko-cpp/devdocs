PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       tcflush — flush non-transmitted output data, non-read input data,
       or both
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;termios.h&gt;

       int tcflush(int <i>fildes</i>, int <i>queue_selector</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>tcflush</i>() shall discard data written
       to the object referred to by <i>fildes</i> (an open file descriptor
       associated with a terminal) but not transmitted, or data received
       but not read, depending on the value of <i>queue_selector</i>:

        *  If <i>queue_selector</i> is TCIFLUSH, it shall flush data received
           but not read.

        *  If <i>queue_selector</i> is TCOFLUSH, it shall flush data written
           but not transmitted.

        *  If <i>queue_selector</i> is TCIOFLUSH, it shall flush both data
           received but not read and data written but not transmitted.

       Attempts to use <i>tcflush</i>() from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a <i>fildes</i> associated with its
       controlling terminal shall cause the process group to be sent a
       SIGTTOU signal.  If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU
       signals or the process is ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process
       shall be allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tcflush</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>queue_selector</i> argument is not a supported value.

       <b>EIO    </b>The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the
              calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is
              not ignoring SIGTTOU.

       <b>ENOTTY </b>The file associated with <i>fildes</i> is not a terminal.
