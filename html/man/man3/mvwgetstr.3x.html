</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The  function <b>getstr </b>is equivalent to a series of calls to <b>getch</b>,
       until a newline or carriage return is received  (the  terminating
       character is not included in the returned string).  The resulting
       value  is  placed in the area pointed to by the character pointer
       <i>str</i>, followed by a NUL.

       The <b>getnstr </b>function reads from the <i>stdscr</i> default  window.   The
       other  functions, such as <b>wgetnstr</b>, read from the window given as
       a parameter.

       <b>getnstr </b>reads at most <i>n</i> characters, thus  preventing  a  possible
       overflow  of the input buffer.  Any attempt to enter more charac‐
       ters (other than the  terminating  newline  or  carriage  return)
       causes a beep.  Function keys also cause a beep and are ignored.

       The user's <i>erase</i> and <i>kill</i> characters are interpreted:

       •   The <i>erase</i> character (e.g., <b>^H</b>) erases the character at the
           end of the buffer, moving the cursor to the left.

           If <i>keypad</i> mode is on for the window, <b>KEY_LEFT </b>and <b>KEY_BACK‐</b>
           <b>SPACE </b>are both considered equivalent to the user's erase
           character.

       •   The <i>kill</i> character (e.g., <b>^U</b>) erases the entire buffer, leav‐
           ing the cursor at the beginning of the buffer.

       Characters input are echoed only if <b>echo </b>is currently on.  In
       that case, backspace is echoed as deletion of the previous char‐
       acter (typically a left motion).
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       All routines return the integer <b>ERR </b>upon failure and an <b>OK </b>(SVr4
       specifies only “an integer value other than <b>ERR</b>”) upon successful
       completion.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.

       In this implementation, these functions return an error if the
       window pointer is null, or if its timeout expires without having
       any data.

       This implementation provides an extension as well.  If a <b>SIGWINCH</b>
       interrupts the function, it will return <b>KEY_RESIZE </b>rather than <b>OK</b>
       or <b>ERR</b>.

       Functions with a “mv” prefix first perform a cursor movement us‐
       ing <b>wmove</b>, and return an error if the position is outside the
       window, or if the window pointer is null.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that <b>getstr</b>, <b>mvgetstr</b>, and <b>mvwgetstr </b>may be macros.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue
       4.  They read single-byte characters only.  The standard does not
       define any error conditions.  This implementation returns <b>ERR </b>if
       the window pointer is null, or if the lower-level <b>wgetch</b>(3X) call
       returns an <b>ERR</b>.

       SVr3 and early SVr4 curses implementations did not reject func‐
       tion keys; the SVr4.0 documentation claimed that “special keys”
       (such as function keys, “home” key, “clear” key, <i>etc</i>.) are “in‐
       terpreted”, without giving details.  It lied.  In fact, the
       “character” value appended to the string by those implementations
       was predictable but not useful (being, in fact, the low-order
       eight bits of the key's KEY_ value).

       The functions <b>getnstr</b>, <b>mvgetnstr</b>, and <b>mvwgetnstr </b>were present but
       not documented in SVr4.

       X/Open Curses, Issue 5 (2007) stated that these functions “read
       at most <i>n</i> bytes” but did not state whether the terminating NUL is
       counted in that limit.  X/Open Curses, Issue 7 (2009) changed
       that to say they “read at most <i>n</i>-1 bytes” to allow for the termi‐
       nating NUL.  As of 2018, some implementations do, some do not
       count it:

       •   ncurses 6.1 and PDCurses do not count the NUL in the given
           limit, while

       •   Solaris SVr4 and NetBSD curses count the NUL as part of the
           limit.

       •   Solaris xcurses provides both: its wide-character <b>wget_nstr</b>
           reserves a NUL, but its <b>wgetnstr </b>does not count the NUL con‐
           sistently.

       In SVr4 curses, a negative value of <i>n</i> tells <b>wgetnstr </b>to assume
       that the caller's buffer is large enough to hold the result,
       i.e., to act like <b>wgetstr</b>.  X/Open Curses does not mention this
       (or anything related to negative or zero values of <i>n</i>), however
       most implementations use the feature, with different limits:

       •   Solaris SVr4 curses and PDCurses limit the result to 255
           bytes.  Other Unix systems than Solaris are likely to use the
           same limit.

       •   Solaris xcurses limits the result to <b>LINE_MAX </b>bytes.

       •   NetBSD 7 assumes no particular limit for the result from
           <b>wgetstr</b>.  However, it limits the <b>wgetnstr </b>parameter <i>n</i> to en‐
           sure that it is greater than zero.

           A comment in NetBSD's source code states that this is speci‐
           fied in SUSv2.

       •   ncurses (before 6.2) assumes no particular limit for the re‐
           sult from <b>wgetstr</b>, and treats the <i>n</i> parameter of <b>wgetnstr</b>
           like SVr4 curses.

       •   ncurses 6.2 uses <b>LINE_MAX</b>, or a larger (system-dependent)
           value which the <b>sysconf </b>function may provide.  If neither
           <b>LINE_MAX </b>or <b>sysconf </b>is available, ncurses uses the POSIX val‐
           ue for <b>LINE_MAX </b>(a 2048 byte limit).  In either case, it re‐
           serves a byte for the terminating NUL.

       Although <b>getnstr </b>is equivalent to a series of calls to <b>getch</b>, it
       also makes changes to the curses modes to allow simple editing of
       the input buffer:

       •   <b>getnstr </b>saves the current value of the <b>nl</b>, <b>echo</b>, <b>raw </b>and
           <b>cbreak </b>modes, and sets <b>nl</b>, <b>noecho</b>, <b>noraw</b>, and <b>cbreak</b>.

           <b>getnstr </b>handles the echoing of characters, rather than rely‐
           ing on the caller to set an appropriate mode.

       •   It also obtains the <i>erase</i> and <i>kill</i> characters from <b>erasechar</b>
           and <b>killchar</b>, respectively.

       •   On return, <b>getnstr </b>restores the modes to their previous val‐
           ues.

       Other implementations differ in their treatment of special char‐
       acters:

       •   While they may set the <i>echo</i> mode, other implementations do
           not modify the <i>raw</i> mode, They may take the <i>cbreak</i> mode set by
           the caller into account when deciding whether to handle echo‐
           ing within <b>getnstr </b>or as a side-effect of the <b>getch </b>calls.

       •   The original ncurses (as <i>pcurses</i> in 1986) set <b>noraw </b>and
           <b>cbreak </b>when accepting input for <b>getnstr</b>.  That may have been
           done to make function- and cursor-keys work; it is not neces‐
           sary with ncurses.

           Since 1995, ncurses has provided signal handlers for INTR and
           QUIT (e.g., <b>^C </b>or <b>^\</b>).  With the <b>noraw </b>and <b>cbreak </b>settings,
           those may catch a signal and stop the program, where other
           implementations allow one to enter those characters in the
           buffer.

       •   Starting in 2021 (ncurses 6.3), <b>getnstr </b>sets <b>raw</b>, rather than
           <b>noraw </b>and <b>cbreak </b>for better compatibility with SVr4-curses,
           e.g., allowing one to enter a <b>^C </b>into the buffer.
