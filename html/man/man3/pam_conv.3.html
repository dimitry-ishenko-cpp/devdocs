                       struct pam_response **resp, void *appdata_ptr);
           void *appdata_ptr;
       };

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The PAM library uses an application-defined callback to allow a
       direct communication between a loaded module and the application.
       This callback is specified by the <i>struct pam_conv</i> passed to
       <a href="pam_start.3.html">pam_start(3)</a> at the start of the transaction.

       When a module calls the referenced conv() function, the argument
       <i>appdata_ptr</i> is set to the second element of this structure.

       The other arguments of a call to conv() concern the information
       exchanged by module and application. That is to say, <i>num_msg</i>
       holds the length of the array of pointers, <i>msg</i>. After a
       successful return, the pointer <i>resp</i> points to an array of
       pam_response structures, holding the application supplied text.
       The <i>resp_retcode</i> member of this struct is unused and should be
       set to zero. It is the caller's responsibility to release both,
       this array and the responses themselves, using <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a>. Note,
       <i>*resp</i> is a <i>struct pam_response</i> array and not an array of
       pointers.

       The number of responses is always equal to the <i>num_msg</i>
       conversation function argument. This does require that the
       response array is <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a>'d after every call to the conversation
       function. The index of the responses corresponds directly to the
       prompt index in the pam_message array.

       On failure, the conversation function should release any
       resources it has allocated, and return one of the predefined PAM
       error codes.

       Each message can have one of four types, specified by the
       <i>msg_style</i> member of <i>struct pam_message</i>:

       PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF
           Obtain a string without echoing any text.

       PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON
           Obtain a string whilst echoing text.

       PAM_ERROR_MSG
           Display an error message.

       PAM_TEXT_INFO
           Display some text.

       The point of having an array of messages is that it becomes
       possible to pass a number of things to the application in a
       single call from the module. It can also be convenient for the
       application that related things come at once: a windows based
       application can then present a single form with many
       messages/prompts on at once.

       In passing, it is worth noting that there is a discrepancy
       between the way Linux-PAM handles the const struct pam_message
       **msg conversation function argument and the way that Solaris'
       PAM (and derivatives, known to include HP/UX, are there others?)
       does. Linux-PAM interprets the msg argument as entirely
       equivalent to the following prototype const struct pam_message
       *msg[] (which, in spirit, is consistent with the commonly used
       prototypes for argv argument to the familiar main() function:
       char **argv; and char *argv[]). Said another way Linux-PAM
       interprets the msg argument as a pointer to an array of num_msg
       read only 'struct pam_message' pointers. Solaris' PAM
       implementation interprets this argument as a pointer to a pointer
       to an array of num_msg pam_message structures. Fortunately,
       perhaps, for most module/application developers when num_msg has
       a value of one these two definitions are entirely equivalent.
       Unfortunately, casually raising this number to two has led to
       unanticipated compatibility problems.

       For what its worth the two known module writer work-arounds for
       trying to maintain source level compatibility with both PAM
       implementations are:

       •   never call the conversation function with num_msg greater
           than one.

       •   set up msg as doubly referenced so both types of conversation
           function can find the messages. That is, make

                      msg[n] = &amp; (( *msg )[n])
