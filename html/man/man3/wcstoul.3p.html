NAME </h2>

       wcstoul, wcstoull — convert a wide-character string to an
       unsigned long
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       unsigned long wcstoul(const wchar_t *restrict <i>nptr</i>,
           wchar_t **restrict <i>endptr</i>, int <i>base</i>);
       unsigned long long wcstoull(const wchar_t *restrict <i>nptr</i>,
           wchar_t **restrict <i>endptr</i>, int <i>base</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>wcstoul</i>() and <i>wcstoull</i>() functions shall convert the initial
       portion of the wide-character string pointed to by <i>nptr</i> to
       <b>unsigned long </b>and <b>unsigned long long </b>representation,
       respectively. First, they shall decompose the input wide-
       character string into three parts:

        1. An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space wide-
           character codes (as specified by <i>iswspace</i>())

        2. A subject sequence interpreted as an integer represented in
           some radix determined by the value of <i>base</i>

        3. A final wide-character string of one or more unrecognized
           wide-character codes, including the terminating null wide-
           character code of the input wide-character string

       Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence to an
       unsigned integer, and return the result.

       If <i>base</i> is 0, the expected form of the subject sequence is that
       of a decimal constant, octal constant, or hexadecimal constant,
       any of which may be preceded by a <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-' </b>sign. A decimal
       constant begins with a non-zero digit, and consists of a sequence
       of decimal digits. An octal constant consists of the prefix <b>'0'</b>
       optionally followed by a sequence of the digits <b>'0' </b>to <b>'7' </b>only.
       A hexadecimal constant consists of the prefix 0x or 0X followed
       by a sequence of the decimal digits and letters <b>'a' </b>(or <b>'A'</b>) to
       <b>'f' </b>(or <b>'F'</b>) with values 10 to 15 respectively.

       If the value of <i>base</i> is between 2 and 36, the expected form of
       the subject sequence is a sequence of letters and digits
       representing an integer with the radix specified by <i>base</i>,
       optionally preceded by a <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-' </b>sign, but not including an
       integer suffix. The letters from <b>'a' </b>(or <b>'A'</b>) to <b>'z' </b>(or <b>'Z'</b>)
       inclusive are ascribed the values 10 to 35; only letters whose
       ascribed values are less than that of <i>base</i> shall be permitted. If
       the value of <i>base</i> is 16, the wide-character codes 0x or 0X may
       optionally precede the sequence of letters and digits, following
       the sign if present.

       The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial
       subsequence of the input wide-character string, starting with the
       first wide-character code that is not white space and is of the
       expected form. The subject sequence contains no wide-character
       codes if the input wide-character string is empty or consists
       entirely of white-space wide-character codes, or if the first
       wide-character code that is not white space is other than a sign
       or a permissible letter or digit.

       If the subject sequence has the expected form and <i>base</i> is 0, the
       sequence of wide-character codes starting with the first digit
       shall be interpreted as an integer constant. If the subject
       sequence has the expected form and the value of <i>base</i> is between 2
       and 36, it shall be used as the base for conversion, ascribing to
       each letter its value as given above. If the subject sequence
       begins with a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;, the value resulting from the
       conversion shall be negated. A pointer to the final wide-
       character string shall be stored in the object pointed to by
       <i>endptr</i>, provided that <i>endptr</i> is not a null pointer.

       In other than the C or POSIX locale, additional locale-specific
       subject sequence forms may be accepted.

       If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected
       form, no conversion shall be performed; the value of <i>nptr</i> shall
       be stored in the object pointed to by <i>endptr</i>, provided that
       <i>endptr</i> is not a null pointer.

       These functions shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.

       Since 0, {ULONG_MAX}, and {ULLONG_MAX} are returned on error and
       0 is also a valid return on success, an application wishing to
       check for error situations should set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to 0, then call
       <i>wcstoul</i>() or <i>wcstoull</i>(), then check <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>wcstoul</i>() and <i>wcstoull</i>()
       functions shall return the converted value, if any. If no
       conversion could be performed, 0 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> may
       be set to indicate the error.  If the correct value is outside
       the range of representable values, {ULONG_MAX} or {ULLONG_MAX}
       respectively shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[ERANGE]</b>.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>base</i> is not supported.

       <b>ERANGE </b>The value to be returned is not representable.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>No conversion could be performed.
