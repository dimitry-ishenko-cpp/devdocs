PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       exit — terminate a process
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       void exit(int <i>status</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The value of <i>status</i> may be 0, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE, or any
       other value, though only the least significant 8 bits (that is,
       <i>status</i> &amp; 0377) shall be available from <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>(); the
       full value shall be available from <i>waitid</i>() and in the <b>siginfo_t</b>
       passed to a signal handler for SIGCHLD.

       The <i>exit</i>() function shall first call all functions registered by
       <i>atexit</i>(), in the reverse order of their registration, except that
       a function is called after any previously registered functions
       that had already been called at the time it was registered. Each
       function is called as many times as it was registered. If, during
       the call to any such function, a call to the <i>longjmp</i>() function
       is made that would terminate the call to the registered function,
       the behavior is undefined.

       If a function registered by a call to <i>atexit</i>() fails to return,
       the remaining registered functions shall not be called and the
       rest of the <i>exit</i>() processing shall not be completed. If <i>exit</i>()
       is called more than once, the behavior is undefined.

       The <i>exit</i>() function shall then flush all open streams with
       unwritten buffered data and close all open streams. Finally, the
       process shall be terminated with the same consequences as
       described in <i>Consequences of Process Termination</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>exit</i>() function does not return.
