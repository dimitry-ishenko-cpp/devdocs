PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       getlogin, getlogin_r — get login name
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       char *getlogin(void);
       int getlogin_r(char *<i>name</i>, size_t <i>namesize</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getlogin</i>() function shall return a pointer to a string
       containing the user name associated by the login activity with
       the controlling terminal of the current process. If <i>getlogin</i>()
       returns a non-null pointer, then that pointer points to the name
       that the user logged in under, even if there are several login
       names with the same user ID.

       The <i>getlogin</i>() function need not be thread-safe.

       The <i>getlogin_r</i>() function shall put the name associated by the
       login activity with the controlling terminal of the current
       process in the character array pointed to by <i>name</i>.  The array is
       <i>namesize</i> characters long and should have space for the name and
       the terminating null character. The maximum size of the login
       name is {LOGIN_NAME_MAX}.

       If <i>getlogin_r</i>() is successful, <i>name</i> points to the name the user
       used at login, even if there are several login names with the
       same user ID.

       The <i>getlogin</i>() and <i>getlogin_r</i>() functions may make use of file
       descriptors 0, 1, and 2 to find the controlling terminal of the
       current process, examining each in turn until the terminal is
       found. If in this case none of these three file descriptors is
       open to the controlling terminal, these functions may fail. The
       method used to find the terminal associated with a file
       descriptor may depend on the file descriptor being open to the
       actual terminal device, not <b>/dev/tty</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>getlogin</i>() shall return a pointer to
       the login name or a null pointer if the user's login name cannot
       be found. Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       to indicate the error.

       The application shall not modify the string returned. The
       returned pointer might be invalidated or the string content might
       be overwritten by a subsequent call to <i>getlogin</i>().  The returned
       pointer and the string content might also be invalidated if the
       calling thread is terminated.

       If successful, the <i>getlogin_r</i>() function shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in
              the system.

       <b>ENOTTY </b>None of the file descriptors 0, 1, or 2 is open to the
              controlling terminal of the current process.

       <b>ENXIO  </b>The calling process has no controlling terminal.

       The <i>getlogin_r</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ERANGE </b>The value of <i>namesize</i> is smaller than the length of the
              string to be returned including the terminating null
              character.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Getting the User Login Name S</b>
       The following example calls the <i>getlogin</i>() function to obtain the
       name of the user associated with the calling process, and passes
       this information to the <i>getpwnam</i>() function to get the associated
       user database information.

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           ...
           char *lgn;
           struct passwd *pw;
           ...
           if ((lgn = getlogin()) == NULL || (pw = getpwnam(lgn)) == NULL) {
               fprintf(stderr, "Get of user information failed.\n"); exit(1);
               }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Three names associated with the current process can be
       determined: <i>getpwuid</i>(<i>geteuid</i>()) shall return the name associated
       with the effective user ID of the process; <i>getlogin</i>() shall
       return the name associated with the current login activity; and
       <i>getpwuid</i>(<i>getuid</i>()) shall return the name associated with the real
       user ID of the process.

       The <i>getlogin_r</i>() function is thread-safe and returns values in a
       user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a static data area
       that may be overwritten by each call.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getlogin</i>() function returns a pointer to the user's login
       name. The same user ID may be shared by several login names. If
       it is desired to get the user database entry that is used during
       login, the result of <i>getlogin</i>() should be used to provide the
       argument to the <i>getpwnam</i>() function. (This might be used to
       determine the user's login shell, particularly where a single
       user has multiple login shells with distinct login names, but the
       same user ID.)

       The information provided by the <i>cuserid</i>() function, which was
       originally defined in the POSIX.1‐1988 standard and subsequently
       removed, can be obtained by the following:

           getpwuid(geteuid())

       while the information provided by historical implementations of
       <i>cuserid</i>() can be obtained by:

           getpwuid(getuid())

       The thread-safe version of this function places the user name in
       a user-supplied buffer and returns a non-zero value if it fails.
       The non-thread-safe version may return the name in a static data
       area that may be overwritten by each call.
