SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>#include &lt;pcre2.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pcre2_jit_compile(pcre2_code *</b><i>code</i><b>, uint32_t </b><i>options</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>

       This function requests JIT compilation, which, if the just-in-
       time compiler is available, further processes a compiled pattern
       into machine code that executes much faster than the
       <b>pcre2_match() </b>interpretive matching function. Full details are
       given in the <b>pcre2jit </b>documentation.

       The first argument is a pointer that was returned by a successful
       call to <b>pcre2_compile()</b>, and the second must contain one or more
       of the following bits:

         PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE      compile code for full matching
         PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT  compile code for soft partial matching
         PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD  compile code for hard partial matching

       There is also an obsolete option called PCRE2_JIT_INVALID_UTF,
       which has been superseded by the <b>pcre2_compile() </b>option
       PCRE2_MATCH_INVALID_UTF. The old option is deprecated and may be
       removed in the future.

       The yield of the function is 0 for success, or a negative error
       code otherwise.  In particular, PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION is
       returned if JIT is not supported or if an unknown bit is set in
       <i>options</i>. The function can also return PCRE2_ERROR_NOMEMORY if JIT
       is unable to allocate executable memory for the compiler, even if
       it was because of a system security restriction.

       There is a complete description of the PCRE2 native API in the
       <b>pcre2api </b>page and a description of the POSIX API in the
       <b>pcre2posix </b>page.
