       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the

       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_trace_get_filter, posix_trace_set_filter — retrieve and set
       the filter of an initialized trace stream (<b>TRACING</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;trace.h&gt;

       int posix_trace_get_filter(trace_id_t <i>trid</i>, trace_event_set_t *<i>set</i>);
       int posix_trace_set_filter(trace_id_t <i>trid</i>,
           const trace_event_set_t *<i>set</i>, int <i>how</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_get_filter</i>() function shall retrieve, into the
       argument pointed to by <i>set</i>, the actual trace event filter from
       the trace stream specified by <i>trid</i>.

       The <i>posix_trace_set_filter</i>() function shall change the set of
       filtered trace event types after a trace stream identified by the
       <i>trid</i> argument is created. This function may be called prior to
       starting the trace stream, or while the trace stream is active.
       By default, if no call is made to <i>posix_trace_set_filter</i>(), all
       trace events shall be recorded (that is, none of the trace event
       types are filtered out).

       If this function is called while the trace is in progress, a
       special system trace event, POSIX_TRACE_FILTER, shall be recorded
       in the trace indicating both the old and the new sets of filtered
       trace event types (see <i>Table 2-4</i>, <i>Trace and Trace Event Filter</i>
       <i>Options: System Trace Events</i> and <i>Table 2-6</i>, <i>Trace</i>, <i>Trace Log</i>, <i>and</i>
       <i>Trace Event Filter Options: System Trace Events</i>).

       If the <i>posix_trace_set_filter</i>() function is interrupted by a
       signal, an error shall be returned and the filter shall not be
       changed. In this case, the state of the trace stream shall not be
       changed.

       The value of the argument <i>how</i> indicates the manner in which the
       set is to be changed and shall have one of the following values,
       as defined in the <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i> header:

       POSIX_TRACE_SET_EVENTSET
             The resulting set of trace event types to be filtered shall
             be the trace event type set pointed to by the argument <i>set</i>.

       POSIX_TRACE_ADD_EVENTSET
             The resulting set of trace event types to be filtered shall
             be the union of the current set and the trace event type
             set pointed to by the argument <i>set</i>.

       POSIX_TRACE_SUB_EVENTSET
             The resulting set of trace event types to be filtered shall
             be all trace event types in the current set that are not in
             the set pointed to by the argument <i>set</i>; that is, remove
             each element of the specified set from the current filter.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value
       of zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error
       number.

       The <i>posix_trace_get_filter</i>() function stores the set of filtered
       trace event types in <i>set</i>, if successful.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>trid</i> argument does not correspond to an
              active trace stream or the value of the argument pointed
              to by <i>set</i> is invalid.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The operation was interrupted by a signal.
