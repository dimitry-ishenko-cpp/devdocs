PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       shmat — XSI shared memory attach operation
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;

       void *shmat(int <i>shmid</i>, const void *<i>shmaddr</i>, int <i>shmflg</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>shmat</i>() function operates on XSI shared memory (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.346</i>, <i>Shared Memory</i>
       <i>Object</i>).  It is unspecified whether this function interoperates
       with the realtime interprocess communication facilities defined
       in <i>Section 2.8</i>, <i>Realtime</i>.

       The <i>shmat</i>() function attaches the shared memory segment
       associated with the shared memory identifier specified by <i>shmid</i>
       to the address space of the calling process. The segment is
       attached at the address specified by one of the following
       criteria:

        *  If <i>shmaddr</i> is a null pointer, the segment is attached at the
           first available address as selected by the system.

        *  If <i>shmaddr</i> is not a null pointer and (<i>shmflg</i> &amp;SHM_RND) is
           non-zero, the segment is attached at the address given by
           (<i>shmaddr</i> -((<i>uintptr_t</i>)<i>shmaddr</i> %SHMLBA)). The character <b>'%' </b>is
           the C-language remainder operator.

        *  If <i>shmaddr</i> is not a null pointer and (<i>shmflg</i> &amp;SHM_RND) is 0,
           the segment is attached at the address given by <i>shmaddr</i>.

        *  The segment is attached for reading if (<i>shmflg</i> &amp;SHM_RDONLY)
           is non-zero and the calling process has read permission;
           otherwise, if it is 0 and the calling process has read and
           write permission, the segment is attached for reading and
           writing.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>shmat</i>() shall increment the value of
       <i>shm_nattch</i> in the data structure associated with the shared
       memory ID of the attached shared memory segment and return the
       segment's start address.  Also, the <i>shm_atime</i> timestamp shall be
       set to the current time, as described in <i>Section 2.7.1</i>, <i>IPC</i>
       <i>General Description</i>.

       Otherwise, the shared memory segment shall not be attached,
       <i>shmat</i>() shall return (<b>void *</b>)-1, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>shmat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Operation permission is denied to the calling process; see
              <i>Section 2.7</i>, <i>XSI Interprocess Communication</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>shmid</i> is not a valid shared memory
              identifier, the <i>shmaddr</i> is not a null pointer, and the
              value of (<i>shmaddr</i> -((<i>uintptr_t</i>)<i>shmaddr</i> %SHMLBA)) is an
              illegal address for attaching shared memory; or the
              <i>shmaddr</i> is not a null pointer, (<i>shmflg</i> &amp;SHM_RND) is 0, and
              the value of <i>shmaddr</i> is an illegal address for attaching
              shared memory.

       <b>EMFILE </b>The number of shared memory segments attached to the
              calling process would exceed the system-imposed limit.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The available data space is not large enough to
              accommodate the shared memory segment.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The POSIX Realtime Extension defines alternative interfaces for
       interprocess communication. Application developers who need to
       use IPC should design their applications so that modules using
       the IPC routines described in <i>Section 2.7</i>, <i>XSI Interprocess</i>
       <i>Communication</i> can be easily modified to use the alternative
       interfaces.
