NAME </h2>

       pthread_create — thread creation
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_create(pthread_t *restrict <i>thread</i>,
           const pthread_attr_t *restrict <i>attr</i>,
           void *(*<i>start_routine</i>)(void*), void *restrict <i>arg</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_create</i>() function shall create a new thread, with
       attributes specified by <i>attr</i>, within a process. If <i>attr</i> is NULL,
       the default attributes shall be used. If the attributes specified
       by <i>attr</i> are modified later, the thread's attributes shall not be
       affected.  Upon successful completion, <i>pthread_create</i>() shall
       store the ID of the created thread in the location referenced by
       <i>thread</i>.

       The thread is created executing <i>start_routine</i> with <i>arg</i> as its
       sole argument. If the <i>start_routine</i> returns, the effect shall be
       as if there was an implicit call to <i>pthread_exit</i>() using the
       return value of <i>start_routine</i> as the exit status. Note that the
       thread in which <i>main</i>() was originally invoked differs from this.
       When it returns from <i>main</i>(), the effect shall be as if there was
       an implicit call to <i>exit</i>() using the return value of <i>main</i>() as
       the exit status.

       The signal state of the new thread shall be initialized as
       follows:

        *  The signal mask shall be inherited from the creating thread.

        *  The set of signals pending for the new thread shall be empty.

       The thread-local current locale and the alternate stack shall not
       be inherited.

       The floating-point environment shall be inherited from the
       creating thread.

       If <i>pthread_create</i>() fails, no new thread is created and the
       contents of the location referenced by <i>thread</i> are undefined.

       If _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME is defined, the new thread shall have a
       CPU-time clock accessible, and the initial value of this clock
       shall be set to zero.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_create</i>() does not refer to an initialized
       thread attributes object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_create</i>() function shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_create</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The system lacked the necessary resources to create
              another thread, or the system-imposed limit on the total
              number of threads in a process {PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX} would
              be exceeded.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have appropriate privileges to set the
              required scheduling parameters or scheduling policy.

       The <i>pthread_create</i>() function shall not return an error code of
       <b>[EINTR]</b>.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       There is no requirement on the implementation that the ID of the
       created thread be available before the newly created thread
       starts executing. The calling thread can obtain the ID of the
       created thread through the <i>thread</i> argument of the
       <i>pthread_create</i>() function, and the newly created thread can
       obtain its ID by a call to <i>pthread_self</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       A suggested alternative to <i>pthread_create</i>() would be to define
       two separate operations: create and start. Some applications
       would find such behavior more natural. Ada, in particular,
       separates the ``creation'' of a task from its ``activation''.

       Splitting the operation was rejected by the standard developers
       for many reasons:

        *  The number of calls required to start a thread would increase
           from one to two and thus place an additional burden on
           applications that do not require the additional
           synchronization. The second call, however, could be avoided
           by the additional complication of a start-up state attribute.

        *  An extra state would be introduced: ``created but not
           started''. This would require the standard to specify the
           behavior of the thread operations when the target has not yet
           started executing.

        *  For those applications that require such behavior, it is
           possible to simulate the two separate steps with the
           facilities that are currently provided. The <i>start_routine</i>()
           can synchronize by waiting on a condition variable that is
           signaled by the start operation.

       An Ada implementor can choose to create the thread at either of
       two points in the Ada program: when the task object is created,
       or when the task is activated (generally at a ``begin''). If the
       first approach is adopted, the <i>start_routine</i>() needs to wait on a
       condition variable to receive the order to begin ``activation''.
       The second approach requires no such condition variable or extra
       synchronization. In either approach, a separate Ada task control
       block would need to be created when the task object is created to
       hold rendezvous queues, and so on.

       An extension of the preceding model would be to allow the state
       of the thread to be modified between the create and start. This
       would allow the thread attributes object to be eliminated. This
       has been rejected because:

        *  All state in the thread attributes object has to be able to
           be set for the thread. This would require the definition of
           functions to modify thread attributes. There would be no
           reduction in the number of function calls required to set up
           the thread. In fact, for an application that creates all
           threads using identical attributes, the number of function
           calls required to set up the threads would be dramatically
           increased. Use of a thread attributes object permits the
           application to make one set of attribute setting function
           calls.  Otherwise, the set of attribute setting function
           calls needs to be made for each thread creation.

        *  Depending on the implementation architecture, functions to
           set thread state would require kernel calls, or for other
           implementation reasons would not be able to be implemented as
           macros, thereby increasing the cost of thread creation.

        *  The ability for applications to segregate threads by class
           would be lost.

       Another suggested alternative uses a model similar to that for
       process creation, such as ``thread fork''. The fork semantics
       would provide more flexibility and the ``create'' function can be
       implemented simply by doing a thread fork followed immediately by
       a call to the desired ``start routine'' for the thread. This
       alternative has these problems:

        *  For many implementations, the entire stack of the calling
           thread would need to be duplicated, since in many
           architectures there is no way to determine the size of the
           calling frame.

        *  Efficiency is reduced since at least some part of the stack
           has to be copied, even though in most cases the thread never
           needs the copied context, since it merely calls the desired
           start routine.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_create</i>() does not refer to an initialized
       thread attributes object, it is recommended that the function
       should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
