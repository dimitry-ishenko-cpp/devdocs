NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_setnonblock, pcap_getnonblock - set or get the state of non-
       blocking mode on a capture device
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];</b>

       <b>int pcap_setnonblock(pcap_t *p, int nonblock, char *errbuf);</b>
       <b>int pcap_getnonblock(pcap_t *p, char *errbuf);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_setnonblock</b>() puts a capture handle into ``non-blocking''
       mode, or takes it out of ``non-blocking'' mode, depending on
       whether the <i>nonblock</i> argument is non-zero or zero.  It has no
       effect on ``savefiles''.  <i>errbuf</i> is a buffer large enough to hold
       at least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE </b>chars.

       In ``non-blocking'' mode, an attempt to read from the capture
       descriptor with <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP) and <b>pcap_next_ex</b>(3PCAP)
       will, if no packets are currently available to be read, return <b>0</b>
       immediately rather than blocking waiting for packets to arrive.

       <b>pcap_loop</b>(3PCAP) will loop forever, consuming CPU time when no
       packets are currently available; <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() should be used
       instead.  <b>pcap_next</b>(3PCAP) will return <b>NULL </b>if there are no
       packets currently available to read; this is indistinguishable
       from an error, so <b>pcap_next_ex</b>() should be used instead.

       When first activated with <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP) or opened with
       <b>pcap_open_live</b>(3PCAP), a capture handle is not in ``non-blocking
       mode''; a call to <b>pcap_setnonblock</b>() is required in order to put
       it into ``non-blocking'' mode.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_setnonblock() </b>return 0 on success, <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED</b>
       if called on a capture handle that has been created but not
       activated, and <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>for other errors.  <b>pcap_getnonblock</b>()
       returns the current ``non-blocking'' state of the capture
       descriptor on success; it always returns <b>0 </b>on ``savefiles''.  It
       returns <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED </b>if called on a capture handle
       that has been created but not activated, and <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>for other
       errors.  If <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is returned, <i>errbuf</i> is filled in with an
       appropriate error message.
