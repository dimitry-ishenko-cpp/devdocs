NAME </h2>

       pthread_mutexattr_getrobust, pthread_mutexattr_setrobust — get
       and set the mutex robust attribute
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_mutexattr_getrobust(const pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict
           <i>attr</i>, int *restrict <i>robust</i>);
       int pthread_mutexattr_setrobust(pthread_mutexattr_t *<i>attr</i>,
           int <i>robust</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutexattr_getrobust</i>() and
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_setrobust</i>() functions, respectively, shall get
       and set the mutex <i>robust</i> attribute. This attribute is set in the
       <i>robust</i> parameter. Valid values for <i>robust</i> include:

       PTHREAD_MUTEX_STALLED
             No special actions are taken if the owner of the mutex is
             terminated while holding the mutex lock. This can lead to
             deadlocks if no other thread can unlock the mutex.
             This is the default value.

       PTHREAD_MUTEX_ROBUST
             If the process containing the owning thread of a robust
             mutex terminates while holding the mutex lock, the next
             thread that acquires the mutex shall be notified about the
             termination by the return value <b>[EOWNERDEAD] </b>from the
             locking function. If the owning thread of a robust mutex
             terminates while holding the mutex lock, the next thread
             that attempts to acquire the mutex may be notified about
             the termination by the return value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>.  The
             notified thread can then attempt to make the state
             protected by the mutex consistent again, and if successful
             can mark the mutex state as consistent by calling
             <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>().  After a subsequent successful
             call to <i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>(), the mutex lock shall be
             released and can be used normally by other threads. If the
             mutex is unlocked without a call to
             <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>(), it shall be in a permanently
             unusable state and all attempts to lock the mutex shall
             fail with the error <b>[ENOTRECOVERABLE]</b>.  The only
             permissible operation on such a mutex is
             <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>().

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_mutexattr_getrobust</i>() or
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_setrobust</i>() does not refer to an initialized
       mutex attributes object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>pthread_mutexattr_getrobust</i>()
       function shall return zero and store the value of the <i>robust</i>
       attribute of <i>attr</i> into the object referenced by the <i>robust</i>
       parameter. Otherwise, an error value shall be returned to
       indicate the error. If successful, the
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_setrobust</i>() function shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutexattr_setrobust</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>robust</i> is invalid.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The actions required to make the state protected by the mutex
       consistent again are solely dependent on the application. If it
       is not possible to make the state of a mutex consistent, robust
       mutexes can be used to notify this situation by calling
       <i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>() without a prior call to
       <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>().

       If the state is declared inconsistent by calling
       <i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>() without a prior call to
       <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>(), a possible approach could be to
       destroy the mutex and then reinitialize it. However, it should be
       noted that this is possible only in certain situations where the
       state protected by the mutex has to be reinitialized and
       coordination achieved with other threads blocked on the mutex,
       because otherwise a call to a locking function with a reference
       to a mutex object invalidated by a call to
       <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() results in undefined behavior.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_mutexattr_getrobust</i>() or
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_setrobust</i>() does not refer to an initialized
       mutex attributes object, it is recommended that the function
       should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
