       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These  primitives  manipulate  sets  of  trace  event types. They
       operate on data objects addressable by the  application,  not  on
       the current trace event filter of any trace stream.

       The   <i>posix_trace_eventset_add</i>()  and  <i>posix_trace_eventset_del</i>()
       functions, respectively, shall add or delete the individual trace
       event type specified by the value of the argument <i>event_id</i> to  or
       from  the  trace  event  type set pointed to by the argument <i>set</i>.
       Adding a trace event type already in the set or deleting a  trace
       event type not in the set shall not be considered an error.

       The  <i>posix_trace_eventset_empty</i>()  function  shall initialize the
       trace event type set pointed to by the <i>set</i> argument such that all
       trace event  types  defined,  both  system  and  user,  shall  be
       excluded from the set.

       The  <i>posix_trace_eventset_fill</i>()  function  shall  initialize the
       trace event type set pointed to by the argument  <i>set</i>,  such  that
       the  set  of trace event types defined by the argument <i>what</i> shall
       be included in the set. The value  of  the  argument  <i>what</i>  shall
       consist  of  one  of  the  following  values,  as  defined in the
       <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i> header:

       POSIX_TRACE_WOPID_EVENTS
             All the process-independent implementation-defined system
             trace event types are included in the set.

       POSIX_TRACE_SYSTEM_EVENTS
             All the implementation-defined system trace event types are
             included in the set, as are those defined in POSIX.1‐2008.

       POSIX_TRACE_ALL_EVENTS
             All trace event types defined, both system and user, are
             included in the set.

       Applications shall call either <i>posix_trace_eventset_empty</i>() or
       <i>posix_trace_eventset_fill</i>() at least once for each object of type
       <b>trace_event_set_t </b>prior to any other use of that object. If such
       an object is not initialized in this way, but is nonetheless
       supplied as an argument to any of the <i>posix_trace_eventset_add</i>(),
       <i>posix_trace_eventset_del</i>(), or <i>posix_trace_eventset_ismember</i>()
       functions, the results are undefined.

       The <i>posix_trace_eventset_ismember</i>() function shall test whether
       the trace event type specified by the value of the argument
       <i>event_id</i> is a member of the set pointed to by the argument <i>set</i>.
       The value returned in the object pointed to by <i>ismember</i> argument
       is zero if the trace event type identifier is not a member of the
       set and a value different from zero if it is a member of the set.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value
       of zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error
       number.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of one of the arguments is invalid.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_eventset_add</i>(), <i>posix_trace_eventset_del</i>(),
       <i>posix_trace_eventset_empty</i>(), <i>posix_trace_eventset_fill</i>(), and
       <i>posix_trace_eventset_ismember</i>() functions may be removed in a
       future version.
