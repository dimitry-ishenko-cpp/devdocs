PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       abort — generate an abnormal process abort
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       void abort(void);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>abort</i>() function shall cause abnormal process termination to
       occur, unless the signal SIGABRT is being caught and the signal
       handler does not return.

       The abnormal termination processing shall include the default
       actions defined for SIGABRT and may include an attempt to effect
       <i>fclose</i>() on all open streams.

       The SIGABRT signal shall be sent to the calling process as if by
       means of <i>raise</i>() with the argument SIGABRT.

       The status made available to <i>wait</i>(), <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>() by
       <i>abort</i>() shall be that of a process terminated by the SIGABRT
       signal.  The <i>abort</i>() function shall override blocking or ignoring
       the SIGABRT signal.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>abort</i>() function shall not return.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Catching the signal is intended to provide the application
       developer with a portable means to abort processing, free from
       possible interference from any implementation-supplied functions.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard requires the <i>abort</i>() function to
       be async-signal-safe. Since POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C
       standard, this required a change to the DESCRIPTION from ``shall
       include the effect of <i>fclose</i>()'' to ``may include an attempt to
       effect <i>fclose</i>().''

       The revised wording permits some backwards-compatibility and
       avoids a potential deadlock situation.

       The Open Group Base Resolution bwg2002‐003 is applied, removing
       the following XSI shaded paragraph from the DESCRIPTION:

       ``On XSI-conformant systems, in addition the abnormal termination
       processing shall include the effect of <i>fclose</i>() on message
       catalog descriptors.''

       There were several reasons to remove this paragraph:

        *  No special processing of open message catalogs needs to be
           performed prior to abnormal process termination.

        *  The main reason to specifically mention that <i>abort</i>() includes
           the effect of <i>fclose</i>() on open streams is to flush output
           queued on the stream. Message catalogs in this context are
           read-only and, therefore, do not need to be flushed.

        *  The effect of <i>fclose</i>() on a message catalog descriptor is
           unspecified. Message catalog descriptors are allowed, but not
           required to be implemented using a file descriptor, but there
           is no mention in POSIX.1‐2008 of a message catalog descriptor
           using a standard I/O stream FILE object as would be expected
           by <i>fclose</i>().
