NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sd_bus_is_open, sd_bus_is_ready - Check whether the bus
       connection is open or ready
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;systemd/sd-bus.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int sd_bus_is_open(sd_bus *</b><i>bus</i><b>);</b>

       <b>int sd_bus_is_ready(sd_bus *</b><i>bus</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_bus_is_open() </b>checks whether the specified bus connection is
       open, i.e. in the process of being established, already
       established or in the process of being torn down. It returns zero
       when the connection has not been started yet (i.e.
       <a href="sd_bus_start.3.html">sd_bus_start(3)</a> or some equivalent call has not been invoked
       yet), or is fully terminated again (for example after
       <a href="sd_bus_close.3.html">sd_bus_close(3)</a>), it returns positive otherwise.

       <b>sd_bus_is_ready() </b>checks whether the specified connection is
       fully established, i.e. completed the connection and
       authentication phases of the protocol and received the <b>Hello()</b>
       method call response, and is not in the process of being torn
       down again. It returns zero outside of this state, and positive
       otherwise. Effectively, this function returns positive while
       regular messages can be sent or received on the connection.

       The <i>bus</i> argument may be <b>NULL</b>, zero is also returned in that case.

       To be notified when the connection is fully established, use
       <a href="sd_bus_set_connected_signal.3.html">sd_bus_set_connected_signal(3)</a> and install a match for the
       <b>Connected() </b>signal on the "org.freedesktop.DBus.Local" interface.
       To be notified when the connection is torn down again, install a
       match for the <b>Disconnected() </b>signal on the
       "org.freedesktop.DBus.Local" interface.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Those functions return 0 if the bus is <i>not</i> in the given state,
       and a positive integer when it is. On failure, a negative
       errno-style error code is returned.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-ECHILD</b>
           The bus connection has been created in a different process,
           library or module instance.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
</pre> <h2>
