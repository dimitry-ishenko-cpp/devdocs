CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is a cut-down version of the archive record reading routines
       from libpcp, that writes the next physical record on the stream
       identified by <i>f</i>.

       The record is already formatted in <i>rbuf</i>, including the setup of
       the record header length and trailer length, and <i>rbuf</i> must be in
       network byte-order.

       There is no checking, so the record format must be correct and
       match the semantics of which ever physical file (metadata or data
       volume) that is associated with <i>f</i>.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS AND RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       The return value is 0 if all is well, else some error code less
       than zero.
