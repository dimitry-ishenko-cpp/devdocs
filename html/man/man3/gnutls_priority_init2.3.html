SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int gnutls_priority_init2(gnutls_priority_t * </b><i>priority_cache</i><b>,</b>

ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache
                   is a <b>gnutls_priority_t </b>type.

       const char * priorities
                   is a string describing priorities (may be <b>NULL</b>)

       const char ** err_pos
                   In case of an error this will have the position in
                   the string the error occurred

       unsigned flags
                   zero or <b>GNUTLS_PRIORITY_INIT_DEF_APPEND</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Sets priorities for the ciphers, key exchange methods, and macs.
       The  <i>priority_cache</i> should be deinitialized using
       <b>gnutls_priority_deinit()</b>.

       The <b>priorities </b>option allows you to specify a colon separated
       list of the cipher priorities to enable.  Some keywords are
       defined to provide quick access to common preferences.

       When  <i>flags</i> is set to <b>GNUTLS_PRIORITY_INIT_DEF_APPEND </b>then the
       <i>priorities</i> specified will be appended to the default options.

       Unless there is a special need, use the "NORMAL" keyword to apply
       a reasonable security level, or "NORMAL:%COMPAT" for
       compatibility.

       "PERFORMANCE" means all the "secure" ciphersuites are enabled,
       limited to 128 bit ciphers and sorted by terms of speed
       performance.

       "LEGACY" the NORMAL settings for GnuTLS 3.2.x or earlier. There
       is no verification profile set, and the allowed DH primes are
       considered weak today.

       "NORMAL" means all "secure" ciphersuites. The 256-bit ciphers are
       included as a fallback only.  The ciphers are sorted by security
       margin.

       "PFS" means all "secure" ciphersuites that support perfect
       forward secrecy.  The 256-bit ciphers are included as a fallback
       only.  The ciphers are sorted by security margin.

       "SECURE128" means all "secure" ciphersuites of security level
       128-bit or more.

       "SECURE192" means all "secure" ciphersuites of security level
       192-bit or more.

       "SUITEB128" means all the NSA SuiteB ciphersuites with security
       level of 128.

       "SUITEB192" means all the NSA SuiteB ciphersuites with security
       level of 192.

       "NONE" means nothing is enabled.  This disables everything,
       including protocols.

       "@KEYWORD1,KEYWORD2,..." The system administrator imposed
       settings.  The provided keyword(s) will be expanded from a
       configuration-time provided file - default is:
       /etc/gnutls/config.  Any attributes that follow it, will be
       appended to the expanded string. If multiple keywords are
       provided, separated by commas, then the first keyword that exists
       in the configuration file will be used. At least one of the
       keywords must exist, or this function will return an error.
       Typical usage would be to specify an application specified
       keyword first, followed by "SYSTEM" as a default fallback. e.g.,
       " <i>LIBVIRT</i> ,SYSTEM:!-VERS-SSL3.0" will first try to find a config
       file entry matching "LIBVIRT", but if that does not exist will
       use the entry for "SYSTEM". If "SYSTEM" does not exist either, an
       error will be returned. In all cases, the SSL3.0 protocol will be
       disabled. The system priority file entries should be formatted as
       "KEYWORD=VALUE", e.g., "SYSTEM=NORMAL:+ARCFOUR-128".

       Special keywords are "!", "-" and "+".  "!" or "-" appended with
       an algorithm will remove this algorithm.  "+" appended with an
       algorithm will add this algorithm.

       Check the GnuTLS manual section "Priority strings" for detailed
       information.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+MAC-ALL:+RSA:+AES-128-CBC:+SIGN-ALL:+COMP-NULL"

       "NORMAL:+ARCFOUR-128" means normal ciphers plus ARCFOUR-128.

       "SECURE128:-VERS-SSL3.0" means that only secure ciphers are and
       enabled, SSL3.0 is disabled.

       "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1",

       "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+AES-128-CBC:+ECDHE-RSA:+SHA1:+COMP-NULL:+SIGN-RSA-SHA1:+CURVE-SECP256R1",

       "SECURE256:+SECURE128",

       Note that "NORMAL:%COMPAT" is the most compatible mode.

       A <b>NULL  </b><i>priorities</i> string indicates the default priorities to be
       used (this is available since GnuTLS 3.3.0).
