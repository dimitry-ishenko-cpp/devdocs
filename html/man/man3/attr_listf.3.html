DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>attr_list </b>and <b>attr_listf </b>functions provide a way to list the
       existing attributes of a filesystem object.

       <i>Path</i> points to a path name for a filesystem object, and <i>fd</i> refers
       to the file descriptor associated with a file.  The <i>buffer</i> will
       be filled with a structure describing at least a portion of the
       attributes associated with the given filesystem object.  <i>Buffer</i>
       will be overwritten with an <i><b>attrlist_t</b> </i>structure containing a
       list of the attributes associated with that filesystem object, up
       to a maximum of <i>buffersize</i> bytes.  The <i>buffer</i> must be
       sufficiently large to hold the appropriate data structures plus
       at least one maximally sized attribute name, but cannot be more
       than ATTR_MAX_VALUELEN (currently 64KB) bytes in length.

       The contents of an <i><b>attrlist_t</b> </i>structure include the following
       members:

          <b>int32_t al_count; /∗ number of entries in attrlist ∗/</b>
          <b>int32_t al_more; /∗ T/F: more attrs (do syscall again) ∗/</b>
          <b>int32_t al_offset[1]; /∗ byte offsets of attrs [var-sized] ∗/</b>

       The <i>al_count</i> field shows the number of attributes represented in
       this buffer, which is also the number of elements in the
       <i>al_offset</i> array.  The <i>al_more</i> field will be non-zero if another
       <b>attr_list </b>call would result in more attributes.  The <i>al_offset</i>
       array contains the byte offset within the <i>buffer</i> of the structure
       describing each of the attributes, an <i><b>attrlist_ent_t</b> </i>structure.
       The <i><b>ATTR_ENTRY(buffer, index)</b> </i>macro will help with decoding the
       list.  It takes a pointer to the <i>buffer</i> and an <i>index</i> into the
       <i>al_offset</i> array and returns a pointer to the corresponding
       <i><b>attrlist_ent_t</b> </i>structure.

       The contents of an <i><b>attrlist_ent_t</b> </i>structure include the following
       members:

          <b>uint32_t a_valuelen; /∗ number bytes in value of attr ∗/</b>
          <b>char a_name[]; /∗ attr name (NULL terminated) ∗/</b>

       The <i>a_valuelen</i> field shows the size in bytes of the value
       associated with the attribute whose name is stored in the <i>a_name</i>
       field.  The name is a NULL terminated string.

       Note that the value of the attribute cannot be obtained through
       this interface, the <b>attr_get </b>call should be used to get the
       value.  The <b>attr_list </b>interface tells the calling process how
       large of a buffer it must have in order to get the attribute's
       value.

       The <i>flags</i> argument can contain the following symbols bitwise
       OR'ed together:

       ATTR_ROOT
              List the attributes that are in the <b>root </b>address space,
              not in the <b>user </b>address space.  (limited to use by super-
              user only)

       ATTR_DONTFOLLOW
              Do not follow symbolic links when resolving a <i>path</i> on an
              <b>attr_list </b>function call.  The default is to follow
              symbolic links.

       The <i>cursor</i> argument is a pointer to an opaque data structure that
       the kernel uses to track the calling process's position in the
       attribute list.  The only valid operations on a <i>cursor</i> are to
       pass it into an <b>attr_list </b>function call or to zero it out.  It
       should be zero'ed out before the first <b>attr_list </b>call.  Note that
       multi-threaded applications may keep more than one <i>cursor</i> in
       order to serve multiple contexts, ie: the <b>attr_list </b>call is
       "thread-safe".

       <b>attr_list </b>will fail if one or more of the following are true:

       [ENOENT]
              The named file does not exist.

       [EPERM]
              The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file
              and the effective user ID is not super-user.

       [ENOTDIR]
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EACCES]
              Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix.

       [EINVAL]
              A bit was set in the <i>flag</i> argument that is not defined for
              this system call, or the buffer was too small or too
              large.

       [EFAULT]
              Either <i>Path</i> or <i>buffer</i> points outside the allocated address
              space of the process, or <i>buffer</i> or <i>bufsize</i> are not 32bit
              aligned.

       [ELOOP]
              A path name lookup involved too many symbolic links.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
              The length of <i>path</i> exceeds {<i>MAXPATHLEN</i>}, or a pathname
              component is longer than {<i>MAXNAMELEN</i>}.

       [ENOATTR]
              <i>attribute</i> does not exist for this file.

       <b>attr_listf </b>will fail if:

       [EINVAL]
              A bit was set in the <i>flag</i> argument that is not defined for
              this system call, or <i>fd</i> refers to a socket, not a file, or
              the buffer was too small or too large.

       [EFAULT]
              Either <i>Path</i> or <i>buffer</i> points outside the allocated address
              space of the process, or <i>buffer</i> or <i>bufsize</i> are not 32bit
              aligned.

       [EBADF]
              <i>Fd</i> does not refer to a valid descriptor.

       Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
       a value of -1 is returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
