CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Find the loaded ``full'' instance domain that matches a ``delta''
       instance domain.

       The caller ensures the physical metadata record for the ``delta''
       instance domain has been read into <i>buf</i>.  The associated archive
       control structure is identified by <i>lcp</i>, which implies the input
       archive has also been opened with <a href="pmnewcontext.3.html">pmNewContext(3)</a>.

       <b>pmaUndeltaInDom </b>starts by extracting the timestamp and the
       instance domain number for the ``delta'' instance domain from
       <i>buf</i>.  With this information, <b>__pmLogSearchInDom</b>(3) is called to
       find the matching loaded instance domain, which will have been
       converted from a ``delta'' instance domain to a ``full'' instance
       domain in the process.

       <b>pmaUndeltaInDom </b>is most useful for applications that read
       physical metadata records and need to operate on ``full''
       instance domains, rather than the ``delta'' instance domains that
       occur in Version 3 archives.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS AND RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       Lots of warning babble if the matching loaded instance domain
       cannot be found, and the return value is NULL in this case.
