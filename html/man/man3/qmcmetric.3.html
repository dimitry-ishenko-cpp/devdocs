NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>QmcMetric </b>- container for a metric and all its values
</pre> <h2>
C++ SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcp/pmc/Metric.h&gt;</b>

       <b>c++ ... -lpcp_qmc -lpcp</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A <b>QmcMetric </b>object is a container for a single metric and all its
       values.

       The <b>QmcMetricValue </b>structure is used to hold the instance index,
       values and errors of each instance.  In the case of a singular
       metric, a single <b>QmcMetricValue </b>object is used.

       A <b>QmcMetric </b>object consists of a list of <b>QmcMetricValue </b>objects,
       indexes to the descriptors in the metric's <b>QmcGroup </b>and
       <b>QmcContext </b>and flags to indicate if the instances are explicit or
       implicit, and if only active metrics are required after
       <b>QmcMetric::updateIndom </b>is called.
</pre> <h2>
CONSTRUCTORS </h2>
<pre>
       Metrics should be constructed through the <b>QmcGroup::addMetric</b>
       methods as this will ensure that the references to the metric's
       context, descriptor and instance domain are correctly
       initialized.
</pre> <h2>
INSTANCES </h2>
<pre>
       For metrics with an instance domain it is possible to add and
       remove any instance, and also update the instance list to reflect
       changes in a dynamic instance domain.

       <b>bool updateIndom();</b>
           Update the metric to include new instances.  This method will
           first call <b>QmcContext::update </b>to update the instance domain.
           If the <i>active</i> flag is set in the <b>QmcGroup::addMetric </b>call,
           only instances will exported by the metric, otherwise the
           metric will export all instances listed in the domain.

           The ordering of instances may change as a result of this
           call.  Instances that already existed will keep their current
           and previous values and errors, even if they are in a
           different order.

       <b>int addInst(QString const&amp; name);</b>
           Add the instance <b>name </b>to the metric.  If the instance does
           not exist in the instance domain, a <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> error will be
           returned.  This method ignores the value of the <i>active</i> flag
           set in the <b>QmcMetric </b>constructor.

       <b>void removeInst(uint_t index);</b>
           Remove the instance at position <i>index</i> from the metric.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       Error messages are generated using <a href="pmprintf.3.html">pmprintf(3)</a> but are not
       flushed. It is the responsibility of the user to call <a href="pmflush.3.html">pmflush(3)</a>
       to output any messages.

       Additional diagnostics may be activated by adding the option <b>pmc</b>
       to the global debugging specification, as described in
       <a href="pmsetdebug.3.html">pmSetDebug(3)</a>.
