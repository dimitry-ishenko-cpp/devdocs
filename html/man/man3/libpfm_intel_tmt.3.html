NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_tmt - support for Intel Tremont core PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: tmt</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Tremont</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Tremont core PMU.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Tremont
       processors:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a counter mask modifier (m) with a value greater or equal
              to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].
</pre> <h2>
OFFCORE_RESPONSE events </h2>
<pre>
       Intel Tremont provides two offcore_response events:
       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0 </b>and <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_1</b>. The  <b>OCR </b>event is
       aliased to <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0</b>.

       Those events need special treatment in the performance monitoring
       infrastructure because each event uses an extra register to store
       some settings. Thus, in case multiple offcore_response events are
       monitored simultaneously, the kernel needs to manage the sharing
       of that extra register.

       The offcore_response event is exposed as a normal event by the
       library. The extra settings are exposed as regular umasks. The
       library takes care of encoding the events according for the
       underlying kernel interface.

       On Intel Tremont, it is not possible to combine the request,
       supplier, snoop, fields anymore to avoid invalid combinations. As
       such, the umasks provided by the library are the only ones
       supported and validated.
