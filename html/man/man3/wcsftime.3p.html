PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       wcsftime — convert date and time to a wide-character string
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       size_t wcsftime(wchar_t *restrict <i>wcs</i>, size_t <i>maxsize</i>,
           const wchar_t *restrict <i>format</i>, const struct tm *restrict <i>timeptr</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>wcsftime</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>strftime</i>()
       function, except that:

        *  The argument <i>wcs</i> points to the initial element of an array of
           wide characters into which the generated output is to be
           placed.

        *  The argument <i>maxsize</i> indicates the maximum number of wide
           characters to be placed in the output array.

        *  The argument <i>format</i> is a wide-character string and the
           conversion specifications are replaced by corresponding
           sequences of wide characters.  It is unspecified whether an
           encoding error occurs if the format string contains <b>wchar_t</b>
           values that do not correspond to members of the character set
           of the current locale.

        *  Field widths specify the number of wide characters instead of
           the number of bytes.

        *  The return value indicates the number of wide characters
           placed in the output array.

       If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior
       is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the total number of resulting wide-character codes including
       the terminating null wide-character code is no more than <i>maxsize</i>,
       <i>wcsftime</i>() shall return the number of wide-character codes placed
       into the array pointed to by <i>wcs</i>, not including the terminating
       null wide-character code. Otherwise, zero is returned and the
       contents of the array are unspecified.
