DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The fts functions are provided for traversing file hierarchies.
       A simple overview is that the <b>fts_open</b>() function returns a
       "handle" (of type <i>FTS *</i>) that refers to a file hierarchy
       "stream".  This handle is then supplied to the other fts
       functions.  The function <b>fts_read</b>() returns a pointer to a
       structure describing one of the files in the file hierarchy.  The
       function <b>fts_children</b>() returns a pointer to a linked list of
       structures, each of which describes one of the files contained in
       a directory in the hierarchy.

       In general, directories are visited two distinguishable times; in
       preorder (before any of their descendants are visited) and in
       postorder (after all of their descendants have been visited).
       Files are visited once.  It is possible to walk the hierarchy
       "logically" (visiting the files that symbolic links point to) or
       physically (visiting the symbolic links themselves), order the
       walk of the hierarchy or prune and/or revisit portions of the
       hierarchy.

       Two structures (and associated types) are defined in the include
       file <i>&lt;fts.h&gt;</i>.  The first type is <i>FTS</i>, the structure that
       represents the file hierarchy itself.  The second type is <i>FTSENT</i>,
       the structure that represents a file in the file hierarchy.
       Normally, an <i>FTSENT</i> structure is returned for every file in the
       file hierarchy.  In this manual page, "file" and "FTSENT
       structure" are generally interchangeable.

       The <i>FTSENT</i> structure contains fields describing a file.  The
       structure contains at least the following fields (there are
       additional fields that should be considered private to the
       implementation):

           typedef struct _ftsent {
               unsigned short  fts_info;     /* flags for FTSENT structure */
               char           *fts_accpath;  /* access path */
               char           *fts_path;     /* root path */
               short           fts_pathlen;  /* strlen(fts_path) +
                                                strlen(fts_name) */
               char           *fts_name;     /* filename */
               short           fts_namelen;  /* strlen(fts_name) */
               short           fts_level;    /* depth (-1 to N) */
               int             fts_errno;    /* file errno */
               long            fts_number;   /* local numeric value */
               void           *fts_pointer;  /* local address value */
               struct _ftsent *fts_parent;   /* parent directory */
               struct _ftsent *fts_link;     /* next file structure */
               struct _ftsent *fts_cycle;    /* cycle structure */
               struct stat    *fts_statp;    /* [l]stat(2) information */
           } FTSENT;

       These fields are defined as follows:

       <i>fts_info</i>
              One of the following values describing the returned <i>FTSENT</i>
              structure and the file it represents.  With the exception
              of directories without errors (<b>FTS_D</b>), all of these
              entries are terminal, that is, they will not be revisited,
              nor will any of their descendants be visited.

              <b>FTS_D  </b>A directory being visited in preorder.

              <b>FTS_DC </b>A directory that causes a cycle in the tree.  (The
                     <i>fts_cycle</i> field of the <i>FTSENT</i> structure will be
                     filled in as well.)

              <b>FTS_DEFAULT</b>
                     Any <i>FTSENT</i> structure that represents a file type
                     not explicitly described by one of the other
                     <i>fts_info</i> values.

              <b>FTS_DNR</b>
                     A directory which cannot be read.  This is an error
                     return, and the <i>fts_errno</i> field will be set to
                     indicate what caused the error.

              <b>FTS_DOT</b>
                     A file named "."  or ".."  which was not specified
                     as a filename to <b>fts_open</b>() (see <b>FTS_SEEDOT</b>).

              <b>FTS_DP </b>A directory being visited in postorder.  The
                     contents of the <i>FTSENT</i> structure will be unchanged
                     from when it was returned in preorder, that is,
                     with the <i>fts_info</i> field set to <b>FTS_D</b>.

              <b>FTS_ERR</b>
                     This is an error return, and the <i>fts_errno</i> field
                     will be set to indicate what caused the error.

              <b>FTS_F  </b>A regular file.

              <b>FTS_NS </b>A file for which no [<b>l</b>]<a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> information was
                     available.  The contents of the <i>fts_statp</i> field are
                     undefined.  This is an error return, and the
                     <i>fts_errno</i> field will be set to indicate what caused
                     the error.

              <b>FTS_NSOK</b>
                     A file for which no [<b>l</b>]<a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> information was
                     requested.  The contents of the <i>fts_statp</i> field are
                     undefined.

              <b>FTS_SL </b>A symbolic link.

              <b>FTS_SLNONE</b>
                     A symbolic link with a nonexistent target.  The
                     contents of the <i>fts_statp</i> field reference the file
                     characteristic information for the symbolic link
                     itself.

       <i>fts_accpath</i>
              A path for accessing the file from the current directory.

       <i>fts_path</i>
              The path for the file relative to the root of the
              traversal.  This path contains the path specified to
              <b>fts_open</b>() as a prefix.

       <i>fts_pathlen</i>
              The sum of the lengths of the strings referenced by
              <i>fts_path</i> and <i>fts_name</i>.

       <i>fts_name</i>
              The name of the file.

       <i>fts_namelen</i>
              The length of the string referenced by <i>fts_name</i>.

       <i>fts_level</i>
              The depth of the traversal, numbered from -1 to N, where
              this file was found.  The <i>FTSENT</i> structure representing
              the parent of the starting point (or root) of the
              traversal is numbered -1, and the <i>FTSENT</i> structure for the
              root itself is numbered 0.

       <i>fts_errno</i>
              If <b>fts_children</b>() or <b>fts_read</b>() returns an <i>FTSENT</i>
              structure whose <i>fts_info</i> field is set to <b>FTS_DNR</b>, <b>FTS_ERR</b>,
              or <b>FTS_NS</b>, the <i>fts_errno</i> field contains the error number
              (i.e., the <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> value) specifying the cause of the error.
              Otherwise, the contents of the <i>fts_errno</i> field are
              undefined.

       <i>fts_number</i>
              This field is provided for the use of the application
              program and is not modified by the fts functions.  It is
              initialized to 0.

       <i>fts_pointer</i>
              This field is provided for the use of the application
              program and is not modified by the fts functions.  It is
              initialized to NULL.

       <i>fts_parent</i>
              A pointer to the <i>FTSENT</i> structure referencing the file in
              the hierarchy immediately above the current file, that is,
              the directory of which this file is a member.  A parent
              structure for the initial entry point is provided as well,
              however, only the <i>fts_level</i>, <i>fts_number</i>, and <i>fts_pointer</i>
              fields are guaranteed to be initialized.

       <i>fts_link</i>
              Upon return from the <b>fts_children</b>() function, the <i>fts_link</i>
              field points to the next structure in the NULL-terminated
              linked list of directory members.  Otherwise, the contents
              of the <i>fts_link</i> field are undefined.

       <i>fts_cycle</i>
              If a directory causes a cycle in the hierarchy (see
              <b>FTS_DC</b>), either because of a hard link between two
              directories, or a symbolic link pointing to a directory,
              the <i>fts_cycle</i> field of the structure will point to the
              <i>FTSENT</i> structure in the hierarchy that references the same
              file as the current <i>FTSENT</i> structure.  Otherwise, the
              contents of the <i>fts_cycle</i> field are undefined.

       <i>fts_statp</i>
              A pointer to [<b>l</b>]<a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> information for the file.

       A single buffer is used for all of the paths of all of the files
       in the file hierarchy.  Therefore, the <i>fts_path</i> and <i>fts_accpath</i>
       fields are guaranteed to be null-terminated <i>only</i> for the file
       most recently returned by <b>fts_read</b>().  To use these fields to
       reference any files represented by other <i>FTSENT</i> structures will
       require that the path buffer be modified using the information
       contained in that <i>FTSENT</i> structure's <i>fts_pathlen</i> field.  Any such
       modifications should be undone before further calls to <b>fts_read</b>()
       are attempted.  The <i>fts_name</i> field is always null-terminated.

   <b>fts_open()</b>
       The <b>fts_open</b>() function takes a pointer to an array of character
       pointers naming one or more paths which make up a logical file
       hierarchy to be traversed.  The array must be terminated by a
       null pointer.

       There are a number of options, at least one of which (either
       <b>FTS_LOGICAL </b>or <b>FTS_PHYSICAL</b>) must be specified.  The options are
       selected by ORing the following values:

       <b>FTS_LOGICAL</b>
              This option causes the fts routines to return <i>FTSENT</i>
              structures for the targets of symbolic links instead of
              the symbolic links themselves.  If this option is set, the
              only symbolic links for which <i>FTSENT</i> structures are
              returned to the application are those referencing
              nonexistent files: the <i>fts_statp</i> field is obtained via
              <a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> with a fallback to <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat(2)</a>.

       <b>FTS_PHYSICAL</b>
              This option causes the fts routines to return <i>FTSENT</i>
              structures for symbolic links themselves instead of the
              target files they point to.  If this option is set, <i>FTSENT</i>
              structures for all symbolic links in the hierarchy are
              returned to the application: the <i>fts_statp</i> field is
              obtained via <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat(2)</a>.

       <b>FTS_COMFOLLOW</b>
              This option causes any symbolic link specified as a root
              path to be followed immediately, as if via <b>FTS_LOGICAL</b>,
              regardless of the primary mode.

       <b>FTS_NOCHDIR</b>
              As a performance optimization, the fts functions change
              directories as they walk the file hierarchy.  This has the
              side-effect that an application cannot rely on being in
              any particular directory during the traversal.  This
              option turns off this optimization, and the fts functions
              will not change the current directory.  Note that
              applications should not themselves change their current
              directory and try to access files unless <b>FTS_NOCHDIR </b>is
              specified and absolute pathnames were provided as
              arguments to <b>fts_open</b>().

       <b>FTS_NOSTAT</b>
              By default, returned <i>FTSENT</i> structures reference file
              characteristic information (the <i>fts_statp</i> field) for each
              file visited.  This option relaxes that requirement as a
              performance optimization, allowing the fts functions to
              set the <i>fts_info</i> field to <b>FTS_NSOK </b>and leave the contents
              of the <i>fts_statp</i> field undefined.

       <b>FTS_SEEDOT</b>
              By default, unless they are specified as path arguments to
              <b>fts_open</b>(), any files named "."  or ".."  encountered in
              the file hierarchy are ignored.  This option causes the
              fts routines to return <i>FTSENT</i> structures for them.

       <b>FTS_XDEV</b>
              This option prevents fts from descending into directories
              that have a different device number than the file from
              which the descent began.

       The argument <b>compar</b>() specifies a user-defined function which may
       be used to order the traversal of the hierarchy.  It takes two
       pointers to pointers to <i>FTSENT</i> structures as arguments and should
       return a negative value, zero, or a positive value to indicate if
       the file referenced by its first argument comes before, in any
       order with respect to, or after, the file referenced by its
       second argument.  The <i>fts_accpath</i>, <i>fts_path</i>, and <i>fts_pathlen</i>
       fields of the <i>FTSENT</i> structures may <i>never</i> be used in this
       comparison.  If the <i>fts_info</i> field is set to <b>FTS_NS </b>or <b>FTS_NSOK</b>,
       the <i>fts_statp</i> field may not either.  If the <b>compar</b>() argument is
       NULL, the directory traversal order is in the order listed in
       <i>path_argv</i> for the root paths, and in the order listed in the
       directory for everything else.

   <b>fts_read()</b>
       The <b>fts_read</b>() function returns a pointer to an <i>FTSENT</i> structure
       describing a file in the hierarchy.  Directories (that are
       readable and do not cause cycles) are visited at least twice,
       once in preorder and once in postorder.  All other files are
       visited at least once.  (Hard links between directories that do
       not cause cycles or symbolic links to symbolic links may cause
       files to be visited more than once, or directories more than
       twice.)

       If all the members of the hierarchy have been returned,
       <b>fts_read</b>() returns NULL and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to 0.  If an error
       unrelated to a file in the hierarchy occurs, <b>fts_read</b>() returns
       NULL and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.  If an error related
       to a returned file occurs, a pointer to an <i>FTSENT</i> structure is
       returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> may or may not have been set (see <i>fts_info</i>).

       The <i>FTSENT</i> structures returned by <b>fts_read</b>() may be overwritten
       after a call to <b>fts_close</b>() on the same file hierarchy stream,
       or, after a call to <b>fts_read</b>() on the same file hierarchy stream
       unless they represent a file of type directory, in which case
       they will not be overwritten until after a call to <b>fts_read</b>()
       after the <i>FTSENT</i> structure has been returned by the function
       <b>fts_read</b>() in postorder.

   <b>fts_children()</b>
       The <b>fts_children</b>() function returns a pointer to an <i>FTSENT</i>
       structure describing the first entry in a NULL-terminated linked
       list of the files in the directory represented by the <i>FTSENT</i>
       structure most recently returned by <b>fts_read</b>().  The list is
       linked through the <i>fts_link</i> field of the <i>FTSENT</i> structure, and is
       ordered by the user-specified comparison function, if any.
       Repeated calls to <b>fts_children</b>() will re-create this linked list.

       As a special case, if <b>fts_read</b>() has not yet been called for a
       hierarchy, <b>fts_children</b>() will return a pointer to the files in
       the logical directory specified to <b>fts_open</b>(), that is, the
       arguments specified to <b>fts_open</b>().  Otherwise, if the <i>FTSENT</i>
       structure most recently returned by <b>fts_read</b>() is not a directory
       being visited in preorder, or the directory does not contain any
       files, <b>fts_children</b>() returns NULL and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to zero.  If an
       error occurs, <b>fts_children</b>() returns NULL and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.

       The <i>FTSENT</i> structures returned by <b>fts_children</b>() may be
       overwritten after a call to <b>fts_children</b>(), <b>fts_close</b>(), or
       <b>fts_read</b>() on the same file hierarchy stream.

       The <i>instr</i> argument is either zero or the following value:

       <b>FTS_NAMEONLY</b>
              Only the names of the files are needed.  The contents of
              all the fields in the returned linked list of structures
              are undefined with the exception of the <i>fts_name</i> and
              <i>fts_namelen</i> fields.

   <b>fts_set()</b>
       The function <b>fts_set</b>() allows the user application to determine
       further processing for the file <i>f</i> of the stream <i>ftsp</i>.  The
       <b>fts_set</b>() function returns 0 on success, and -1 if an error
       occurs.

       The <i>instr</i> argument is either 0 (meaning "do nothing") or one of
       the following values:

       <b>FTS_AGAIN</b>
              Revisit the file; any file type may be revisited.  The
              next call to <b>fts_read</b>() will return the referenced file.
              The <i>fts_stat</i> and <i>fts_info</i> fields of the structure will be
              reinitialized at that time, but no other fields will have
              been changed.  This option is meaningful only for the most
              recently returned file from <b>fts_read</b>().  Normal use is for
              postorder directory visits, where it causes the directory
              to be revisited (in both preorder and postorder) as well
              as all of its descendants.

       <b>FTS_FOLLOW</b>
              The referenced file must be a symbolic link.  If the
              referenced file is the one most recently returned by
              <b>fts_read</b>(), the next call to <b>fts_read</b>() returns the file
              with the <i>fts_info</i> and <i>fts_statp</i> fields reinitialized to
              reflect the target of the symbolic link instead of the
              symbolic link itself.  If the file is one of those most
              recently returned by <b>fts_children</b>(), the <i>fts_info</i> and
              <i>fts_statp</i> fields of the structure, when returned by
              <b>fts_read</b>(), will reflect the target of the symbolic link
              instead of the symbolic link itself.  In either case, if
              the target of the symbolic link does not exist, the fields
              of the returned structure will be unchanged and the
              <i>fts_info</i> field will be set to <b>FTS_SLNONE</b>.

              If the target of the link is a directory, the preorder
              return, followed by the return of all of its descendants,
              followed by a postorder return, is done.

       <b>FTS_SKIP</b>
              No descendants of this file are visited.  The file may be
              one of those most recently returned by either
              <b>fts_children</b>() or <b>fts_read</b>().

   <b>fts_close()</b>
       The <b>fts_close</b>() function closes the file hierarchy stream
       referred to by <i>ftsp</i> and restores the current directory to the
       directory from which <b>fts_open</b>() was called to open <i>ftsp</i>.  The
       <b>fts_close</b>() function returns 0 on success, and -1 if an error
       occurs.

ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The function <b>fts_open</b>() may fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> for any of the
       errors specified for <a href="../man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a> and <a href="malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>.

       In addition, <b>fts_open</b>() may fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> as follows:

       <b>ENOENT </b>Any element of <i>path_argv</i> was an empty string.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Before glibc 2.23, all of the APIs described in this man page are
       not safe when compiling a program using the LFS APIs (e.g., when
       compiling with <i>-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64</i>).
