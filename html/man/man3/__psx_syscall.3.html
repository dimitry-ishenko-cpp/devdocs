DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>libpsx </b>library attempts to fill a gap left by the <a href="../man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads(7)</a>
       implementation on Linux. To be compliant POSIX threads, via the
       <a href="../man7/nptl.7.html">nptl(7)</a> <b>setxid </b>mechanism, glibc maintains consistent UID and GID
       credentials amongst all of the threads associated with the
       current process. However, other credential state is not supported
       by this abstraction. To support these extended kernel managed
       security attributes, <b>libpsx </b>provides a more generic pair of
       wrapping system call functions: <b>psx_syscall3</b>() and
       <b>psx_syscall6</b>().  Like the <b>setxid </b>mechanism, the coordination of
       thread state is mediated by a realtime signal. Whereas the
       <b>nptl:setxid </b>mechanism uses signo=33 (which is hidden by glibc
       below a redefined <b>SIGRTMIN</b>), <b>libpsx </b>inserts itself in the <b>SIGSYS</b>
       handler stack. It goes to great length to be the first such
       handler but acts as a pass-through for other <b>SIGSYS </b>uses.

       A linker trick of <i>wrapping</i> the <b>pthread_create</b>() call with a psx
       thread registration function is used to ensure <b>libpsx </b>can keep
       track of all pthreads.

       An inefficient macrology trick supports the <b>psx_syscall</b>() pseudo
       function which takes 1 to 7 arguments, depending on the needs of
       the caller. The macrology (which ultimately invokes
       <b>__psx_syscall</b>()) pads out the call to actually use <b>psx_syscall3</b>()
       or <b>psx_syscall6</b>() with zeros filling the missing arguments. While
       using this in source code will make it appear clean, the actual
       code footprint is larger. You are encouraged to use the more
       explicit <b>psx_syscall3</b>() and <b>psx_syscall6</b>() functions as needed.

       <b>psx_set_sensitivity</b>() changes the behavior of the mirrored system
       calls: <b>PSX_IGNORE </b>ensures that differences are ignored (the
       default behavior); <b>PSX_WARNING </b>prints a stderr notification about
       how the results differ; and <b>PSX_ERROR </b>prints the error details
       and generates a <b>SIGSYS </b>signal.

       <b>psx_load_syscalls</b>() can be used to set caller defined function
       pointers for invoking 3 and 6 argument syscalls. This function
       can be used to configure a library, or program to change behavior
       when linked against <b>libpsx</b>.  Indeed, <b>libcap </b>uses this function
       from <b>libpsx </b>to override its thread scoped default system call
       based API. When linked with <b>libpsx</b>, <b>libcap </b>can operate on all the
       threads of a multithreaded program to operate with POSIX
       semantics.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The return value for system call functions is generally the value
       returned by the kernel, or -1 in the case of an error. In such
       cases <a href="errno.3.html">errno(3)</a> is set to the detailed error value. The
       <b>psx_syscall3</b>() and <b>psx_syscall6</b>() functions attempt a single
       threaded system call and return immediately in the case of an
       error. Should this call succeed, then the same system calls are
       executed from a signal handler on each of the other threads of
       the process.
