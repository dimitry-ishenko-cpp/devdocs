</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_set_immediate_mode - set immediate mode for a not-yet-
       activated capture handle
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pcap_set_immediate_mode(pcap_t *p, int immediate_mode);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_set_immediate_mode</b>() sets whether immediate mode should be
       set on a capture handle when the handle is activated.  In
       immediate mode, packets are always delivered as soon as they
       arrive, with no buffering.  If <i>immediate_mode</i> is non-zero,
       immediate mode will be set, otherwise it will not be set.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_set_immediate_mode</b>() returns <b>0 </b>on success or
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED </b>if called on a capture handle that has been
       activated.
</pre> <h2>
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       This function became available in libpcap release 1.5.0.  In
       previous releases, if immediate delivery of packets is required:

              on FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, macOS, and
              Solaris 11, immediate mode must be turned on with a
              <b>BIOCIMMEDIATE ioctl</b>(2), as documented in <b>bpf</b>(4), on the
              descriptor returned by <b>pcap_fileno</b>(3PCAP), after
              <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP) is called;

              on Solaris 10 and earlier versions of Solaris, immediate
              mode must be turned on by using a read timeout of 0 when
              opening the device (this will not provide immediate
              delivery of packets on other platforms, so don't assume
              it's sufficient);

              on Windows, immediate mode must be turned on by calling
              <b>pcap_setmintocopy</b>() with a size of 0.

       On Linux, with previous releases of libpcap, capture devices are
       always in immediate mode; however, in 1.5.0 and later, they are,
       by default, <b>not </b>in immediate mode, so if
       <b>pcap_set_immediate_mode</b>() is available, it should be used.

       On other platforms, capture devices are always in immediate mode.
