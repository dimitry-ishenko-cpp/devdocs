CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Each instance of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive creation
       program <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> supports a control port on which
       <a href="__pmcontrollog.3.html">__pmControlLog(3)</a> requests are received, and responses sent.
       Optionally, the <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance may be designated the
       ``primary'' logger.

       <b>__pmConnectLogger </b>may be used to establish a control port
       connection to the <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance identified by process id
       <i>pid</i> on the host <i>hostname</i>.

       One special case is supported; for the reserved <i>pid</i> value of
       <b>PM_LOG_PRIMARY_PORT </b>the requested connection is to the control
       port for the ``primary'' logger, whatever its process id might
       be.

       On success, <b>__pmConnectLogger </b>returns a non-negative integer,
       that is a file descriptor that may be used in subsequent
       communication with the <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance, e.g. for
       <a href="__pmcontrollog.3.html">__pmControlLog(3)</a>.

       As the control port to <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> is not multiplexed,
       applications using <b>__pmConnectLogger </b>should use <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a> to
       terminate the connection to <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> as soon as they have
       finished communicating.

       If the application connects, and the <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance
       subsequently terminates, e.g. because the associated <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
       instance is terminated, the application will have to explicitly
       re-establish connection to a re-started <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance by
       calling <b>__pmConnectLogger </b>again.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PM_ERR_PERMISSION</b>
              no permission to connect to the specified <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
              instance

       <b>-ECONNREFUSED</b>
              the designated <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance does not exist

       <b>-EADDRINUSE</b>
              the requested control port is already in use
