PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_rwlockattr_destroy, pthread_rwlockattr_init — destroy and
       initialize the read-write lock attributes object
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_rwlockattr_destroy(pthread_rwlockattr_t *<i>attr</i>);
       int pthread_rwlockattr_init(pthread_rwlockattr_t *<i>attr</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlockattr_destroy</i>() function shall destroy a read-
       write lock attributes object. A destroyed <i>attr</i> attributes object
       can be reinitialized using <i>pthread_rwlockattr_init</i>(); the results
       of otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed
       are undefined. An implementation may cause
       <i>pthread_rwlockattr_destroy</i>() to set the object referenced by <i>attr</i>
       to an invalid value.

       The <i>pthread_rwlockattr_init</i>() function shall initialize a read-
       write lock attributes object <i>attr</i> with the default value for all
       of the attributes defined by the implementation.

       Results are undefined if <i>pthread_rwlockattr_init</i>() is called
       specifying an already initialized <i>attr</i> attributes object.

       After a read-write lock attributes object has been used to
       initialize one or more read-write locks, any function affecting
       the attributes object (including destruction) shall not affect
       any previously initialized read-write locks.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_rwlockattr_destroy</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized read-write lock attributes object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_rwlockattr_destroy</i>() and
       <i>pthread_rwlockattr_init</i>() functions shall return zero; otherwise,
       an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlockattr_init</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory exists to initialize the read-write
              lock attributes object.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_rwlockattr_destroy</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized read-write lock attributes object, it is recommended
       that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
</pre> <h2>
