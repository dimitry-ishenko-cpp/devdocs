PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       clock — report CPU time used
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       clock_t clock(void);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>clock</i>() function shall return the implementation's best
       approximation to the processor time used by the process since the
       beginning of an implementation-defined era related only to the
       process invocation.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       To determine the time in seconds, the value returned by <i>clock</i>()
       should be divided by the value of the macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC.
       CLOCKS_PER_SEC is defined to be one million in <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.  If the
       processor time used is not available or its value cannot be
       represented, the function shall return the value (<b>clock_t</b>)-1.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       In programming environments where <b>clock_t </b>is a 32-bit integer
       type and CLOCKS_PER_SEC is one million, <i>clock</i>() will start
       failing in less than 36 minutes of processor time for signed
       <b>clock_t</b>, or 72 minutes for unsigned <b>clock_t</b>.  Applications
       intended to be portable to such environments should use <i>times</i>()
       instead (or <i>clock_gettime</i>() with CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, if
       supported).

       In order to measure the time spent in a program, <i>clock</i>() should
       be called at the start of the program and its return value
       subtracted from the value returned by subsequent calls. The value
       returned by <i>clock</i>() is defined for compatibility across systems
       that have clocks with different resolutions. The resolution on
       any particular system need not be to microsecond accuracy.
