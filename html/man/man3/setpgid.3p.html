NAME </h2>
<pre>
       setpgid — set process group ID for job control
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int setpgid(pid_t <i>pid</i>, pid_t <i>pgid</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setpgid</i>() function shall either join an existing process
       group or create a new process group within the session of the
       calling process.

       The process group ID of a session leader shall not change.

       Upon successful completion, the process group ID of the process
       with a process ID that matches <i>pid</i> shall be set to <i>pgid</i>.

       As a special case, if <i>pid</i> is 0, the process ID of the calling
       process shall be used. Also, if <i>pgid</i> is 0, the process ID of the
       indicated process shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>setpgid</i>() shall return 0; otherwise,
       -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setpgid</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The value of the <i>pid</i> argument matches the process ID of a
              child process of the calling process and the child process
              has successfully executed one of the <i>exec</i> functions.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>pgid</i> argument is less than 0, or is not a
              value supported by the implementation.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The process indicated by the <i>pid</i> argument is a session
              leader.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The value of the <i>pid</i> argument matches the process ID of a
              child process of the calling process and the child process
              is not in the same session as the calling process.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The value of the <i>pgid</i> argument is valid but does not match
              the process ID of the process indicated by the <i>pid</i>
              argument and there is no process with a process group ID
              that matches the value of the <i>pgid</i> argument in the same
              session as the calling process.

       <b>ESRCH  </b>The value of the <i>pid</i> argument does not match the process
              ID of the calling process or of a child process of the
              calling process.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setpgid</i>() function shall group processes together for the
       purpose of signaling, placement in foreground or background, and
       other job control actions.

       The <i>setpgid</i>() function is similar to the <i>setpgrp</i>() function of
       4.2 BSD, except that 4.2 BSD allowed the specified new process
       group to assume any value. This presents certain security
       problems and is more flexible than necessary to support job
       control.

       To provide tighter security, <i>setpgid</i>() only allows the calling
       process to join a process group already in use inside its session
       or create a new process group whose process group ID was equal to
       its process ID.

       When a job control shell spawns a new job, the processes in the
       job must be placed into a new process group via <i>setpgid</i>().  There
       are two timing constraints involved in this action:

        1. The new process must be placed in the new process group
           before the appropriate program is launched via one of the
           <i>exec</i> functions.

        2. The new process must be placed in the new process group
           before the shell can correctly send signals to the new
           process group.

       To address these constraints, the following actions are
       performed. The new processes call <i>setpgid</i>() to alter their own
       process groups after <i>fork</i>() but before <i>exec</i>.  This satisfies the
       first constraint. Under 4.3 BSD, the second constraint is
       satisfied by the synchronization property of <i>vfork</i>(); that is,
       the shell is suspended until the child has completed the <i>exec</i>,
       thus ensuring that the child has completed the <i>setpgid</i>().  A new
       version of <i>fork</i>() with this same synchronization property was
       considered, but it was decided instead to merely allow the parent
       shell process to adjust the process group of its child processes
       via <i>setpgid</i>().  Both timing constraints are now satisfied by
       having both the parent shell and the child attempt to adjust the
       process group of the child process; it does not matter which
       succeeds first.

       Since it would be confusing to an application to have its process
       group change after it began executing (that is, after <i>exec</i>), and
       because the child process would already have adjusted its process
       group before this, the <b>[EACCES] </b>error was added to disallow this.

       One non-obvious use of <i>setpgid</i>() is to allow a job control shell
       to return itself to its original process group (the one in effect
       when the job control shell was executed). A job control shell
       does this before returning control back to its parent when it is
       terminating or suspending itself as a way of restoring its job
       control ``state'' back to what its parent would expect. (Note
       that the original process group of the job control shell
       typically matches the process group of its parent, but this is
       not necessarily always the case.)
