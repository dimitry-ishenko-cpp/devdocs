PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_mem_offset — find offset and length of a mapped typed
       memory block (<b>ADVANCED REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int posix_mem_offset(const void *restrict <i>addr</i>, size_t <i>len</i>,
           off_t *restrict <i>off</i>, size_t *restrict <i>contig_len</i>,
           int *restrict <i>fildes</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_mem_offset</i>() function shall return in the variable
       pointed to by <i>off</i> a value that identifies the offset (or
       location), within a memory object, of the memory block currently
       mapped at <i>addr</i>.  The function shall return in the variable
       pointed to by <i>fildes</i>, the descriptor used (via <i>mmap</i>()) to
       establish the mapping which contains <i>addr</i>.  If that descriptor
       was closed since the mapping was established, the returned value
       of <i>fildes</i> shall be -1. The <i>len</i> argument specifies the length of
       the block of the memory object the user wishes the offset for;
       upon return, the value pointed to by <i>contig_len</i> shall equal
       either <i>len</i>, or the length of the largest contiguous block of the
       memory object that is currently mapped to the calling process
       starting at <i>addr</i>, whichever is smaller.

       If the memory object mapped at <i>addr</i> is a typed memory object,
       then if the <i>off</i> and <i>contig_len</i> values obtained by calling
       <i>posix_mem_offset</i>() are used in a call to <i>mmap</i>() with a file
       descriptor that refers to the same memory pool as <i>fildes</i> (either
       through the same port or through a different port), and that was
       opened with neither the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE nor the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, the typed memory area that
       is mapped shall be exactly the same area that was mapped at <i>addr</i>
       in the address space of the process that called
       <i>posix_mem_offset</i>().

       If the memory object specified by <i>fildes</i> is not a typed memory
       object, then the behavior of this function is implementation-
       defined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>posix_mem_offset</i>() function shall
       return zero; otherwise, the corresponding error status value
       shall be returned.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_mem_offset</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The process has not mapped a memory object supported by
              this function at the given address <i>addr</i>.

       This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.
