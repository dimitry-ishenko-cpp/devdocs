PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fsetpos — set current file position
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int fsetpos(FILE *<i>stream</i>, const fpos_t *<i>pos</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fsetpos</i>() function shall set the file position and state
       indicators for the stream pointed to by <i>stream</i> according to the
       value of the object pointed to by <i>pos</i>, which the application
       shall ensure is a value obtained from an earlier call to
       <i>fgetpos</i>() on the same stream. If a read or write error occurs,
       the error indicator for the stream shall be set and <i>fsetpos</i>()
       fails.

       A successful call to the <i>fsetpos</i>() function shall clear the end-
       of-file indicator for the stream and undo any effects of <i>ungetc</i>()
       on the same stream. After an <i>fsetpos</i>() call, the next operation
       on an update stream may be either input or output.

       The behavior of <i>fsetpos</i>() on devices which are incapable of
       seeking is implementation-defined.  The value of the file offset
       associated with such a device is undefined.

       The <i>fsetpos</i>() function shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fsetpos</i>() function shall return 0 if it succeeds; otherwise,
       it shall return a non-zero value and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fsetpos</i>() function shall fail if, either the <i>stream</i> is
       unbuffered or the <i>stream</i>'s buffer needed to be flushed, and the
       call to <i>fsetpos</i>() causes an underlying <i>lseek</i>() or <i>write</i>() to be
       invoked, and:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor and the
              thread would be delayed in the write operation.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The file descriptor underlying the stream file is not open
              for writing or the stream's buffer needed to be flushed
              and the file is not open.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the
              maximum file size.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the file
              size limit of the process.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to
              write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
              corresponding stream.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a
              signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EIO    </b>A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is a
              member of a background process group attempting to perform
              a <i>write</i>() to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the
              calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, the process is not
              ignoring SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is
              orphaned.  This error may also be returned under
              implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>There was no free space remaining on the device containing
              the file.

       <b>EPIPE  </b>An attempt was made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not
              open for reading by any process; a SIGPIPE signal shall
              also be sent to the thread.

       <b>ESPIPE </b>The file descriptor underlying <i>stream</i> is associated with a
              pipe, FIFO, or socket.

       The <i>fsetpos</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENXIO  </b>A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request
              was outside the capabilities of the device.
