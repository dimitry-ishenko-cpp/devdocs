</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_setdirection - set the direction for which packets will be
       captured
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pcap_setdirection(pcap_t *p, pcap_direction_t d);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_setdirection</b>() is used to specify a direction that packets
       will be captured.  <i>d</i> is one of the constants <b>PCAP_D_IN</b>,
       <b>PCAP_D_OUT </b>or <b>PCAP_D_INOUT</b>.  <b>PCAP_D_IN </b>will only capture packets
       received by the device, <b>PCAP_D_OUT </b>will only capture packets sent
       by the device and <b>PCAP_D_INOUT </b>will capture packets received by
       or sent by the device.  <b>PCAP_D_INOUT </b>is the default setting if
       this function is not called.

       <b>pcap_setdirection</b>() isn't necessarily fully supported on all
       platforms; some platforms might return an error for all values,
       and some other platforms might not support <b>PCAP_D_OUT</b>.

       This operation is not supported if a ``savefile'' is being read.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_setdirection</b>() returns <b>0 </b>on success,
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED </b>if called on a capture handle that has
       been created but not activated, or <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>on other errors. If
       <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is returned, <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP)
       may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch or display the error
       text.
