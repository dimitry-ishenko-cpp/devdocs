<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       symlink, symlinkat — make a symbolic link
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int symlink(const char *<i>path1</i>, const char *<i>path2</i>);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int symlinkat(const char *<i>path1</i>, int <i>fd</i>, const char *<i>path2</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>symlink</i>() function shall create a symbolic link called <i>path2</i>
       that contains the string pointed to by <i>path1</i> (<i>path2</i> is the name
       of the symbolic link created, <i>path1</i> is the string contained in
       the symbolic link).

       The string pointed to by <i>path1</i> shall be treated only as a string
       and shall not be validated as a pathname.

       If the <i>symlink</i>() function fails for any reason other than <b>[EIO]</b>,
       any file named by <i>path2</i> shall be unaffected.

       If <i>path2</i> names a symbolic link, <i>symlink</i>() shall fail and set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EEXIST]</b>.

       The symbolic link's user ID shall be set to the process'
       effective user ID. The symbolic link's group ID shall be set to
       the group ID of the parent directory or to the effective group ID
       of the process. Implementations shall provide a way to initialize
       the symbolic link's group ID to the group ID of the parent
       directory. Implementations may, but need not, provide an
       implementation-defined way to initialize the symbolic link's
       group ID to the effective group ID of the calling process.

       The values of the file mode bits for the created symbolic link
       are unspecified. All interfaces specified by POSIX.1‐2008 shall
       behave as if the contents of symbolic links can always be read,
       except that the value of the file mode bits returned in the
       <i>st_mode</i> field of the <b>stat </b>structure is unspecified.

       Upon successful completion, <i>symlink</i>() shall mark for update the
       last data access, last data modification, and last file status
       change timestamps of the symbolic link. Also, the last data
       modification and last file status change timestamps of the
       directory that contains the new entry shall be marked for update.

       The <i>symlinkat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>symlink</i>()
       function except in the case where <i>path2</i> specifies a relative
       path. In this case the symbolic link is created relative to the
       directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the
       current working directory. If the access mode of the open file
       description associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH,
       the function shall check whether directory searches are permitted
       using the current permissions of the directory underlying the
       file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function
       shall not perform the check.

       If <i>symlinkat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to <i>symlink</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
       Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Write permission is denied in the directory where the
              symbolic link is being created, or search permission is
              denied for a component of the path prefix of <i>path2</i>.

       <b>EEXIST </b>The <i>path2</i> argument names an existing file.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurs while reading from or writing to the
              file system.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path2</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of the pathname specified by the
              <i>path2</i> argument is longer than {NAME_MAX} or the length of
              the <i>path1</i> argument is longer than {SYMLINK_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of the path prefix of <i>path2</i> does not name an
              existing file or <i>path2</i> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOENT </b>or <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path2</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters. If <i>path2</i> without the trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters would name an existing file, an <b>[ENOENT] </b>error
              shall not occur.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The directory in which the entry for the new symbolic link
              is being placed cannot be extended because no space is
              left on the file system containing the directory, or the
              new symbolic link cannot be created because no space is
              left on the file system which shall contain the link, or
              the file system is out of file-allocation resources.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix of <i>path2</i> names an existing
              file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a
              directory.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The new symbolic link would reside on a read-only file
              system.

       The <i>symlinkat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd</i> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path2</i> argument does not specify an absolute path and
              the <i>fd</i> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
              descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path2</i> argument is not an absolute path and <i>fd</i> is a
              file descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path2</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of the <i>path2</i> argument exceeds {PATH_MAX} or
              pathname resolution of a symbolic link in the <i>path2</i>
              argument produced an intermediate result with a length
              that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

EXAMPLES </h2>

       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Like a hard link, a symbolic link allows a file to have multiple
       logical names. The presence of a hard link guarantees the
       existence of a file, even after the original name has been
       removed. A symbolic link provides no such assurance; in fact, the
       file named by the <i>path1</i> argument need not exist when the link is
       created. A symbolic link can cross file system boundaries.

       Normal permission checks are made on each component of the
       symbolic link pathname during its resolution.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The purpose of the <i>symlinkat</i>() function is to create symbolic
       links in directories other than the current working directory
       without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a
       file could be changed in parallel to a call to <i>symlink</i>(),
       resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor
       for the target directory and using the <i>symlinkat</i>() function it
       can be guaranteed that the created symbolic link is located
       relative to the desired directory.
