NAME </h2>
<pre>
       bzero, explicit_bzero - zero a byte string
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;strings.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void bzero(void </b><i>s</i><b>[.</b><i>n</i><b>], size_t </b><i>n</i><b>);</b>

       <b>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void explicit_bzero(void </b><i>s</i><b>[.</b><i>n</i><b>], size_t </b><i>n</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>bzero</b>() function erases the data in the <i>n</i> bytes of the memory
       starting at the location pointed to by <i>s</i>, by writing zeros (bytes
       containing '\0') to that area.

       The <b>explicit_bzero</b>() function performs the same task as <b>bzero</b>().
       It differs from <b>bzero</b>() in that it guarantees that compiler
       optimizations will not remove the erase operation if the compiler
       deduces that the operation is "unnecessary".
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       None.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>explicit_bzero</b>()
              glibc 2.25.

              The <b>explicit_bzero</b>() function is a nonstandard extension
              that is also present on some of the BSDs.  Some other
              implementations have a similar function, such as
              <b>memset_explicit</b>() or <b>memset_s</b>().

       <b>bzero</b>()
              4.3BSD.

              Marked as LEGACY in POSIX.1-2001.  Removed in
              POSIX.1-2008.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>explicit_bzero</b>() function addresses a problem that security-
       conscious applications may run into when using <b>bzero</b>(): if the
       compiler can deduce that the location to be zeroed will never
       again be touched by a <i>correct</i> program, then it may remove the
       <b>bzero</b>() call altogether.  This is a problem if the intent of the
       <b>bzero</b>() call was to erase sensitive data (e.g., passwords) to
       prevent the possibility that the data was leaked by an incorrect
       or compromised program.  Calls to <b>explicit_bzero</b>() are never
       optimized away by the compiler.

       The <b>explicit_bzero</b>() function does not solve all problems
       associated with erasing sensitive data:

       •  The <b>explicit_bzero</b>() function does <i>not</i> guarantee that
          sensitive data is completely erased from memory.  (The same is
          true of <b>bzero</b>().)  For example, there may be copies of the
          sensitive data in a register and in "scratch" stack areas.
          The <b>explicit_bzero</b>() function is not aware of these copies,
          and can't erase them.

       •  In some circumstances, <b>explicit_bzero</b>() can <i>decrease</i> security.
          If the compiler determined that the variable containing the
          sensitive data could be optimized to be stored in a register
          (because it is small enough to fit in a register, and no
          operation other than the <b>explicit_bzero</b>() call would need to
          take the address of the variable), then the <b>explicit_bzero</b>()
          call will force the data to be copied from the register to a
          location in RAM that is then immediately erased (while the
          copy in the register remains unaffected).  The problem here is
          that data in RAM is more likely to be exposed by a bug than
          data in a register, and thus the <b>explicit_bzero</b>() call creates
          a brief time window where the sensitive data is more
          vulnerable than it would otherwise have been if no attempt had
          been made to erase the data.

       Note that declaring the sensitive variable with the <b>volatile</b>
       qualifier does <i>not</i> eliminate the above problems.  Indeed, it will
       make them worse, since, for example, it may force a variable that
       would otherwise have been optimized into a register to instead be
       maintained in (more vulnerable) RAM for its entire lifetime.

       Notwithstanding the above details, for security-conscious
       applications, using <b>explicit_bzero</b>() is generally preferable to
       not using it.  The developers of <b>explicit_bzero</b>() anticipate that
       future compilers will recognize calls to <b>explicit_bzero</b>() and
       take steps to ensure that all copies of the sensitive data are
       erased, including copies in registers or in "scratch" stack
       areas.
