       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_mutexattr_destroy, pthread_mutexattr_init — destroy and
       initialize the mutex attributes object
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_mutexattr_destroy(pthread_mutexattr_t *<i>attr</i>);
       int pthread_mutexattr_init(pthread_mutexattr_t *<i>attr</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutexattr_destroy</i>() function shall destroy a mutex
       attributes object; the object becomes, in effect, uninitialized.
       An implementation may cause <i>pthread_mutexattr_destroy</i>() to set
       the object referenced by <i>attr</i> to an invalid value.

       A destroyed <i>attr</i> attributes object can be reinitialized using
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_init</i>(); the results of otherwise referencing
       the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.

       The <i>pthread_mutexattr_init</i>() function shall initialize a mutex
       attributes object <i>attr</i> with the default value for all of the
       attributes defined by the implementation.

       Results are undefined if <i>pthread_mutexattr_init</i>() is called
       specifying an already initialized <i>attr</i> attributes object.

       After a mutex attributes object has been used to initialize one
       or more mutexes, any function affecting the attributes object
       (including destruction) shall not affect any previously
       initialized mutexes.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_mutexattr_destroy</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized mutex attributes object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>pthread_mutexattr_destroy</i>() and
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_init</i>() shall return zero; otherwise, an error
       number shall be returned to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutexattr_init</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory exists to initialize the mutex
              attributes object.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_mutexattr_destroy</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized mutex attributes object, it is recommended that the
       function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.

       See <a href="pthread_attr_destroy.3p.html">pthread_attr_destroy(3p)</a> for a general explanation of
       attributes. Attributes objects allow implementations to
       experiment with useful extensions and permit extension of this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 without changing the existing functions.
       Thus, they provide for future extensibility of this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 and reduce the temptation to standardize prematurely
       on semantics that are not yet widely implemented or understood.

       Examples of possible additional mutex attributes that have been
       discussed are <i>spin_only</i>, <i>limited_spin</i>, <i>no_spin</i>, <i>recursive</i>, and
       <i>metered</i>.  (To explain what the latter attributes might mean:
       recursive mutexes would allow for multiple re-locking by the
       current owner; metered mutexes would transparently keep records
       of queue length, wait time, and so on.) Since there is not yet
       wide agreement on the usefulness of these resulting from shared
       implementation and usage experience, they are not yet specified
       in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. Mutex attributes objects,
       however, make it possible to test out these concepts for possible
       standardization at a later time.

   <b>Mutex Attributes and Performance</b>
       Care has been taken to ensure that the default values of the
       mutex attributes have been defined such that mutexes initialized
       with the defaults have simple enough semantics so that the
       locking and unlocking can be done with the equivalent of a test-
       and-set instruction (plus possibly a few other basic
       instructions).

       There is at least one implementation method that can be used to
       reduce the cost of testing at lock-time if a mutex has non-
       default attributes. One such method that an implementation can
       employ (and this can be made fully transparent to fully
       conforming POSIX applications) is to secretly pre-lock any
       mutexes that are initialized to non-default attributes. Any later
       attempt to lock such a mutex causes the implementation to branch
       to the ``slow path'' as if the mutex were unavailable; then, on
       the slow path, the implementation can do the ``real work'' to
       lock a non-default mutex. The underlying unlock operation is more
       complicated since the implementation never really wants to
       release the pre-lock on this kind of mutex. This illustrates
       that, depending on the hardware, there may be certain
       optimizations that can be used so that whatever mutex attributes
       are considered ``most frequently used'' can be processed most
       efficiently.

   <b>Process Shared Memory and Synchronization</b>
       The existence of memory mapping functions in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 leads to the possibility that an application may
       allocate the synchronization objects from this section in memory
       that is accessed by multiple processes (and therefore, by threads
       of multiple processes).

       In order to permit such usage, while at the same time keeping the
       usual case (that is, usage within a single process) efficient, a
       <i>process-shared</i> option has been defined.

       If an implementation supports the _POSIX_THREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
       option, then the <i>process-shared</i> attribute can be used to indicate
       that mutexes or condition variables may be accessed by threads of
       multiple processes.

       The default setting of PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE has been chosen
       for the <i>process-shared</i> attribute so that the most efficient forms
       of these synchronization objects are created by default.

       Synchronization variables that are initialized with the
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE <i>process-shared</i> attribute may only be
       operated on by threads in the process that initialized them.
       Synchronization variables that are initialized with the
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED <i>process-shared</i> attribute may be operated
       on by any thread in any process that has access to it. In
       particular, these processes may exist beyond the lifetime of the
       initializing process. For example, the following code implements
       a simple counting semaphore in a mapped file that may be used by
       many processes.

           /* sem.h */
           struct semaphore {
               pthread_mutex_t lock;

           void

           }

       The following code is for three separate processes that create,
       post, and wait on a semaphore in the file <b>/tmp/semaphore</b>.  Once
       the file is created, the post and wait programs increment and
       decrement the counting semaphore (waiting and waking as required)
       even though they did not initialize the semaphore.
