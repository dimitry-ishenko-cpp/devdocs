NAME </h2>
<pre>
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)
</pre> <h2>
INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>

       PCRE2 is the name used for a revised API for the PCRE library,
       which is a set of functions, written in C, that implement regular
       expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics
       as Perl, with just a few differences. After nearly two decades,
       the limitations of the original API were making development
       increasingly difficult. The new API is more extensible, and it
       was simplified by abolishing the separate "study" optimizing
       function; in PCRE2, patterns are automatically optimized where
       possible. Since forking from PCRE1, the code has been extensively
       refactored and new features introduced. The old library is now
       obsolete and is no longer maintained.

       As well as Perl-style regular expression patterns, some features
       that appeared in Python and the original PCRE before they
       appeared in Perl are available using the Python syntax. There is
       also some support for one or two .NET and Oniguruma syntax items,
       and there are options for requesting some minor changes that give
       better ECMAScript (aka JavaScript) compatibility.

       The source code for PCRE2 can be compiled to support strings of
       8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit code units, which means that up to three
       separate libraries may be installed, one for each code unit size.
       The size of code unit is not related to the bit size of the
       underlying hardware. In a 64-bit environment that also supports
       32-bit applications, versions of PCRE2 that are compiled in both
       64-bit and 32-bit modes may be needed.

       The original work to extend PCRE to 16-bit and 32-bit code units
       was done by Zoltan Herczeg and Christian Persch, respectively. In
       all three cases, strings can be interpreted either as one
       character per code unit, or as UTF-encoded Unicode, with support
       for Unicode general category properties. Unicode support is
       optional at build time (but is the default). However, processing
       strings as UTF code units must be enabled explicitly at run time.
       The version of Unicode in use can be discovered by running

         pcre2test -C

       The three libraries contain identical sets of functions, with
       names ending in _8, _16, or _32, respectively (for example,
       <b>pcre2_compile_8()</b>). However, by defining PCRE2_CODE_UNIT_WIDTH to
       be 8, 16, or 32, a program that uses just one code unit width can
       be written using generic names such as <b>pcre2_compile()</b>, and the
       documentation is written assuming that this is the case.

       In addition to the Perl-compatible matching function, PCRE2
       contains an alternative function that matches the same compiled
       patterns in a different way. In certain circumstances, the
       alternative function has some advantages.  For a discussion of
       the two matching algorithms, see the <b>pcre2matching </b>page.

       Details of exactly which Perl regular expression features are and
       are not supported by PCRE2 are given in separate documents. See
       the <b>pcre2pattern </b>and <b>pcre2compat </b>pages. There is a syntax summary
       in the <b>pcre2syntax </b>page.

       Some features of PCRE2 can be included, excluded, or changed when
       the library is built. The <b>pcre2_config() </b>function makes it
       possible for a client to discover which features are available.
       The features themselves are described in the <b>pcre2build </b>page.
       Documentation about building PCRE2 for various operating systems
       can be found in the <b>README </b>and <b>NON-AUTOTOOLS_BUILD </b>files in the
       source distribution.

       The libraries contains a number of undocumented internal
       functions and data tables that are used by more than one of the
       exported external functions, but which are not intended for use
       by external callers. Their names all begin with "_pcre2", which
       hopefully will not provoke any name clashes. In some
       environments, it is possible to control which external symbols
       are exported when a shared library is built, and in these cases
       the undocumented symbols are not exported.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS </h2>
<pre>

       If you are using PCRE2 in a non-UTF application that permits
       users to supply arbitrary patterns for compilation, you should be
       aware of a feature that allows users to turn on UTF support from
       within a pattern. For example, an 8-bit pattern that begins with
       "(*UTF)" turns on UTF-8 mode, which interprets patterns and
       subjects as strings of UTF-8 code units instead of individual
       8-bit characters. This causes both the pattern and any data
       against which it is matched to be checked for UTF-8 validity. If
       the data string is very long, such a check might use sufficiently
       many resources as to cause your application to lose performance.

       One way of guarding against this possibility is to use the
       <b>pcre2_pattern_info() </b>function to check the compiled pattern's
       options for PCRE2_UTF. Alternatively, you can set the
       PCRE2_NEVER_UTF option when calling <b>pcre2_compile()</b>. This causes
       a compile time error if the pattern contains a UTF-setting
       sequence.

       The use of Unicode properties for character types such as \d can
       also be enabled from within the pattern, by specifying "(*UCP)".
       This feature can be disallowed by setting the PCRE2_NEVER_UCP
       option.

       If your application is one that supports UTF, be aware that
       validity checking can take time. If the same data string is to be
       matched many times, you can use the PCRE2_NO_UTF_CHECK option for
       the second and subsequent matches to avoid running redundant
       checks.

       The use of the \C escape sequence in a UTF-8 or UTF-16 pattern
       can lead to problems, because it may leave the current matching
       point in the middle of a multi-code-unit character. The
       PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option can be used by an application to
       lock out the use of \C, causing a compile-time error if it is
       encountered. It is also possible to build PCRE2 with the use of
       \C permanently disabled.

       Another way that performance can be hit is by running a pattern
       that has a very large search tree against a string that will
       never match. Nested unlimited repeats in a pattern are a common
       example. PCRE2 provides some protection against this: see the
       <b>pcre2_set_match_limit() </b>function in the <b>pcre2api </b>page. There is a
       similar function called <b>pcre2_set_depth_limit() </b>that can be used
       to restrict the amount of memory that is used.

USER DOCUMENTATION </h2>
<pre>

       The user documentation for PCRE2 comprises a number of different
       sections. In the "man" format, each of these is a separate "man
       page". In the HTML format, each is a separate page, linked from
       the index page. In the plain text format, the descriptions of the
       <b>pcre2grep </b>and <b>pcre2test </b>programs are in files called
       <b>pcre2grep.txt </b>and <b>pcre2test.txt</b>, respectively. The remaining
       sections, except for the <b>pcre2demo </b>section (which is a program
       listing), and the short pages for individual functions, are
       concatenated in <b>pcre2.txt</b>, for ease of searching. The sections
       are as follows:
