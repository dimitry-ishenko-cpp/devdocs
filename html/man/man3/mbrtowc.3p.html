PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mbrtowc — convert a character to a wide-character code
       (restartable)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       size_t mbrtowc(wchar_t *restrict <i>pwc</i>, const char *restrict <i>s</i>,
           size_t <i>n</i>, mbstate_t *restrict <i>ps</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       If <i>s</i> is a null pointer, the <i>mbrtowc</i>() function shall be
       equivalent to the call:

           mbrtowc(NULL, "", 1, ps)

       In this case, the values of the arguments <i>pwc</i> and <i>n</i> are ignored.

       If <i>s</i> is not a null pointer, the <i>mbrtowc</i>() function shall inspect
       at most <i>n</i> bytes beginning at the byte pointed to by <i>s</i> to
       determine the number of bytes needed to complete the next
       character (including any shift sequences). If the function
       determines that the next character is completed, it shall
       determine the value of the corresponding wide character and then,
       if <i>pwc</i> is not a null pointer, shall store that value in the
       object pointed to by <i>pwc</i>.  If the corresponding wide character is
       the null wide character, the resulting state described shall be
       the initial conversion state.

       If <i>ps</i> is a null pointer, the <i>mbrtowc</i>() function shall use its own
       internal <b>mbstate_t </b>object, which shall be initialized at program
       start-up to the initial conversion state. Otherwise, the
       <b>mbstate_t </b>object pointed to by <i>ps</i> shall be used to completely
       describe the current conversion state of the associated character
       sequence. The implementation shall behave as if no function
       defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 calls <i>mbrtowc</i>().

       The behavior of this function is affected by the <i>LC_CTYPE</i>
       category of the current locale.

       The <i>mbrtowc</i>() function need not be thread-safe if called with a
       NULL <i>ps</i> argument.

       The <i>mbrtowc</i>() function shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mbrtowc</i>() function shall return the first of the following
       that applies:

       0           If the next <i>n</i> or fewer bytes complete the character
                   that corresponds to the null wide character (which is
                   the value stored).

       between 1 and <i>n</i> inclusive
                   If the next <i>n</i> or fewer bytes complete a valid
                   character (which is the value stored); the value
                   returned shall be the number of bytes that complete
                   the character.

       (<b>size_t</b>)-2  If the next <i>n</i> bytes contribute to an incomplete but
                   potentially valid character, and all <i>n</i> bytes have
                   been processed (no value is stored). When <i>n</i> has at
                   least the value of the {MB_CUR_MAX} macro, this case
                   can only occur if <i>s</i> points at a sequence of redundant
                   shift sequences (for implementations with state-
                   dependent encodings).

       (<b>size_t</b>)-1  If an encoding error occurs, in which case the next <i>n</i>
                   or fewer bytes do not contribute to a complete and
                   valid character (no value is stored). In this case,
                   <b>[EILSEQ] </b>shall be stored in <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> and the conversion
                   state is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mbrtowc</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ </b>An invalid character sequence is detected.  In the POSIX
              locale an <b>[EILSEQ] </b>error cannot occur since all byte
              values are valid characters.

       The <i>mbrtowc</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>ps</i> points to an object that contains an invalid conversion
              state.
