PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rand, rand_r, srand — pseudo-random number generator
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int rand(void);
       int rand_r(unsigned *<i>seed</i>);
       void srand(unsigned <i>seed</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For <i>rand</i>() and <i>srand</i>(): The functionality described on this
       reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is
       unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C
       standard.

       The <i>rand</i>() function shall compute a sequence of pseudo-random
       integers in the range [0,{RAND_MAX}] with a period of at least
       232.

       The <i>rand</i>() function need not be thread-safe.

       The <i>rand_r</i>() function shall compute a sequence of pseudo-random
       integers in the range [0,{RAND_MAX}].  (The value of the
       {RAND_MAX} macro shall be at least 32767.)

       If <i>rand_r</i>() is called with the same initial value for the object
       pointed to by <i>seed</i> and that object is not modified between
       successive returns and calls to <i>rand_r</i>(), the same sequence shall
       be generated.

       The <i>srand</i>() function uses the argument as a seed for a new
       sequence of pseudo-random numbers to be returned by subsequent
       calls to <i>rand</i>().  If <i>srand</i>() is then called with the same seed
       value, the sequence of pseudo-random numbers shall be repeated.
       If <i>rand</i>() is called before any calls to <i>srand</i>() are made, the
       same sequence shall be generated as when <i>srand</i>() is first called
       with a seed value of 1.

       The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 calls <i>rand</i>() or <i>srand</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>rand</i>() function shall return the next pseudo-random number in
       the sequence.

       The <i>rand_r</i>() function shall return a pseudo-random integer.

       The <i>srand</i>() function shall not return a value.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Generating a Pseudo-Random Number Sequence</b>
       The following example demonstrates how to generate a sequence of
       pseudo-random numbers.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           ...
               long count, i;
               char *keystr;
               int elementlen, len;
               char c;
           ...
           /* Initial random number generator. */
               srand(1);

               /* Create keys using only lowercase characters */
               len = 0;
               for (i=0; i&lt;count; i++) {
                   while (len &lt; elementlen) {
                       c = (char) (rand() % 128);
                       if (islower(c))
                           keystr[len++] = c;
                   }

                   keystr[len] = '\0';
                   printf("%s Element%0*ld\n", keystr, elementlen, i);
                   len = 0;
               }

   <b>Generating the Same Sequence on Different Machines</b>
       The following code defines a pair of functions that could be
       incorporated into applications wishing to ensure that the same
       sequence of numbers is generated across different machines.

           static unsigned long next = 1;
           int myrand(void)  /* RAND_MAX assumed to be 32767. */
           {
               next = next * 1103515245 + 12345;
               return((unsigned)(next/65536) % 32768);
           }

           void mysrand(unsigned seed)
           {
               next = seed;
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>drand48</i>() and <i>random</i>() functions provide much more elaborate
       pseudo-random number generators.

       The limitations on the amount of state that can be carried
       between one function call and another mean the <i>rand_r</i>() function
       can never be implemented in a way which satisfies all of the
       requirements on a pseudo-random number generator.

       These functions should be avoided whenever non-trivial
       requirements (including safety) have to be fulfilled.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The ISO C standard <i>rand</i>() and <i>srand</i>() functions allow per-process
       pseudo-random streams shared by all threads. Those two functions
       need not change, but there has to be mutual-exclusion that
       prevents interference between two threads concurrently accessing
       the random number generator.

       With regard to <i>rand</i>(), there are two different behaviors that may
       be wanted in a multi-threaded program:

        1. A single per-process sequence of pseudo-random numbers that
           is shared by all threads that call <i>rand</i>()

        2. A different sequence of pseudo-random numbers for each thread
           that calls <i>rand</i>()

       This is provided by the modified thread-safe function based on
       whether the seed value is global to the entire process or local
       to each thread.

       This does not address the known deficiencies of the <i>rand</i>()
       function implementations, which have been approached by
       maintaining more state. In effect, this specifies new thread-safe
       forms of a deficient function.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>rand_r</i>() function may be removed in a future version.
