DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A mutex is a MUTual EXclusion device, and is useful for
       protecting shared data structures from concurrent modifications,
       and implementing critical sections and monitors.

       A mutex has two possible states: unlocked (not owned by any
       thread), and locked (owned by one thread).  A mutex can never be
       owned by two different threads simultaneously.  A thread
       attempting to lock a mutex that is already locked by another
       thread is suspended until the owning thread unlocks the mutex
       first.

       <b>pthread_mutex_init </b>initializes the mutex object pointed to by
       <i>mutex</i> according to the mutex attributes specified in <i>mutexattr</i>.
       If <i>mutexattr</i> is <b>NULL</b>, default attributes are used instead.

       The LinuxThreads implementation supports only one mutex
       attributes, the <i>mutex kind</i>, which is either ``fast'',
       ``recursive'', or ``error checking''.  The kind of a mutex
       determines whether it can be locked again by a thread that
       already owns it.  The default kind is ``fast''.  See
       <a href="pthread_mutexattr_init.3.html">pthread_mutexattr_init(3)</a> for more information on mutex
       attributes.

       Variables of type <b>pthread_mutex_t </b>can also be initialized
       statically, using the constants <b>PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER </b>(for
       fast mutexes), <b>PTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP </b>(for
       recursive mutexes), and <b>PTHREAD_ERRORCHECK_MUTEX_INITIALIZER_NP</b>
       (for error checking mutexes).

       <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>locks the given mutex.  If the mutex is
       currently unlocked, it becomes locked and owned by the calling
       thread, and <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>returns immediately.  If the mutex
       is already locked by another thread, <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>suspends
       the calling thread until the mutex is unlocked.

       If the mutex is already locked by the calling thread, the
       behavior of <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>depends on the kind of the mutex.
       If the mutex is of the ``fast'' kind, the calling thread is
       suspended until the mutex is unlocked, thus effectively causing
       the calling thread to deadlock.  If the mutex is of the ``error
       checking'' kind, <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>returns immediately with the
       error code <b>EDEADLK</b>.  If the mutex is of the ``recursive'' kind,
       <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>succeeds and returns immediately, recording
       the number of times the calling thread has locked the mutex.  An
       equal number of <b>pthread_mutex_unlock </b>operations must be performed
       before the mutex returns to the unlocked state.

       <b>pthread_mutex_trylock </b>behaves identically to <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b>,
       except that it does not block the calling thread if the mutex is
       already locked by another thread (or by the calling thread in the
       case of a ``fast'' mutex).  Instead, <b>pthread_mutex_trylock</b>
       returns immediately with the error code <b>EBUSY</b>.

       <b>pthread_mutex_unlock </b>unlocks the given mutex.  The mutex is
       assumed to be locked and owned by the calling thread on entrance
       to <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b>.  If the mutex is of the ``fast'' kind,
       <b>pthread_mutex_unlock </b>always returns it to the unlocked state.  If
       it is of the ``recursive'' kind, it decrements the locking count
       of the mutex (number of <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>operations performed
       on it by the calling thread), and only when this count reaches
       zero is the mutex actually unlocked.

       On ``error checking'' and ``recursive'' mutexes,
       <b>pthread_mutex_unlock </b>actually checks at run-time that the mutex
       is locked on entrance, and that it was locked by the same thread
       that is now calling <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b>.  If these conditions
       are not met, an error code is returned and the mutex remains
       unchanged.  ``Fast'' mutexes perform no such checks, thus
       allowing a locked mutex to be unlocked by a thread other than its
       owner.  This is non-portable behavior and must not be relied
       upon.

       <b>pthread_mutex_destroy </b>destroys a mutex object, freeing the
       resources it might hold.  The mutex must be unlocked on entrance.
       In the LinuxThreads implementation, no resources are associated
       with mutex objects, thus <b>pthread_mutex_destroy </b>actually does
       nothing except checking that the mutex is unlocked.
</pre> <h2>
CANCELLATION </h2>
<pre>
       None of the mutex functions is a cancelation point, not even
       <b>pthread_mutex_lock</b>, in spite of the fact that it can suspend a
       thread for arbitrary durations.  This way, the status of mutexes
       at cancelation points is predictable, allowing cancelation
       handlers to unlock precisely those mutexes that need to be
       unlocked before the thread stops executing.  Consequently,
       threads using deferred cancelation should never hold a mutex for
       extended periods of time.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNC-SIGNAL SAFETY </h2>
<pre>
       The mutex functions are not async-signal safe.  What this means
       is that they should not be called from a signal handler.  In
       particular, calling <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>or <b>pthread_mutex_unlock</b>
       from a signal handler may deadlock the calling thread.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pthread_mutex_init </b>always returns 0.  The other mutex functions
       return 0 on success and a non-zero error code on error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>function returns the following error code
       on error:

              <b>EINVAL </b>The mutex has not been properly initialized.

              <b>EDEADLK</b>
                     The mutex is already locked by the calling thread
                     (``error checking'' mutexes only).

       The <b>pthread_mutex_trylock </b>function returns the following error
       codes on error:

              <b>EBUSY  </b>The mutex could not be acquired because it was
                     currently locked.

              <b>EINVAL </b>The mutex has not been properly initialized.

       The <b>pthread_mutex_unlock </b>function returns the following error
       code on error:

              <b>EINVAL </b>The mutex has not been properly initialized.

              <b>EPERM  </b>The calling thread does not own the mutex (``error
                     checking'' mutexes only).

       The <b>pthread_mutex_destroy </b>function returns the following error
       code on error:

              <b>EBUSY  </b>The mutex is currently locked.

EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       A shared global variable <i>x</i> can be protected by a mutex as
       follows:

              <b>int x;</b>
              <b>pthread_mutex_t mut = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;</b>

       All accesses and modifications to <i>x</i> should be bracketed by calls
       to <b>pthread_mutex_lock </b>and <b>pthread_mutex_unlock </b>as follows:

              <b>pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mut);</b>
              <b>/* operate on x */</b>
              <b>pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mut);</b>
