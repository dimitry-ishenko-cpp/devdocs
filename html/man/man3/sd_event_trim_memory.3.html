DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_event_add_memory_pressure() </b>adds a new event source that is
       triggered whenever memory pressure is seen. This functionality is
       built around the Linux kernel's <b>Pressure Stall Information</b>
       <b>(PSI)</b>[1] logic.

       Expects an event loop object as first parameter, and returns the
       allocated event source object in the second parameter, on
       success. The <i>handler</i> parameter is a function to call when memory
       pressure is seen, or <b>NULL</b>. The handler function will be passed
       the <i>userdata</i> pointer, which may be chosen freely by the caller.
       The handler may return negative to signal an error (see below),
       other return values are ignored. If <i>handler</i> is <b>NULL</b>, a default
       handler that compacts allocation caches maintained by libsystemd
       as well as glibc (via <a href="malloc_trim.3.html">malloc_trim(3)</a>) will be used.

       To destroy an event source object use <a href="sd_event_source_unref.3.html">sd_event_source_unref(3)</a>,
       but note that the event source is only removed from the event
       loop when all references to the event source are dropped. To make
       sure an event source does not fire anymore, even if it is still
       referenced, disable the event source using
       <a href="sd_event_source_set_enabled.3.html">sd_event_source_set_enabled(3)</a> with <b>SD_EVENT_OFF</b>.

       If the second parameter of <b>sd_event_add_memory_pressure() </b>is <b>NULL</b>
       no reference to the event source object is returned. In this case
       the event source is considered "floating", and will be destroyed
       implicitly when the event loop itself is destroyed.

       The event source will fire according to the following logic:

        1. If the <i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</i>/<i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WRITE</i>
           environment variables are set at the time the event source is
           established, it will watch the file, FIFO or AF_UNIX socket
           specified via <i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</i> (which must contain an
           absolute path name) for <b>POLLPRI </b>(in case it is a regular
           file) or <b>POLLIN </b>events (otherwise). After opening the inode,
           it will write the (decoded) Base64 data provided via
           <i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WRITE</i> into it before it starts polling on it
           (the variable may be unset in which case this is skipped).
           Typically, if used, <i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</i> will contain a
           path such as /proc/pressure/memory or a path to a specific
           memory.pressure file in the control group file system
           (cgroupfs).

        2. If these environment variables are not set, the local PSI
           interface file memory.pressure of the control group the
           invoking process is running in is used.

        3. If that file does not exist, the system-wide PSI interface
           file /proc/pressure/memory is watched instead.

       Or in other words: preferably any explicit configuration passed
       in by an invoking service manager (or similar) is used as
       notification source, before falling back to local notifications
       of the service, and finally to global notifications of the
       system.

       Well-behaving services and applications are recommended to react
       to memory pressure events by executing one or more of the
       following operations, in order to ensure optimal behaviour even
       on loaded and resource-constrained systems:

       •   Release allocation caches such as <b>malloc_trim() </b>or similar,
           both implemented in the libraries consumed by the program and
           in private allocation caches of the program itself.

       •   Release any other form of in-memory caches that can easily be
           recovered if needed (e.g. browser caches).

       •   Terminate idle worker threads or processes, or similar.

       •   Even exit entirely from the program if it is idle and can be
           automatically started when needed (for example via socket or
           bus activation).

       Any of the suggested operations should help easing memory
       pressure situations and allowing the system to make progress by
       reclaiming the memory for other purposes.

       This event source typically fires on memory pressure stalls, i.e.
       when operational latency above a configured threshold already has
       been seen. This should be taken into consideration when
       discussing whether later latency to re-aquire any released
       resources is acceptable: it's usually more important to think of
       the latencies that already happened than those coming up in
       future.

       The <b>sd_event_source_set_memory_pressure_type() </b>and
       <b>sd_event_source_set_memory_pressure_period() </b>functions can be
       used to fine-tune the PSI parameters for pressure notifications.
       The former takes either "some", "full" as second parameter, the
       latter takes threshold and period times in microseconds as
       parameters. For details about these three parameters see the PSI
       documentation. Note that these two calls must be invoked
       immediately after allocating the event source, as they must be
       configured before polling begins. Also note that these calls will
       fail if memory pressure parameterization has been passed in via
       the <i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</i>/<i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WRITE</i> environment
       variables (or in other words: configuration supplied by a service
       manager wins over internal settings).

       The <b>sd_event_trim_memory() </b>function releases various internal
       allocation caches maintained by libsystemd and then invokes
       glibc's <a href="malloc_trim.3.html">malloc_trim(3)</a>. This makes the operation executed when
       the handler function parameter of <b>sd_event_add_memory_pressure </b>is
       passed as <b>NULL </b>directly accessible for invocation at any time
       (see above). This function will log a structured log message at
       <b>LOG_DEBUG </b>level (with message ID
       f9b0be465ad540d0850ad32172d57c21) about the memory pressure
       operation.

</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, these functions return 0 or a positive integer. On
       failure, they return a negative errno-style error code.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-ENOMEM</b>
           Not enough memory to allocate an object.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
           An invalid argument has been passed.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-EHOSTDOWN</b>
           The <i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</i> variable has been set to the
           literal string /dev/null, in order to explicitly disable
           memory pressure handling.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-EBADMSG</b>
           The <i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</i> variable has been set to an
           invalid string, for example a relative rather than an
           absolute path.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-ENOTTY</b>
           The <i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</i> variable points to a regular file
           outside of the procfs or cgroupfs file systems.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-EOPNOTSUPP</b>
           No configuration via <i>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</i> has been
           specified and the local kernel does not support the PSI
           interface.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-EBUSY</b>
           This is returned by
           <b>sd_event_source_set_memory_pressure_type() </b>and
           <b>sd_event_source_set_memory_pressure_period() </b>if invoked on
           event sources at a time later than immediately after
           allocating them.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-ESTALE</b>
           The event loop is already terminated.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-ECHILD</b>
           The event loop has been created in a different process,
           library or module instance.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-EDOM</b>
           The passed event source is not a signal event source.

           Added in version 254.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
