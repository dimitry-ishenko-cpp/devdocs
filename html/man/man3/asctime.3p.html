       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       asctime, asctime_r — convert date and time to a string
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       char *asctime(const struct tm *<i>timeptr</i>);
       char *asctime_r(const struct tm *restrict <i>tm</i>, char *restrict <i>buf</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For <i>asctime</i>(): The functionality described on this reference page
       is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is
       unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C
       standard.

       The <i>asctime</i>() function shall convert the broken-down time in the
       structure pointed to by <i>timeptr</i> into a string in the form:

           Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1973\n\0

       using the equivalent of the following algorithm:

           char *asctime(const struct tm *timeptr)
           {
               static char wday_name[7][3] = {
                   "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"
               };
               static char mon_name[12][3] = {
                   "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun",
                   "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
               };
               static char result[26];

               sprintf(result, "%.3s %.3s%3d %.2d:%.2d:%.2d %d\n",
                   wday_name[timeptr-&gt;tm_wday],
                   mon_name[timeptr-&gt;tm_mon],
                   timeptr-&gt;tm_mday, timeptr-&gt;tm_hour,
                   timeptr-&gt;tm_min, timeptr-&gt;tm_sec,
                   1900 + timeptr-&gt;tm_year);
               return result;
           }

       However, the behavior is undefined if <i>timeptr</i>-&gt;<i>tm_wday</i> or
       <i>timeptr</i>-&gt;<i>tm_mon</i> are not within the normal ranges as defined in
       <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>, or if <i>timeptr</i>-&gt;<i>tm_year</i> exceeds {INT_MAX}-1990, or if
       the above algorithm would attempt to generate more than 26 bytes
       of output (including the terminating null).

       The <b>tm </b>structure is defined in the <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i> header.

       The <i>asctime</i>(), <i>ctime</i>(), <i>gmtime</i>(), and <i>localtime</i>() functions shall
       return values in one of two static objects: a broken-down time
       structure and an array of type <b>char</b>.  Execution of any of the
       functions may overwrite the information returned in either of
       these objects by any of the other functions.

       The <i>asctime</i>() function need not be thread-safe.

       The <i>asctime_r</i>() function shall convert the broken-down time in
       the structure pointed to by <i>tm</i> into a string (of the same form as
       that returned by <i>asctime</i>(), and with the same undefined behavior
       when input or output is out of range) that is placed in the user-
       supplied buffer pointed to by <i>buf</i> (which shall contain at least
       26 bytes) and then return <i>buf</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>asctime</i>() shall return a pointer to
       the string.  If the function is unsuccessful, it shall return
       NULL.

       Upon successful completion, <i>asctime_r</i>() shall return a pointer to
       a character string containing the date and time. This string is
       pointed to by the argument <i>buf</i>.  If the function is unsuccessful,
       it shall return NULL.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are included only for compatibility with older
       implementations. They have undefined behavior if the resulting
       string would be too long, so the use of these functions should be
       discouraged. On implementations that do not detect output string
       length overflow, it is possible to overflow the output buffers in
       such a way as to cause applications to fail, or possible system
       security violations. Also, these functions do not support
       localized date and time formats. To avoid these problems,
       applications should use <i>strftime</i>() to generate strings from
       broken-down times.

       Values for the broken-down time structure can be obtained by
       calling <i>gmtime</i>() or <i>localtime</i>().

       The <i>asctime_r</i>() function is thread-safe and shall return values
       in a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a static data
       area that may be overwritten by each call.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The standard developers decided to mark the <i>asctime</i>() and
       <i>asctime_r</i>() functions obsolescent even though <i>asctime</i>() is in the
       ISO C standard due to the possibility of buffer overflow. The
       ISO C standard also provides the <i>strftime</i>() function which can be
       used to avoid these problems.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions may be removed in a future version.
