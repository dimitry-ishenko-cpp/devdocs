NAME </h2>

       keyctl_watch_key - Watch for changes to a key
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;keyutils.h&gt;</b>

       <b>long keyctl_watch_key(key_serial_t </b><i>key</i><b>,</b>
                             <b>int </b><i>watch_queue_fd</i>
                             <b>int </b><i>watch_id</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>keyctl_watch_key</b>() sets or removes a watch on <i>key</i>.

       <i>watch_id</i> specifies the ID for a watch that will be included in
       notification messages.  It can be between 0 and 255 to add a key;
       it should be -1 to remove a key.

       <i>watch_queue_fd</i> is a file descriptor attached to a watch_queue
       device instance.  Multiple openings of a device provide separate
       instances.  Each device instance can only have one watch on any
       particular key.

   <b>Notification Record</b>
       Key-specific notification messages that the kernel emits into the
       buffer have the following format:

           struct key_notification {
                struct watch_notification watch;
                __u32     key_id;
                __u32     aux;
           };

       The <i>watch.type</i> field will be set to <b>WATCH_TYPE_KEY_NOTIFY </b>and the
       <i>watch.subtype</i> field will contain one of the following constants,
       indicating the event that occurred and the watch_id passed to
       keyctl_watch_key() will be placed in <i>watch.info</i> in the ID field.
       The following events are defined:

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_INSTANTIATED</b>
              This indicates that a watched key got instantiated or
              negatively instantiated.  <i>key_id</i> indicates the key that
              was instantiated and <i>aux</i> is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_UPDATED</b>
              This indicates that a watched key got updated or
              instantiated by update.  <i>key_id</i> indicates the key that was
              updated and <i>aux</i> is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_LINKED</b>
              This indicates that a key got linked into a watched
              keyring.  <i>key_id</i> indicates the keyring that was modified
              <i>aux</i> indicates the key that was added.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_UNLINKED</b>
              This indicates that a key got unlinked from a watched
              keyring.  <i>key_id</i> indicates the keyring that was modified
              <i>aux</i> indicates the key that was removed.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_CLEARED</b>
              This indicates that a watched keyring got cleared.  <i>key_id</i>
              indicates the keyring that was cleared and <i>aux</i> is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_REVOKED</b>
              This indicates that a watched key got revoked.  <i>key_id</i>
              indicates the key that was revoked and <i>aux</i> is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_INVALIDATED</b>
              This indicates that a watched key got invalidated.  <i>key_id</i>
              indicates the key that was invalidated and <i>aux</i> is unused.

       <b>NOTIFY_KEY_SETATTR</b>
              This indicates that a watched key had its attributes
              (owner, group, permissions, timeout) modified.  <i>key_id</i>
              indicates the key that was modified and <i>aux</i> is unused.

   <b>Removal Notification</b>
       When a watched key is garbage collected, all of its watches are
       automatically destroyed and a notification is delivered to each
       watcher.  This will normally be an extended notification of the
       form:

           struct watch_notification_removal {
                struct watch_notification watch;
                __u64     id;
           };

       The <i>watch.type</i> field will be set to <b>WATCH_TYPE_META </b>and the
       <i>watch.subtype</i> field will contain <b>WATCH_META_REMOVAL_NOTIFICATION</b>.
       If the extended notification is given, then the length will be 2
       units, otherwise it will be 1 and only the header will be
       present.

       The watch_id passed to <i>keyctl_watch_key</i>() will be placed in
       <i>watch.info</i> in the ID field.

       If the extension is present, <i>id</i> will be set to the ID of the
       destroyed key.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success <b>keyctl_watch_key</b>() returns <b>0 .  </b>On error, the value <b>-1</b>
       will be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> will have been set to an appropriate
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ENOKEY </b>The specified key does not exist.

       <b>EKEYEXPIRED</b>
              The specified key has expired.

       <b>EKEYREVOKED</b>
              The specified key has been revoked.

       <b>EACCES </b>The named key exists, but does not grant <b>view </b>permission
              to the calling process.

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The specified key already has a watch on it for that
              device instance (add only).

       <b>EBADSLT</b>
              The specified key doesn't have a watch on it (removal
              only).
