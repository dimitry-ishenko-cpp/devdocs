PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       endhostent, gethostent, sethostent — network host database
       functions
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

       void endhostent(void);
       struct hostent *gethostent(void);
       void sethostent(int <i>stayopen</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall retrieve information about hosts. This
       information is considered to be stored in a database that can be
       accessed sequentially or randomly. The implementation of this
       database is unspecified.

       <b>Note:  </b>In many cases this database is implemented by the Domain
              Name System, as documented in RFC 1034, RFC 1035, and
              RFC 1886.

       The <i>sethostent</i>() function shall open a connection to the database
       and set the next entry for retrieval to the first entry in the
       database. If the <i>stayopen</i> argument is non-zero, the connection
       shall not be closed by a call to <i>gethostent</i>(), and the
       implementation may maintain an open file descriptor.

       The <i>gethostent</i>() function shall read the next entry in the
       database, opening and closing a connection to the database as
       necessary.

       Entries shall be returned in <b>hostent </b>structures.

       The <i>endhostent</i>() function shall close the connection to the
       database, releasing any open file descriptor.

       These functions need not be thread-safe.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>gethostent</i>() function shall
       return a pointer to a <b>hostent </b>structure if the requested entry
       was found, and a null pointer if the end of the database was
       reached or the requested entry was not found.

       The application shall not modify the structure to which the
       return value points, nor any storage areas pointed to by pointers
       within the structure. The returned pointer, and pointers within
       the structure, might be invalidated or the structure or the
       storage areas might be overwritten by a subsequent call to
       <i>gethostent</i>().  The returned pointer, and pointers within the
       structure, might also be invalidated if the calling thread is
       terminated.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
