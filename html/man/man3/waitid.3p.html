NAME </h2>
<pre>
       waitid — wait for a child process to change state
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;

       int waitid(idtype_t <i>idtype</i>, id_t <i>id</i>, siginfo_t *<i>infop</i>, int <i>options</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>waitid</i>() function shall obtain status information (see
       <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Status Information</i>) pertaining to termination,
       stop, and/or continue events in one of the caller's child
       processes.

       The <i>waitid</i>() function shall cause the calling thread to become
       blocked until an error occurs or status information becomes
       available to the calling thread that satisfies all of the
       following properties (``matching status information''):

        *  The status information is from one of the child processes in
           the set of child processes specified by the <i>idtype</i> and <i>id</i>
           arguments.

        *  The state change in the status information matches one of the
           state change flags set in the <i>options</i> argument.

       If matching status information is available prior to the call to
       <i>waitid</i>(), return shall be immediate. If matching status
       information is available for two or more child processes, the
       order in which their status is reported is unspecified.

       As described in <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Status Information</i>, the <i>waitid</i>()
       function consumes the status information it obtains unless the
       WNOWAIT flag is set in the <i>options</i> argument.

       The behavior when multiple threads are blocked in <i>wait</i>(),
       <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>() is described in <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Status</i>
       <i>Information</i>.

       The <i>waitid</i>() function shall record the obtained status
       information in the structure pointed to by <i>infop</i>.  The fields of
       the structure pointed to by <i>infop</i> shall be filled in as described
       under ``Pointer to a Function'' in <i>Section 2.4.3</i>, <i>Signal Actions</i>.

       The <i>idtype</i> and <i>id</i> arguments are used to specify which children
       <i>waitid</i>() waits for.

       If <i>idtype</i> is P_PID, <i>waitid</i>() shall wait for the child with a
       process ID equal to (<b>pid_t</b>)<i>id</i>.

       If <i>idtype</i> is P_PGID, <i>waitid</i>() shall wait for any child with a
       process group ID equal to (<b>pid_t</b>)<i>id</i>.

       If <i>idtype</i> is P_ALL, <i>waitid</i>() shall wait for any children and <i>id</i>
       is ignored.

       The <i>options</i> argument is used to specify which state changes
       <i>waitid</i>() shall wait for. It is formed by OR'ing together the
       following flags:

       WCONTINUED  Status shall be returned for any continued child
                   process whose status either has not been reported
                   since it continued from a job control stop or has
                   been reported only by calls to <i>waitid</i>() with the
                   WNOWAIT flag set.

       WEXITED     Wait for processes that have exited.

       WNOHANG     Do not hang if no status is available; return
                   immediately.

       WNOWAIT     Keep the process whose status is returned in <i>infop</i> in
                   a waitable state. This shall not affect the state of
                   the process; the process may be waited for again
                   after this call completes.

       WSTOPPED    Status shall be returned for any child that has
                   stopped upon receipt of a signal, and whose status
                   either has not been reported since it stopped or has
                   been reported only by calls to <i>waitid</i>() with the
                   WNOWAIT flag set.

       Applications shall specify at least one of the flags WEXITED,
       WSTOPPED, or WCONTINUED to be OR'ed in with the <i>options</i> argument.

       The application shall ensure that the <i>infop</i> argument points to a
       <b>siginfo_t </b>structure. If <i>waitid</i>() returns because a child process
       was found that satisfied the conditions indicated by the
       arguments <i>idtype</i> and <i>options</i>, then the structure pointed to by
       <i>infop</i> shall be filled in by the system with the status of the
       process; the <i>si_signo</i> member shall be set equal to SIGCHLD.  If
       <i>waitid</i>() returns because WNOHANG was specified and status is not
       available for any process specified by <i>idtype</i> and <i>id</i>, then the
       <i>si_signo</i> and <i>si_pid</i> members of the structure pointed to by <i>infop</i>
       shall be set to zero and the values of other members of the
       structure are unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If WNOHANG was specified and status is not available for any
       process specified by <i>idtype</i> and <i>id</i>, 0 shall be returned. If
       <i>waitid</i>() returns due to the change of state of one of its
       children, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned
       and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>waitid</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ECHILD </b>The calling process has no existing unwaited-for child
              processes.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>waitid</i>() function was interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EINVAL </b>An invalid value was specified for <i>options</i>, or <i>idtype</i> and
              <i>id</i> specify an invalid set of processes.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Calls to <i>waitid</i>() with <i>idtype</i> equal to P_ALL will collect
       information about any child process. This may result in
       interactions with other interfaces that may be waiting for their
       own children (such as by use of <i>system</i>()).  For this reason it is
       recommended that portable applications not use <i>waitid</i>() with
       idtype of P_ALL. See also APPLICATION USAGE for <i>wait</i>().

       As specified in <i>Consequences of Process Termination</i>, if the
       calling process has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or has SIGCHLD set to
       SIG_IGN, then the termination of a child process will not cause
       status information to become available to a thread blocked in
       <i>wait</i>(), <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>().  Thus, a thread blocked in one of
       the wait functions will remain blocked unless some other
       condition causes the thread to resume execution (such as an
       <b>[ECHILD] </b>failure due to no remaining children in the set of
       waited-for children).
