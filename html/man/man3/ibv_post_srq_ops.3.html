DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ibv_post_srq_ops() </b>performs series of offload configuration
       manipulations on special types of SRQ <i>srq</i>. Currenlty it is used
       to configure tag matching SRQ. Series of configuration operations
       defined by linked lists of struct ibv_ops_wr elements starting
       from <i>wr.</i>

       struct ibv_ops_wr {
               uint64_t                wr_id;   /* User defined WR ID */
               /* Pointer to next WR in list, NULL if last WR */
               struct ibv_ops_wr      *next;
               enum ibv_ops_wr_opcode  opcode;  /* From enum ibv_ops_wr_opcode */
               int                     flags;   /* From enum ibv_ops_flags */
               struct {
                       /* Number of unexpected messages
                        * handled by SW */
                       uint32_t unexpected_cnt;
                       /* Input parameter for the DEL opcode
                        * and output parameter for the ADD opcode */
                       uint32_t handle;
                       struct {
                               uint64_t                recv_wr_id;   /* User defined WR ID for TM_RECV */
                               struct ibv_sge         *sg_list; /* Pointer to the s/g array */
                               int                     num_sge; /* Size of the s/g array */
                               uint64_t                tag;
                               uint64_t                mask;    /* Incoming message considered matching if
                                                                   TMH.tag &amp; entry.mask == entry.tag */
                       } add;
               } tm;
       };

       First part of struct ibv_ops_wr retains ibv_send_wr notion.
       Opcode defines operation to perform. Currently supported
       IBV_WR_TAG_ADD, IBV_WR_TAG_DEL and IBV_WR_TAG_SYNC values. See
       below for detailed description.

       To allow reliable data delivery TM SRQ maintains special low
       level synchronization primitive - phase synchronization. Receive
       side message handling comprises two concurrent activities -
       posting tagged buffers by SW and receiving incoming messages by
       HW. This process considered coherent only if all unexpected
       messages received by HW is completely processed in SW. To pass to
       hardware number of processed unexpected messages unexpected_cnt
       field should be used and IBV_OPS_TM_SYNC flag should be set.

       To request WC for tag list operations IBV_OPS_SIGNALED flags
       should be passed. In this case WC will be generated on TM SRQ's
       CQ, provided wr_id will identify WC.

       Opcode IBV_WR_TAG_ADD used to add tag entry to tag matching list.
       Tag entry consists of SGE list, tag &amp; mask (matching parameters),
       user specified opaque wr_id (passed via recv_wr_id field) and
       uniquely identified by handle (returned by driver).  Size of tag
       matching list is limited by max_num_tags.  SGE list size is
       limited by max_sge.

       Opcode IBV_WR_TAG_DEL removes previously added tag entry.  Field
       handle should be set to value returned by previously performed
       IBV_WR_TAG_ADD operation.  Operation may fail due to concurrent
       tag consumption - in this case IBV_WC_TM_ERR status will be
       returned in WC.

       Opcode IBV_WR_TAG_SYNC may be used if no changes to matching list
       required, just to updated unexpected messages counter.

       IBV_WC_TM_SYNC_REQ flag returned in list operation WC shows that
       counter synchronization required. This flag also may be returned
       by unexpected receive WC, asking for IBV_WR_TAG_SYNC operation to
       keep TM coherence consistency.
