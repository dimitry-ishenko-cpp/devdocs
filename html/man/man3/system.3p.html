       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       system — issue a command
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int system(const char *<i>command</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       If <i>command</i> is a null pointer, the <i>system</i>() function shall
       determine whether the host environment has a command processor.
       If <i>command</i> is not a null pointer, the <i>system</i>() function shall
       pass the string pointed to by <i>command</i> to that command processor
       to be executed in an implementation-defined manner; this might
       then cause the program calling <i>system</i>() to behave in a non-
       conforming manner or to terminate.

       The <i>system</i>() function shall behave as if a child process were
       created using <i>fork</i>(), and the child process invoked the <i>sh</i>
       utility using <i>execl</i>() as follows:

           execl(&lt;<i>shell path</i>&gt;, "sh", "-c", <i>command</i>, (char *)0);

       where &lt;<i>shell path</i>&gt; is an unspecified pathname for the <i>sh</i> utility.
       It is unspecified whether the handlers registered with
       <i>pthread_atfork</i>() are called as part of the creation of the child
       process.

       The <i>system</i>() function shall ignore the SIGINT and SIGQUIT
       signals, and shall block the SIGCHLD signal, while waiting for
       the command to terminate. If this might cause the application to
       miss a signal that would have killed it, then the application
       should examine the return value from <i>system</i>() and take whatever
       action is appropriate to the application if the command
       terminated due to receipt of a signal.

       The <i>system</i>() function shall not affect the termination status of
       any child of the calling processes other than the process or
       processes it itself creates.

       The <i>system</i>() function shall not return until the child process
       has terminated.

       The <i>system</i>() function need not be thread-safe.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>command</i> is a null pointer, <i>system</i>() shall return non-zero to
       indicate that a command processor is available, or zero if none
       is available.  The <i>system</i>() function shall always return non-zero
       when <i>command</i> is NULL.

       If <i>command</i> is not a null pointer, <i>system</i>() shall return the
       termination status of the command language interpreter in the
       format specified by <i>waitpid</i>().  The termination status shall be
       as defined for the <i>sh</i> utility; otherwise, the termination status
       is unspecified. If some error prevents the command language
       interpreter from executing after the child process is created,
       the return value from <i>system</i>() shall be as if the command
       language interpreter had terminated using <i>exit</i>(127) or
       <i>_exit</i>(127).  If a child process cannot be created, or if the
       termination status for the command language interpreter cannot be
       obtained, <i>system</i>() shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>system</i>() function may set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> values as described by
       <a href="fork.3p.html">fork(3p)</a>.

       In addition, <i>system</i>() may fail if:

       <b>ECHILD </b>The status of the child process created by <i>system</i>() is no
              longer available.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the return value of <i>system</i>() is not -1, its value can be
       decoded through the use of the macros described in <i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i>.
       For convenience, these macros are also provided in <i>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</i>.

       Note that, while <i>system</i>() must ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT and
       block SIGCHLD while waiting for the child to terminate, the
       handling of signals in the executed command is as specified by
       <i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i>.  For example, if SIGINT is being caught or is
       set to SIG_DFL when <i>system</i>() is called, then the child is started
       with SIGINT handling set to SIG_DFL.

       Ignoring SIGINT and SIGQUIT in the parent process prevents
       coordination problems (two processes reading from the same
       terminal, for example) when the executed command ignores or
       catches one of the signals. It is also usually the correct action
       when the user has given a command to the application to be
       executed synchronously (as in the <b>'!'  </b>command in many
       interactive applications). In either case, the signal should be
       delivered only to the child process, not to the application
       itself. There is one situation where ignoring the signals might
       have less than the desired effect. This is when the application
       uses <i>system</i>() to perform some task invisible to the user. If the
       user typed the interrupt character (<b>"^C"</b>, for example) while
       <i>system</i>() is being used in this way, one would expect the
       application to be killed, but only the executed command is
       killed. Applications that use <i>system</i>() in this way should
       carefully check the return status from <i>system</i>() to see if the
       executed command was successful, and should take appropriate
       action when the command fails.

       Blocking SIGCHLD while waiting for the child to terminate
       prevents the application from catching the signal and obtaining
       status from <i>system</i>()'s child process before <i>system</i>() can get the
       status itself.

       The context in which the utility is ultimately executed may
       differ from that in which <i>system</i>() was called. For example, file
       descriptors that have the FD_CLOEXEC flag set are closed, and the
       process ID and parent process ID are different. Also, if the
       executed utility changes its environment variables or its current
       working directory, that change is not reflected in the caller's
       context.

       There is no defined way for an application to find the specific
       path for the shell. However, <i>confstr</i>() can provide a value for
       <i>PATH</i> that is guaranteed to find the <i>sh</i> utility.

       Using the <i>system</i>() function in more than one thread in a process
       or when the SIGCHLD signal is being manipulated by more than one
       thread in a process may produce unexpected results.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>system</i>() function should not be used by programs that have
       set user (or group) ID privileges. The <i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i> family of
       functions (except <i>execlp</i>() and <i>execvp</i>()), should be used instead.
       This prevents any unforeseen manipulation of the environment of
       the user that could cause execution of commands not anticipated
       by the calling program.

       There are three levels of specification for the <i>system</i>()
       function. The ISO C standard gives the most basic. It requires
       that the function exists, and defines a way for an application to
       query whether a command language interpreter exists. It says
       nothing about the command language or the environment in which
       the command is interpreted.

       POSIX.1‐2008 places additional restrictions on <i>system</i>().  It
       requires that if there is a command language interpreter, the
       environment must be as specified by <i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i>.  This
       ensures, for example, that close-on-<i>exec</i> works, that file locks
       are not inherited, and that the process ID is different. It also
       specifies the return value from <i>system</i>() when the command line
       can be run, thus giving the application some information about
       the command's completion status.

       Finally, POSIX.1‐2008 requires the command to be interpreted as
       in the shell command language defined in the Shell and Utilities
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       Note that, <i>system</i>(NULL) is required to return non-zero,
       indicating that there is a command language interpreter. At first
       glance, this would seem to conflict with the ISO C standard which
       allows <i>system</i>(NULL) to return zero. There is no conflict,
       however. A system must have a command language interpreter, and
       is non-conforming if none is present.  It is therefore
       permissible for the <i>system</i>() function on such a system to
       implement the behavior specified by the ISO C standard as long as
       it is understood that the implementation does not conform to
       POSIX.1‐2008 if <i>system</i>(NULL) returns zero.

       It was explicitly decided that when <i>command</i> is NULL, <i>system</i>()
       should not be required to check to make sure that the command
       language interpreter actually exists with the correct mode, that
       there are enough processes to execute it, and so on. The call
       <i>system</i>(NULL) could, theoretically, check for such problems as too
       many existing child processes, and return zero. However, it would
       be inappropriate to return zero due to such a (presumably)
       transient condition. If some condition exists that is not under
       the control of this application and that would cause any <i>system</i>()
       call to fail, that system has been rendered non-conforming.

       Early drafts required, or allowed, <i>system</i>() to return with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       set to <b>[EINTR] </b>if it was interrupted with a signal. This error
       return was removed, and a requirement that <i>system</i>() not return
       until the child has terminated was added. This means that if a
       <i>waitpid</i>() call in <i>system</i>() exits with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b>,
       <i>system</i>() must reissue the <i>waitpid</i>().  This change was made for
       two reasons:

        1. There is no way for an application to clean up if <i>system</i>()
           returns <b>[EINTR]</b>, short of calling <i>wait</i>(), and that could have
           the undesirable effect of returning the status of children
           other than the one started by <i>system</i>().

        2. While it might require a change in some historical
           implementations, those implementations already have to be
           changed because they use <i>wait</i>() instead of <i>waitpid</i>().

       Note that if the application is catching SIGCHLD signals, it will
       receive such a signal before a successful <i>system</i>() call returns.

       To conform to POSIX.1‐2008, <i>system</i>() must use <i>waitpid</i>(), or some
       similar function, instead of <i>wait</i>().

       The following code sample illustrates how <i>system</i>() might be
       implemented on an implementation conforming to POSIX.1‐2008.

           #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
           int system(const char *cmd)
           {
               int stat;
               pid_t pid;
               struct sigaction sa, savintr, savequit;
               sigset_t saveblock;
               if (cmd == NULL)
                   return(1);
               sa.sa_handler = SIG_IGN;
               sigemptyset(&amp;sa.sa_mask);
               sa.sa_flags = 0;
               sigemptyset(&amp;savintr.sa_mask);
               sigemptyset(&amp;savequit.sa_mask);
               sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;sa, &amp;savintr);
               sigaction(SIGQUIT, &amp;sa, &amp;savequit);
               sigaddset(&amp;sa.sa_mask, SIGCHLD);
               sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &amp;sa.sa_mask, &amp;saveblock);
               if ((pid = fork()) == 0) {
                   sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;savintr, (struct sigaction *)0);
                   sigaction(SIGQUIT, &amp;savequit, (struct sigaction *)0);
                   sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;saveblock, (sigset_t *)0);
                   execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", cmd, (char *)0);
                   _exit(127);
               }
               if (pid == -1) {
                   stat = -1; /* errno comes from fork() */
               } else {
                   while (waitpid(pid, &amp;stat, 0) == -1) {
                       if (errno != EINTR){
                           stat = -1;
                           break;
                       }
                   }
               }
               sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;savintr, (struct sigaction *)0);
               sigaction(SIGQUIT, &amp;savequit, (struct sigaction *)0);
               sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;saveblock, (sigset_t *)0);
               return(stat);
           }

       Note that, while a particular implementation of <i>system</i>() (such as
       the one above) can assume a particular path for the shell, such a
       path is not necessarily valid on another system. The above
       example is not portable, and is not intended to be.

       Note also that the above example implementation is not thread-
       safe.  Implementations can provide a thread-safe <i>system</i>()
       function, but doing so involves complications such as how to
       restore the signal dispositions for SIGINT and SIGQUIT correctly
       if there are overlapping calls, and how to deal with
       cancellation. The example above would not restore the signal
       dispositions and would leak a process ID if cancelled. This does
       not matter for a non-thread-safe implementation since canceling a
       non-thread-safe function results in undefined behavior (see
       <i>Section 2.9.5.2</i>, <i>Cancellation Points</i>).  To avoid leaking a
       process ID, a thread-safe implementation would need to terminate
       the child process when acting on a cancellation.

       One reviewer suggested that an implementation of <i>system</i>() might
       want to use an environment variable such as <i>SHELL</i> to determine
       which command interpreter to use. The supposed implementation
       would use the default command interpreter if the one specified by
       the environment variable was not available. This would allow a
       user, when using an application that prompts for command lines to
       be processed using <i>system</i>(), to specify a different command
       interpreter. Such an implementation is discouraged. If the
       alternate command interpreter did not follow the command line
       syntax specified in the Shell and Utilities volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, then changing <i>SHELL</i> would render <i>system</i>() non-
       conforming. This would affect applications that expected the
       specified behavior from <i>system</i>(), and since the Shell and
       Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not mention that <i>SHELL</i>
       affects <i>system</i>(), the application would not know that it needed
       to unset <i>SHELL</i>.
