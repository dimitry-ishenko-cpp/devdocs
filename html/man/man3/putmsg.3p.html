       int putmsg(int <i>fildes</i>, const struct strbuf *<i>ctlptr</i>,
           const struct strbuf *<i>dataptr</i>, int <i>flags</i>);

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>putmsg</i>() function shall create a message from a process
       buffer(s) and send the message to a STREAMS file. The message may
       contain either a data part, a control part, or both. The data and
       control parts are distinguished by placement in separate buffers,
       as described below. The semantics of each part are defined by the
       STREAMS module that receives the message.

       The <i>putpmsg</i>() function is equivalent to <i>putmsg</i>(), except that the
       process can send messages in different priority bands.  Except
       where noted, all requirements on <i>putmsg</i>() also pertain to
       <i>putpmsg</i>().

       The <i>fildes</i> argument specifies a file descriptor referencing an
       open STREAM. The <i>ctlptr</i> and <i>dataptr</i> arguments each point to a
       <b>strbuf </b>structure.

       The <i>ctlptr</i> argument points to the structure describing the
       control part, if any, to be included in the message. The <i>buf</i>
       member in the <b>strbuf </b>structure points to the buffer where the
       control information resides, and the <i>len</i> member indicates the
       number of bytes to be sent. The <i>maxlen</i> member is not used by
       <i>putmsg</i>().  In a similar manner, the argument <i>dataptr</i> specifies
       the data, if any, to be included in the message. The <i>flags</i>
       argument indicates what type of message should be sent and is
       described further below.

       To send the data part of a message, the application shall ensure
       that <i>dataptr</i> is not a null pointer and the <i>len</i> member of <i>dataptr</i>
       is 0 or greater. To send the control part of a message, the
       application shall ensure that the corresponding values are set
       for <i>ctlptr</i>.  No data (control) part shall be sent if either
       <i>dataptr</i>(<i>ctlptr</i>) is a null pointer or the <i>len</i> member of
       <i>dataptr</i>(<i>ctlptr</i>) is set to -1.

       For <i>putmsg</i>(), if a control part is specified and <i>flags</i> is set to
       RS_HIPRI, a high priority message shall be sent. If no control
       part is specified, and <i>flags</i> is set to RS_HIPRI, <i>putmsg</i>() shall
       fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINVAL]</b>.  If <i>flags</i> is set to 0, a normal
       message (priority band equal to 0) shall be sent.  If a control
       part and data part are not specified and <i>flags</i> is set to 0, no
       message shall be sent and 0 shall be returned.

       For <i>putpmsg</i>(), the flags are different. The <i>flags</i> argument is a
       bitmask with the following mutually-exclusive flags defined:
       MSG_HIPRI and MSG_BAND. If <i>flags</i> is set to 0, <i>putpmsg</i>() shall
       fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINVAL]</b>.  If a control part is specified
       and <i>flags</i> is set to MSG_HIPRI and <i>band</i> is set to 0, a high-
       priority message shall be sent. If <i>flags</i> is set to MSG_HIPRI and
       either no control part is specified or <i>band</i> is set to a non-zero
       value, <i>putpmsg</i>() shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINVAL]</b>.  If <i>flags</i>
       is set to MSG_BAND, then a message shall be sent in the priority
       band specified by <i>band</i>.  If a control part and data part are not
       specified and <i>flags</i> is set to MSG_BAND, no message shall be sent
       and 0 shall be returned.

       The <i>putmsg</i>() function shall block if the STREAM write queue is
       full due to internal flow control conditions, with the following
       exceptions:

        *  For high-priority messages, <i>putmsg</i>() shall not block on this
           condition and continues processing the message.

        *  For other messages, <i>putmsg</i>() shall not block but shall fail
           when the write queue is full and O_NONBLOCK is set.

       The <i>putmsg</i>() function shall also block, unless prevented by lack
       of internal resources, while waiting for the availability of
       message blocks in the STREAM, regardless of priority or whether
       O_NONBLOCK has been specified. No partial message shall be sent.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>putmsg</i>() and <i>putpmsg</i>() shall return
       0; otherwise, they shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>putmsg</i>() and <i>putpmsg</i>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>A non-priority message was specified, the O_NONBLOCK flag
              is set, and the STREAM write queue is full due to internal
              flow control conditions; or buffers could not be allocated
              for the message that was to be created.

       <b>EBADF  </b><i>fildes</i> is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during <i>putmsg</i>().

       <b>EINVAL </b>An undefined value is specified in <i>flags</i>, or <i>flags</i> is set
              to RS_HIPRI or MSG_HIPRI and no control part is supplied,
              or the STREAM or multiplexer referenced by <i>fildes</i> is
              linked (directly or indirectly) downstream from a
              multiplexer, or <i>flags</i> is set to MSG_HIPRI and <i>band</i> is non-
              zero (for <i>putpmsg</i>() only).

       <b>ENOSR  </b>Buffers could not be allocated for the message that was to
              be created due to insufficient STREAMS memory resources.

       <b>ENOSTR </b>A STREAM is not associated with <i>fildes</i>.

       <b>ENXIO  </b>A hangup condition was generated downstream for the
              specified STREAM.

       <b>EPIPE </b>or <b>EIO</b>
              The <i>fildes</i> argument refers to a STREAMS-based pipe and the
              other end of the pipe is closed. A SIGPIPE signal is
              generated for the calling thread.

       <b>ERANGE </b>The size of the data part of the message does not fall
              within the range specified by the maximum and minimum
              packet sizes of the topmost STREAM module. This value is
              also returned if the control part of the message is larger
              than the maximum configured size of the control part of a
              message, or if the data part of a message is larger than
              the maximum configured size of the data part of a message.

       In addition, <i>putmsg</i>() and <i>putpmsg</i>() shall fail if the STREAM head
       had processed an asynchronous error before the call. In this
       case, the value of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> does not reflect the result of <i>putmsg</i>()
       or <i>putpmsg</i>(), but reflects the prior error.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Sending a High-Priority Message</b>
       The value of <i>fd</i> is assumed to refer to an open STREAMS file. This
       call to <i>putmsg</i>() does the following:

        1. Creates a high-priority message with a control part and a
           data part, using the buffers pointed to by <i>ctrlbuf</i> and
           <i>databuf</i>, respectively.

        2. Sends the message to the STREAMS file identified by <i>fd</i>.

           #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;
           #include &lt;string.h&gt;
           ...
           int fd;
           char *ctrlbuf = "This is the control part";
           char *databuf = "This is the data part";
           struct strbuf ctrl;
           struct strbuf data;
           int ret;

           ctrl.buf = ctrlbuf;
           ctrl.len = strlen(ctrlbuf);

           data.buf = databuf;
           data.len = strlen(databuf);

           ret = putmsg(fd, &amp;ctrl, &amp;data, MSG_HIPRI);

   <b>Using putpmsg()</b>
       This example has the same effect as the previous example. In this
       example, however, the <i>putpmsg</i>() function creates and sends the
       message to the STREAMS file.

           #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;
           #include &lt;string.h&gt;
           ...
           int fd;
           char *ctrlbuf = "This is the control part";
           char *databuf = "This is the data part";
           struct strbuf ctrl;
           struct strbuf data;
           int ret;

           ctrl.buf = ctrlbuf;
           ctrl.len = strlen(ctrlbuf);

           data.buf = databuf;
           data.len = strlen(databuf);

           ret = putpmsg(fd, &amp;ctrl, &amp;data, 0, MSG_HIPRI);
