CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is a cut-down version of <b>__pmLogRead</b>(3) from libpcp, that
       reads the next physical record from the volume <i>vol</i> of the archive
       identified by <i>acp</i>.

       If <i>vol</i> is <b>PM_LOG_VOL_META </b>then the next metadata record is read,
       otherwise the next record from the data volume <i>vol</i> is read.

       The record is returned in <i>rbuf</i> which is allocated here; so the
       caller will have to call <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a> when it is no longer needed.

       The record header length and trailer length is checked, but
       otherwise <i>rbuf</i> is not processed, and in particular the record
       remains in network byte-order.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS AND RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       The return value is 0 if all is well, else PM_ERR_EOL for end of
       file, else some other error code less than zero.
</pre> <h2>
