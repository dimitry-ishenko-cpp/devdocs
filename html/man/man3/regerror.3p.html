<pre>
       These functions interpret <i>basic</i> and <i>extended</i> regular expressions
       as described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       <i>Chapter 9</i>, <i>Regular Expressions</i>.

       The <b>regex_t </b>structure is defined in <i>&lt;regex.h&gt;</i> and contains at

       The <i>regcomp</i>() function shall compile the regular expression
       contained in the string pointed to by the <i>pattern</i> argument and
       place the results in the structure pointed to by <i>preg</i>.  The
       <i>cflags</i> argument is the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of
       the following flags, which are defined in the <i>&lt;regex.h&gt;</i> header:

       REG_EXTENDED  Use Extended Regular Expressions.

       REG_ICASE     Ignore case in match (see the Base Definitions
                     volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 9</i>, <i>Regular</i>
                     <i>Expressions</i>).

       REG_NOSUB     Report only success/fail in <i>regexec</i>().

       REG_NEWLINE   Change the handling of &lt;newline&gt; characters, as
                     described in the text.

       The default regular expression type for <i>pattern</i> is a Basic
       Regular Expression. The application can specify Extended Regular
       Expressions using the REG_EXTENDED <i>cflags</i> flag.

       If the REG_NOSUB flag was not set in <i>cflags</i>, then <i>regcomp</i>() shall
       set <i>re_nsub</i> to the number of parenthesized subexpressions
       (delimited by <b>"\(\)" </b>in basic regular expressions or <b>"()" </b>in
       extended regular expressions) found in <i>pattern</i>.

       The <i>regexec</i>() function compares the null-terminated string
       specified by <i>string</i> with the compiled regular expression <i>preg</i>
       initialized by a previous call to <i>regcomp</i>().  If it finds a
       match, <i>regexec</i>() shall return 0; otherwise, it shall return non-
       zero indicating either no match or an error. The <i>eflags</i> argument
       is the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following
       flags, which are defined in the <i>&lt;regex.h&gt;</i> header:

       REG_NOTBOL    The first character of the string pointed to by
                     <i>string</i> is not the beginning of the line. Therefore,
                     the &lt;circumflex&gt; character (<b>'^'</b>), when taken as a
                     special character, shall not match the beginning of
                     <i>string</i>.

       REG_NOTEOL    The last character of the string pointed to by
                     <i>string</i> is not the end of the line. Therefore, the
                     &lt;dollar-sign&gt; (<b>'$'</b>), when taken as a special
                     character, shall not match the end of <i>string</i>.

       If <i>nmatch</i> is 0 or REG_NOSUB was set in the <i>cflags</i> argument to
       <i>regcomp</i>(), then <i>regexec</i>() shall ignore the <i>pmatch</i> argument.
       Otherwise, the application shall ensure that the <i>pmatch</i> argument
       points to an array with at least <i>nmatch</i> elements, and <i>regexec</i>()
       shall fill in the elements of that array with offsets of the
       substrings of <i>string</i> that correspond to the parenthesized
       subexpressions of <i>pattern</i>: <i>pmatch</i>[<i>i</i>].<i>rm_so</i> shall be the byte
       offset of the beginning and <i>pmatch</i>[<i>i</i>].<i>rm_eo</i> shall be one greater
       than the byte offset of the end of substring <i>i</i>.  (Subexpression <i>i</i>
       begins at the <i>i</i>th matched open parenthesis, counting from 1.)
       Offsets in <i>pmatch</i>[0] identify the substring that corresponds to
       the entire regular expression. Unused elements of <i>pmatch</i> up to
       <i>pmatch</i>[<i>nmatch</i>-1] shall be filled with -1. If there are more than
       <i>nmatch</i> subexpressions in <i>pattern</i> (<i>pattern</i> itself counts as a
       subexpression), then <i>regexec</i>() shall still do the match, but
       shall record only the first <i>nmatch</i> substrings.

       When matching a basic or extended regular expression, any given
       parenthesized subexpression of <i>pattern</i> might participate in the
       match of several different substrings of <i>string</i>, or it might not
       match any substring even though the pattern as a whole did match.
       The following rules shall be used to determine which substrings
       to report in <i>pmatch</i> when matching regular expressions:

        1. If subexpression <i>i</i> in a regular expression is not contained
           within another subexpression, and it participated in the
           match several times, then the byte offsets in <i>pmatch</i>[<i>i</i>] shall
           delimit the last such match.

        2. If subexpression <i>i</i> is not contained within another
           subexpression, and it did not participate in an otherwise
           successful match, the byte offsets in <i>pmatch</i>[<i>i</i>] shall be -1.
           A subexpression does not participate in the match when:

           <b>'*' </b>or <b>"\{\}" </b>appears immediately after the subexpression in
           a basic regular expression, or <b>'*'</b>, <b>'?'</b>, or <b>"{}" </b>appears
           immediately after the subexpression in an extended regular
           expression, and the subexpression did not match (matched 0
           times)

           or:

                  <b>'|' </b>is used in an extended regular expression to
                  select this subexpression or another, and the other
                  subexpression matched.

        3. If subexpression <i>i</i> is contained within another subexpression
           <i>j</i>, and <i>i</i> is not contained within any other subexpression that
           is contained within <i>j</i>, and a match of subexpression <i>j</i> is
           reported in <i>pmatch</i>[<i>j</i>], then the match or non-match of
           subexpression <i>i</i> reported in <i>pmatch</i>[<i>i</i>] shall be as described
           in 1. and 2. above, but within the substring reported in
           <i>pmatch</i>[<i>j</i>] rather than the whole string. The offsets in
           <i>pmatch</i>[<i>i</i>] are still relative to the start of <i>string</i>.

        4. If subexpression <i>i</i> is contained in subexpression <i>j</i>, and the
           byte offsets in <i>pmatch</i>[<i>j</i>] are -1, then the pointers in
           <i>pmatch</i>[<i>i</i>] shall also be -1.

        5. If subexpression <i>i</i> matched a zero-length string, then both
           byte offsets in <i>pmatch</i>[<i>i</i>] shall be the byte offset of the
           character or null terminator immediately following the zero-
           length string.

       If, when <i>regexec</i>() is called, the locale is different from when
       the regular expression was compiled, the result is undefined.

       If REG_NEWLINE is not set in <i>cflags</i>, then a &lt;newline&gt; in <i>pattern</i>
       or <i>string</i> shall be treated as an ordinary character. If
       REG_NEWLINE is set, then &lt;newline&gt; shall be treated as an
       ordinary character except as follows:

        1. A &lt;newline&gt; in <i>string</i> shall not be matched by a &lt;period&gt;
           outside a bracket expression or by any form of a non-matching
           list (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
           <i>Chapter 9</i>, <i>Regular Expressions</i>).

        2. A &lt;circumflex&gt; (<b>'^'</b>) in <i>pattern</i>, when used to specify
           expression anchoring (see the Base Definitions volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 9.3.8</i>, <i>BRE Expression Anchoring</i>), shall
           match the zero-length string immediately after a &lt;newline&gt; in
           <i>string</i>, regardless of the setting of REG_NOTBOL.

        3. A &lt;dollar-sign&gt; (<b>'$'</b>) in <i>pattern</i>, when used to specify
           expression anchoring, shall match the zero-length string
           immediately before a &lt;newline&gt; in <i>string</i>, regardless of the
           setting of REG_NOTEOL.

       The <i>regfree</i>() function frees any memory allocated by <i>regcomp</i>()
       associated with <i>preg</i>.

       The following constants are defined as the minimum set of error
       return values, although other errors listed as implementation
       extensions in <i>&lt;regex.h&gt;</i> are possible:

       REG_BADBR     Content of <b>"\{\}" </b>invalid: not a number, number too
                     large, more than two numbers, first larger than
                     second.

       REG_BADPAT    Invalid regular expression.

       REG_BADRPT    <b>'?'</b>, <b>'*'</b>, or <b>'+' </b>not preceded by valid regular
                     expression.

       REG_EBRACE    <b>"\{\}" </b>imbalance.

       REG_EBRACK    <b>"[]" </b>imbalance.

       REG_ECOLLATE  Invalid collating element referenced.

       REG_ECTYPE    Invalid character class type referenced.

       REG_EESCAPE   Trailing &lt;backslash&gt; character in pattern.

       REG_EPAREN    <b>"\(\)" </b>or <b>"()" </b>imbalance.

       REG_ERANGE    Invalid endpoint in range expression.

       REG_ESPACE    Out of memory.

       REG_ESUBREG   Number in <b>"\digit" </b>invalid or in error.

       REG_NOMATCH   <i>regexec</i>() failed to match.

       If more than one error occurs in processing a function call, any
       one of the possible constants may be returned, as the order of
       detection is unspecified.

       The <i>regerror</i>() function provides a mapping from error codes
       returned by <i>regcomp</i>() and <i>regexec</i>() to unspecified printable
       strings. It generates a string corresponding to the value of the
       <i>errcode</i> argument, which the application shall ensure is the last
       non-zero value returned by <i>regcomp</i>() or <i>regexec</i>() with the given
       value of <i>preg</i>.  If <i>errcode</i> is not such a value, the content of
       the generated string is unspecified.

       If <i>preg</i> is a null pointer, but <i>errcode</i> is a value returned by a
       previous call to <i>regexec</i>() or <i>regcomp</i>(), the <i>regerror</i>() still
       generates an error string corresponding to the value of <i>errcode</i>,
       but it might not be as detailed under some implementations.

       If the <i>errbuf_size</i> argument is not 0, <i>regerror</i>() shall place the
       generated string into the buffer of size <i>errbuf_size</i> bytes
       pointed to by <i>errbuf</i>.  If the string (including the terminating
       null) cannot fit in the buffer, <i>regerror</i>() shall truncate the
       string and null-terminate the result.

       If <i>errbuf_size</i> is 0, <i>regerror</i>() shall ignore the <i>errbuf</i> argument,
       and return the size of the buffer needed to hold the generated
       string.

       If the <i>preg</i> argument to <i>regexec</i>() or <i>regfree</i>() is not a compiled
       regular expression returned by <i>regcomp</i>(), the result is
       undefined. A <i>preg</i> is no longer treated as a compiled regular
       expression after it is given to <i>regfree</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>regcomp</i>() function shall return
       0. Otherwise, it shall return an integer value indicating an
       error as described in <i>&lt;regex.h&gt;</i>, and the content of <i>preg</i> is
       undefined. If a code is returned, the interpretation shall be as
       given in <i>&lt;regex.h&gt;</i>.

       If <i>regcomp</i>() detects an invalid RE, it may return REG_BADPAT, or
       it may return one of the error codes that more precisely
       describes the error.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>regexec</i>() function shall return
       0. Otherwise, it shall return REG_NOMATCH to indicate no match.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>regerror</i>() function shall return
       the number of bytes needed to hold the entire generated string,
       including the null termination. If the return value is greater
       than <i>errbuf_size</i>, the string returned in the buffer pointed to by
       <i>errbuf</i> has been truncated.

       The <i>regfree</i>() function shall not return a value.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
           #include &lt;regex.h&gt;

           /*
            * Match string against the extended regular expression in
            * pattern, treating errors as no match.
            *
            * Return 1 for match, 0 for no match.
            */

           int
           match(const char *string, char *pattern)
           {
               int    status;
               regex_t    re;

               if (regcomp(&amp;re, pattern, REG_EXTENDED|REG_NOSUB) != 0) {
                   return(0);      /* Report error. */
               }
               status = regexec(&amp;re, string, (size_t) 0, NULL, 0);
               regfree(&amp;re);
               if (status != 0) {
                   return(0);      /* Report error. */
               }
               return(1);
           }

       The following demonstrates how the REG_NOTBOL flag could be used
       with <i>regexec</i>() to find all substrings in a line that match a
       pattern supplied by a user.  (For simplicity of the example, very
       little error checking is done.)

           (void) regcomp (&amp;re, pattern, 0);
           /* This call to regexec() finds the first match on the line. */
           error = regexec (&amp;re, &amp;buffer[0], 1, &amp;pm, 0);
           while (error == 0) {  /* While matches found. */
               /* Substring found between pm.rm_so and pm.rm_eo. */
               /* This call to regexec() finds the next match. */
               error = regexec (&amp;re, buffer + pm.rm_eo, 1, &amp;pm, REG_NOTBOL);
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       An application could use:

           regerror(code,preg,(char *)NULL,(size_t)0)

       to find out how big a buffer is needed for the generated string,
       <i>malloc</i>() a buffer to hold the string, and then call <i>regerror</i>()
       again to get the string. Alternatively, it could allocate a
       fixed, static buffer that is big enough to hold most strings, and
       then use <i>malloc</i>() to allocate a larger buffer if it finds that
       this is too small.

       To match a pattern as described in the Shell and Utilities volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Pattern Matching Notation</i>, use the
       <i>fnmatch</i>() function.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>regexec</i>() function must fill in all <i>nmatch</i> elements of
       <i>pmatch</i>, where <i>nmatch</i> and <i>pmatch</i> are supplied by the application,
       even if some elements of <i>pmatch</i> do not correspond to
       subexpressions in <i>pattern</i>.  The application developer should note
       that there is probably no reason for using a value of <i>nmatch</i> that
       is larger than <i>preg</i>-&gt;<i>re_nsub</i>+1.

       The REG_NEWLINE flag supports a use of RE matching that is needed
       in some applications like text editors. In such applications, the
       user supplies an RE asking the application to find a line that
       matches the given expression. An anchor in such an RE anchors at
       the beginning or end of any line. Such an application can pass a
       sequence of &lt;newline&gt;-separated lines to <i>regexec</i>() as a single
       long string and specify REG_NEWLINE to <i>regcomp</i>() to get the
       desired behavior. The application must ensure that there are no
       explicit &lt;newline&gt; characters in <i>pattern</i> if it wants to ensure
       that any match occurs entirely within a single line.

       The REG_NEWLINE flag affects the behavior of <i>regexec</i>(), but it is
       in the <i>cflags</i> parameter to <i>regcomp</i>() to allow flexibility of
       implementation. Some implementations will want to generate the
       same compiled RE in <i>regcomp</i>() regardless of the setting of
       REG_NEWLINE and have <i>regexec</i>() handle anchors differently based
       on the setting of the flag. Other implementations will generate
       different compiled REs based on the REG_NEWLINE.

       The REG_ICASE flag supports the operations taken by the <i>grep</i> <b>-i</b>
       option and the historical implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>.
       Including this flag will make it easier for application code to
       be written that does the same thing as these utilities.

       The substrings reported in <i>pmatch</i>[] are defined using offsets
       from the start of the string rather than pointers. This allows
       type-safe access to both constant and non-constant strings.

       The type <b>regoff_t </b>is used for the elements of <i>pmatch</i>[] to ensure
       that the application can represent large arrays in memory
       (important for an application conforming to the Shell and
       Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017).

       The 1992 edition of this standard required <b>regoff_t </b>to be at
       least as wide as <b>off_t</b>, to facilitate future extensions in which
       the string to be searched is taken from a file. However, these
       future extensions have not appeared.  The requirement rules out
       popular implementations with 32-bit <b>regoff_t </b>and 64-bit <b>off_t</b>, so
       it has been removed.

       The standard developers rejected the inclusion of a <i>regsub</i>()
       function that would be used to do substitutions for a matched RE.
       While such a routine would be useful to some applications, its
       utility would be much more limited than the matching function
       described here. Both RE parsing and substitution are possible to
       implement without support other than that required by the ISO C
       standard, but matching is much more complex than substituting.
       The only difficult part of substitution, given the information
       supplied by <i>regexec</i>(), is finding the next character in a string
       when there can be multi-byte characters. That is a much larger
       issue, and one that needs a more general solution.

       The <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> variable has not been used for error returns to avoid
       filling the <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> name space for this feature.

       The interface is defined so that the matched substrings <i>rm_sp</i> and
       <i>rm_ep</i> are in a separate <b>regmatch_t </b>structure instead of in
       <b>regex_t</b>.  This allows a single compiled RE to be used
       simultaneously in several contexts; in <i>main</i>() and a signal
       handler, perhaps, or in multiple threads of lightweight
       processes. (The <i>preg</i> argument to <i>regexec</i>() is declared with type
       <b>const</b>, so the implementation is not permitted to use the
       structure to store intermediate results.) It also allows an
       application to request an arbitrary number of substrings from an
       RE. The number of subexpressions in the RE is reported in <i>re_nsub</i>
       in <i>preg</i>.  With this change to <i>regexec</i>(), consideration was given
       to dropping the REG_NOSUB flag since the user can now specify
       this with a zero <i>nmatch</i> argument to <i>regexec</i>().  However, keeping
       REG_NOSUB allows an implementation to use a different (perhaps
       more efficient) algorithm if it knows in <i>regcomp</i>() that no
       subexpressions need be reported. The implementation is only
       required to fill in <i>pmatch</i> if <i>nmatch</i> is not zero and if REG_NOSUB
       is not specified. Note that the <b>size_t </b>type, as defined in the
       ISO C standard, is unsigned, so the description of <i>regexec</i>() does
       not need to address negative values of <i>nmatch</i>.

       REG_NOTBOL was added to allow an application to do repeated
       searches for the same pattern in a line. If the pattern contains
       a &lt;circumflex&gt; character that should match the beginning of a
       line, then the pattern should only match when matched against the
       beginning of the line.  Without the REG_NOTBOL flag, the
       application could rewrite the expression for subsequent matches,
       but in the general case this would require parsing the
       expression. The need for REG_NOTEOL is not as clear; it was added
       for symmetry.

       The addition of the <i>regerror</i>() function addresses the historical
       need for conforming application programs to have access to error
       information more than ``Function failed to compile/match your RE
       for unknown reasons''.

       This interface provides for two different methods of dealing with
       error conditions. The specific error codes (REG_EBRACE, for
       example), defined in <i>&lt;regex.h&gt;</i>, allow an application to recover
       from an error if it is so able. Many applications, especially
       those that use patterns supplied by a user, will not try to deal
       with specific error cases, but will just use <i>regerror</i>() to obtain
       a human-readable error message to present to the user.

       The <i>regerror</i>() function uses a scheme similar to <i>confstr</i>() to
       deal with the problem of allocating memory to hold the generated
       string. The scheme used by <i>strerror</i>() in the ISO C standard was
       considered unacceptable since it creates difficulties for multi-
       threaded applications.

       The <i>preg</i> argument is provided to <i>regerror</i>() to allow an
       implementation to generate a more descriptive message than would
       be possible with <i>errcode</i> alone. An implementation might, for
       example, save the character offset of the offending character of
       the pattern in a field of <i>preg</i>, and then include that in the
       generated message string. The implementation may also ignore
       <i>preg</i>.

       A REG_FILENAME flag was considered, but omitted. This flag caused
       <i>regexec</i>() to match patterns as described in the Shell and
       Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Pattern Matching</i>
       <i>Notation</i> instead of REs. This service is now provided by the
       <i>fnmatch</i>() function.

       Notice that there is a difference in philosophy between the
       ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard and POSIX.1‐2008 in how to handle a
       ``bad'' regular expression. The ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard says
       that many bad constructs ``produce undefined results'', or that
       ``the interpretation is undefined''. POSIX.1‐2008, however, says
       that the interpretation of such REs is unspecified. The term
       ``undefined'' means that the action by the application is an
       error, of similar severity to passing a bad pointer to a
       function.

       The <i>regcomp</i>() and <i>regexec</i>() functions are required to accept any
       null-terminated string as the <i>pattern</i> argument. If the meaning of
       the string is ``undefined'', the behavior of the function is
       ``unspecified''. POSIX.1‐2008 does not specify how the functions
       will interpret the pattern; they might return error codes, or
       they might do pattern matching in some completely unexpected way,
       but they should not do something like abort the process.
