NAME </h2>

       <b>pmGetArchiveEnd</b>, <b>pmGetHighResArchiveEnd </b>- locate logical end of
       file for a set of archives
</pre> <h2>
C SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcp/pmapi.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pmGetArchiveEnd(struct timeval *</b><i>tp</i><b>);</b>
       <b>int pmGetHighResArchiveEnd(struct timespec *</b><i>tp</i><b>);</b>

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Assuming the current PMAPI context is associated with a set of
       archives, <b>pmGetArchiveEnd </b>and <b>pmGetHighResArchiveEnd </b>will attempt
       to find the logical end of file (after the last complete record
       in the set of archives), and return the last recorded timestamp
       via <i>tp</i>.  This timestamp may be passed to <a href="pmsetmode.3.html">pmSetMode(3)</a> or
       <a href="pmsetmodehighres.3.html">pmSetModeHighRes(3)</a> to reliably position the context at the last
       valid archive record, e.g. in preparation for subsequent reading
       in reverse chronological order.

       For archives that are not concurrently being written, the
       physical end of file and the logical end of file are co-incident.
       However if an archive is being written by <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> at the same
       time an application is trying to read the archive, the logical
       end of file may be before the physical end of file due to write
       buffering that is not aligned with the logical record boundaries.

       <b>pmGetArchiveEnd </b>and <b>pmGetHighResArchiveEnd </b>return an error less
       than zero if the context is neither valid, nor associated with a
       set of archives, or the set of archives is seriously corrupted.
       Otherwise, the return value is 0 if there has been no change of
       state since the last call, or 1 if the logical end of file has
       advanced since the last call.

       In the absence of an error, the result returned via <i>tp</i> is well-
       defined.

       Both <b>pmGetArchiveEnd </b>and <b>pmGetHighResArchiveEnd </b>preserve the
       positioning state of the archive file prior to this function
       call.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT</b>
              the current PMAPI context is either invalid, or not
              associated with a set of archives

       <b>PM_ERR_LOGREC</b>
              the set of archives is sufficiently damaged, that not a
              single valid record can be found
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.  Values for these variables may be obtained
       programmatically using the <a href="pmgetconfig.3.html">pmGetConfig(3)</a> function.
