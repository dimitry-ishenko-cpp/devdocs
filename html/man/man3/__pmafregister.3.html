CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This  documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not  work,  or  may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The routines implement an event queue and callback framework that
       supports  periodic  evaluation of a series of events with varying
       frequencies for Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) applications.

       The  <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>  application,  the  <a href="../man1/pmdatrace.1.html">pmdatrace(1)</a>  PMDA  and  the
       <b>pmdahotproc</b>(1) PMDA are the principal users of these services.

       An  event is created by calling <b>__pmAFsetup </b>or <b>__pmAFregister </b>and
       on success the return value is an event number greater than zero.
       The event has associated event  data  identified  by  the  opaque
       pointer <i>data</i>.  The event will occur with frequency <i>delta</i> and each
       time  the  event occurs the function <i>func</i> will be called with the
       event number and the event data as arguments.

       If <b>__pmAFsetup </b>is used then the first event is scheduled for  the
       current  time plus <i>start</i>, else if <b>__pmAFregister </b>is used then the
       first event is scheduled for the current time plus <i>delta</i>.

       <i>func</i> is called in a SIGALRM signal handler  context  and  so  the
       routines  that  may  be safely called from <i>func</i> are restricted to
       the so-called <i>async-signal-safe</i> set.  In particular there must be
       no Standard I/O calls nor calls to any of the <a href="malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>  routines
       to modify the state of the heap.  Refer to the <i>Pointer to a Func‐</i>
       <i>tion</i>     Section     of     the    POSIX.1-2013    document    at
       <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html">http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html</a>
       for a fuller description.

       The safest and simplest class of <i>func</i> routines are those that  do
       minimal  processing,  set some global state and return.  The real
       work associated with the event is done subsequently from the  ap‐
       plication's main loop when the global state change is detected.

       Once  the  event  occurs  and the callback has been executed, the
       event will be rescheduled for <i>delta</i> into the  future,  except  if
       all  the  fields  of <i>delta</i> are zero, in which case the event will
       not be rescheduled (a ``one trip'' event).

       Internally, events are processed serially so there is  no  possi‐
       bility of nested callbacks or re-entrant callbacks from the event
       management routines.

       Given an event number <i>afid</i>, <b>__pmAFunregister </b>will permanently re‐
       move the corresponding entry from the event queue.

       To  control the event queue processing, <b>__pmAFblock </b>and <b>__pmAFun‐</b>
       <b>block </b>may be used to explicitly block and unblock the dispatch of
       events.  This is most useful when the caller wishes to set  up  a
       number  of  events via <b>__pmAFsetup </b>or <b>__pmAFregister </b>and complete
       the registration phase before the first event callback occurs.

       A call to <b>__pmAFisempty </b>returns 1 or 0 depending on  whether  the
       event queue is empty or not.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       These  routines  rely on <a href="../man2/setitimer.2.html">setitimer(2)</a> and manipulate the handling
       of <b>SIGALRM </b>signals, and hence are probably ill-suited for  appli‐
       cations  that  require direct and concurrent access to these ser‐
       vices and resources.

       If the callback functions are slow, or delayed,  it  is  possible
       that  the  event  scheduling could fall behind and never catchup.
       When this begins to  happen,  events  are  silently  skipped  and
       rescheduled at the earliest possible time in the future according
       to  the fixed schedule defined by the time of the call to <b>__pmAF‐</b>
       <b>setup </b>and the value of the <i>start</i> and <i>delta</i> arguments (or  defined
       by  the  time  of the call to <b>__pmAFregister </b>and the value of the
       <i>delta</i> argument).

       In addition, the semantics of the interval timer(s) and the glob‐
       al state needed to support these services  demand  that  applica‐
       tions  calling  these  routines  must do so from a single thread.
       This restriction is enforced at the <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a>, where routines  may
       return  the error code <b>PM_ERR_THREAD </b>if the library detects calls
       from more than one thread.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>__pmAFsetup</b>, <b>__pmAFregister </b>and  <b>__pmAFunregister  </b>return  values
       less than zero in the case of an error.  These values are PCP er‐
       ror  codes,  and  may  be  used  to  produce  error  messages via
       <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>.

       The routines support the standard PCP debug tracing, and  the  <b>af</b>
       option (or <b>-D af </b>on the command line) will produce diagnostics on
       standard error that trace the enqueuing and execution of events.
