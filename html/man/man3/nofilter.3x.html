DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>unctrl</b>
       The  <b>unctrl  </b>routine returns a character string which is a print‐
       able representation of  the  character  <i>c</i>,  ignoring  attributes.
       Control  characters  are  displayed in the <b>^</b><i>X</i> notation.  Printing
       characters are displayed as is.

       The corresponding <b>wunctrl </b>returns a printable representation of a
       wide character.

   <b>keyname/key_name</b>
       The <b>keyname </b>routine returns a character string  corresponding  to
       the key <i>c</i>:

       •   Printable characters are displayed as themselves, e.g., a
           one-character string containing the key.

       •   Control characters are displayed in the <b>^</b><i>X</i> notation.

       •   DEL (character 127) is displayed as <b>^?</b>.

       •   Values above 128 are either meta characters (if the screen
           has not been initialized, or if <b>meta</b>(3X) has been called with
           a <b>TRUE </b>parameter), shown in the <b>M-</b><i>X</i> notation, or are dis‐
           played as themselves.  In the latter case, the values may not
           be printable; this follows the X/Open specification.

       •   Values above 256 may be the names of the names of function
           keys.

       •   Otherwise (if there is no corresponding name) the function
           returns null, to denote an error.  X/Open also lists an “UN‐
           KNOWN KEY” return value, which some implementations return
           rather than null.

       The corresponding <b>key_name </b>returns a character string correspond‐
       ing to the wide-character value <i>w</i>.  The two functions do not re‐
       turn the same set of strings; the latter returns null where the
       former would display a meta character.

   <b>filter/nofilter</b>
       The <b>filter </b>routine, if used, must be called before <b>initscr </b>or
       <b>newterm </b>are called.  Calling <b>filter </b>causes these changes in ini‐
       tialization:

       •   <b>LINES </b>is set to 1;

       •   the capabilities <b>clear</b>, <b>cud1</b>, <b>cud</b>, <b>cup</b>, <b>cuu1</b>, <b>cuu</b>, <b>vpa </b>are
           disabled;

       •   the capability <b>ed </b>is disabled if <b>bce </b>is set;

       •   and the <b>home </b>string is set to the value of <b>cr</b>.

       The <b>nofilter </b>routine cancels the effect of a preceding <b>filter</b>
       call.  That allows the caller to initialize a screen on a differ‐
       ent device, using a different value of <b>$TERM</b>.  The limitation
       arises because the <b>filter </b>routine modifies the in-memory copy of
       the terminal information.

   <b>use_env</b>
       The <b>use_env </b>routine, if used, should be called before <b>initscr </b>or
       <b>newterm </b>are called (because those compute the screen size).  It
       modifies the way <b>ncurses </b>treats environment variables when deter‐
       mining the screen size.

       •   Normally <b>ncurses </b>looks first at the terminal database for the
           screen size.

           If <b>use_env </b>was called with <b>FALSE </b>for parameter, it stops here
           unless <b>use_tioctl </b>was also called with <b>TRUE </b>for parameter.

       •   Then it asks for the screen size via operating system calls.
           If successful, it overrides the values from the terminal
           database.

       •   Finally (unless <b>use_env </b>was called with <b>FALSE </b>parameter),
           <b>ncurses </b>examines the <b>LINES </b>or <b>COLUMNS </b>environment variables,
           using a value in those to override the results from the oper‐
           ating system or terminal database.

           <b>Ncurses </b>also updates the screen size in response to <b>SIGWINCH</b>,
           unless overridden by the <b>LINES </b>or <b>COLUMNS </b>environment vari‐
           ables,

   <b>use_tioctl</b>
       The <b>use_tioctl </b>routine, if used, should be called before <b>initscr</b>
       or <b>newterm </b>are called (because those compute the screen size).
       After <b>use_tioctl </b>is called with <b>TRUE </b>as an argument, <b>ncurses </b>mod‐
       ifies the last step in its computation of screen size as follows:

       •   checks if the <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS </b>environment variables are set
           to a number greater than zero.

       •   for each, <b>ncurses </b>updates the corresponding environment vari‐
           able with the value that it has obtained via operating system
           call or from the terminal database.

       •   <b>ncurses </b>re-fetches the value of the environment variables so
           that it is still the environment variables which set the
           screen size.

       The <b>use_env </b>and <b>use_tioctl </b>routines combine as summarized here:
        <b>use_env   use_tioctl   Summary</b>
        ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
        TRUE      FALSE        This is the default behavior.  <b>ncurses</b>
                               uses operating system calls unless over‐
                               ridden by $LINES or $COLUMNS environment
                               variables.
        TRUE      TRUE         <b>ncurses </b>updates $LINES and $COLUMNS
                               based on operating system calls.
        FALSE     TRUE         <b>ncurses </b>ignores $LINES and $COLUMNS, us‐
                               es operating system calls to obtain
                               size.
        FALSE     FALSE        <b>ncurses </b>relies on the terminal database
                               to determine size.

   <b>putwin/getwin</b>
       The <b>putwin </b>routine writes all data associated with window (or
       pad) <i>win</i> into the file to which <i>filep</i> points.  This information
       can be later retrieved using the <b>getwin </b>function.

       The <b>getwin </b>routine reads window related data stored in the file
       by <b>putwin</b>.  The routine then creates and initializes a new window
       using that data.  It returns a pointer to the new window.  There
       are a few caveats:

       •   the data written is a copy of the <b>WINDOW </b>structure, and its
           associated character cells.  The format differs between the
           wide-character (<b>ncursesw</b>) and non-wide (<b>ncurses</b>) libraries.
           You can transfer data between the two, however.

       •   the retrieved window is always created as a top-level window
           (or pad), rather than a subwindow.

       •   the window's character cells contain the color pair <i>value</i>,
           but not the actual color <i>numbers</i>.  If cells in the retrieved
           window use color pairs which have not been created in the ap‐
           plication using <b>init_pair</b>, they will not be colored when the
           window is refreshed.

   <b>delay_output</b>
       The <b>delay_output </b>routine inserts an <i>ms</i> millisecond pause in out‐
       put.  This routine should not be used extensively because padding
       characters are used rather than a CPU pause.  If no padding char‐
       acter is specified, this uses <b>napms </b>to perform the delay.

   <b>flushinp</b>
       The <b>flushinp </b>routine throws away any typeahead that has been
       typed by the user and has not yet been read by the program.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Except for <b>flushinp</b>, routines that return an integer return <b>ERR</b>
       upon failure and <b>OK </b>(SVr4 specifies only "an integer value other
       than <b>ERR</b>") upon successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return <b>NULL </b>on error.

       X/Open does not define any error conditions.  In this implementa‐
       tion

          <b>flushinp</b>
               returns an error if the terminal was not initialized.

          <b>putwin</b>
               returns an error if the associated <b>fwrite </b>calls return an
               error.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
   <b>filter</b>
       The SVr4 documentation describes the action of <b>filter </b>only in the
       vaguest terms.  The description here is adapted from the XSI
       Curses standard (which erroneously fails to describe the dis‐
       abling of <b>cuu</b>).

   <b>keyname</b>
       The <b>keyname </b>function may return the names of user-defined string
       capabilities which are defined in the terminfo entry via the <b>-x</b>
       option of <b>@TIC@</b>.  This implementation automatically assigns at
       run-time keycodes to user-defined strings which begin with “k”.
       The keycodes start at KEY_MAX, but are not guaranteed to be the
       same value for different runs because user-defined codes are
       merged from all terminal descriptions which have been loaded.
       The <b>use_extended_names</b>(3X) function controls whether this data is
       loaded when the terminal description is read by the library.

   <b>nofilter/use_tioctl</b>
       The <b>nofilter </b>and <b>use_tioctl </b>routines are specific to <b>ncurses</b>.
       They were not supported on Version 7, BSD or System V implementa‐
       tions.  It is recommended that any code depending on <b>ncurses </b>ex‐
       tensions be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.

   <b>putwin/getwin file-format</b>
       The <b>putwin </b>and <b>getwin </b>functions have several issues with porta‐
       bility:

       •   The files written and read by these functions use an imple‐
           mentation-specific format.  Although the format is an obvious
           target for standardization, it has been overlooked.

           Interestingly enough, according to the copyright dates in So‐
           laris source, the functions (along with <b>scr_init</b>, etc.) orig‐
           inated with the University of California, Berkeley (in 1982)
           and were later (in 1988) incorporated into SVr4.  Oddly,
           there are no such functions in the 4.3BSD curses sources.

       •   Most implementations simply dump the binary <b>WINDOW </b>structure
           to the file.  These include SVr4 curses, NetBSD and PDCurses,
           as well as older <b>ncurses </b>versions.  This implementation (as
           well as the X/Open variant of Solaris curses, dated 1995) us‐
           es textual dumps.

           The implementations which use binary dumps use block-I/O (the
           <b>fwrite </b>and <b>fread </b>functions).  Those that use textual dumps
           use buffered-I/O.  A few applications may happen to write ex‐
           tra data in the file using these functions.  Doing that can
           run into problems mixing block- and buffered-I/O.  This im‐
           plementation reduces the problem on writes by flushing the
           output.  However, reading from a file written using mixed
           schemes may not be successful.

   <b>unctrl/wunctrl</b>
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  It
       states that <b>unctrl </b>and <b>wunctrl </b>will return a null pointer if un‐
       successful, but does not define any error conditions.  This im‐
       plementation checks for three cases:

       •   the parameter is a 7-bit US-ASCII code.  This is the case
           that X/Open Curses documented.

       •   the parameter is in the range 128-159, i.e., a C1 control
           code.  If <b>use_legacy_coding</b>(3X) has been called with a <b>2 </b>pa‐
           rameter, <b>unctrl </b>returns the parameter, i.e., a one-character
           string with the parameter as the first character.  Otherwise,
           it returns “~@”, “~A”, etc., analogous to “^@”, “^A”, C0 con‐
           trols.

           X/Open Curses does not document whether <b>unctrl </b>can be called
           before initializing curses.  This implementation permits
           that, and returns the “~@”, etc., values in that case.

       •   parameter values outside the 0 to 255 range.  <b>unctrl </b>returns
           a null pointer.

       The strings returned by <b>unctrl </b>in this implementation are deter‐
       mined at compile time, showing C1 controls from the upper-128
       codes with a “~” prefix rather than “^”.  Other implementations
       have different conventions.  For example, they may show both sets
       of control characters with “^”, and strip the parameter to 7
       bits.  Or they may ignore C1 controls and treat all of the up‐
       per-128 codes as printable.  This implementation uses 8 bits but
       does not modify the string to reflect locale.  The <b>use_lega‐</b>
       <b>cy_coding</b>(3X) function allows the caller to change the output of
       <b>unctrl</b>.

       Likewise, the <b>meta</b>(3X) function allows the caller to change the
       output of <b>keyname</b>, i.e., it determines whether to use the “M-”
       prefix for “meta” keys (codes in the range 128 to 255).  Both
       <b>use_legacy_coding</b>(3X) and <b>meta</b>(3X) succeed only after curses is
       initialized.  X/Open Curses does not document the treatment of
       codes 128 to 159.  When treating them as “meta” keys (or if <b>key‐</b>
       <b>name </b>is called before initializing curses), this implementation
       returns strings “M-^@”, “M-^A”, etc.

       X/Open Curses documents <b>unctrl </b>as declared in <b>&lt;unctrl.h&gt;</b>, which
       <b>ncurses </b>does.  However, <b>ncurses</b>' <b>&lt;curses.h&gt; </b>includes <b>&lt;unctrl.h&gt;</b>,
       matching the behavior of SVr4 curses.  Other implementations may
       not do that.

   <b>use_env/use_tioctl</b>
       If <b>ncurses </b>is configured to provide the sp-functions extension,
       the state of <b>use_env </b>and <b>use_tioctl </b>may be updated before creat‐
       ing each <i>screen</i> rather than once only (<b>curs_sp_funcs</b>(3X)).  This
       feature of <b>use_env </b>is not provided by other implementation of
       curses.
