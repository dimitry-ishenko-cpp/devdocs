PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       round, roundf, roundl — round to the nearest integer value in a
       floating-point format
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;math.h&gt;

       double round(double <i>x</i>);
       float roundf(float <i>x</i>);
       long double roundl(long double <i>x</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall round their argument to the nearest integer
       value in floating-point format, rounding halfway cases away from
       zero, regardless of the current rounding direction.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
       rounded integer value.  The result shall have the same sign as <i>x</i>.

       If <i>x</i> is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

       If <i>x</i> is ±0 or ±Inf, <i>x</i> shall be returned.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The integral value returned by these functions need not be
       expressible as an <b>intmax_t</b>.  The return value should be tested
       before assigning it to an integer type to avoid the undefined
       results of an integer overflow.

       These functions may raise the inexact floating-point exception if
       the result differs in value from the argument.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
