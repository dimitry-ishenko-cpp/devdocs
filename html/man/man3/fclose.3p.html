PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fclose — close a stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int fclose(FILE *<i>stream</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fclose</i>() function shall cause the stream pointed to by <i>stream</i>
       to be flushed and the associated file to be closed. Any unwritten
       buffered data for the stream shall be written to the file; any
       unread buffered data shall be discarded. Whether or not the call
       succeeds, the stream shall be disassociated from the file and any
       buffer set by the <i>setbuf</i>() or <i>setvbuf</i>() function shall be
       disassociated from the stream. If the associated buffer was
       automatically allocated, it shall be deallocated.

       If the file is not already at EOF, and the file is one capable of
       seeking, the file offset of the underlying open file description
       shall be set to the file position of the stream if the stream is
       the active handle to the underlying file description.

       The <i>fclose</i>() function shall mark for update the last data
       modification and last file status change timestamps of the
       underlying file, if the stream was writable, and if buffered data
       remains that has not yet been written to the file. The <i>fclose</i>()
       function shall perform the equivalent of a <i>close</i>() on the file
       descriptor that is associated with the stream pointed to by
       <i>stream</i>.

       After the call to <i>fclose</i>(), any use of <i>stream</i> results in
       undefined behavior.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>fclose</i>() shall return 0; otherwise,
       it shall return EOF and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fclose</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor
              underlying <i>stream</i> and the thread would be delayed in the
              write operation.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The file descriptor underlying stream is not valid.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the
              maximum file size.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the file
              size limit of the process.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to
              write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
              corresponding stream.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>fclose</i>() function was interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EIO    </b>The process is a member of a background process group
              attempting to write to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is
              set, the calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, the
              process is not ignoring SIGTTOU, and the process group of
              the process is orphaned.  This error may also be returned
              under implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The underlying stream was created by <i>open_memstream</i>() or
              <i>open_wmemstream</i>() and insufficient memory is available.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>There was no free space remaining on the device containing
              the file or in the buffer used by the <i>fmemopen</i>() function.

       <b>EPIPE  </b>An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not
              open for reading by any process. A SIGPIPE signal shall
              also be sent to the thread.

       The <i>fclose</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENXIO  </b>A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request
              was outside the capabilities of the device.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since after the call to <i>fclose</i>() any use of <i>stream</i> results in
       undefined behavior, <i>fclose</i>() should not be used on <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>,
       or <i>stderr</i> except immediately before process termination (see the
       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.303</i>, <i>Process</i>
       <i>Termination</i>), so as to avoid triggering undefined behavior in
       other standard interfaces that rely on these streams. If there
       are any <i>atexit</i>() handlers registered by the application, such a
       call to <i>fclose</i>() should not occur until the last handler is
       finishing. Once <i>fclose</i>() has been used to close <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>, or
       <i>stderr</i>, there is no standard way to reopen any of these streams.

       Use of <i>freopen</i>() to change <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>, or <i>stderr</i> instead of
       closing them avoids the danger of a file unexpectedly being
       opened as one of the special file descriptors STDIN_FILENO,
       STDOUT_FILENO, or STDERR_FILENO at a later time in the
       application.
