NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>menu_driver </b>- command-processing loop of the menu system
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Once a menu has been posted (displayed), you should funnel input
       events to it through <b>menu_driver</b>.  This routine has three major
       input cases:

       •   The input is a form navigation request.  Navigation request
           codes are constants defined in <b>&lt;form.h&gt;</b>, which are distinct
           from the key- and character codes returned by <b>wgetch</b>(3X).

       •   The input is a printable character.  Printable characters
           (which must be positive, less than 256) are checked according
           to the program's locale settings.

       •   The input is the KEY_MOUSE special key associated with an
           mouse event.

       The menu driver requests are as follows:

       REQ_LEFT_ITEM
            Move left to an item.

       REQ_RIGHT_ITEM
            Move right to an item.

       REQ_UP_ITEM
            Move up to an item.

       REQ_DOWN_ITEM
            Move down to an item.

       REQ_SCR_ULINE
            Scroll up a line.

       REQ_SCR_DLINE
            Scroll down a line.

       REQ_SCR_DPAGE
            Scroll down a page.

       REQ_SCR_UPAGE
            Scroll up a page.

       REQ_FIRST_ITEM
            Move to the first item.

       REQ_LAST_ITEM
            Move to the last item.

       REQ_NEXT_ITEM
            Move to the next item.

       REQ_PREV_ITEM
            Move to the previous item.

       REQ_TOGGLE_ITEM
            Select/deselect an item.

       REQ_CLEAR_PATTERN
            Clear the menu pattern buffer.

       REQ_BACK_PATTERN
            Delete the previous character from the pattern buffer.

       REQ_NEXT_MATCH
            Move to the next item matching the pattern match.

       REQ_PREV_MATCH
            Move to the previous item matching the pattern match.

       If the second argument is a printable character, the code appends
       it to the pattern buffer and attempts to move to the next item
       matching the new pattern.  If there is no such match, <b>menu_driver</b>
       returns <b>E_NO_MATCH </b>and deletes the appended character from the
       buffer.

       If the second argument is one of the above pre-defined requests,
       the corresponding action is performed.

   <b>MOUSE HANDLING</b>
       If the second argument is the KEY_MOUSE special key, the
       associated mouse event is translated into one of the above pre-
       defined requests.  Currently only clicks in the user window
       (e.g., inside the menu display area or the decoration window) are
       handled.

       If you click above the display region of the menu:

       •   a REQ_SCR_ULINE is generated for a single click,

       •   a REQ_SCR_UPAGE is generated for a double-click and

       •   a REQ_FIRST_ITEM is generated for a triple-click.

       If you click below the display region of the menu:

       •   a REQ_SCR_DLINE is generated for a single click,

       •   a REQ_SCR_DPAGE is generated for a double-click and

       •   a REQ_LAST_ITEM is generated for a triple-click.

       If you click at an item inside the display area of the menu:

       •   the menu cursor is positioned to that item.

       •   If you double-click an item a REQ_TOGGLE_ITEM is generated
           and <b>E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND </b>is returned.  This return value makes
           sense, because a double click usually means that an item-
           specific action should be returned.  It is exactly the
           purpose of this return value to signal that an application
           specific command should be executed.

       •   If a translation into a request was done, <b>menu_driver </b>returns
           the result of this request.

       If you clicked outside the user window or the mouse event could
       not be translated into a menu request an <b>E_REQUEST_DENIED </b>is
       returned.

   <b>APPLICATION-DEFINED COMMANDS</b>
       If the second argument is neither printable nor one of the above
       pre-defined menu requests or KEY_MOUSE, the drive assumes it is
       an application-specific command and returns <b>E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND</b>.
       Application-defined commands should be defined relative to
       <b>MAX_COMMAND</b>, the maximum value of these pre-defined requests.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>menu_driver </b>return one of the following error codes:

       <b>E_OK </b>The routine succeeded.

       <b>E_SYSTEM_ERROR</b>
            System error occurred (see <a href="errno.3.html">errno(3)</a>).

       <b>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</b>
            Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       <b>E_BAD_STATE</b>
            Routine was called from an initialization or termination
            function.

       <b>E_NOT_POSTED</b>
            The menu has not been posted.

       <b>E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND</b>
            The menu driver code saw an unknown request code.

       <b>E_NO_MATCH</b>
            Character failed to match.

       <b>E_REQUEST_DENIED</b>

PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not
       supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.  The support for mouse
       events is ncurses specific.
