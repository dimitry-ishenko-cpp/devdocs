PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_fadvise — file advisory information (<b>ADVANCED REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int posix_fadvise(int <i>fd</i>, off_t <i>offset</i>, off_t <i>len</i>, int <i>advice</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_fadvise</i>() function shall advise the implementation on
       the expected behavior of the application with respect to the data
       in the file associated with the open file descriptor, <i>fd</i>,
       starting at <i>offset</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes. The specified
       range need not currently exist in the file. If <i>len</i> is zero, all
       data following <i>offset</i> is specified. The implementation may use
       this information to optimize handling of the specified data. The
       <i>posix_fadvise</i>() function shall have no effect on the semantics of
       other operations on the specified data, although it may affect
       the performance of other operations.

       The advice to be applied to the data is specified by the <i>advice</i>
       parameter and may be one of the following values:

       POSIX_FADV_NORMAL
             Specifies that the application has no advice to give on its
             behavior with respect to the specified data. It is the
             default characteristic if no advice is given for an open
             file.

       POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL
             Specifies that the application expects to access the
             specified data sequentially from lower offsets to higher
             offsets.

       POSIX_FADV_RANDOM
             Specifies that the application expects to access the
             specified data in a random order.

       POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED
             Specifies that the application expects to access the
             specified data in the near future.

       POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED
             Specifies that the application expects that it will not
             access the specified data in the near future.

       POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE
             Specifies that the application expects to access the
             specified data once and then not reuse it thereafter.

       These values are defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>posix_fadvise</i>() shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_fadvise</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fd</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>advice</i> is invalid, or the value of <i>len</i> is
              less than zero.

       <b>ESPIPE </b>The <i>fd</i> argument is associated with a pipe or FIFO.
