</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_atfork - register fork handlers
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX threads library (<i>libpthread</i>, <i>-lpthread</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pthread_atfork(void (*</b><i>prepare</i><b>)(void), void (*</b><i>parent</i><b>)(void),</b>
                          <b>void (*</b><i>child</i><b>)(void));</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pthread_atfork</b>() function registers fork handlers that are to
       be executed when <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> is called by any thread in a process.
       The handlers are executed in the context of the thread that calls
       <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.

       Three kinds of handler can be registered:

       •  <i>prepare</i> specifies a handler that is executed in the parent
          process before <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> processing starts.

       •  <i>parent</i> specifies a handler that is executed in the parent
          process after <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> processing completes.

       •  <i>child</i> specifies a handler that is executed in the child
          process after <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> processing completes.

       Any of the three arguments may be NULL if no handler is needed in
       the corresponding phase of <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> processing.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>pthread_atfork</b>() returns zero.  On error, it returns
       an error number.  <b>pthread_atfork</b>() may be called multiple times
       by a process to register additional handlers.  The handlers for
       each phase are called in a specified order: the <i>prepare</i> handlers
       are called in reverse order of registration; the <i>parent</i> and <i>child</i>
       handlers are called in the order of registration.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ENOMEM </b>Could not allocate memory to record the fork handler list
              entry.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2001.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       When <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> is called in a multithreaded process, only the
       calling thread is duplicated in the child process.  The original
       intention of <b>pthread_atfork</b>() was to allow the child process to
       be returned to a consistent state.  For example, at the time of
       the call to <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, other threads may have locked mutexes that
       are visible in the user-space memory duplicated in the child.
       Such mutexes would never be unlocked, since the threads that
       placed the locks are not duplicated in the child.  The intent of
       <b>pthread_atfork</b>() was to provide a mechanism whereby the
       application (or a library) could ensure that mutexes and other
       process and thread state would be restored to a consistent state.
       In practice, this task is generally too difficult to be
       practicable.

       After a <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> in a multithreaded process returns in the child,
       the child should call only async-signal-safe functions (see
       <a href="../man7/signal-safety.7.html">signal-safety(7)</a>) until such time as it calls <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> to
       execute a new program.

       POSIX.1 specifies that <b>pthread_atfork</b>() shall not fail with the
       error <b>EINTR</b>.
