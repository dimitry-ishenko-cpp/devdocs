PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mlock, munlock — lock or unlock a range of process address space
       (<b>REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int mlock(const void *<i>addr</i>, size_t <i>len</i>);
       int munlock(const void *<i>addr</i>, size_t <i>len</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mlock</i>() function shall cause those whole pages containing any
       part of the address space of the process starting at address <i>addr</i>
       and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes to be memory-resident until unlocked
       or until the process exits or <i>exec</i>s another process image. The
       implementation may require that <i>addr</i> be a multiple of {PAGESIZE}.

       The <i>munlock</i>() function shall unlock those whole pages containing
       any part of the address space of the process starting at address
       <i>addr</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes, regardless of how many times
       <i>mlock</i>() has been called by the process for any of the pages in
       the specified range. The implementation may require that <i>addr</i> be
       a multiple of {PAGESIZE}.

       If any of the pages in the range specified to a call to <i>munlock</i>()
       are also mapped into the address spaces of other processes, any
       locks established on those pages by another process are
       unaffected by the call of this process to <i>munlock</i>().  If any of
       the pages in the range specified by a call to <i>munlock</i>() are also
       mapped into other portions of the address space of the calling
       process outside the range specified, any locks established on
       those pages via the other mappings are also unaffected by this
       call.

       Upon successful return from <i>mlock</i>(), pages in the specified range
       shall be locked and memory-resident. Upon successful return from
       <i>munlock</i>(), pages in the specified range shall be unlocked with
       respect to the address space of the process. Memory residency of
       unlocked pages is unspecified.

       Appropriate privileges are required to lock process memory with
       <i>mlock</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>mlock</i>() and <i>munlock</i>() functions
       shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, no change is made to any
       locks in the address space of the process, and the function shall
       return a value of -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mlock</i>() and <i>munlock</i>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Some or all of the address range specified by the <i>addr</i> and
              <i>len</i> arguments does not correspond to valid mapped pages in
              the address space of the process.

       The <i>mlock</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>Some or all of the memory identified by the operation
              could not be locked when the call was made.

       The <i>mlock</i>() and <i>munlock</i>() functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>addr</i> argument is not a multiple of {PAGESIZE}.

       The <i>mlock</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Locking the pages mapped by the specified range would
              exceed an implementation-defined limit on the amount of
              memory that the process may lock.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The calling process does not have appropriate privileges
              to perform the requested operation.
