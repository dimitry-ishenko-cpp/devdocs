DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>futimens</i>() and <i>utimensat</i>() functions shall set the access and
       modification times of a file to the values of the <i>times</i> argument.
       The <i>futimens</i>() function changes the times of the file associated
       with the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.  The <i>utimensat</i>() function changes
       the times of the file pointed to by the <i>path</i> argument, relative
       to the directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.  Both
       functions allow time specifications accurate to the nanosecond.

       For <i>futimens</i>() and <i>utimensat</i>(), the <i>times</i> argument is an array of
       two <b>timespec </b>structures. The first array member represents the
       date and time of last access, and the second member represents
       the date and time of last modification. The times in the <b>timespec</b>
       structure are measured in seconds and nanoseconds since the
       Epoch. The file's relevant timestamp shall be set to the greatest
       value supported by the file system that is not greater than the
       specified time.

       If the <i>tv_nsec</i> field of a <b>timespec </b>structure has the special
       value UTIME_NOW, the file's relevant timestamp shall be set to
       the greatest value supported by the file system that is not
       greater than the current time. If the <i>tv_nsec</i> field has the
       special value UTIME_OMIT, the file's relevant timestamp shall not
       be changed. In either case, the <i>tv_sec</i> field shall be ignored.

       If the <i>times</i> argument is a null pointer, both the access and
       modification timestamps shall be set to the greatest value
       supported by the file system that is not greater than the current
       time. If <i>utimensat</i>() is passed a relative path in the <i>path</i>
       argument, the file to be used shall be relative to the directory
       associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the current
       working directory. If the access mode of the open file
       description associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH,
       the function shall check whether directory searches are permitted
       using the current permissions of the directory underlying the
       file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function
       shall not perform the check.

       If <i>utimensat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used.

       Only a process with the effective user ID equal to the user ID of
       the file, or with write access to the file, or with appropriate
       privileges may use <i>futimens</i>() or <i>utimensat</i>() with a null pointer
       as the <i>times</i> argument or with both <i>tv_nsec</i> fields set to the
       special value UTIME_NOW. Only a process with the effective user
       ID equal to the user ID of the file or with appropriate
       privileges may use <i>futimens</i>() or <i>utimensat</i>() with a non-null
       <i>times</i> argument that does not have both <i>tv_nsec</i> fields set to
       UTIME_NOW and does not have both <i>tv_nsec</i> fields set to
       UTIME_OMIT. If both <i>tv_nsec</i> fields are set to UTIME_OMIT, no
       ownership or permissions check shall be performed for the file,
       but other error conditions may still be detected (including
       <b>[EACCES] </b>errors related to the path prefix).

       Values for the <i>flag</i> argument of <i>utimensat</i>() are constructed by a
       bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list, defined in
       <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>:

       AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
             If <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, then the access and
             modification times of the symbolic link are changed.

       Upon successful completion, <i>futimens</i>() and <i>utimensat</i>() shall mark
       the last file status change timestamp for update, with the
       exception that if both <i>tv_nsec</i> fields are set to UTIME_OMIT, the
       file status change timestamp need not be marked for update.

       The <i>utimes</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>utimensat</i>()
       function with the special value AT_FDCWD as the <i>fd</i> argument and
       the <i>flag</i> argument set to zero, except that the <i>times</i> argument is
       a <b>timeval </b>structure rather than a <b>timespec </b>structure, and
       accuracy is only to the microsecond, not nanosecond, and rounding
       towards the nearest second may occur.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
       Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error. If -1 is returned, the file times shall not
       be affected.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The <i>times</i> argument is a null pointer, or both <i>tv_nsec</i>
              values are UTIME_NOW, and the effective user ID of the
              process does not match the owner of the file and write
              access is denied.

       <b>EINVAL </b>Either of the <i>times</i> argument structures specified a
              <i>tv_nsec</i> value that was neither UTIME_NOW nor UTIME_OMIT,
              and was a value less than zero or greater than or equal to
              1000 million.

       <b>EINVAL </b>A new file timestamp would be a value whose <i>tv_sec</i>
              component is not a value supported by the file system.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The <i>times</i> argument is not a null pointer, does not have
              both <i>tv_nsec</i> fields set to UTIME_NOW, does not have both
              <i>tv_nsec</i> fields set to UTIME_OMIT, the calling process'
              effective user ID does not match the owner of the file,
              and the calling process does not have appropriate
              privileges.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The file system containing the file is read-only.

       The <i>futimens</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fd</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       The <i>utimensat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd</i> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path</i> argument does not specify an absolute path and
              the <i>fd</i> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
              descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument is not an absolute path and <i>fd</i> is a file
              descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       The <i>utimensat</i>() and <i>utimes</i>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied by a component of the path
              prefix.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       The <i>utimensat</i>() and <i>utimes</i>() functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The <i>utimensat</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>flag</i> argument is not valid.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The purpose of the <i>utimensat</i>() function is to set the access and
       modification time of files in directories other than the current
       working directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part
       of the path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to
       <i>utimes</i>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file
       descriptor for the target directory and using the <i>utimensat</i>()
       function it can be guaranteed that the changed file is located
       relative to the desired directory.

       The standard developers considered including a special case for
       the permissions required by <i>utimensat</i>() when one <i>tv_nsec</i> field is
       UTIME_NOW and the other is UTIME_OMIT. One possibility would be
       to include this case in with the cases where <i>times</i> is a null
       pointer or both fields are UTIME_NOW, where the call is allowed
       if the process has write permission for the file. However,
       associating write permission with an update to just the last data
       access timestamp (which is normally updated by <i>read</i>()) did not
       seem appropriate. The other possibility would be to specify that
       this one case is allowed if the process has read permission, but
       this was felt to be too great a departure from the <i>utime</i>() and
       <i>utimes</i>() functions on which <i>utimensat</i>() is based. If an
       application needs to set the last data access timestamp to the
       current time for a file on which it has read permission but is
       not the owner, it can do so by opening the file, reading one or
       more bytes (or reading a directory entry, if the file is a
       directory), and then closing it.
