</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pam_get_item </b>function allows applications and PAM service
       modules to access and retrieve PAM information of <i>item_type</i>. Upon
       successful return, <i>item</i> contains a pointer to the value of the
       corresponding item. Note, this is a pointer to the <i>actual</i> data
       and should <b>not </b>be <i>free()</i>'ed or over-written! The following values
       are supported for <i>item_type</i>:

       PAM_SERVICE
           The service name (which identifies that PAM stack that the
           PAM functions will use to authenticate the program).

       PAM_USER
           The username of the entity under whose identity service will
           be given. That is, following authentication, <i>PAM_USER</i>
           identifies the local entity that gets to use the service.
           Note, this value can be mapped from something (eg.,
           "anonymous") to something else (eg. "guest119") by any module
           in the PAM stack. As such an application should consult the
           value of <i>PAM_USER</i> after each call to a PAM function.

       PAM_USER_PROMPT
           The string used when prompting for a user's name. The default
           value for this string is a localized version of "login: ".

       PAM_TTY
           The terminal name: prefixed by /dev/ if it is a device file;
           for graphical, X-based, applications the value for this item
           should be the <i>$DISPLAY</i> variable.

       PAM_RUSER
           The requesting user name: local name for a locally requesting
           user or a remote user name for a remote requesting user.

           Generally an application or module will attempt to supply the
           value that is most strongly authenticated (a local account
           before a remote one. The level of trust in this value is
           embodied in the actual authentication stack associated with
           the application, so it is ultimately at the discretion of the
           system administrator.

           <i>PAM_RUSER@PAM_RHOST</i> should always identify the requesting
           user. In some cases, <i>PAM_RUSER</i> may be NULL. In such
           situations, it is unclear who the requesting entity is.

       PAM_RHOST
           The requesting hostname (the hostname of the machine from
           which the <i>PAM_RUSER</i> entity is requesting service). That is
           <i>PAM_RUSER@PAM_RHOST</i> does identify the requesting user. In
           some applications, <i>PAM_RHOST</i> may be NULL. In such situations,
           it is unclear where the authentication request is originating
           from.

       PAM_AUTHTOK
           The authentication token (often a password). This token
           should be ignored by all module functions besides
           <a href="pam_sm_authenticate.3.html">pam_sm_authenticate(3)</a> and <a href="pam_sm_chauthtok.3.html">pam_sm_chauthtok(3)</a>. In the former
           function it is used to pass the most recent authentication
           token from one stacked module to another. In the latter
           function the token is used for another purpose. It contains
           the currently active authentication token.

       PAM_OLDAUTHTOK
           The old authentication token. This token should be ignored by
           all module functions except <a href="pam_sm_chauthtok.3.html">pam_sm_chauthtok(3)</a>.

       PAM_CONV
           The pam_conv structure. See <a href="pam_conv.3.html">pam_conv(3)</a>.

       The following additional items are specific to Linux-PAM and
       should not be used in portable applications:

       PAM_FAIL_DELAY
           A function pointer to redirect centrally managed failure
           delays. See <a href="pam_fail_delay.3.html">pam_fail_delay(3)</a>.

       PAM_XDISPLAY
           The name of the X display. For graphical, X-based
           applications the value for this item should be the <i>$DISPLAY</i>
           variable. This value may be used independently of <i>PAM_TTY</i> for
           passing the name of the display.

       PAM_XAUTHDATA
           A pointer to a structure containing the X authentication data
           required to make a connection to the display specified by
           <i>PAM_XDISPLAY</i>, if such information is necessary. See
           <a href="pam_xauth_data.3.html">pam_xauth_data(3)</a>.

       PAM_AUTHTOK_TYPE
           The default action is for the module to use the following
           prompts when requesting passwords: "New UNIX password: " and
           "Retype UNIX password: ". The example word <i>UNIX</i> can be
           replaced with this item, by default it is empty. This item is
           used by <a href="pam_get_authtok.3.html">pam_get_authtok(3)</a>.

       If a service module wishes to obtain the name of the user, it
       should not use this function, but instead perform a call to
       <a href="pam_get_user.3.html">pam_get_user(3)</a>.

       Only a service module is privileged to read the authentication
       tokens, PAM_AUTHTOK and PAM_OLDAUTHTOK.
