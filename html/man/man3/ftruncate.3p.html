PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ftruncate — truncate a file to a specified length
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int ftruncate(int <i>fildes</i>, off_t <i>length</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>fildes</i> is not a valid file descriptor open for writing, the
       <i>ftruncate</i>() function shall fail.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a regular file, the <i>ftruncate</i>() function
       shall cause the size of the file to be truncated to <i>length</i>.  If
       the size of the file previously exceeded <i>length</i>, the extra data
       shall no longer be available to reads on the file. If the file
       previously was smaller than this size, <i>ftruncate</i>() shall increase
       the size of the file. If the file size is increased, the extended
       area shall appear as if it were zero-filled. The value of the
       seek pointer shall not be modified by a call to <i>ftruncate</i>().

       Upon successful completion, if <i>fildes</i> refers to a regular file,
       <i>ftruncate</i>() shall mark for update the last data modification and
       last file status change timestamps of the file and the S_ISUID
       and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may be cleared. If the
       <i>ftruncate</i>() function is unsuccessful, the file is unaffected.

       If the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file
       size limit for the process, the request shall fail and the
       implementation shall generate the SIGXFSZ signal for the thread.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a directory, <i>ftruncate</i>() shall fail.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to any other file type, except a shared memory
       object, the result is unspecified.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory object, <i>ftruncate</i>() shall set
       the size of the shared memory object to <i>length</i>.

       If the effect of <i>ftruncate</i>() is to decrease the size of a memory
       mapped file or a shared memory object and whole pages beyond the
       new end were previously mapped, then the whole pages beyond the
       new end shall be discarded.

       References to discarded pages shall result in the generation of a
       SIGBUS signal.

       If the effect of <i>ftruncate</i>() is to increase the size of a memory
       object, it is unspecified whether the contents of any mapped
       pages between the old end-of-file and the new are flushed to the
       underlying object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>ftruncate</i>() shall return 0;
       otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ftruncate</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during execution.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>length</i> argument was less than 0.

       <b>EFBIG </b>or <b>EINVAL</b>
              The <i>length</i> argument was greater than the maximum file
              size.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>The file is a regular file and <i>length</i> is greater than the
              offset maximum established in the open file description
              associated with <i>fildes</i>.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a
              file system.

       <b>EBADF </b>or <b>EINVAL</b>
              The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a file descriptor open for
              writing.
