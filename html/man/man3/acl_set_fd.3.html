</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>acl_set_fd </b>— set an ACL by file descriptor
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;<i>sys/types.h</i>&gt; &lt;<i>sys/acl.h</i>&gt; <i>int</i> <b>acl_set_fd</b>(<i>int fd</i>, <i>acl_t acl</i>)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>acl_set_fd</b>() function associates an access ACL with the file
       referred to by <i>fd</i>.

       The effective user ID of the process must match the owner of the
       file or the process must have the CAP_FOWNER capability for the
       request to succeed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>acl_set_fd</b>() function returns the value 0 if successful;
       otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global variable <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If any of the following conditions occur, the <b>acl_set_fd</b>()
       function returns the value <b>-1 </b>and and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the
       corresponding value:

       [EBADF]            The <i>fd</i> argument is not a valid file
                          descriptor.

       [EINVAL]           The argument <i>acl</i> does not point to a valid
                          ACL.

                          The ACL has more entries than the file
                          referred to by <i>fd</i> can obtain.

       [ENOSPC]           The directory or file system that would
                          contain the new ACL cannot be extended or the
                          file system is out of file allocation
                          resources.

       [ENOTSUP]          The file identified by <i>fd</i> cannot be associated
                          with the ACL because the file system on which
                          the file is located does not support this.

       [EPERM]            The process does not have appropriate
                          privilege to perform the operation to set the
                          ACL.

       [EROFS]            This function requires modification of a file
                          system which is currently read-only.
