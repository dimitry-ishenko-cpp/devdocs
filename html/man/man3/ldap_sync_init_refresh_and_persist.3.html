</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These routines provide an interface to the LDAP Content
       Synchronization operation (RFC 4533).  They require an
       <b>ldap_sync_t </b>structure to be set up with parameters required for
       various phases of the operation; this includes setting some
       handlers for special events.  All handlers take a pointer to the
       <b>ldap_sync_t </b>structure as the first argument, and a pointer to the
       <b>LDAPMessage </b>structure as received from the server by the client
       library, plus, occasionally, other specific arguments.

       The members of the <b>ldap_sync_t </b>structure are:

       <b>char *</b><i>ls_base</i>
              The search base; by default, the <b>BASE </b>option in
              <a href="../man5/ldap.conf.5.html">ldap.conf(5)</a>.

       <b>int </b><i>ls_scope</i>
              The search scope (one of <b>LDAP_SCOPE_BASE</b>,
              <b>LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL</b>, <b>LDAP_SCOPE_SUBORDINATE </b>or
              <b>LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE</b>; see <b>ldap.h </b>for details).

       <b>char *</b><i>ls_filter</i>
              The filter (RFC 4515); by default, <b>(objectClass=*)</b>.

       <b>char **</b><i>ls_attrs</i>
              The requested attributes; by default <b>NULL</b>, indicating all
              user attributes.

       <b>int </b><i>ls_timelimit</i>
              The requested time limit (in seconds); by default <b>0</b>, to
              indicate no limit.

       <b>int </b><i>ls_sizelimit</i>
              The requested size limit (in entries); by default <b>0</b>, to
              indicate no limit.

       <b>int </b><i>ls_timeout</i>
              The desired timeout during polling with <a href="ldap_sync_poll.3.html">ldap_sync_poll(3)</a>.
              A value of <b>-1 </b>means that polling is blocking, so
              <a href="ldap_sync_poll.3.html">ldap_sync_poll(3)</a> will not return until a message is
              received; a value of <b>0 </b>means that polling returns
              immediately, no matter if any response is available or
              not; a positive value represents the timeout the
              <a href="ldap_sync_poll.3.html">ldap_sync_poll(3)</a> function will wait for response before
              returning, unless a message is received; in that case,
              <a href="ldap_sync_poll.3.html">ldap_sync_poll(3)</a> returns as soon as the message is
              available.

       <b>ldap_sync_search_entry_f </b><i>ls_search_entry</i>
              A function that is called whenever an entry is returned.
              The <b>msg </b>argument is the <b>LDAPMessage </b>that contains the
              searchResultEntry; it can be parsed using the regular
              client API routines, like <a href="ldap_get_dn.3.html">ldap_get_dn(3)</a>,
              <a href="ldap_first_attribute.3.html">ldap_first_attribute(3)</a>, and so on.  The <b>entryUUID</b>
              argument contains the entryUUID of the entry.  The <b>phase</b>
              argument indicates the type of operation: one of
              <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_PRESENT</b>, <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_ADD</b>,
              <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_MODIFY</b>, <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_DELETE</b>; in case of
              <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_PRESENT </b>or <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_DELETE</b>, only the
              DN is contained in the <i>LDAPMessage</i>; in case of
              <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_MODIFY</b>, the whole entry is contained in the
              <i>LDAPMessage</i>, and the application is responsible of
              determining the differences between the new view of the
              entry provided by the caller and the data already known.

       <b>ldap_sync_search_reference_f </b><i>ls_search_reference</i>
              A function that is called whenever a search reference is
              returned.  The <b>msg </b>argument is the <b>LDAPMessage </b>that
              contains the searchResultReference; it can be parsed using
              the regular client API routines, like
              <a href="ldap_parse_reference.3.html">ldap_parse_reference(3)</a>.

       <b>ldap_sync_intermediate_f </b><i>ls_intermediate</i>
              A function that is called whenever something relevant
              occurs during the refresh phase of the search, which is
              marked by an <i>intermediateResponse</i> message type.  The <b>msg</b>
              argument is the <b>LDAPMessage </b>that contains the intermediate
              response; it can be parsed using the regular client API
              routines, like <a href="ldap_parse_intermediate.3.html">ldap_parse_intermediate(3)</a>.  The <b>syncUUIDs</b>
              argument contains an array of UUIDs of the entries that
              depends on the value of the <b>phase </b>argument.  In case of
              <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_PRESENTS</b>, the "present" phase is being
              entered; this means that the following sequence of results
              will consist in entries in "present" sync state.  In case
              of <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_DELETES</b>, the "deletes" phase is being
              entered; this means that the following sequence of results
              will consist in entries in "delete" sync state.  In case
              of <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_PRESENTS_IDSET</b>, the message contains a
              set of UUIDs of entries that are present; it replaces a
              "presents" phase.  In case of
              <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_DELETES_IDSET</b>, the message contains a set
              of UUIDs of entries that have been deleted; it replaces a
              "deletes" phase.  In case of <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_DONE, </b>a
              "presents" phase with "refreshDone" set to "TRUE" has been
              returned to indicate that the refresh phase of
              refreshAndPersist is over, and the client should start
              polling.  Except for the <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_PRESENTS_IDSET </b>and
              <b>LDAP_SYNC_CAPI_DELETES_IDSET </b>cases, <b>syncUUIDs </b>is NULL.

       <b>ldap_sync_search_result_f </b><i>ls_search_result</i>
              A function that is called whenever a searchResultDone is
              returned.  In refreshAndPersist this can only occur when
              the server decides that the search must be interrupted.
              The <b>msg </b>argument is the <b>LDAPMessage </b>that contains the
              response; it can be parsed using the regular client API
              routines, like <a href="ldap_parse_result.3.html">ldap_parse_result(3)</a>.  The <b>refreshDeletes</b>
              argument is not relevant in this case; it should always be
              -1.

       <b>void *</b><i>ls_private</i>
              A pointer to private data.  The client may register here a
              pointer to data the handlers above may need.

       <b>LDAP *</b><i>ls_ld</i>
              A pointer to a LDAP structure that is used to connect to
              the server.  It is the responsibility of the client to
              initialize the structure and to provide appropriate
              authentication and security in place.
</pre> <h2>
GENERAL USE </h2>
<pre>
       A <b>ldap_sync_t </b>structure is initialized by calling
       <b>ldap_sync_initialize</b>(3).  This simply clears out the contents of
       an already existing <b>ldap_sync_t </b>structure, and sets appropriate
       values for some members.  After that, the caller is responsible
       for setting up the connection (member <b>ls_ld</b>), eventually setting
       up transport security (TLS), for binding and any other
       initialization.  The caller must also fill all the documented
       search-related fields of the <b>ldap_sync_t </b>structure.

       At the end of a session, the structure can be cleaned up by
       calling <b>ldap_sync_destroy</b>(3), which takes care of freeing all
       data assuming it was allocated by <b>ldap_mem*</b>(3) routines.
       Otherwise, the caller should take care of destroying and zeroing
       out the documented search-related fields, and call
       <b>ldap_sync_destroy</b>(3) to free undocumented members set by the API.
</pre> <h2>
REFRESH ONLY </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>refreshOnly </b>functionality is obtained by periodically calling
       <a href="ldap_sync_init.3.html">ldap_sync_init(3)</a> with mode set to <b>LDAP_SYNC_REFRESH_ONLY</b>, or,
       which is equivalent, by directly calling
       <a href="ldap_sync_init_refresh_only.3.html">ldap_sync_init_refresh_only(3)</a>.  The state of the search, and the
       consistency of the search parameters, is preserved across calls
       by passing the <b>ldap_sync_t </b>structure as left by the previous
       call.
</pre> <h2>
REFRESH AND PERSIST </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>refreshAndPersist </b>functionality is obtained by calling
       <a href="ldap_sync_init.3.html">ldap_sync_init(3)</a> with mode set to <b>LDAP_SYNC_REFRESH_AND_PERSIST</b>,
       or, which is equivalent, by directly calling
       <a href="ldap_sync_init_refresh_and_persist.3.html">ldap_sync_init_refresh_and_persist(3)</a> and, after a successful
       return, by repeatedly polling with <a href="ldap_sync_poll.3.html">ldap_sync_poll(3)</a> according to
       the desired pattern.

       A client may insert a call to <a href="ldap_sync_poll.3.html">ldap_sync_poll(3)</a> into an external
       loop to check if any modification was returned; in this case, it
       might be appropriate to set <b>ls_timeout </b>to 0, or to set it to a
       finite, small value.  Otherwise, if the client's main purpose
       consists in waiting for responses, a timeout of -1 is most
       suitable, so that the function only returns after some data has
       been received and handled.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       All routines return any LDAP error resulting from a lower-level
       error in the API calls they are based on, or LDAP_SUCCESS in case
       of success.  <a href="ldap_sync_poll.3.html">ldap_sync_poll(3)</a> may return
       <b>LDAP_SYNC_REFRESH_REQUIRED </b>if a full refresh is requested by the
       server.  In this case, it is appropriate to call
       <a href="ldap_sync_init.3.html">ldap_sync_init(3)</a> again, passing the same <b>ldap_sync_t </b>structure
       as resulted from any previous call.
