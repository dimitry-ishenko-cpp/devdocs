NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lockf — record locking on files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int lockf(int <i>fildes</i>, int <i>function</i>, off_t <i>size</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>lockf</i>() function shall lock sections of a file with advisory-
       mode locks. Calls to <i>lockf</i>() from threads in other processes
       which attempt to lock the locked file section shall either return
       an error value or block until the section becomes unlocked. All
       the locks for a process are removed when the process terminates.
       Record locking with <i>lockf</i>() shall be supported for regular files
       and may be supported for other files.

       The <i>fildes</i> argument is an open file descriptor. To establish a
       lock with this function, the file descriptor shall be opened with
       write-only permission (O_WRONLY) or with read/write permission
       (O_RDWR).

       The <i>function</i> argument is a control value which specifies the
       action to be taken. The permissible values for <i>function</i> are
       defined in <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> as follows:
         ┌──────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
         │ <b>Function </b>│                 <b>Description                  </b>│
         ├──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
         │ F_ULOCK  │ Unlock locked sections.                      │
         │ F_LOCK   │ Lock a section for exclusive use.            │
         │ F_TLOCK  │ Test and lock a section for exclusive use.   │
         │ F_TEST   │ Test a section for locks by other processes. │
         └──────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

       F_TEST shall detect if a lock by another process is present on
       the specified section.

       F_LOCK and F_TLOCK shall both lock a section of a file if the
       section is available.

       F_ULOCK shall remove locks from a section of the file.

       The <i>size</i> argument is the number of contiguous bytes to be locked
       or unlocked.  The section to be locked or unlocked starts at the
       current offset in the file and extends forward for a positive
       size or backward for a negative size (the preceding bytes up to
       but not including the current offset). If <i>size</i> is 0, the section
       from the current offset through the largest possible file offset
       shall be locked (that is, from the current offset through the
       present or any future end-of-file). An area need not be allocated
       to the file to be locked because locks may exist past the end-of-
       file.

       The sections locked with F_LOCK or F_TLOCK may, in whole or in
       part, contain or be contained by a previously locked section for
       the same process. When this occurs, or if adjacent locked
       sections would occur, the sections shall be combined into a
       single locked section. If the request would cause the number of
       locks to exceed a system-imposed limit, the request shall fail.

       F_LOCK and F_TLOCK requests differ only by the action taken if
       the section is not available. F_LOCK shall block the calling
       thread until the section is available. F_TLOCK shall cause the
       function to fail if the section is already locked by another
       process.

       File locks shall be released on first close by the locking
       process of any file descriptor for the file.

       F_ULOCK requests may release (wholly or in part) one or more
       locked sections controlled by the process. Locked sections shall
       be unlocked starting at the current file offset through <i>size</i>
       bytes or to the end-of-file if <i>size</i> is (<b>off_t</b>)0. When all of a
       locked section is not released (that is, when the beginning or
       end of the area to be unlocked falls within a locked section),
       the remaining portions of that section shall remain locked by the
       process. Releasing the center portion of a locked section shall
       cause the remaining locked beginning and end portions to become
       two separate locked sections. If the request would cause the
       number of locks in the system to exceed a system-imposed limit,
       the request shall fail.

       A potential for deadlock occurs if the threads of a process
       controlling a locked section are blocked by accessing a locked
       section of another process. If the system detects that deadlock
       would occur, <i>lockf</i>() shall fail with an <b>[EDEADLK] </b>error.

       The interaction between <i>fcntl</i>() and <i>lockf</i>() locks is unspecified.

       Blocking on a section shall be interrupted by any signal.

       An F_ULOCK request in which <i>size</i> is non-zero and the offset of
       the last byte of the requested section is the maximum value for
       an object of type <b>off_t</b>, when the process has an existing lock in
       which <i>size</i> is 0 and which includes the last byte of the requested
       section, shall be treated as a request to unlock from the start
       of the requested section with a size equal to 0. Otherwise, an
       F_ULOCK request shall attempt to unlock only the requested
       section.

       Attempting to lock a section of a file that is associated with a
       buffered stream produces unspecified results.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>lockf</i>() shall return 0. Otherwise, it
       shall return -1, set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate an error, and existing
       locks shall not be changed.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>lockf</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid open file descriptor;
              or <i>function</i> is F_LOCK or F_TLOCK and <i>fildes</i> is not a valid
              file descriptor open for writing.

       <b>EACCES </b>or <b>EAGAIN</b>
              The <i>function</i> argument is F_TLOCK or F_TEST and the section
              is already locked by another process.

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              The <i>function</i> argument is F_LOCK and a deadlock is
              detected.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during execution of the function.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>function</i> argument is not one of F_LOCK, F_TLOCK,
              F_TEST, or F_ULOCK; or <i>size</i> plus the current file offset
              is less than 0.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The offset of the first, or if <i>size</i> is not 0 then the
              last, byte in the requested section cannot be represented
              correctly in an object of type <b>off_t</b>.

       The <i>lockf</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The <i>function</i> argument is F_LOCK or F_TLOCK and the file is
              mapped with <i>mmap</i>().

       <b>EDEADLK </b>or <b>ENOLCK</b>
              The <i>function</i> argument is F_LOCK, F_TLOCK, or F_ULOCK, and
              the request would cause the number of locks to exceed a
              system-imposed limit.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP </b>or <b>EINVAL</b>
              The implementation does not support the locking of files
              of the type indicated by the <i>fildes</i> argument.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Locking a Portion of a File</b>
       In the following example, a file named <b>/home/cnd/mod1 </b>is being
       modified. Other processes that use locking are prevented from
       changing it during this process. Only the first 10000 bytes are
       locked, and the lock call fails if another process has any part
       of this area locked already.

           #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

           int fildes;
           int status;
           ...
           fildes = open("/home/cnd/mod1", O_RDWR);
           status = lockf(fildes, F_TLOCK, (off_t)10000);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Record-locking should not be used in combination with the
       <i>fopen</i>(), <i>fread</i>(), <i>fwrite</i>(), and other <i>stdio</i> functions. Instead,
       the more primitive, non-buffered functions (such as <i>open</i>())
       should be used. Unexpected results may occur in processes that do
       buffering in the user address space. The process may later
       read/write data which is/was locked. The <i>stdio</i> functions are the
       most common source of unexpected buffering.

       The <i>alarm</i>() function may be used to provide a timeout facility in
       applications requiring it.
