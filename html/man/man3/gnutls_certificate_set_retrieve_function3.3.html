NAME </h2>

       gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function3 - API function
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;gnutls/abstract.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void</b>
       <b>gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function3(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t</b>
       <i>cred</i><b>, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function3 * </b><i>func</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t cred
                   is a <b>gnutls_certificate_credentials_t </b>type.

       gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function3 * func
                   is the callback function
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This function sets a callback to be called in order to retrieve
       the certificate and OCSP responses to be used in the handshake.
       <i>func</i> will be called only if the peer requests a certificate
       either during handshake or during post-handshake authentication.

       The callback's function prototype is defined in `abstract.h':

       int gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function3( gnutls_session_t,
       const struct gnutls_cert_retr_st *info, gnutls_pcert_st **certs,
       unsigned int *certs_length, gnutls_ocsp_data_st **ocsp, unsigned
       int *ocsp_length, gnutls_privkey_t *privkey, unsigned int
       *flags);

       The info field of the callback contains:
        <i>req_ca_dn</i> which is a list with the CA names that the server
       considers trusted.  This is a hint and typically the client
       should send a certificate that is signed by one of these CAs.
       These names, when available, are DER encoded. To get a more
       meaningful value use the function <b>gnutls_x509_rdn_get()</b>.
        <i>pk_algos</i> contains a list with server's acceptable public key
       algorithms.  The certificate returned should support the server's
       given algorithms.

       The callback should fill-in the following values:

        <i>certs</i> should contain an allocated list of certificates and
       public keys.
        <i>certs_length</i> is the size of the previous list.
        <i>ocsp</i> should contain an allocated list of OCSP responses.
        <i>ocsp_length</i> is the size of the previous list.
        <i>privkey</i> is the private key.

       If flags in the callback are set to <b>GNUTLS_CERT_RETR_DEINIT_ALL</b>
       then all provided values must be allocated using <b>gnutls_malloc()</b>,
       and will be released by gnutls; otherwise they will not be
       touched by gnutls.

       The callback function should set the certificate and OCSP
       response list to be sent, and return 0 on success. If no
       certificates are available, the  <i>certs_length</i> and  <i>ocsp_length</i>
       should be set to zero. The return value (-1) indicates error and
       the handshake will be terminated. If both certificates are set in
       the credentials and a callback is available, the callback takes
       predence.

       Raw public-keys: In case raw public-keys are negotiated as
       certificate type, certificates that would normally hold the
       public-key material are not available. In that case,
        <i>certs</i> contains an allocated list with only the public key. Since
       there is no certificate, there is also no certificate status.
       Therefore, OCSP information should not be set.
