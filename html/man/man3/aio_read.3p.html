NAME </h2>
<pre>
       aio_read — asynchronous read from a file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;aio.h&gt;

       int aio_read(struct aiocb *<i>aiocbp</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_read</i>() function shall read <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> from the
       file associated with <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i> into the buffer pointed
       to by <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_buf</i>. The function call shall return when the
       read request has been initiated or queued to the file or device
       (even when the data cannot be delivered immediately).

       If prioritized I/O is supported for this file, then the
       asynchronous operation shall be submitted at a priority equal to
       a base scheduling priority minus <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_reqprio</i>. If Thread
       Execution Scheduling is not supported, then the base scheduling
       priority is that of the calling process;
       otherwise, the base scheduling priority is that of the calling
       thread.

       The <i>aiocbp</i> value may be used as an argument to <i>aio_error</i>() and
       <i>aio_return</i>() in order to determine the error status and return
       status, respectively, of the asynchronous operation while it is
       proceeding. If an error condition is encountered during queuing,
       the function call shall return without having initiated or queued
       the request. The requested operation takes place at the absolute
       position in the file as given by <i>aio_offset</i>, as if <i>lseek</i>() were
       called immediately prior to the operation with an <i>offset</i> equal to
       <i>aio_offset</i> and a <i>whence</i> equal to SEEK_SET.  After a successful
       call to enqueue an asynchronous I/O operation, the value of the
       file offset for the file is unspecified.

       The <i>aio_sigevent</i> member specifies the notification which occurs
       when the request is completed.

       The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_lio_opcode</i> field shall be ignored by <i>aio_read</i>().

       The <i>aiocbp</i> argument points to an <b>aiocb </b>structure. If the buffer
       pointed to by <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_buf</i> or the control block pointed to by
       <i>aiocbp</i> becomes an illegal address prior to asynchronous I/O
       completion, then the behavior is undefined.

       Simultaneous asynchronous operations using the same <i>aiocbp</i>
       produce undefined results.

       If synchronized I/O is enabled on the file associated with
       <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>, the behavior of this function shall be
       according to the definitions of synchronized I/O data integrity
       completion and synchronized I/O file integrity completion.

       For any system action that changes the process memory space while
       an asynchronous I/O is outstanding to the address range being
       changed, the result of that action is undefined.

       For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset
       maximum established in the open file description associated with
       <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_read</i>() function shall return the value zero if the I/O
       operation is successfully queued; otherwise, the function shall
       return the value -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_read</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The requested asynchronous I/O operation was not queued
              due to system resource limitations.

       Each of the following conditions may be detected synchronously at
       the time of the call to <i>aio_read</i>(), or asynchronously. If any of
       the conditions below are detected synchronously, the <i>aio_read</i>()
       function shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the corresponding
       value. If any of the conditions below are detected
       asynchronously, the return status of the asynchronous operation
       is set to -1, and the error status of the asynchronous operation
       is set to the corresponding value.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i> argument is not a valid file
              descriptor open for reading.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The file offset value implied by <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> would
              be invalid,
              <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_reqprio</i> is not a valid value, or
              <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> is an invalid value.

       In the case that the <i>aio_read</i>() successfully queues the I/O
       operation but the operation is subsequently canceled or
       encounters an error, the return status of the asynchronous
       operation is one of the values normally returned by the <i>read</i>()
       function call. In addition, the error status of the asynchronous
       operation is set to one of the error statuses normally set by the
       <i>read</i>() function call, or one of the following values:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i> argument is not a valid file
              descriptor open for reading.

       <b>ECANCELED</b>
              The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O completed
              due to an explicit <i>aio_cancel</i>() request.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The file offset value implied by <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> would
              be invalid.

       The following condition may be detected synchronously or
       asynchronously:

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The file is a regular file, <i>aiobcp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> is greater
              than 0, and the starting offset in <i>aiobcp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> is
              before the end-of-file and is at or beyond the offset
              maximum in the open file description associated with
              <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.
