PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fdopendir, opendir — open directory associated with file
       descriptor
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;

       DIR *fdopendir(int <i>fd</i>);
       DIR *opendir(const char *<i>dirname</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fdopendir</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>opendir</i>()
       function except that the directory is specified by a file
       descriptor rather than by a name. The file offset associated with
       the file descriptor at the time of the call determines which
       entries are returned.

       Upon successful return from <i>fdopendir</i>(), the file descriptor is
       under the control of the system, and if any attempt is made to
       close the file descriptor, or to modify the state of the
       associated description, other than by means of <i>closedir</i>(),
       <i>readdir</i>(), <i>readdir_r</i>(), <i>rewinddir</i>(), or <i>seekdir</i>(), the behavior
       is undefined. Upon calling <i>closedir</i>() the file descriptor shall
       be closed.

       It is unspecified whether the FD_CLOEXEC flag will be set on the
       file descriptor by a successful call to <i>fdopendir</i>().

       The <i>opendir</i>() function shall open a directory stream
       corresponding to the directory named by the <i>dirname</i> argument. The
       directory stream is positioned at the first entry. If the type
       <b>DIR </b>is implemented using a file descriptor, applications shall
       only be able to open up to a total of {OPEN_MAX} files and
       directories.

       If the type <b>DIR </b>is implemented using a file descriptor, the
       descriptor shall be obtained as if the O_DIRECTORY flag was
       passed to <i>open</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a
       pointer to an object of type <b>DIR</b>.  Otherwise, these functions
       shall return a null pointer and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fdopendir</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fd</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor open for
              reading.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The descriptor <i>fd</i> is not associated with a directory.

       The <i>opendir</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied for the component of the path
              prefix of <i>dirname</i> or read permission is denied for
              <i>dirname</i>.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>dirname</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>dirname</i> does not name an existing directory
              or <i>dirname</i> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of <i>dirname</i> names an existing file that is
              neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       The <i>opendir</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>dirname</i> argument.

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENFILE </b>Too many files are currently open in the system.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Open a Directory Stream</b>
       The following program fragment demonstrates how the <i>opendir</i>()
       function is used.

           #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;
           ...
               DIR *dir;
               struct dirent *dp;
           ...
               if ((dir = opendir (".")) == NULL) {
                   perror ("Cannot open .");
                   exit (1);
               }

               while ((dp = readdir (dir)) != NULL) {
           ...

   <b>Find And Open a File</b>
       The following program searches through a given directory looking
       for files whose name does not begin with a dot and whose size is
       larger than 1 MiB.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;
           #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

           int
           main(int argc, char *argv[])
           {
               struct stat statbuf;
               DIR *d;
               struct dirent *dp;
               int dfd, ffd;

               if ((d = fdopendir((dfd = open("./tmp", O_RDONLY)))) == NULL) {
                   fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open ./tmp directory\n");
                   exit(1);
               }
               while ((dp = readdir(d)) != NULL) {
                   if (dp-&gt;d_name[0] == '.')
                       continue;
                   /* there is a possible race condition here as the file
                    * could be renamed between the readdir and the open */
                   if ((ffd = openat(dfd, dp-&gt;d_name, O_RDONLY)) == -1) {
                       perror(dp-&gt;d_name);
                       continue;
                   }
                   if (fstat(ffd, &amp;statbuf) == 0 &amp;&amp; statbuf.st_size &gt; (1024*1024)) {
                       /* found it ... */
                       printf("%s: %jdK\n", dp-&gt;d_name,
                           (intmax_t)(statbuf.st_size / 1024));
                   }
                   close(ffd);
               }
               closedir(d); // note this implicitly closes dfd
               return 0;
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>opendir</i>() function should be used in conjunction with
       <i>readdir</i>(), <i>closedir</i>(), and <i>rewinddir</i>() to examine the contents of
       the directory (see the EXAMPLES section in <a href="readdir.3p.html">readdir(3p)</a>).  This
       method is recommended for portability.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The purpose of the <i>fdopendir</i>() function is to enable opening
       files in directories other than the current working directory
       without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a
       file could be changed in parallel to a call to <i>opendir</i>(),
       resulting in unspecified behavior.

       Based on historical implementations, the rules about file
       descriptors apply to directory streams as well. However, this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not mandate that the directory stream
       be implemented using file descriptors. The description of
       <i>closedir</i>() clarifies that if a file descriptor is used for the
       directory stream, it is mandatory that <i>closedir</i>() deallocate the
       file descriptor. When a file descriptor is used to implement the
       directory stream, it behaves as if the FD_CLOEXEC had been set
       for the file descriptor.

       The directory entries for dot and dot-dot are optional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not provide a way to test <i>a priori</i>
       for their existence because an application that is portable must
       be written to look for (and usually ignore) those entries.
       Writing code that presumes that they are the first two entries
       does not always work, as many implementations permit them to be
       other than the first two entries, with a ``normal'' entry
       preceding them. There is negligible value in providing a way to
       determine what the implementation does because the code to deal
       with dot and dot-dot must be written in any case and because such
       a flag would add to the list of those flags (which has proven in
       itself to be objectionable) and might be abused.

       Since the structure and buffer allocation, if any, for directory
       operations are defined by the implementation, this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 imposes no portability requirements for erroneous
       program constructs, erroneous data, or the use of unspecified
       values such as the use or referencing of a <i>dirp</i> value or a <b>dirent</b>
       structure value after a directory stream has been closed or after
       a <i>fork</i>() or one of the <i>exec</i> function calls.
