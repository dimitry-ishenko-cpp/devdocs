PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       setreuid — set real and effective user IDs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int setreuid(uid_t <i>ruid</i>, uid_t <i>euid</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setreuid</i>() function shall set the real and effective user IDs
       of the current process to the values specified by the <i>ruid</i> and
       <i>euid</i> arguments. If <i>ruid</i> or <i>euid</i> is -1, the corresponding
       effective or real user ID of the current process shall be left
       unchanged.

       A process with appropriate privileges can set either ID to any
       value.  An unprivileged process can only set the effective user
       ID if the <i>euid</i> argument is equal to either the real, effective,
       or saved user ID of the process.

       If the real user ID is being set (<i>ruid</i> is not -1), or the
       effective user ID is being set to a value not equal to the real
       user ID, then the saved set-user-ID of the current process shall
       be set equal to the new effective user ID.

       It is unspecified whether a process without appropriate
       privileges is permitted to change the real user ID to match the
       current effective user ID or saved set-user-ID of the process.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setreuid</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>ruid</i> or <i>euid</i> argument is invalid or out-
              of-range.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The current process does not have appropriate privileges,
              and either an attempt was made to change the effective
              user ID to a value other than the real user ID or the
              saved set-user-ID or an attempt was made to change the
              real user ID to a value not permitted by the
              implementation.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Setting the Effective User ID to the Real User ID</b>
       The following example sets the effective user ID of the calling
       process to the real user ID, so that files created later will be
       owned by the current user. It also sets the saved set-user-ID to
       the real user ID, so any future attempt to set the effective user
       ID back to its previous value will fail.

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           ...
           setreuid(getuid(), getuid());
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Earlier versions of this standard did not specify whether the
       saved set-user-ID was affected by <i>setreuid</i>() calls. This version
       specifies common existing practice that constitutes an important
       security feature. The ability to set both the effective user ID
       and saved set-user-ID to be the same as the real user ID means
       that any security weakness in code that is executed after that
       point cannot result in malicious code being executed with the
       previous effective user ID. Privileged applications could already
       do this using just <i>setuid</i>(), but for non-privileged applications
       the only standard method available is to use this feature of
       <i>setreuid</i>().
