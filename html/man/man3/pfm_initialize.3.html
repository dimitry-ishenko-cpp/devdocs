NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pfm_initialize - initialize library
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pfm_initialize(void);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is the first function that a program <b>must </b>call otherwise the
       library will not operate.  This function probes the underlying
       hardware looking for valid PMU event tables to activate.
       Multiple distinct PMU tables may be activated at the same time.

       The function must be called only once. If the function is called
       more than once, it does not execute the initialization multiple
       times, it simply returns the same value as for the first call.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN </h2>
<pre>
       The function returns whether or not it was successful, i.e., at
       least one PMU was activated. A return value of <b>PFMLIB_SUCCESS</b>
       indicates success, otherwise the value is an error code.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_NOTSUPP</b>
              No PMU was activated.
