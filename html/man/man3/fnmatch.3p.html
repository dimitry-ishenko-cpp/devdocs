NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fnmatch — match a filename string or a pathname
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;fnmatch.h&gt;

       int fnmatch(const char *<i>pattern</i>, const char *<i>string</i>, int <i>flags</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fnmatch</i>() function shall match patterns as described in the
       Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.13.1</i>,
       <i>Patterns Matching a Single Character</i> and <i>Section 2.13.2</i>, <i>Patterns</i>
       <i>Matching Multiple Characters</i>.  It checks the string specified by
       the <i>string</i> argument to see if it matches the pattern specified by
       the <i>pattern</i> argument.

       The <i>flags</i> argument shall modify the interpretation of <i>pattern</i> and
       <i>string</i>.  It is the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the
       flags defined in <i>&lt;fnmatch.h&gt;</i>.  If the FNM_PATHNAME flag is set in
       <i>flags</i>, then a &lt;slash&gt; character (<b>'/'</b>) in <i>string</i> shall be
       explicitly matched by a &lt;slash&gt; in <i>pattern</i>; it shall not be
       matched by either the &lt;asterisk&gt; or &lt;question-mark&gt; special
       characters, nor by a bracket expression. If the FNM_PATHNAME flag
       is not set, the &lt;slash&gt; character shall be treated as an ordinary
       character.

       If FNM_NOESCAPE is not set in <i>flags</i>, a &lt;backslash&gt; character in
       <i>pattern</i> followed by any other character shall match that second
       character in <i>string</i>.  In particular, <b>"\\" </b>shall match a
       &lt;backslash&gt; in <i>string</i>.  If <i>pattern</i> ends with an unescaped
       &lt;backslash&gt;, <i>fnmatch</i>() shall return a non-zero value (indicating
       either no match or an error).  If FNM_NOESCAPE is set, a
       &lt;backslash&gt; character shall be treated as an ordinary character.

       If FNM_PERIOD is set in <i>flags</i>, then a leading &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>)  in
       <i>string</i> shall match a &lt;period&gt; in <i>pattern</i>; as described by rule 2
       in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section</i>
       <i>2.13.3</i>, <i>Patterns Used for Filename Expansion</i> where the location
       of ``leading'' is indicated by the value of FNM_PATHNAME:

        *  If FNM_PATHNAME is set, a &lt;period&gt; is ``leading'' if it is
           the first character in <i>string</i> or if it immediately follows a
           &lt;slash&gt;.

        *  If FNM_PATHNAME is not set, a &lt;period&gt; is ``leading'' only if
           it is the first character of <i>string</i>.

       If FNM_PERIOD is not set, then no special restrictions are placed
       on matching a period.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>string</i> matches the pattern specified by <i>pattern</i>, then
       <i>fnmatch</i>() shall return 0. If there is no match, <i>fnmatch</i>() shall
       return FNM_NOMATCH, which is defined in <i>&lt;fnmatch.h&gt;</i>.  If an error
       occurs, <i>fnmatch</i>() shall return another non-zero value.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fnmatch</i>() function has two major uses. It could be used by an
       application or utility that needs to read a directory and apply a
       pattern against each entry. The <i>find</i> utility is an example of
       this. It can also be used by the <i>pax</i> utility to process its
       <i>pattern</i> operands, or by applications that need to match strings
       in a similar manner.

       The name <i>fnmatch</i>() is intended to imply <i>filename</i> match, rather
       than <i>pathname</i> match. The default action of this function is to
       match filename strings, rather than pathnames, since it gives no
       special significance to the &lt;slash&gt; character. With the
       FNM_PATHNAME flag, <i>fnmatch</i>() does match pathnames, but without
       tilde expansion, parameter expansion, or special treatment for a
       &lt;period&gt; at the beginning of a filename.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       This function replaced the REG_FILENAME flag of <i>regcomp</i>() in
       early proposals of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. It provides
       virtually the same functionality as the <i>regcomp</i>() and <i>regexec</i>()
       functions using the REG_FILENAME and REG_FSLASH flags (the
       REG_FSLASH flag was proposed for <i>regcomp</i>(), and would have had
       the opposite effect from FNM_PATHNAME), but with a simpler
       function and less system overhead.
