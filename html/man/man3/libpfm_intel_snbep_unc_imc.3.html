NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_snbep_unc_imc - support for Intel Sandy Bridge-EP
       Integrated Memory Controller (IMC)  uncore PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: snbep_unc_imc[0-3]</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Sandy Bridge-EP IMC uncore PMU</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Sandy Bridge Integrated Memory
       Controller (IMC) uncore PMU.  This PMU model only exists on Sandy
       Bridge model 45. There are four IMC PMUs per socket.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Sandy Bridge C-Box
       uncore PMU:

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count IMC cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This
              is a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to
              one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t      </b>Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the
              counter counts the number of IMC cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].
