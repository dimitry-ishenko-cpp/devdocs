SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int rename(const char *<i>old</i>, const char *<i>new</i>);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int renameat(int <i>oldfd</i>, const char *<i>old</i>, int <i>newfd</i>,
           const char *<i>new</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For <i>rename</i>(): The functionality described on this reference page
       is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is
       unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C
       standard.

       The <i>rename</i>() function shall change the name of a file. The <i>old</i>
       argument points to the pathname of the file to be renamed. The
       <i>new</i> argument points to the new pathname of the file.  If the <i>new</i>
       argument does not resolve to an existing directory entry for a
       file of type directory and the <i>new</i> argument contains at least one
       non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
       characters after all symbolic links have been processed, <i>rename</i>()
       shall fail.

       If either the <i>old</i> or <i>new</i> argument names a symbolic link, <i>rename</i>()
       shall operate on the symbolic link itself, and shall not resolve
       the last component of the argument. If the <i>old</i> argument and the
       <i>new</i> argument resolve to either the same existing directory entry
       or different directory entries for the same existing file,
       <i>rename</i>() shall return successfully and perform no other action.

       If the <i>old</i> argument points to the pathname of a file that is not
       a directory, the <i>new</i> argument shall not point to the pathname of
       a directory. If the link named by the <i>new</i> argument exists, it
       shall be removed and <i>old</i> renamed to <i>new</i>.  In this case, a link
       named <i>new</i> shall remain visible to other threads throughout the
       renaming operation and refer either to the file referred to by
       <i>new</i> or <i>old</i> before the operation began. Write access permission is
       required for both the directory containing <i>old</i> and the directory
       containing <i>new</i>.

       If the <i>old</i> argument points to the pathname of a directory, the
       <i>new</i> argument shall not point to the pathname of a file that is
       not a directory. If the directory named by the <i>new</i> argument
       exists, it shall be removed and <i>old</i> renamed to <i>new</i>.  In this
       case, a link named <i>new</i> shall exist throughout the renaming
       operation and shall refer either to the directory referred to by
       <i>new</i> or <i>old</i> before the operation began. If <i>new</i> names an existing
       directory, it shall be required to be an empty directory.

       If either <i>pathname</i> argument refers to a path whose final
       component is either dot or dot-dot, <i>rename</i>() shall fail.

       If the <i>old</i> argument points to a pathname of a symbolic link, the
       symbolic link shall be renamed. If the <i>new</i> argument points to a
       pathname of a symbolic link, the symbolic link shall be removed.

       The <i>old</i> pathname shall not name an ancestor directory of the <i>new</i>
       pathname. Write access permission is required for the directory
       containing <i>old</i> and the directory containing <i>new</i>.  If the <i>old</i>
       argument points to the pathname of a directory, write access
       permission may be required for the directory named by <i>old</i>, and,
       if it exists, the directory named by <i>new</i>.

       If the link named by the <i>new</i> argument exists and the file's link
       count becomes 0 when it is removed and no process has the file
       open, the space occupied by the file shall be freed and the file
       shall no longer be accessible. If one or more processes have the
       file open when the last link is removed, the link shall be
       removed before <i>rename</i>() returns, but the removal of the file
       contents shall be postponed until all references to the file are
       closed.

       Upon successful completion, <i>rename</i>() shall mark for update the
       last data modification and last file status change timestamps of
       the parent directory of each file.

       If the <i>rename</i>() function fails for any reason other than <b>[EIO]</b>,
       any file named by <i>new</i> shall be unaffected.

       The <i>renameat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>rename</i>()
       function except in the case where either <i>old</i> or <i>new</i> specifies a
       relative path. If <i>old</i> is a relative path, the file to be renamed
       is located relative to the directory associated with the file
       descriptor <i>oldfd</i> instead of the current working directory. If <i>new</i>
       is a relative path, the same happens only relative to the
       directory associated with <i>newfd</i>.  If the access mode of the open
       file description associated with the file descriptor is not
       O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory searches are
       permitted using the current permissions of the directory
       underlying the file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH,
       the function shall not perform the check.

       If <i>renameat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>oldfd</i>
       or <i>newfd</i> parameter, the current working directory shall be used
       in the determination of the file for the respective <i>path</i>
       parameter.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>rename</i>() function shall return 0.
       Otherwise, it shall return -1, <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the
       error, and neither the file named by <i>old</i> nor the file named by
       <i>new</i> shall be changed or created.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>renameat</i>() function shall return
       0. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>rename</i>() and <i>renameat</i>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>A component of either path prefix denies search
              permission; or one of the directories containing <i>old</i> or
              <i>new</i> denies write permissions; or, write permission is
              required and is denied for a directory pointed to by the
              <i>old</i> or <i>new</i> arguments.

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The directory named by <i>old</i> or <i>new</i> is currently in use by
              the system or another process, and the implementation
              considers this an error.

       [EEXIST] or [ENOTEMPTY]
                   The link named by <i>new</i> is a directory that is not an
                   empty directory.

       <b>EINVAL      </b>The <i>old</i> pathname names an ancestor directory of the
                   <i>new</i> pathname, or either pathname argument contains a
                   final component that is dot or dot-dot.

       <b>EIO         </b>A physical I/O error has occurred.

       <b>EISDIR      </b>The <i>new</i> argument points to a directory and the <i>old</i>

       <b>ELOOP       </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
                   resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>EMLINK      </b>The file named by <i>old</i> is a directory, and the link
                   count of the parent directory of <i>new</i> would exceed
                   {LINK_MAX}.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
                   The length of a component of a pathname is longer
                   than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT      </b>The link named by <i>old</i> does not name an existing file,
                   a component of the path prefix of <i>new</i> does not exist,
                   or either <i>old</i> or <i>new</i> points to an empty string.

       <b>ENOSPC      </b>The directory that would contain <i>new</i> cannot be
                   extended.

       <b>ENOTDIR     </b>A component of either path prefix names an existing
                   file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link
                   to a directory; or the <i>old</i> argument names a directory
                   and the <i>new</i> argument names a non-directory file; or
                   the <i>old</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
                   character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
                   characters and the last pathname component names an
                   existing file that is neither a directory nor a
                   symbolic link to a directory; or the <i>old</i> argument
                   names an existing non-directory file and the <i>new</i>
                   argument names a nonexistent file, contains at least
                   one non-&lt;slash&gt; character, and ends with one or more
                   trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters; or the <i>new</i> argument
                   names an existing non-directory file, contains at

                   more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters.

       <b>EPERM </b>or <b>EACCES</b>
                   The S_ISVTX flag is set on the directory containing
                   the file referred to by <i>old</i> and the process does not
                   satisfy the criteria specified in the Base
                   Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 4.3</i>,

                   <i>4.3</i>, <i>Directory Protection</i> with respect to this file.

       <b>EROFS       </b>The requested operation requires writing in a
                   directory on a read-only file system.

       <b>EXDEV       </b>The links named by <i>new</i> and <i>old</i> are on different file
                   systems and the implementation does not support links
                   between file systems.

       In addition, the <i>renameat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>oldfd</i> or <i>newfd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of
              the directory underlying <i>oldfd</i> or <i>newfd</i>, respectively, do

              argument does not specify an absolute path and the <i>newfd</i>
              argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor

       The <i>rename</i>() and <i>renameat</i>() functions may fail if:

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The file named by the <i>old</i> or <i>new</i> arguments is a named
              STREAM.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Renaming a File</b>
       The following example shows how to rename a file named
       <b>/home/cnd/mod1 </b>to <b>/home/cnd/mod2</b>.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

           int status;
           ...
           status = rename("/home/cnd/mod1", "/home/cnd/mod2");
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Some implementations mark for update the last file status change
       timestamp of renamed files and some do not. Applications which
       make use of the last file status change timestamp may behave
       differently with respect to renamed files unless they are
       designed to allow for either behavior.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       This <i>rename</i>() function is equivalent for regular files to that
       defined by the ISO C standard.  Its inclusion here expands that
       definition to include actions on directories and specifies
       behavior when the <i>new</i> parameter names a file that already exists.
       That specification requires that the action of the function be
       atomic.

       One of the reasons for introducing this function was to have a
       means of renaming directories while permitting implementations to
       prohibit the use of <i>link</i>() and <i>unlink</i>() with directories, thus
       constraining links to directories to those made by <i>mkdir</i>().

       The specification that if <i>old</i> and <i>new</i> refer to the same file is
       intended to guarantee that:

           rename("x", "x");

       does not remove the file.

       Renaming dot or dot-dot is prohibited in order to prevent
       cyclical file system paths.

       See also the descriptions of <b>[ENOTEMPTY] </b>and <b>[ENAMETOOLONG] </b>in
       <i>rmdir</i>() and <b>[EBUSY] </b>in <i>unlink</i>().  For a discussion of <b>[EXDEV]</b>,
       see <i>link</i>().

       The purpose of the <i>renameat</i>() function is to rename files in
       directories other than the current working directory without
       exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could
       be changed in parallel to a call to <i>rename</i>(), resulting in
       unspecified behavior. By opening file descriptors for the source
       and target directories and using the <i>renameat</i>() function it can
       be guaranteed that that renamed file is located correctly and the
       resulting file is in the desired directory.
