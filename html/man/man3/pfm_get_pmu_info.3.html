DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This function returns in <b>info </b>information about a PMU model
       designated by its identifier in <b>pmu</b>.

       The <b>pfm_pmu_info </b>structure is defined as follows:
       typedef struct {
               const char              *name;
               const char              *desc;
               pfm_pmu_t               pmu;
               pfm_pmu_type_t          type;
               int                     size;
               int                     nevents;
               int                     first_event;
               int                     max_encoding;
               int                     num_cntrs;
               int                     num_fixed_cntrs;
               struct {
                       int             is_present:1;
                       int             is_arch_default:1;
                       int             is_core:1;
                       int             is_uncore:1;
                       int             reserved:28;
               };
       } pfm_pmu_info_t;

       The fields of this structure are defined as follows:

       <b>name   </b>This is the symbolic name of the PMU. This name can be
              used as a prefix in an event string. This is a read-only
              string.

       <b>desc   </b>This is the description of PMU. This is a read-only
              string.

       <b>pmu    </b>This is the unique PMU identification code. It is
              identical to the value passed in <b>pmu </b>and it provided only
              for completeness.

       <b>type   </b>This field contains the type of the PMU. The following
              types are defined:

              <b>PFM_PMU_TYPE_UNKNOWN</b>
                     The type of the PMU could not be determined.

              <b>PFM_PMU_TYPE_CORE</b>
                     This field is set to one when the PMU is
                     implemented by the processor core.

              <b>PFM_PMU_TYPE_UNCORE</b>
                     This field is set to one when the PMU is
                     implemented on the processor die but at the socket
                     level, i.e., capturing events for all cores.

       <b>nevents</b>
              This is the number of available events for this PMU model
              based on the host processor. It is <b>only </b>valid if the
              <b>is_present </b>field is set to 1. Event identifiers are not
              guaranteed contiguous. In other words, it is not because
              <b>nevents </b>is equal to 100, that event identifiers go from 0
              to 99. The iterator function <b>pfm_get_event_next() </b>must be
              used to go from one identifier to the next.

       <b>first_event</b>
              This field returns the opaque index of the first event for
              this PMU model. The index can be used with
              <b>pfm_get_event_info() </b>or <b>pfm_get_event_next() </b>functions.
              In case no event is available, this field contains <b>-1</b>.

       <b>num_cntrs</b>
              This field contains the number of generic counters
              supported by the PMU.  A counter is generic if it can
              count more than one event. When it is not possible to
              determine the number of generic counters, this field
              contains -1.

       <b>num_fixed_cntrs</b>
              This field contains the number of fixed counters supported
              by the PMU.  A counter is fixed if it hardwired to count
              only one event. When it is not possible to determine the
              number of generic counters, this field contains -1.

       <b>size   </b>This field contains the size of the struct passed. This
              field is used to provide for extensibility of the struct
              without compromising backward compatibility.  The value
              should be set to <b>sizeof(pfm_pmu_info_t)</b>. If instead, a
              value of <b>0 </b>is specified, the library assumes the struct
              passed is identical to the first ABI version which size is
              <b>PFM_PMU_INFO_ABI0</b>. Thus, if fields were added after the
              first ABI, they will not be set by the library. The
              library does check that bytes beyond what is implemented
              are zeroes.

       <b>max_encoding</b>
              This field returns the number of event codes returned by
              <b>pfm_get_event_encoding()</b>.

       <b>is_present</b>
              This field is set to one is the PMU model has been
              detected on the host system.

       <b>is_dfl </b>This field is set to one if the PMU is the default PMU for
              this architecture.  Otherwise this field is zero.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the function returns <b>PFM_SUCCESS </b>and PMU
       information in <b>info</b>, otherwise it returns an error code.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_NOINIT</b>
              Library has not been initialized properly.

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_NOTSUPP</b>
              PMU model is not supported by the library.

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_INVAL</b>
              The <b>pmu </b>argument is invalid or <b>info </b>is <b>NULL </b>or <b>size </b>is not
              zero.
