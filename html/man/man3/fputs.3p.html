PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fputs — put a string on a stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int fputs(const char *restrict <i>s</i>, FILE *restrict <i>stream</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fputs</i>() function shall write the null-terminated string
       pointed to by <i>s</i> to the stream pointed to by <i>stream</i>.  The
       terminating null byte shall not be written.

       The last data modification and last file status change timestamps
       of the file shall be marked for update between the successful
       execution of <i>fputs</i>() and the next successful completion of a call
       to <i>fflush</i>() or <i>fclose</i>() on the same stream or a call to <i>exit</i>() or
       <i>abort</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>fputs</i>() shall return a non-negative
       number. Otherwise, it shall return EOF, set an error indicator
       for the stream, and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Printing to Standard Output</b>
       The following example gets the current time, converts it to a
       string using <i>localtime</i>() and <i>asctime</i>(), and prints it to standard
       output using <i>fputs</i>().  It then prints the number of minutes to an
       event for which it is waiting.

           #include &lt;time.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           ...
           time_t now;
           int minutes_to_event;
           ...
           time(&amp;now);
           printf("The time is ");
           fputs(asctime(localtime(&amp;now)), stdout);
           printf("There are still %d minutes to the event.\n",
               minutes_to_event);
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>puts</i>() function appends a &lt;newline&gt; while <i>fputs</i>() does not.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that successful completion
       simply return a non-negative integer. There are at least three
       known different implementation conventions for this requirement:

        *  Return a constant value.

        *  Return the last character written.

        *  Return the number of bytes written. Note that this
           implementation convention cannot be adhered to for strings
           longer than {INT_MAX} bytes as the value would not be
           representable in the return type of the function. For
           backwards-compatibility, implementations can return the
           number of bytes for strings of up to {INT_MAX} bytes, and
           return {INT_MAX} for all longer strings.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fputs</i>() function is one whose source code was specified in
       the referenced <i>The C Programming Language</i>. In the original
       edition, the function had no defined return value, yet many
       practical implementations would, as a side-effect, return the
       value of the last character written as that was the value
       remaining in the accumulator used as a return value. In the
       second edition of the book, either the fixed value 0 or EOF would
       be returned depending upon the return value of <i>ferror</i>(); however,
       for compatibility with extant implementations, several
       implementations would, upon success, return a positive value
       representing the last byte written.
