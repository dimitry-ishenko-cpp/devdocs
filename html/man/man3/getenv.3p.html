PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       getenv — get value of an environment variable
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       char *getenv(const char *<i>name</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>getenv</i>() function shall search the environment of the calling
       process (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter</i>
       <i>8</i>, <i>Environment Variables</i>) for the environment variable <i>name</i> if it
       exists and return a pointer to the value of the environment
       variable. If the specified environment variable cannot be found,
       a null pointer shall be returned. The application shall ensure
       that it does not modify the string pointed to by the <i>getenv</i>()
       function.

       The returned string pointer might be invalidated or the string
       content might be overwritten by a subsequent call to <i>getenv</i>(),
       <i>setenv</i>(), <i>unsetenv</i>(),
       or (if supported) <i>putenv</i>() but they shall not be affected by a
       call to any other function in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The returned string pointer might also be invalidated if the
       calling thread is terminated.

       The <i>getenv</i>() function need not be thread-safe.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>getenv</i>() shall return a pointer to a
       string containing the <i>value</i> for the specified <i>name</i>.  If the
       specified <i>name</i> cannot be found in the environment of the calling
       process, a null pointer shall be returned.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Getting the Value of an Environment Variable</b>
       The following example gets the value of the <i>HOME</i> environment
       variable.

           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           ...
           const char *name = "HOME";
           char *value;

           value = getenv(name);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>clearenv</i>() function was considered but rejected. The <i>putenv</i>()
       function has now been included for alignment with the Single UNIX
       Specification.

       The <i>getenv</i>() function is inherently not thread-safe because it
       returns a value pointing to static data.

       Conforming applications are required not to directly modify the
       pointers to which <i>environ</i> points, but to use only the <i>setenv</i>(),
       <i>unsetenv</i>(), and <i>putenv</i>() functions, or assignment to <i>environ</i>
       itself, to manipulate the process environment. This constraint
       allows the implementation to properly manage the memory it
       allocates. This enables the implementation to free any space it
       has allocated to strings (and perhaps the pointers to them)
       stored in <i>environ</i> when <i>unsetenv</i>() is called. A C runtime start-up
       procedure (that which invokes <i>main</i>() and perhaps initializes
       <i>environ</i>) can also initialize a flag indicating that none of the
       environment has yet been copied to allocated storage, or that the
       separate table has not yet been initialized. If the application
       switches to a complete new environment by assigning a new value
       to <i>environ</i>, this can be detected by <i>getenv</i>(), <i>setenv</i>(),
       <i>unsetenv</i>(), or <i>putenv</i>() and the implementation can at that point
       reinitialize based on the new environment. (This may include
       copying the environment strings into a new array and assigning
       <i>environ</i> to point to it.)

       In fact, for higher performance of <i>getenv</i>(), implementations that
       do not provide <i>putenv</i>() could also maintain a separate copy of
       the environment in a data structure that could be searched much
       more quickly (such as an indexed hash table, or a binary tree),
       and update both it and the linear list at <i>environ</i> when <i>setenv</i>()
       or <i>unsetenv</i>() is invoked. On implementations that do provide
       <i>putenv</i>(), such a copy might still be worthwhile but would need to
       allow for the fact that applications can directly modify the
       content of environment strings added with <i>putenv</i>().  For example,
       if an environment string found by searching the copy is one that
       was added using <i>putenv</i>(), the implementation would need to check
       that the string in <i>environ</i> still has the same name (and value, if
       the copy includes values), and whenever searching the copy
       produces no match the implementation would then need to search
       each environment string in <i>environ</i> that was added using <i>putenv</i>()
       in case any of them have changed their names and now match. Thus,
       each use of <i>putenv</i>() to add to the environment would reduce the
       speed advantage of having the copy.

       Performance of <i>getenv</i>() can be important for applications which
       have large numbers of environment variables. Typically,
       applications like this use the environment as a resource database
       of user-configurable parameters.  The fact that these variables
       are in the user's shell environment usually means that any other
       program that uses environment variables (such as <i>ls</i>, which
       attempts to use <i>COLUMNS</i>), or really almost any utility (<i>LANG</i>,
       <i>LC_ALL</i>, and so on) is similarly slowed down by the linear search
       through the variables.

       An implementation that maintains separate data structures, or
       even one that manages the memory it consumes, is not currently
       required as it was thought it would reduce consensus among
       implementors who do not want to change their historical
       implementations.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version may add one or more functions to access and
       modify the environment in a thread-safe manner.
