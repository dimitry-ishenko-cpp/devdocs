</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_journal_get_fd() </b>returns a file descriptor that may be
       asynchronously polled in an external event loop and is signaled
       as soon as the journal changes, because new entries or files were
       added, rotation took place, or files have been deleted, and
       similar. The file descriptor is suitable for usage in <a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll(2)</a>.
       Use <b>sd_journal_get_events() </b>for an events mask to watch for. The
       call takes one argument: the journal context object. Note that
       not all file systems are capable of generating the necessary
       events for wakeups from this file descriptor for changes to be
       noticed immediately. In particular network files systems do not
       generate suitable file change events in all cases. Cases like
       this can be detected with <b>sd_journal_reliable_fd()</b>, below.
       <b>sd_journal_get_timeout() </b>will ensure in these cases that wake-ups
       happen frequently enough for changes to be noticed, although with
       a certain latency.

       <b>sd_journal_get_events() </b>will return the <b>poll() </b>mask to wait for.
       This function will return a combination of <b>POLLIN </b>and <b>POLLOUT </b>and
       similar to fill into the ".events" field of <i>struct pollfd</i>.

       <b>sd_journal_get_timeout() </b>will return a timeout value for usage in
       <b>poll()</b>. This returns a value in microseconds since the epoch of
       <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC </b>for timing out <b>poll() </b>in <i>timeout_usec</i>. See
       <a href="../man2/clock_gettime.2.html">clock_gettime(2)</a> for details about <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>. If there is
       no timeout to wait for, this will fill in <b>(uint64_t) -1 </b>instead.
       Note that <b>poll() </b>takes a relative timeout in milliseconds rather
       than an absolute timeout in microseconds. To convert the absolute
       'us' timeout into relative 'ms', use code like the following:

           uint64_t t;
           int msec;
           sd_journal_get_timeout(m, &amp;t);
           if (t == (uint64_t) -1)
             msec = -1;
           else {
             struct timespec ts;
             uint64_t n;
             clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;ts);
             n = (uint64_t) ts.tv_sec * 1000000 + ts.tv_nsec / 1000;
             msec = t &gt; n ? (int) ((t - n + 999) / 1000) : 0;
           }

       The code above does not do any error checking for brevity's sake.
       The calculated <i>msec</i> integer can be passed directly as <b>poll()</b>'s
       timeout parameter.

       After each <b>poll() </b>wake-up <b>sd_journal_process() </b>needs to be called
       to process events. This call will also indicate what kind of
       change has been detected (see below; note that spurious wake-ups
       are possible).

       A synchronous alternative for using <b>sd_journal_get_fd()</b>,
       <b>sd_journal_get_events()</b>, <b>sd_journal_get_timeout() </b>and
       <b>sd_journal_process() </b>is <b>sd_journal_wait()</b>. It will synchronously
       wait until the journal gets changed. The maximum time this call
       sleeps may be controlled with the <i>timeout_usec</i> parameter. Pass
       <b>(uint64_t) -1 </b>to wait indefinitely. Internally this call simply
       combines <b>sd_journal_get_fd()</b>, <b>sd_journal_get_events()</b>,
       <b>sd_journal_get_timeout()</b>, <b>poll() </b>and <b>sd_journal_process() </b>into
       one.

       <b>sd_journal_reliable_fd() </b>may be used to check whether the wake-up
       events from the file descriptor returned by <b>sd_journal_get_fd()</b>
       are known to be quickly triggered. On certain file systems where
       file change events from the OS are not available (such as NFS)
       changes need to be polled for repeatedly, and hence are detected
       only with a considerable latency. This call will return a
       positive value if the journal changes are detected quickly and
       zero when they need to be polled for. Note that there is usually
       no need to invoke this function directly as
       <b>sd_journal_get_timeout() </b>will request appropriate timeouts
       anyway.

       Note that all of the above change notification interfaces do not
       report changes instantly. Latencies are introduced for multiple
       reasons: as mentioned certain storage backends require time-based
       polling, in other cases wake-ups are optimized by coalescing
       events, and the OS introduces additional IO/CPU scheduling
       latencies.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_journal_get_fd() </b>returns a valid file descriptor on success or
       a negative errno-style error code.

       <b>sd_journal_get_events() </b>returns a combination of <b>POLLIN</b>, <b>POLLOUT</b>
       and suchlike on success or a negative errno-style error code.

       <b>sd_journal_reliable_fd() </b>returns a positive integer if the file
       descriptor returned by <b>sd_journal_get_fd() </b>will generate wake-ups
       immediately for all journal changes. Returns 0 if there might be
       a latency involved.

       <b>sd_journal_process() </b>and <b>sd_journal_wait() </b>return a negative
       errno-style error code, or one of <b>SD_JOURNAL_NOP</b>,
       <b>SD_JOURNAL_APPEND </b>or <b>SD_JOURNAL_INVALIDATE </b>on success:

       •   If <b>SD_JOURNAL_NOP </b>is returned, the journal did not change
           since the last invocation.

       •   If <b>SD_JOURNAL_APPEND </b>is returned, new entries have been
           appended to the end of the journal. In this case it is
           sufficient to simply continue reading at the previous end
           location of the journal, to read the newly added entries.

       •   If <b>SD_JOURNAL_INVALIDATE</b>, journal files were added to or
           removed from the set of journal files watched (e.g. due to
           rotation or vacuuming), and thus entries might have appeared
           or disappeared at arbitrary places in the log stream,
           possibly before or after the previous end of the log stream.
           If <b>SD_JOURNAL_INVALIDATE </b>is returned, live-view UIs that want
           to reflect on screen the precise state of the log data on
           disk should probably refresh their entire display (relative
           to the cursor of the log entry on the top of the screen).
           Programs only interested in a strictly sequential stream of
           log data may treat <b>SD_JOURNAL_INVALIDATE </b>the same way as
           <b>SD_JOURNAL_APPEND</b>, thus ignoring any changes to the log view
           earlier than the old end of the log stream.

SIGNAL SAFETY </h2>
<pre>
       In general, <b>sd_journal_get_fd()</b>, <b>sd_journal_get_events()</b>, and
       <b>sd_journal_get_timeout() </b>are <i>not</i> "async signal safe" in the
       meaning of <a href="../man7/signal-safety.7.html">signal-safety(7)</a>. Nevertheless, only the first call to
       any of those three functions performs unsafe operations, so
       subsequent calls <i>are</i> safe.

       <b>sd_journal_process() </b>and <b>sd_journal_wait() </b>are not safe.
       <b>sd_journal_reliable_fd() </b>is safe.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       All functions listed here are thread-agnostic and only a single
       specific thread may operate on a given object during its entire
       lifetime. It's safe to allocate multiple independent objects and
       use each from a specific thread in parallel. However, it's not
       safe to allocate such an object in one thread, and operate or
       free it from any other, even if locking is used to ensure these
       threads don't operate on it at the very same time.

       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.
