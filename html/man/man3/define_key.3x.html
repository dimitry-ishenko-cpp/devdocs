NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>define_key </b>- define a keycode
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;curses.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int define_key(const char *</b><i>definition</i><b>, int </b><i>keycode</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to define keycodes with their corresponding control
       strings, so that the ncurses library will interpret them just as
       it would the predefined codes in the terminfo database.

       If the given string is null, any existing definition for the
       keycode is removed.  Similarly, if the given keycode is negative
       or zero, any existing string for the given definition is removed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The keycode must be greater than zero, and the string non-null,
       otherwise <b>ERR </b>is returned.  <b>ERR </b>may also be returned if there is
       insufficient memory to allocate the data to store the definition.
       If no error is detected, <b>OK </b>is returned.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported
       on Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended
       that any code depending on them be conditioned using
       NCURSES_VERSION.
