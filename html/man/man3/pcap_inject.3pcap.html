NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_inject, pcap_sendpacket - transmit a packet
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pcap_inject(pcap_t *p, const void *buf, size_t size);</b>
       <b>int pcap_sendpacket(pcap_t *p, const u_char *buf, int size);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_inject</b>() sends a raw packet through the network interface;
       <i>buf</i> points to the data of the packet, including the link-layer
       header, and <i>size</i> is the number of bytes in the packet.

       Note that, even if you successfully open the network interface,
       you might not have permission to send packets on it, or it might
       not support sending packets; as <b>pcap_open_live</b>(3PCAP) doesn't
       have a flag to indicate whether to open for capturing, sending,
       or capturing and sending, you cannot request an open that
       supports sending and be notified at open time whether sending
       will be possible.  Note also that some devices might not support
       sending packets.

       Note that, on some platforms, the link-layer header of the packet
       that's sent might not be the same as the link-layer header of the
       packet supplied to <b>pcap_inject</b>(), as the source link-layer
       address, if the header contains such an address, might be changed
       to be the address assigned to the interface on which the packet
       it sent, if the platform doesn't support sending completely raw
       and unchanged packets.  Even worse, some drivers on some
       platforms might change the link-layer type field to whatever
       value libpcap used when attaching to the device, even on
       platforms that <i>do</i> nominally support sending completely raw and
       unchanged packets.

       <b>pcap_sendpacket</b>() is like <b>pcap_inject</b>(), but it returns <b>0 </b>on
       success, rather than returning the number of bytes written.
       (<b>pcap_inject</b>() comes from OpenBSD; <b>pcap_sendpacket</b>() comes from
       WinPcap/Npcap.  Both are provided for compatibility.)
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_inject</b>() returns the number of bytes written on success,
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED </b>if called on a capture handle that has
       been created but not activated, and <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>on other errors.

       <b>pcap_sendpacket</b>() returns <b>0 </b>on success, <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED</b>
       if called on a capture handle that has been created but not
       activated, and <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>on other errors.

       If <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is returned, <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or
       <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP) may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch
       or display the error text.
