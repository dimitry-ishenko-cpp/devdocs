DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>initscr</b>
       <b>initscr  </b>is  normally  the first <b>curses </b>routine to call when ini‐
       tializing a program.  A few special routines sometimes need to be
       called before it; these  are  <b>slk_init</b>(3X),  <b>filter</b>,  <b>ripoffline</b>,
       <b>use_env</b>.   For  multiple-terminal  applications,  <b>newterm  </b>may be
       called before <b>initscr</b>.

       The initscr code determines the terminal type and initializes all
       <b>curses </b>data structures.  <b>initscr </b>also causes the  first  call  to
       <b>refresh</b>(3X) to clear the screen.  If errors occur, <b>initscr </b>writes
       an  appropriate error message to standard error and exits; other‐
       wise, a pointer is returned to <b>stdscr</b>.

   <b>newterm</b>
       A program that outputs to more than one terminal should  use  the
       <b>newterm  </b>routine for each terminal instead of <b>initscr</b>.  A program
       that needs to inspect capabilities, so it can continue to run  in
       a line-oriented mode if the terminal cannot support a screen-ori‐
       ented  program,  would  also  use  <b>newterm</b>.   The routine <b>newterm</b>
       should be called once for each terminal.  It returns  a  variable
       of  type  <b>SCREEN  *  </b>which should be saved as a reference to that
       terminal.  <b>newterm</b>'s arguments are

       •   the <i>type</i> of the terminal to be used in place of <b>$TERM</b>,

       •   a file pointer for output to the terminal, and

       •   another file pointer for input from the terminal

       If the <i>type</i> parameter is <b>NULL</b>, <b>$TERM </b>will be used.

   <b>endwin</b>
       The program must also call <b>endwin </b>for each terminal being used
       before exiting from <b>curses</b>.  If <b>newterm </b>is called more than once
       for the same terminal, the first terminal referred to must be the
       last one for which <b>endwin </b>is called.

       A program should always call <b>endwin </b>before exiting or escaping
       from <b>curses </b>mode temporarily.  This routine

       •   resets colors to correspond with the default color pair 0,

       •   moves the cursor to the lower left-hand corner of the screen,

       •   clears the remainder of the line so that it uses the default
           colors,

       •   sets the cursor to normal visibility (see <b>curs_set</b>(3X)),

       •   stops cursor-addressing mode using the <i>exit_ca_mode</i> terminal
           capability,

       •   restores tty modes (see <b>reset_shell_mode</b>(3X)).

       Calling <b>refresh</b>(3X) or <b>doupdate</b>(3X) after a temporary escape
       causes the program to resume visual mode.

   <b>isendwin</b>
       The <b>isendwin </b>routine returns <b>TRUE </b>if <b>endwin </b>has been called with‐
       out any subsequent calls to <b>wrefresh</b>, and <b>FALSE </b>otherwise.

   <b>set_term</b>
       The <b>set_term </b>routine is used to switch between different termi‐
       nals.  The screen reference <i>new</i> becomes the new current terminal.
       The previous terminal is returned by the routine.  This is the
       only routine which manipulates <b>SCREEN </b>pointers; all other rou‐
       tines affect only the current terminal.

   <b>delscreen</b>
       The <b>delscreen </b>routine frees storage associated with the <b>SCREEN</b>
       data structure.  The <b>endwin </b>routine does not do this, so
       <b>delscreen </b>should be called after <b>endwin </b>if a particular <b>SCREEN </b>is
       no longer needed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>endwin </b>returns the integer <b>ERR </b>upon failure and <b>OK </b>upon success‐
       ful completion.

       Routines that return pointers always return <b>NULL </b>on error.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation

       •   <b>endwin </b>returns an error if the terminal was not initialized.

       •   <b>newterm </b>returns an error if it cannot allocate the data
           structures for the screen, or for the top-level windows with‐
           in the screen, i.e., <b>curscr</b>, <b>newscr</b>, or <b>stdscr</b>.

       •   <b>set_term </b>returns no error.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These functions were described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue
       4.  As of 2015, the current document is X/Open Curses, Issue 7.

   <b>Differences</b>
       X/Open specifies that portable applications must not call <b>initscr</b>
       more than once:

       •   The portable way to use <b>initscr </b>is once only, using <b>refresh</b>
           (see curs_refresh(3X)) to restore the screen after <b>endwin</b>.

       •   This implementation allows using <b>initscr </b>after <b>endwin</b>.

       Old versions of curses, e.g., BSD 4.4, would return a null point‐
       er from <b>initscr </b>when an error is detected, rather than exiting.
       It is safe but redundant to check the return value of <b>initscr </b>in
       XSI Curses.

       Calling <b>endwin </b>does not dispose of the memory allocated in
       <b>initscr </b>or <b>newterm</b>.  Deleting a <b>SCREEN </b>provides a way to do this:

       •   X/Open Curses does not say what happens to <b>WINDOW</b>s when
           <b>delscreen </b>“frees storage associated with the <b>SCREEN</b>” nor does
           the SVr4 documentation help, adding that it should be called
           after <b>endwin </b>if a <b>SCREEN </b>is no longer needed.

       •   However, <b>WINDOW</b>s are implicitly associated with a <b>SCREEN</b>.  so
           that it is reasonable to expect <b>delscreen </b>to deal with these.

       •   SVr4 curses deletes the standard <b>WINDOW </b>structures <b>stdscr </b>and
           <b>curscr </b>as well as a work area <b>newscr</b>.  SVr4 curses ignores
           other windows.

       •   Since version 4.0 (1996), ncurses has maintained a list of
           all windows for each screen, using that information to delete
           those windows when <b>delscreen </b>is called.

       •   NetBSD copied this feature of ncurses in 2001.  PDCurses fol‐
           lows the SVr4 model, deleting only the standard <b>WINDOW </b>struc‐
           tures.

   <b>Unset TERM Variable</b>
       If the TERM variable is missing or empty, <b>initscr </b>uses the value
       “unknown”, which normally corresponds to a terminal entry with
       the <i>generic</i> (<i>gn</i>) capability.  Generic entries are detected by <b>se‐</b>
       <b>tupterm </b>(see curs_terminfo(3X)) and cannot be used for full-
       screen operation.  Other implementations may handle a miss‐
       ing/empty TERM variable differently.

   <b>Signal Handlers</b>
       Quoting from X/Open Curses, section 3.1.1:

            <i>Curses implementations may provide for special handling of</i>
            <i>the</i> <b>SIGINT</b><i>,</i> <b>SIGQUIT </b><i>and</i> <b>SIGTSTP </b><i>signals if their disposition</i>
            <i>is</i> <b>SIG_DFL </b><i>at the time</i> <b>initscr </b><i>is called</i> ...

            <i>Any special handling for these signals may remain in effect</i>
            <i>for the life of the process or until the process changes the</i>
            <i>disposition of the signal.</i>

            <i>None of the Curses functions are required to be safe with</i>
            <i>respect to signals</i> ...

       This implementation establishes signal handlers during initial‐
       ization, e.g., <b>initscr </b>or <b>newterm</b>.  Applications which must han‐
       dle these signals should set up the corresponding handlers <i>after</i>
       initializing the library:

       <b>SIGINT</b>
            The handler <i>attempts</i> to cleanup the screen on exit.  Al‐
            though it <i>usually</i> works as expected, there are limitations:

            •   Walking the <b>SCREEN </b>list is unsafe, since all list man‐
                agement is done without any signal blocking.

            •   On systems which have <b>REENTRANT </b>turned on, <b>set_term </b>uses
                functions which could deadlock or misbehave in other
                ways.

            •   <b>endwin </b>calls other functions, many of which use stdio or
                other library functions which are clearly unsafe.

       <b>SIGTERM</b>
            This uses the same handler as <b>SIGINT</b>, with the same limita‐
            tions.  It is not mentioned in X/Open Curses, but is more
            suitable for this purpose than <b>SIGQUIT </b>(which is used in de‐
            bugging).

       <b>SIGTSTP</b>
            This handles the <i>stop</i> signal, used in job control.  When re‐
            suming the process, this implementation discards pending in‐
            put with <b>flushinput </b>(see curs_util(3X)), and repaints the
            screen assuming that it has been completely altered.  It al‐
            so updates the saved terminal modes with <b>def_shell_mode </b>(see
            <b>curs_kernel</b>(3X)).

       <b>SIGWINCH</b>
            This handles the window-size changes which were ignored in
            the standardization efforts.  The handler sets a (signal-
            safe) variable which is later tested in <b>wgetch </b>(see
            curs_getch(3X)).  If <b>keypad </b>has been enabled for the corre‐
            sponding window, <b>wgetch </b>returns the key symbol <b>KEY_RESIZE</b>.
            At the same time, <b>wgetch </b>calls <b>resizeterm </b>to adjust the
            standard screen <b>stdscr</b>, and update other data such as <b>LINES</b>
            and <b>COLS</b>.
