<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];</b>

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>() constructs a list of network devices that can
       be opened with <b>pcap_create</b>(3PCAP) and <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP) or
       with <b>pcap_open_live</b>(3PCAP).  (Note that there may be network
       devices that cannot be opened by the process calling
       <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>(), because, for example, that process does not
       have sufficient privileges to open them for capturing; if so,
       those devices will not appear on the list.)  <i>alldevsp</i> is a
       pointer to a <b>pcap_if_t *</b>; <i>errbuf</i> is a buffer large enough to hold
       at least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE </b>chars.

       If <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>() succeeds, the pointer pointed to by
       <i>alldevsp</i> is set to point to the first element of the list, or to
       <b>NULL </b>if no devices were found (this is considered success).  Each
       element of the list is of type <b>pcap_if_t</b>, and has the following
       members:

              <b>next   </b>if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to the next element in the
                     list; <b>NULL </b>for the last element of the list

              <b>name   </b>a pointer to a string giving a name for the device
                     to pass to <b>pcap_open_live</b>()

              <b>description</b>
                     if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a string giving a human-
                     readable description of the device

              <b>addresses</b>
                     a pointer to the first element of a list of network
                     addresses for the device, or <b>NULL </b>if the device has
                     no addresses

              <b>flags  </b>device flags:

                     <b>PCAP_IF_LOOPBACK</b>
                            set if the device is a loopback interface

                     <b>PCAP_IF_UP</b>
                            set if the device is up

                     <b>PCAP_IF_RUNNING</b>
                            set if the device is running

                     <b>PCAP_IF_WIRELESS</b>
                            set if the device is a wireless interface;
                            this includes IrDA as well as radio-based
                            networks such as IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE
                            802.11, so it doesn't just mean Wi-Fi

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS</b>
                            a bitmask for an indication of whether the
                            adapter is connected or not; for wireless
                            interfaces, "connected" means "associated
                            with a network"

                     The possible values for the connection status bits
                     are:

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN</b>
                            it's unknown whether the adapter is
                            connected or not

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED</b>
                            the adapter is connected

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED</b>
                            the adapter is disconnected

                     <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE</b>
                            the notion of "connected" and "disconnected"
                            don't apply to this interface; for example,
                            it doesn't apply to a loopback device

       Each element of the list of addresses is of type <b>pcap_addr_t</b>, and
       has the following members:

              <b>next   </b>if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to the next element in the
                     list; <b>NULL </b>for the last element of the list

              <b>addr   </b>a pointer to a <b>struct sockaddr </b>containing an
                     address

              <b>netmask</b>
                     if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a <b>struct sockaddr </b>that
                     contains the netmask corresponding to the address
                     pointed to by <b>addr</b>

              <b>broadaddr</b>
                     if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a <b>struct sockaddr </b>that
                     contains the broadcast address corresponding to the
                     address pointed to by <b>addr</b>; may be <b>NULL </b>if the
                     device doesn't support broadcasts

              <b>dstaddr</b>
                     if not <b>NULL</b>, a pointer to a <b>struct sockaddr </b>that
                     contains the destination address corresponding to
                     the address pointed to by <b>addr</b>; may be <b>NULL </b>if the
                     device isn't a point-to-point interface

       Note that the addresses in the list of addresses might be IPv4
       addresses, IPv6 addresses, or some other type of addresses, so
       you must check the <b>sa_family </b>member of the <b>struct sockaddr </b>before
       interpreting the contents of the address; do not assume that the
       addresses are all IPv4 addresses, or even all IPv4 or IPv6
       addresses.  IPv4 addresses have the value <b>AF_INET</b>, IPv6 addresses
       have the value <b>AF_INET6 </b>(which older operating systems that don't
       support IPv6 might not define), and other addresses have other
       values.  Whether other addresses are returned, and what types
       they might have is platform-dependent.  Namely, link-layer
       addresses, such as Ethernet MAC addresses, have the value
       <b>AF_PACKET </b>(on Linux) or <b>AF_LINK </b>(on AIX, FreeBSD, Haiku, illumos,
       macOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD) or are not returned at all (on
       GNU/Hurd and Solaris).

       For IPv4 addresses, the <b>struct sockaddr </b>pointer can be
       interpreted as if it pointed to a <b>struct sockaddr_in</b>; for IPv6
       addresses, it can be interpreted as if it pointed to a <b>struct</b>
       <b>sockaddr_in6</b>.  For link-layer addresses, it can be interpreted as
       if it pointed to a <b>struct sockaddr_ll </b>(for <b>AF_PACKET</b>) or a <b>struct</b>
       <b>sockaddr_dl </b>(for <b>AF_LINK</b>).

       The list of devices must be freed with <b>pcap_freealldevs</b>(3PCAP),
       which frees the list pointed to by <i>alldevs</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>() returns <b>0 </b>on success and <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>on
       failure; as indicated, finding no devices is considered success,
       rather than failure, so <b>0 </b>will be returned in that case. If
       <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is returned, <i>errbuf</i> is filled in with an appropriate
       error message.
</pre> <h2>
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>PCAP_IF_UP </b>and <b>PCAP_IF_RUNNING </b>constants became available in
       libpcap release 1.6.1.  The <b>PCAP_IF_WIRELESS</b>,
       <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS</b>, <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_UNKNOWN</b>,
       <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_CONNECTED</b>,
       <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_DISCONNECTED</b>, and
       <b>PCAP_IF_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOT_APPLICABLE </b>constants became
       available in libpcap release 1.9.0.
