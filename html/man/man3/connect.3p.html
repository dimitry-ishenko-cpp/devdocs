NAME </h2>

       connect — connect a socket
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int connect(int <i>socket</i>, const struct sockaddr *<i>address</i>,
           socklen_t <i>address_len</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>connect</i>() function shall attempt to make a connection on a
       connection-mode socket or to set or reset the peer address of a
       connectionless-mode socket. The function takes the following
       arguments:

       <i>socket</i>      Specifies the file descriptor associated with the
                   socket.

       <i>address</i>     Points to a <b>sockaddr </b>structure containing the peer
                   address. The length and format of the address depend
                   on the address family of the socket.

       <i>address_len</i> Specifies the length of the <b>sockaddr </b>structure
                   pointed to by the <i>address</i> argument.

       If the socket has not already been bound to a local address,
       <i>connect</i>() shall bind it to an address which, unless the socket's
       address family is AF_UNIX, is an unused local address.

       If the initiating socket is not connection-mode, then <i>connect</i>()
       shall set the socket's peer address, and no connection is made.
       For SOCK_DGRAM sockets, the peer address identifies where all
       datagrams are sent on subsequent <i>send</i>() functions, and limits the
       remote sender for subsequent <i>recv</i>() functions. If the <i>sa_family</i>
       member of <i>address</i> is AF_UNSPEC, the socket's peer address shall
       be reset. Note that despite no connection being made, the term
       ``connected'' is used to describe a connectionless-mode socket
       for which a peer address has been set.

       If the initiating socket is connection-mode, then <i>connect</i>() shall
       attempt to establish a connection to the address specified by the
       <i>address</i> argument. If the connection cannot be established
       immediately and O_NONBLOCK is not set for the file descriptor for
       the socket, <i>connect</i>() shall block for up to an unspecified
       timeout interval until the connection is established. If the
       timeout interval expires before the connection is established,
       <i>connect</i>() shall fail and the connection attempt shall be aborted.
       If <i>connect</i>() is interrupted by a signal that is caught while
       blocked waiting to establish a connection, <i>connect</i>() shall fail
       and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINTR]</b>, but the connection request shall not be
       aborted, and the connection shall be established asynchronously.

       If the connection cannot be established immediately and
       O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the socket,
       <i>connect</i>() shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINPROGRESS]</b>, but the
       connection request shall not be aborted, and the connection shall
       be established asynchronously. Subsequent calls to <i>connect</i>() for
       the same socket, before the connection is established, shall fail
       and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EALREADY]</b>.

       When the connection has been established asynchronously,
       <i>pselect</i>(), <i>select</i>(), and <i>poll</i>() shall indicate that the file
       descriptor for the socket is ready for writing.

       The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate
       privileges to use the <i>connect</i>() function.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>connect</i>() shall return 0; otherwise,
       -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>connect</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EADDRNOTAVAIL</b>
              The specified address is not available from the local
              machine.

       <b>EAFNOSUPPORT</b>
              The specified address is not a valid address for the
              address family of the specified socket.

       <b>EALREADY</b>
              A connection request is already in progress for the
              specified socket.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>socket</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNREFUSED</b>
              The target address was not listening for connections or
              refused the connection request.

       <b>EINPROGRESS</b>
              O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the socket
              and the connection cannot be immediately established; the
              connection shall be established asynchronously.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The attempt to establish a connection was interrupted by
              delivery of a signal that was caught; the connection shall
              be established asynchronously.

       <b>EISCONN</b>
              The specified socket is connection-mode and is already
              connected.

       <b>ENETUNREACH</b>
              No route to the network is present.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <i>socket</i> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EPROTOTYPE</b>
              The specified address has a different type than the socket
              bound to the specified peer address.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The attempt to connect timed out before a connection was
              made.

       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <i>connect</i>()
       shall fail if:

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
              file system.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the pathname in <i>address</i>.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of the pathname does not name an existing file
              or the pathname is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix of the pathname in <i>address</i>
              names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a
              symbolic link to a directory, or the pathname in <i>address</i>
              contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends with
              one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters and the last
              pathname component names an existing file that is neither
              a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       The <i>connect</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied for a component of the path
              prefix; or write access to the named socket is denied.

       <b>EADDRINUSE</b>
              Attempt to establish a connection that uses addresses that
              are already in use.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              Remote host reset the connection request.

       <b>EHOSTUNREACH</b>
              The destination host cannot be reached (probably because
              the host is down or a remote router cannot reach it).

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>address_len</i> argument is not a valid length for the
              address family; or invalid address family in the <b>sockaddr</b>
              structure.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the pathname in <i>address</i>.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENETDOWN</b>
              The local network interface used to reach the destination
              is down.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              No buffer space is available.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The socket is listening and cannot be connected.
