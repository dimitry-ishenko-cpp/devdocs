NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_skx_unc_upi - support for Intel Skylake X Server UPI
       uncore PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: skx_unc_upi[0-2]</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Skylake X Server UPI uncore PMU</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Skylake X Server UPI uncore PMU.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Skylake X server
       UPI uncore PMU:

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to
              one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t      </b>Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the
              counter counts the number of QPI cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the threshold or edge filter. If
              set, the event counts when strictly less than N
              occurrences occur per cycle if threshold is set to N. When
              invert is set, then threshold must be set to non-zero
              value. If set, the event counts when the event transitions
              from occurring to not occurring (falling edge) when edge
              detection is set. This is a boolean modifier
</pre> <h2>
BASIC_HDR_MATCH events </h2>
<pre>
       The library also supports the special <b>RXL_BASIC_HDR_MATCH </b>and
       <b>TXL_BASIC_HDR_MATCH </b>opcode matcher events. These events have a
       lot more filters available in the form of either a modifier
       (listed below) or specific umasks.  The following modifiers are
       available in additional to the standard listed above:

       <b>rcsnid </b>Specify a RCS Node identifier as an integer in the range
              [0-15]. Default: 0

       <b>dnid   </b>Specify a destination Node identifier as an integer in the
              range [0-15]. Default: 0
