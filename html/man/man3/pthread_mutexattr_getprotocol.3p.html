SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol(const pthread_mutexattr_t
           *restrict <i>attr</i>, int *restrict <i>protocol</i>);
       int pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(pthread_mutexattr_t *<i>attr</i>,
           int <i>protocol</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>() and
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() functions, respectively, shall
       get and set the protocol attribute of a mutex attributes object
       pointed to by <i>attr</i> which was previously created by the function
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_init</i>().

       The <i>protocol</i> attribute defines the protocol to be followed in
       utilizing mutexes.  The value of <i>protocol</i> may be one of:

       PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
       PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE
       PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT

       which are defined in the <i>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</i> header. The default value of
       the attribute shall be PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE.

       When a thread owns a mutex with the PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE <i>protocol</i>
       attribute, its priority and scheduling shall not be affected by
       its mutex ownership.

       When a thread is blocking higher priority threads because of
       owning one or more robust mutexes with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT
       <i>protocol</i> attribute, it shall execute at the higher of its
       priority or the priority of the highest priority thread waiting
       on any of the robust mutexes owned by this thread and initialized
       with this protocol.

       When a thread is blocking higher priority threads because of
       owning one or more non-robust mutexes with the
       PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT <i>protocol</i> attribute, it shall execute at the
       higher of its priority or the priority of the highest priority
       thread waiting on any of the non-robust mutexes owned by this
       thread and initialized with this protocol.

       When a thread owns one or more robust mutexes initialized with
       the PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol, it shall execute at the higher
       of its priority or the highest of the priority ceilings of all
       the robust mutexes owned by this thread and initialized with this
       attribute, regardless of whether other threads are blocked on any
       of these robust mutexes or not.

       When a thread owns one or more non-robust mutexes initialized
       with the PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol, it shall execute at the
       higher of its priority or the highest of the priority ceilings of
       all the non-robust mutexes owned by this thread and initialized
       with this attribute, regardless of whether other threads are
       blocked on any of these non-robust mutexes or not.

       While a thread is holding a mutex which has been initialized with
       the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol
       attributes, it shall not be subject to being moved to the tail of
       the scheduling queue at its priority in the event that its
       original priority is changed, such as by a call to
       <i>sched_setparam</i>().  Likewise, when a thread unlocks a mutex that
       has been initialized with the PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT or
       PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT protocol attributes, it shall not be subject
       to being moved to the tail of the scheduling queue at its
       priority in the event that its original priority is changed.

       If a thread simultaneously owns several mutexes initialized with
       different protocols, it shall execute at the highest of the
       priorities that it would have obtained by each of these
       protocols.

       When a thread makes a call to <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>(), the mutex was
       initialized with the protocol attribute having the value
       PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, when the calling thread is blocked because
       the mutex is owned by another thread, that owner thread shall
       inherit the priority level of the calling thread as long as it
       continues to own the mutex. The implementation shall update its
       execution priority to the maximum of its assigned priority and
       all its inherited priorities.  Furthermore, if this owner thread
       itself becomes blocked on another mutex with the <i>protocol</i>
       attribute having the value PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT, the same
       priority inheritance effect shall be propagated to this other
       owner thread, in a recursive manner.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>() or
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() does not refer to an initialized
       mutex attributes object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>()
       and <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() functions shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENOTSUP</b>
              The value specified by <i>protocol</i> is an unsupported value.

       The <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>() and
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value specified by <i>protocol</i> is invalid.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have the privilege to perform the
              operation.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol</i>() or
       <i>pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol</i>() does not refer to an initialized
       mutex attributes object, it is recommended that the function
       should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
