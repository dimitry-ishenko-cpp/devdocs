DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are used to simplify analysis of memory leaks  in
       the ncurses library.

       Any  implementation of curses must not free the memory associated
       with a screen, since (even after calling <b>endwin</b>(3X)), it must  be
       available for use in the next call to <b>refresh</b>(3X).  There are al‐
       so  chunks of memory held for performance reasons.  That makes it
       hard to analyze curses applications for memory leaks.  When using
       the specially configured debugging version  of  the  ncurses  li‐
       brary, applications can call functions which free those chunks of
       memory, simplifying the process of memory-leak checking.

       Some of the functions are named with a “_nc_” prefix because they
       are not intended for use in the non-debugging library:

       <b>_nc_freeall</b>
            This frees (almost) all of the memory allocated by ncurses.

       <b>_nc_free_and_exit</b>
            This frees the memory allocated by ncurses (like
            <b>_nc_freeall</b>), and exits the program.  It is preferred over
            <b>_nc_freeall </b>since some of that memory may be required to
            keep the application running.  Simply exiting (with the giv‐
            en exit-code) is safer.

       <b>_nc_free_tinfo</b>
            Use this function if only the low-level terminfo functions
            (and corresponding library) are used.  Like <b>_nc_free_and_ex‐</b>
            <b>it</b>, it exits the program after freeing memory.

       The functions prefixed “_nc” are normally not available; they
       must be configured into the library at build time using the
       <b>--disable-leaks </b>option.  That compiles-in code that frees memory
       that normally would not be freed.

       The <b>exit_curses </b>and <b>exit_terminfo </b>functions call <b>_nc_free_and_ex‐</b>
       <b>it </b>and <b>_nc_free_tinfo </b>if the library is configured to support
       memory-leak checking.  If the library is not configured to sup‐
       port memory-leak checking, they simply call <b>exit</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       These functions do not return a value.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are not part of X/Open Curses; nor do other im‐
       plementations of curses provide a similar feature.

       In any implementation of X/Open Curses, an application can free
       part of the memory allocated by curses:

       •   The portable part of <b>exit_curses </b>can be freed using
           <b>delscreen</b>, passing the <b>SCREEN* </b>pointer returned by <b>newterm</b>.

           In some implementations, there is a global variable <b>sp </b>which
           could be used, e.g., if the screen were only initialized us‐
           ing <b>initscr</b>.

       •   The portable part of <b>exit_terminfo </b>can be freed using
           <b>del_curterm</b>.

           In this case, there is a global variable <b>cur_term </b>which can
           be used as parameter.
