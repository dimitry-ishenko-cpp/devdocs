NAME </h2>
<pre>
       shm_open — open a shared memory object (<b>REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int shm_open(const char *<i>name</i>, int <i>oflag</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>shm_open</i>() function shall establish a connection between a
       shared memory object and a file descriptor. It shall create an
       open file description that refers to the shared memory object and
       a file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The
       file descriptor shall be allocated as described in <i>Section 2.14</i>,
       <i>File Descriptor Allocation</i>, and can be used by other functions to
       refer to that shared memory object.  The <i>name</i> argument points to
       a string naming a shared memory object. It is unspecified whether
       the name appears in the file system and is visible to other
       functions that take pathnames as arguments. The <i>name</i> argument
       conforms to the construction rules for a pathname, except that
       the interpretation of &lt;slash&gt; characters other than the leading
       &lt;slash&gt; character in <i>name</i> is implementation-defined, and that the
       length limits for the <i>name</i> argument are implementation-defined
       and need not be the same as the pathname limits {PATH_MAX} and
       {NAME_MAX}.  If <i>name</i> begins with the &lt;slash&gt; character, then
       processes calling <i>shm_open</i>() with the same value of <i>name</i> refer to
       the same shared memory object, as long as that name has not been
       removed. If <i>name</i> does not begin with the &lt;slash&gt; character, the
       effect is implementation-defined.

       If successful, <i>shm_open</i>() shall return a file descriptor for the
       shared memory object.  The open file description is new, and
       therefore the file descriptor does not share it with any other
       processes. It is unspecified whether the file offset is set. The
       FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated with the new file
       descriptor is set.

       The file status flags and file access modes of the open file
       description are according to the value of <i>oflag</i>.  The <i>oflag</i>
       argument is the bitwise-inclusive OR of the following flags
       defined in the <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> header. Applications specify exactly one
       of the first two values (access modes) below in the value of
       <i>oflag</i>:

       O_RDONLY    Open for read access only.

       O_RDWR      Open for read or write access.

       Any combination of the remaining flags may be specified in the
       value of <i>oflag</i>:

       O_CREAT     If the shared memory object exists, this flag has no
                   effect, except as noted under O_EXCL below.
                   Otherwise, the shared memory object is created. The
                   user ID of the shared memory object shall be set to
                   the effective user ID of the process. The group ID of
                   the shared memory object shall be set to the
                   effective group ID of the process; however, if the
                   <i>name</i> argument is visible in the file system, the
                   group ID may be set to the group ID of the containing
                   directory. The permission bits of the shared memory
                   object shall be set to the value of the <i>mode</i> argument
                   except those set in the file mode creation mask of
                   the process. When bits in <i>mode</i> other than the file
                   permission bits are set, the effect is unspecified.
                   The <i>mode</i> argument does not affect whether the shared
                   memory object is opened for reading, for writing, or
                   for both. The shared memory object has a size of
                   zero.

       O_EXCL      If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set, <i>shm_open</i>() fails if
                   the shared memory object exists. The check for the
                   existence of the shared memory object and the
                   creation of the object if it does not exist is atomic
                   with respect to other processes executing <i>shm_open</i>()
                   naming the same shared memory object with O_EXCL and
                   O_CREAT set. If O_EXCL is set and O_CREAT is not set,
                   the result is undefined.

       O_TRUNC     If the shared memory object exists, and it is
                   successfully opened O_RDWR, the object shall be
                   truncated to zero length and the mode and owner shall
                   be unchanged by this function call. The result of
                   using O_TRUNC with O_RDONLY is undefined.

       When a shared memory object is created, the state of the shared
       memory object, including all data associated with the shared
       memory object, persists until the shared memory object is
       unlinked and all other references are gone. It is unspecified
       whether the name and shared memory object state remain valid
       after a system reboot.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>shm_open</i>() function shall return
       a non-negative integer representing the file descriptor.
       Otherwise, it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>

              specified by <i>oflag</i> are denied, or the shared memory object
              does not exist and permission to create the shared memory

   <b>Creating and Mapping a Shared Memory Object</b>
       The following code segment demonstrates the use of <i>shm_open</i>() to
       create a shared memory object which is then sized using
       <i>ftruncate</i>() before being mapped into the process address space
       using <i>mmap</i>():

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
           ...

           #define MAX_LEN 10000
           struct region {        /* Defines "structure" of shared memory */
               int len;
               char buf[MAX_LEN];
           };
           struct region *rptr;
           int fd;

           /* Create shared memory object and set its size */

           fd = shm_open("/myregion", O_CREAT | O_RDWR, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
           if (fd == -1)
               /* Handle error */;

           if (ftruncate(fd, sizeof(struct region)) == -1)
               /* Handle error */;

           /* Map shared memory object */

           rptr = mmap(NULL, sizeof(struct region),
                  PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);
           if (rptr == MAP_FAILED)
               /* Handle error */;

           /* Now we can refer to mapped region using fields of rptr;
              for example, rptr-&gt;len */

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       When the Memory Mapped Files option is supported, the normal
       <i>open</i>() call is used to obtain a descriptor to a file to be mapped
       according to existing practice with <i>mmap</i>().  When the Shared
       Memory Objects option is supported, the <i>shm_open</i>() function shall
       obtain a descriptor to the shared memory object to be mapped.

       There is ample precedent for having a file descriptor represent
       several types of objects. In the POSIX.1‐1990 standard, a file
       descriptor can represent a file, a pipe, a FIFO, a tty, or a
       directory. Many implementations simply have an operations vector,
       which is indexed by the file descriptor type and does very
       different operations. Note that in some cases the file descriptor
       passed to generic operations on file descriptors is returned by
       <i>open</i>() or <i>creat</i>() and in some cases returned by alternate
       functions, such as <i>pipe</i>().  The latter technique is used by
       <i>shm_open</i>().

       Note that such shared memory objects can actually be implemented
       as mapped files. In both cases, the size can be set after the
       open using <i>ftruncate</i>().  The <i>shm_open</i>() function itself does not
       create a shared object of a specified size because this would
       duplicate an extant function that set the size of an object
       referenced by a file descriptor.

       On implementations where memory objects are implemented using the
       existing file system, the <i>shm_open</i>() function may be implemented
       using a macro that invokes <i>open</i>(), and the <i>shm_unlink</i>() function
       may be implemented using a macro that invokes <i>unlink</i>().

       For implementations without a permanent file system, the
       definition of the name of the memory objects is allowed not to
       survive a system reboot. Note that this allows systems with a
       permanent file system to implement memory objects as data
       structures internal to the implementation as well.

       On implementations that choose to implement memory objects using
       memory directly, a <i>shm_open</i>() followed by an <i>ftruncate</i>() and
       <i>close</i>() can be used to preallocate a shared memory area and to
       set the size of that preallocation. This may be necessary for
       systems without virtual memory hardware support in order to
       ensure that the memory is contiguous.

       The set of valid open flags to <i>shm_open</i>() was restricted to
       O_RDONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, and O_TRUNC because these could be
       easily implemented on most memory mapping systems. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 is silent on the results if the implementation
       cannot supply the requested file access because of
       implementation-defined reasons, including hardware ones.

       The error conditions <b>[EACCES] </b>and <b>[ENOTSUP] </b>are provided to
       inform the application that the implementation cannot complete a
       request.

       <b>[EACCES] </b>indicates for implementation-defined reasons, probably
       hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with a
       requested mode because it conflicts with another requested mode.
       An example might be that an application desires to open a memory
       object two times, mapping different areas with different access
       modes. If the implementation cannot map a single area into a
       process space in two places, which would be required if different
       access modes were required for the two areas, then the
       implementation may inform the application at the time of the
       second open.

       <b>[ENOTSUP] </b>indicates for implementation-defined reasons, probably
       hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with a
       requested mode at all. An example would be that the hardware of
       the implementation cannot support write-only shared memory areas.

       On all implementations, it may be desirable to restrict the
       location of the memory objects to specific file systems for
       performance (such as a RAM disk) or implementation-defined
       reasons (shared memory supported directly only on certain file
       systems). The <i>shm_open</i>() function may be used to enforce these
       restrictions. There are a number of methods available to the
       application to determine an appropriate name of the file or the
       location of an appropriate directory. One way is from the
       environment via <i>getenv</i>().  Another would be from a configuration
       file.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 specifies that memory objects have
       initial contents of zero when created. This is consistent with
       current behavior for both files and newly allocated memory. For
       those implementations that use physical memory, it would be
       possible that such implementations could simply use available
       memory and give it to the process uninitialized.  This, however,
       is not consistent with standard behavior for the uninitialized
       data area, the stack, and of course, files. Finally, it is highly
       desirable to set the allocated memory to zero for security
       reasons. Thus, initializing memory objects to zero is required.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version might require the <i>shm_open</i>() and <i>shm_unlink</i>()
       functions to have semantics similar to normal file system
       operations.
