PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_detach — detach a thread
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_detach(pthread_t <i>thread</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_detach</i>() function shall indicate to the
       implementation that storage for the thread <i>thread</i> can be
       reclaimed when that thread terminates. If <i>thread</i> has not
       terminated, <i>pthread_detach</i>() shall not cause it to terminate.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>thread</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_detach</i>() does not refer to a joinable thread.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the call succeeds, <i>pthread_detach</i>() shall return 0; otherwise,
       an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_detach</i>() function shall not return an error code of
       <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_join</i>() or <i>pthread_detach</i>() functions should
       eventually be called for every thread that is created so that
       storage associated with the thread may be reclaimed.

       It has been suggested that a ``detach'' function is not
       necessary; the <i>detachstate</i> thread creation attribute is
       sufficient, since a thread need never be dynamically detached.
       However, need arises in at least two cases:

        1. In a cancellation handler for a <i>pthread_join</i>() it is nearly
           essential to have a <i>pthread_detach</i>() function in order to
           detach the thread on which <i>pthread_join</i>() was waiting.
           Without it, it would be necessary to have the handler do
           another <i>pthread_join</i>() to attempt to detach the thread, which
           would both delay the cancellation processing for an unbounded
           period and introduce a new call to <i>pthread_join</i>(), which
           might itself need a cancellation handler. A dynamic detach is
           nearly essential in this case.

        2. In order to detach the ``initial thread'' (as may be
           desirable in processes that set up server threads).

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>thread</i> argument to <i>pthread_detach</i>() does not refer to a joinable
       thread, it is recommended that the function should fail and
       report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.

       If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of
       its lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and
       report an <b>[ESRCH] </b>error.
