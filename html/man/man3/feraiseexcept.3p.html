PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       feraiseexcept — raise floating-point exception
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;fenv.h&gt;

       int feraiseexcept(int <i>excepts</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>feraiseexcept</i>() function shall attempt to raise the supported
       floating-point exceptions represented by the <i>excepts</i> argument.
       The order in which these floating-point exceptions are raised is
       unspecified, except that if the <i>excepts</i> argument represents IEC
       60559 valid coincident floating-point exceptions for atomic
       operations (namely overflow and inexact, or underflow and
       inexact), then overflow or underflow shall be raised before
       inexact.  Whether the <i>feraiseexcept</i>() function additionally
       raises the inexact floating-point exception whenever it raises
       the overflow or underflow floating-point exception is
       implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the argument is zero or if all the specified exceptions were
       successfully raised, <i>feraiseexcept</i>() shall return zero.
       Otherwise, it shall return a non-zero value.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The effect is intended to be similar to that of floating-point
       exceptions raised by arithmetic operations. Hence, enabled traps
       for floating-point exceptions raised by this function are taken.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Raising overflow or underflow is allowed to also raise inexact
       because on some architectures the only practical way to raise an
       exception is to execute an instruction that has the exception as
       a side-effect. The function is not restricted to accept only
       valid coincident expressions for atomic operations, so the
       function can be used to raise exceptions accrued over several
       operations.
