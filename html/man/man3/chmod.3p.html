NAME </h2>
<pre>
       chmod, fchmodat — change mode of a file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

       int chmod(const char *<i>path</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int fchmodat(int <i>fd</i>, const char *<i>path</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>, int <i>flag</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>chmod</i>() function shall change S_ISUID, S_ISGID, S_ISVTX, and
       the file permission bits of the file named by the pathname
       pointed to by the <i>path</i> argument to the corresponding bits in the
       <i>mode</i> argument. The application shall ensure that the effective
       user ID of the process matches the owner of the file or the
       process has appropriate privileges in order to do this.

       S_ISUID, S_ISGID, S_ISVTX, and the file permission bits are
       described in <i>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</i>.

       If the calling process does not have appropriate privileges, and
       if the group ID of the file does not match the effective group ID
       or one of the supplementary group IDs and if the file is a
       regular file, bit S_ISGID (set-group-ID on execution) in the
       file's mode shall be cleared upon successful return from <i>chmod</i>().

       Additional implementation-defined restrictions may cause the
       S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits in <i>mode</i> to be ignored.

       Upon successful completion, <i>chmod</i>() shall mark for update the
       last file status change timestamp of the file.

       The <i>fchmodat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>chmod</i>()
       function except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a relative path.
       In this case the file to be changed is determined relative to the
       directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the
       current working directory. If the access mode of the open file
       description associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH,
       the function shall check whether directory searches are permitted
       using the current permissions of the directory underlying the
       file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function
       shall not perform the check.

       Values for <i>flag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of
       flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>:

       AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
             If <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, then the mode of the
             symbolic link is changed.

       If <i>fchmodat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used. If also
       <i>flag</i> is zero, the behavior shall be identical to a call to
       <i>chmod</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
       Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error. If -1 is returned, no change to the file mode
       occurs.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file
              and the process does not have appropriate privileges.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       The <i>fchmodat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd</i> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path</i> argument does not specify an absolute path and
              the <i>fd</i> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
              descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument is not an absolute path and <i>fd</i> is a file
              descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during execution of the function.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>mode</i> argument is invalid.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The <i>fchmodat</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>flag</i> argument is invalid.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW bit is set in the <i>flag</i> argument,
              <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, and the system does not
              support changing the mode of a symbolic link.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Setting Read Permissions for User, Group, and Others</b>
       The following example sets read permissions for the owner, group,
       and others.

           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

           const char *path;
           ...
           chmod(path, S_IRUSR|S_IRGRP|S_IROTH);

   <b>Setting Read, Write, and Execute Permissions for the Owner Only</b>
       The following example sets read, write, and execute permissions
       for the owner, and no permissions for group and others.

           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

           const char *path;
           ...
           chmod(path, S_IRWXU);

   <b>Setting Different Permissions for Owner, Group, and Other</b>
       The following example sets owner permissions for CHANGEFILE to
       read, write, and execute, group permissions to read and execute,
       and other permissions to read.

           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

           #define CHANGEFILE "/etc/myfile"
           ...
           chmod(CHANGEFILE, S_IRWXU|S_IRGRP|S_IXGRP|S_IROTH);

   <b>Setting and Checking File Permissions</b>
       The following example sets the file permission bits for a file
       named <b>/home/cnd/mod1</b>, then calls the <i>stat</i>() function to verify
       the permissions.

           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

           int status;
           struct stat buffer
           ...
           chmod("/home/cnd/mod1", S_IRWXU|S_IRWXG|S_IROTH|S_IWOTH);
           status = stat("/home/cnd/mod1", &amp;buffer);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       In order to ensure that the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits are set, an
       application requiring this should use <i>stat</i>() after a successful
       <i>chmod</i>() to verify this.

       Any file descriptors currently open by any process on the file
       could possibly become invalid if the mode of the file is changed
       to a value which would deny access to that process. One situation
       where this could occur is on a stateless file system. This
       behavior will not occur in a conforming environment.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 specifies that the S_ISGID bit is
       cleared by <i>chmod</i>() on a regular file under certain conditions.
       This is specified on the assumption that regular files may be
       executed, and the system should prevent users from making
       executable <i>setgid</i>() files perform with privileges that the caller
       does not have. On implementations that support execution of other
       file types, the S_ISGID bit should be cleared for those file
       types under the same circumstances.

       Implementations that use the S_ISUID bit to indicate some other
       function (for example, mandatory record locking) on non-
       executable files need not clear this bit on writing. They should
       clear the bit for executable files and any other cases where the
       bit grants special powers to processes that change the file
       contents. Similar comments apply to the S_ISGID bit.

       The purpose of the <i>fchmodat</i>() function is to enable changing the
       mode of files in directories other than the current working
       directory without exposure to race conditions.  Any part of the
       path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to <i>chmod</i>(),
       resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor
       for the target directory and using the <i>fchmodat</i>() function it can
       be guaranteed that the changed file is located relative to the
       desired directory. Some implementations might allow changing the
       mode of symbolic links. This is not supported by the interfaces
       in the POSIX specification. Systems with such support provide an
       interface named <i>lchmod</i>().  To support such implementations
       <i>fchmodat</i>() has a <i>flag</i> parameter.
