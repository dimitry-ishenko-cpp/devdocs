       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int chown(const char *<i>path</i>, uid_t <i>owner</i>, gid_t <i>group</i>);

           int <i>flag</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>chown</i>() function shall change the user and group ownership of
       a file.

       The <i>path</i> argument points to a pathname naming a file. The user ID
       and group ID of the named file shall be set to the numeric values
       contained in <i>owner</i> and <i>group</i>, respectively.

       Only processes with an effective user ID equal to the user ID of
       the file or with appropriate privileges may change the ownership
       of a file. If _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is in effect for <i>path</i>:

        *  Changing the user ID is restricted to processes with
           appropriate privileges.

        *  Changing the group ID is permitted to a process with an
           effective user ID equal to the user ID of the file, but
           without appropriate privileges, if and only if <i>owner</i> is equal
           to the file's user ID or (<b>uid_t</b>)-1 and <i>group</i> is equal either
           to the calling process' effective group ID or to one of its
           supplementary group IDs.

       If the specified file is a regular file, one or more of the
       S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, and
       the process does not have appropriate privileges, the set-user-ID
       (S_ISUID) and set-group-ID (S_ISGID) bits of the file mode shall
       be cleared upon successful return from <i>chown</i>().  If the specified
       file is a regular file, one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or
       S_IXOTH bits of the file mode are set, and the process has
       appropriate privileges, it is implementation-defined whether the
       set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are altered. If the <i>chown</i>()
       function is successfully invoked on a file that is not a regular
       file and one or more of the S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH bits of
       the file mode are set, the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits may
       be cleared.

       If <i>owner</i> or <i>group</i> is specified as (<b>uid_t</b>)-1 or (<b>gid_t</b>)-1,
       respectively, the corresponding ID of the file shall not be
       changed.

       Upon successful completion, <i>chown</i>() shall mark for update the
       last file status change timestamp of the file, except that if
       <i>owner</i> is (<b>uid_t</b>)-1 and <i>group</i> is (<b>gid_t</b>)-1, the file status change
       timestamp need not be marked for update.

       The <i>fchownat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>chown</i>() and
       <i>lchown</i>() functions except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a
       relative path. In this case the file to be changed is determined
       relative to the directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i>
       instead of the current working directory. If the access mode of
       the open file description associated with the file descriptor is
       not O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory searches
       are permitted using the current permissions of the directory
       underlying the file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH,
       the function shall not perform the check.

       Values for <i>flag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of
       flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>:

       AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
             If <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, ownership of the symbolic
             link is changed.

       If <i>fchownat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to <i>chown</i>() or <i>lchown</i>()
       respectively, depending on whether or not the AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
       bit is set in the <i>flag</i> argument.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
       Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error. If -1 is returned, no changes are made in the
       user ID and group ID of the file.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The effective user ID does not match the owner of the
              file, or the calling process does not have appropriate
              privileges and _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED indicates that such
              privilege is required.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       The <i>fchownat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd</i> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path</i> argument does not specify an absolute path and
              the <i>fd</i> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
              descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument is not an absolute path and <i>fd</i> is a file
              descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading or writing to the file
              system.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>chown</i>() function was interrupted by a signal which was
              caught.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The owner or group ID supplied is not a value supported by
              the implementation.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The <i>fchownat</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>flag</i> argument is not valid.

EXAMPLES </h2>

       None.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Although <i>chown</i>() can be used on some implementations by the file
       owner to change the owner and group to any desired values, the
       only portable use of this function is to change the group of a
       file to the effective GID of the calling process or to a member
       of its group set.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       System III and System V allow a user to give away files; that is,
       the owner of a file may change its user ID to anything. This is a
       serious problem for implementations that are intended to meet
       government security regulations.  Version 7 and 4.3 BSD permit
       only the superuser to change the user ID of a file. Some
       government agencies (usually not ones concerned directly with
       security) find this limitation too confining. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 uses <i>may</i> to permit secure implementations while not
       disallowing System V.

       System III and System V allow the owner of a file to change the
       group ID to anything. Version 7 permits only the superuser to
       change the group ID of a file.  4.3 BSD permits the owner to
       change the group ID of a file to its effective group ID or to any
       of the groups in the list of supplementary group IDs, but to no
       others.

       The POSIX.1‐1990 standard requires that the <i>chown</i>() function
       invoked by a non-appropriate privileged process clear the S_ISGID
       and the S_ISUID bits for regular files, and permits them to be
       cleared for other types of files. This is so that changes in
       accessibility do not accidentally cause files to become security
       holes.  Unfortunately, requiring these bits to be cleared on non-
       executable data files also clears the mandatory file locking bit
       (shared with S_ISGID), which is an extension on many
       implementations (it first appeared in System V). These bits
       should only be required to be cleared on regular files that have
       one or more of their execute bits set.

       The purpose of the <i>fchownat</i>() function is to enable changing
       ownership of files in directories other than the current working
       directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the
       path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to <i>chown</i>()
       or <i>lchown</i>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file
       descriptor for the target directory and using the <i>fchownat</i>()
       function it can be guaranteed that the changed file is located
       relative to the desired directory.
