DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>fmemopen</b>() function opens a stream that permits the access
       specified by <i>mode</i>.  The stream allows I/O to be performed on the
       string or memory buffer pointed to by <i>buf</i>.

       The <i>mode</i> argument specifies the semantics of I/O on the stream,
       and is one of the following:

       <i>r</i>      The stream is opened for reading.

       <i>w</i>      The stream is opened for writing.

       <i>a</i>      Append; open the stream for writing, with the initial
              buffer position set to the first null byte.

       <i>r+</i>     Open the stream for reading and writing.

       <i>w+</i>     Open the stream for reading and writing.  The buffer
              contents are truncated (i.e., '\0' is placed in the first
              byte of the buffer).

       <i>a+</i>     Append; open the stream for reading and writing, with the
              initial buffer position set to the first null byte.

       The stream maintains the notion of a current position, the
       location where the next I/O operation will be performed.  The
       current position is implicitly updated by I/O operations.  It can
       be explicitly updated using <a href="fseek.3.html">fseek(3)</a>, and determined using
       <a href="ftell.3.html">ftell(3)</a>.  In all modes other than append, the initial position
       is set to the start of the buffer.  In append mode, if no null
       byte is found within the buffer, then the initial position is
       <i>size+1</i>.

       If <i>buf</i> is specified as NULL, then <b>fmemopen</b>() allocates a buffer
       of <i>size</i> bytes.  This is useful for an application that wants to
       write data to a temporary buffer and then read it back again.
       The initial position is set to the start of the buffer.  The
       buffer is automatically freed when the stream is closed.  Note
       that the caller has no way to obtain a pointer to the temporary
       buffer allocated by this call (but see <a href="open_memstream.3.html">open_memstream(3)</a>).

       If <i>buf</i> is not NULL, then it should point to a buffer of at least
       <i>size</i> bytes allocated by the caller.

       When a stream that has been opened for writing is flushed
       (<a href="fflush.3.html">fflush(3)</a>) or closed (<a href="fclose.3.html">fclose(3)</a>), a null byte is written at the
       end of the buffer if there is space.  The caller should ensure
       that an extra byte is available in the buffer (and that <i>size</i>
       counts that byte) to allow for this.

       In a stream opened for reading, null bytes ('\0') in the buffer
       do not cause read operations to return an end-of-file indication.
       A read from the buffer will indicate end-of-file only when the
       current buffer position advances <i>size</i> bytes past the start of the
       buffer.

       Write operations take place either at the current position (for
       modes other than append), or at the current size of the stream
       (for append modes).

       Attempts to write more than <i>size</i> bytes to the buffer result in an
       error.  By default, such errors will be visible (by the absence
       of data) only when the <i>stdio</i> buffer is flushed.  Disabling
       buffering with the following call may be useful to detect errors
       at the time of an output operation:

           setbuf(stream, NULL);
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <b>fmemopen</b>() returns a <i>FILE</i> pointer.
       Otherwise, NULL is returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the
       error.

STANDARDS </h2>

</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       glibc 1.0.x.  POSIX.1-2008.

       POSIX.1-2008 specifies that 'b' in <i>mode</i> shall be ignored.
       However, Technical Corrigendum 1 adjusts the standard to allow
       implementation-specific treatment for this case, thus permitting
       the glibc treatment of 'b'.

       With glibc 2.22, binary mode (see below) was removed, many
       longstanding bugs in the implementation of <b>fmemopen</b>() were fixed,
       and a new versioned symbol was created for this interface.

   <b>Binary mode</b>
       From glibc 2.9 to glibc 2.21, the glibc implementation of
       <b>fmemopen</b>() supported a "binary" mode, enabled by specifying the
       letter 'b' as the second character in <i>mode</i>.  In this mode, writes
       don't implicitly add a terminating null byte, and <a href="fseek.3.html">fseek(3)</a>
       <b>SEEK_END </b>is relative to the end of the buffer (i.e., the value
       specified by the <i>size</i> argument), rather than the current string
       length.

       An API bug afflicted the implementation of binary mode: to
       specify binary mode, the 'b' must be the <i>second</i> character in
       <i>mode</i>.  Thus, for example, "wb+" has the desired effect, but "w+b"
       does not.  This is inconsistent with the treatment of <i>mode</i> by
       <a href="fopen.3.html">fopen(3)</a>.

       Binary mode was removed in glibc 2.22; a 'b' specified in <i>mode</i>
       has no effect.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       There is no file descriptor associated with the file stream
       returned by this function (i.e., <a href="fileno.3.html">fileno(3)</a> will return an error
       if called on the returned stream).
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Before glibc 2.22, if <i>size</i> is specified as zero, <b>fmemopen</b>() fails
       with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.  It would be more consistent if this case
       successfully created a stream that then returned end-of-file on
       the first attempt at reading; since glibc 2.22, the glibc
       implementation provides that behavior.

       Before glibc 2.22, specifying append mode ("a" or "a+") for
       <b>fmemopen</b>() sets the initial buffer position to the first null
       byte, but (if the current position is reset to a location other
       than the end of the stream) does not force subsequent writes to
       append at the end of the stream.  This bug is fixed in glibc
       2.22.

       Before glibc 2.22, if the <i>mode</i> argument to <b>fmemopen</b>() specifies
       append ("a" or "a+"), and the <i>size</i> argument does not cover a null
       byte in <i>buf</i>, then, according to POSIX.1-2008, the initial buffer
       position should be set to the next byte after the end of the
       buffer.  However, in this case the glibc <b>fmemopen</b>() sets the
       buffer position to -1.  This bug is fixed in glibc 2.22.

       Before glibc 2.22, when a call to <a href="fseek.3.html">fseek(3)</a> with a <i>whence</i> value of
       <b>SEEK_END </b>was performed on a stream created by <b>fmemopen</b>(), the
       <i>offset</i> was <i>subtracted</i> from the end-of-stream position, instead of
       being added.  This bug is fixed in glibc 2.22.

       The glibc 2.9 addition of "binary" mode for <b>fmemopen</b>() silently
       changed the ABI: previously, <b>fmemopen</b>() ignored 'b' in <i>mode</i>.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The program below uses <b>fmemopen</b>() to open an input buffer, and
       <a href="open_memstream.3.html">open_memstream(3)</a> to open a dynamically sized output buffer.  The
       program scans its input string (taken from the program's first
       command-line argument) reading integers, and writes the squares
       of these integers to the output buffer.  An example of the output
       produced by this program is the following:

           $ <b>./a.out '1 23 43'</b>
           size=11; ptr=1 529 1849

       int

               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

           in = fmemopen(argv[1], strlen(argv[1]), "r");
           if (in == NULL)
               err(EXIT_FAILURE, "fmemopen");

           out = open_memstream(&amp;ptr, &amp;size);
           if (out == NULL)

               if (s &lt;= 0)
                   break;

               s = fprintf(out, "%d ", v * v);
               if (s == -1)
                   err(EXIT_FAILURE, "fprintf");
           }

           fclose(in);
