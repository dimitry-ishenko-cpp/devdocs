NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_next_ex, pcap_next - read the next packet from a pcap_t
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pcap_next_ex(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_pkthdr **pkt_header,</b>
           <b>const u_char **pkt_data);</b>
       <b>const u_char *pcap_next(pcap_t *p, struct pcap_pkthdr *h);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_next_ex</b>() reads the next packet and returns a
       success/failure indication.  If the packet was read without
       problems, the pointer pointed to by the <i>pkt_header</i> argument is
       set to point to the <b>pcap_pkthdr </b>struct for the packet, and the
       pointer pointed to by the <i>pkt_data</i> argument is set to point to
       the data in the packet.  The <b>struct pcap_pkthdr </b>and the packet
       data are not to be freed by the caller, and are not guaranteed to
       be valid after the next call to <b>pcap_next_ex</b>(), <b>pcap_next</b>(),
       <b>pcap_loop</b>(3PCAP), or <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP); if the code needs them
       to remain valid, it must make a copy of them.

       <b>pcap_next</b>() reads the next packet (by calling <b>pcap_dispatch</b>()
       with a <i>cnt</i> of 1) and returns a <b>u_char </b>pointer to the data in that
       packet.  The packet data is not to be freed by the caller, and is
       not guaranteed to be valid after the next call to <b>pcap_next_ex</b>(),
       <b>pcap_next</b>(), <b>pcap_loop</b>(), or <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(); if the code needs
       it to remain valid, it must make a copy of it.  The <b>pcap_pkthdr</b>
       structure pointed to by <i>h</i> is filled in with the appropriate
       values for the packet.

       The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.
       The format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return
       value of the <b>pcap_datalink</b>(3PCAP) routine when handed the <b>pcap_t</b>
       value also passed to <b>pcap_loop</b>() or <b>pcap_dispatch</b>().
       <i><a href="https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html">https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html</a> </i> lists the values
       <b>pcap_datalink</b>() can return and describes the packet formats that
       correspond to those values.  The value it returns will be valid
       for all packets received unless and until
       <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>(3PCAP) is called; after a successful call to
       <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>(), all subsequent packets will have a link-
       layer header of the type specified by the link-layer header type
       value passed to <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>().

       Do <b>NOT </b>assume that the packets for a given capture or
       ``savefile`` will have any given link-layer header type, such as
       <b>DLT_EN10MB </b>for Ethernet.  For example, the "any" device on Linux
       will have a link-layer header type of <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL </b>or
       <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL2 </b>even if all devices on the system at the time the
       "any" device is opened have some other data link type, such as
       <b>DLT_EN10MB </b>for Ethernet.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_next_ex</b>() returns <b>1 </b>if the packet was read without problems,
       <b>0 </b>if packets are being read from a live capture and the packet
       buffer timeout expired, <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK </b>if packets are being
       read from a ``savefile'' and there are no more packets to read
       from the savefile, <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED </b>if called on a
       capture handle that has been created but not activated, or
       <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>if an error occurred while reading the packet.  If
       <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is returned, <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP)
       may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch or display the error
       text.

       <b>pcap_next</b>() returns a pointer to the packet data on success, and
       returns <b>NULL </b>if an error occurred, or if no packets were read
       from a live capture (if, for example, they were discarded because
       they didn't pass the packet filter, or if, on platforms that
       support a packet buffer timeout that starts before any packets
       arrive, the timeout expires before any packets arrive, or if the
       file descriptor for the capture device is in non-blocking mode
       and no packets were available to be read), or if no more packets
       are available in a ``savefile.'' Unfortunately, there is no way
       to determine whether an error occurred or not.
