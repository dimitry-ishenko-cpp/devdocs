NAME </h2>
<pre>
       umad_recv - receive umad
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;infiniband/umad.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int umad_recv(int </b><i>portid</i><b>, void </b><i>*umad</i><b>, int </b><i>*length</i><b>, int </b><i>timeout_ms</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>umad_recv() </b>waits up to <i>timeout_ms</i> milliseconds for an incoming
       MAD message to be received from the port specified by <i>portid</i>.

       A MAD "message" consists of a single MAD packet <i>or</i> a coalesced
       multipacket RMPP transmission.  In the RMPP case the header of
       the first RMPP packet is returned as the header of the buffer and
       the buffer data contains the coalesced data section of each
       subsequent RMPP MAD packet within the transmission.  Thus all the
       RMPP headers except the first are not copied to user space from
       the kernel.

       The message is copied to the <i>umad</i> buffer if there is sufficient
       room and the received <i>length</i> is indicated.  If the buffer is not
       large enough, the size of the umad buffer needed is returned in
       <i>length</i>.  A negative <i>timeout_ms</i> makes the function block until a
       packet is received. A <i>timeout_ms</i> parameter of zero indicates a
       non blocking read.

       <b>Note </b><i>length</i> is a pointer to the length of the <b>data </b>portion of the
       umad buffer.  This means that <i>umad</i> must point to a buffer at
       least umad_size() + <i>*length</i> bytes long.

       <b>Note also </b>that <i>*length</i> must be &gt;= 256 bytes.  This length allows
       for at least a single MAD packet to be returned.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>umad_recv() </b>on success return the agentid; on error, errno is set
       and a negative value is returned as follows:
        -EINVAL      invalid port handle or agentid or *length is less
       than the minimum supported
        -EIO         receive operation failed
        -EWOULDBLOCK non blocking read can't be fulfilled
        -ENOSPC      The provided buffer is not long enough for the
       complete message.
