NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_amd64_fam17h_zen2 - support for AMD64 Family 17h model 31h
       processors
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: amd64_fam17h_zen2</b>
       <b>PMU desc: AMD64 Fam17h Zen2</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports AMD Family 17h processors Zen2 core PMU in
       both 32 and 64-bit modes.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on AMD64 Family 17h Zen2
       core PMU:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>h      </b>Measure at while executing in host mode (when using
              virtualization). This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLMH</b>.  This
              modifier is available starting with Fam10h. This is a
              boolean modifier.

       <b>g      </b>Measure at while executing in guest mode (when using
              virtualization). This modifier is available starting with
              Fam10h. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].
