<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       utime — set file access and modification times
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;utime.h&gt;

       int utime(const char *<i>path</i>, const struct utimbuf *<i>times</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>utime</i>() function shall set the access and modification times
       of the file named by the <i>path</i> argument.

       If <i>times</i> is a null pointer, the access and modification times of
       the file shall be set to the current time. The effective user ID
       of the process shall match the owner of the file, or the process
       has write permission to the file or has appropriate privileges,
       to use <i>utime</i>() in this manner.

       If <i>times</i> is not a null pointer, <i>times</i> shall be interpreted as a
       pointer to a <b>utimbuf </b>structure and the access and modification
       times shall be set to the values contained in the designated
       structure. Only a process with the effective user ID equal to the
       user ID of the file or a process with appropriate privileges may
       use <i>utime</i>() this way.

       The <b>utimbuf </b>structure is defined in the <i>&lt;utime.h&gt;</i> header. The
       times in the structure <b>utimbuf </b>are measured in seconds since the
       Epoch.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>utime</i>() function shall mark the
       last file status change timestamp for update; see <i>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the error,
       and the file times shall not be affected.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>utime</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied by a component of the path
              prefix; or the <i>times</i> argument is a null pointer and the
              effective user ID of the process does not match the owner
              of the file, the process does not have write permission
              for the file, and the process does not have appropriate
              privileges.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The <i>times</i> argument is not a null pointer and the effective
              user ID of the calling process does not match the owner of
              the file and the calling process does not have appropriate
              privileges.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The file system containing the file is read-only.

       The <i>utime</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since the <b>utimbuf </b>structure only contains <b>time_t </b>variables and is
       not accurate to fractions of a second, applications should use
       the <i>utimensat</i>() function instead of the obsolescent <i>utime</i>()
       function.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>actime</i> structure member must be present so that an
       application may set it, even though an implementation may ignore
       it and not change the last data access timestamp on the file. If
       an application intends to leave one of the times of a file
       unchanged while changing the other, it should use <i>stat</i>() or
       <i>fstat</i>() to retrieve the file's <i>st_atim</i> and <i>st_mtim</i> parameters,
       set <i>actime</i> and <i>modtime</i> in the buffer, and change one of them
       before making the <i>utime</i>() call.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>utime</i>() function may be removed in a future version.
