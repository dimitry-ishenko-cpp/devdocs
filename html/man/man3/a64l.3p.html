PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       a64l, l64a — convert between a 32-bit integer and a radix-64
       ASCII string
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       long a64l(const char *<i>s</i>);
       char *l64a(long <i>value</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These functions maintain numbers stored in radix-64 ASCII
       characters. This is a notation by which 32-bit integers can be
       represented by up to six characters; each character represents a
       digit in radix-64 notation. If the type <b>long </b>contains more than
       32 bits, only the low-order 32 bits shall be used for these
       operations.

       The characters used to represent digits are <b>'.'  </b>(dot) for 0, <b>'/'</b>
       for 1, <b>'0' </b>through <b>'9' </b>for [2,11], <b>'A' </b>through <b>'Z' </b>for [12,37],
       and <b>'a' </b>through <b>'z' </b>for [38,63].

       The <i>a64l</i>() function shall take a pointer to a radix-64
       representation, in which the first digit is the least
       significant, and return the corresponding <b>long </b>value. If the
       string pointed to by <i>s</i> contains more than six characters, <i>a64l</i>()
       shall use the first six. If the first six characters of the
       string contain a null terminator, <i>a64l</i>() shall use only
       characters preceding the null terminator. The <i>a64l</i>() function
       shall scan the character string from left to right with the least
       significant digit on the left, decoding each character as a 6-bit
       radix-64 number. If the type <b>long </b>contains more than 32 bits, the
       resulting value is sign-extended. The behavior of <i>a64l</i>() is
       unspecified if <i>s</i> is a null pointer or the string pointed to by <i>s</i>
       was not generated by a previous call to <i>l64a</i>().

       The <i>l64a</i>() function shall take a <b>long </b>argument and return a
       pointer to the corresponding radix-64 representation. The
       behavior of <i>l64a</i>() is unspecified if <i>value</i> is negative.

       The value returned by <i>l64a</i>() may be a pointer into a static
       buffer. Subsequent calls to <i>l64a</i>() may overwrite the buffer.

       The <i>l64a</i>() function need not be thread-safe.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>a64l</i>() shall return the <b>long </b>value
       resulting from conversion of the input string. If a string
       pointed to by <i>s</i> is an empty string, <i>a64l</i>() shall return 0L.

       The <i>l64a</i>() function shall return a pointer to the radix-64
       representation. If <i>value</i> is 0L, <i>l64a</i>() shall return a pointer to
       an empty string.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the type <b>long </b>contains more than 32 bits, the result of
       <i>a64l</i>(<i>l64a</i>(<i>x</i>)) is <i>x</i> in the low-order 32 bits.
