DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These routines may be used to create a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
       archive  ``on  the  fly'' to support ``record mode'' services for
       PMAPI client applications.

       Each record mode ``session'' involves one or  more  PCP  archives
       each created using a dedicated <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> process, with an over‐
       all  Archive  Folio format as understood by <a href="../man1/pmafm.1.html">pmafm(1)</a>, to name and
       collect all of the archives associated with  a  single  recording
       session.

       The  <i>pmRecordHost</i> structure is used to maintain state information
       between the creator of the recording session and  the  associated
       <b>pmlogger </b>process(es).  The structure is defined as:
         typedef struct {
             FILE   *f_config;    /* caller writes pmlogger configuration here */
             int    fd_ipc;       /* IPC channel to pmlogger */
             char   *logfile;     /* full pathname for pmlogger error logfile */
             pid_t  pid;          /* process id for pmlogger */
             int    status;       /* exit status, -1 if unknown */
         } pmRecordHost;

       The  routines  are used in combination to create a recording ses‐
       sion as follows.

       1.  Call <b>pmRecordSetup </b>to establish a new recording session.  A
           new Archive Folio will be created using the name <i>folio</i>; if
           the file or directory <i>folio</i> already exists, or the file <i>folio</i>
           cannot be created, this is an error.  The application that is
           creating the session is identified by <i>creator</i> (most often
           this would be the same as the global PMAPI application name,
           as returned by <a href="pmgetprogname.3.html">pmGetProgname(3)</a>).  If the application knows
           how to create its own configuration file to replay the
           recorded session, then <i>replay</i> should be non-zero.

           <b>pmRecordSetup </b>returns a <i>stdio</i> stream onto which the applica‐
           tion should write the text of the required replay configura‐
           tion file, if any.

       2.  For each <i>host</i> that is to be included in the recording ses‐
           sion, call <b>pmRecordAddHost</b>.  A new <i>pmRecordHost</i> structure is
           returned via <i>rhp</i>.  It is assumed that <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> is running on
           <i>host</i> as this is how <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> will retrieve the required
           performance metrics.

           If this <i>host</i> is the default host for this recording session,
           then <i>isdefault</i> should be non-zero.  This will ensure that the
           corresponding archive appears first in the PCP archive folio,
           and hence the tools used to replay the archive folio will
           make the correct determination of the archive associated with
           the default host.  At most one <i>host</i> per recording session may
           be nominated as the default host.

           The calling application should write the desired <b>pmlogger</b>
           configuration onto the <i>stdio</i> stream returned via the <i>f_config</i>
           field in the <i>pmRecordHost</i> structure.

       3.  Optionally add arguments to the command line that will be
           used to launch <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> by calling <b>pmRecordControl </b>with a
           <i>request</i> of <b>PM_REC_SETARG</b>.  The argument is passed via <i>options</i>
           and one call to <b>pmRecordControl </b>is required for each distinct
           argument.

           An argument may be added for a particular <b>pmlogger </b>instance
           identified by <i>rhp</i>, or if the <i>rhp</i> argument is NULL the argu‐
           ment is added for all <b>pmlogger </b>instances that will be
           launched in the current recording session.

           Independent of any calls to <b>pmRecordControl </b>with a <i>request</i> of
           <b>PM_REC_SETARG</b>, each <b>pmlogger </b>instance will automatically be
           launched with the following arguments: <b>-c</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-x </b>and the
           basename for the PCP archive.

       4.  To commence the recording session, call <b>pmRecordControl </b>with
           a <i>request</i> of <b>PM_REC_ON</b>, and <i>rhp</i> must be NULL.  This will
           launch one <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> process for each host in the recording
           session, and initialize the <i>fd_ipc</i>, <i>logfile</i>, <i>pid</i> and <i>status</i>
           fields in the associated <i>pmRecordHost</i> structure(s).

       5.  To terminate a <b>pmlogger </b>instance identified by <i>rhp</i>, call <b>pm‐</b>
           <b>RecordControl </b>with a <i>request</i> of <b>PM_REC_OFF</b>.  If the <i>rhp</i> argu‐
           ment to <b>pmRecordControl </b>is NULL, the termination request is
           broadcast to all <b>pmlogger </b>processes in the current recording
           session.

           An informative dialog is generated directly by each <b>pmlogger</b>
           process and hence note the comments on the disposition of
           output from <b>pmlogger </b>below.

           Alternatively, <b>pmlogger </b>can be started with options to limit
           the duration of logging, e.g. the <b>-T </b>or <b>-s </b>arguments, in
           which case there is no need to call <b>pmRecordControl </b>with a
           <i>request</i> of <b>PM_REC_OFF </b>and no dialog is generated.

       6.  To display the current status of the <b>pmlogger </b>instance iden‐
           tified by <i>rhp</i>, call <b>pmRecordControl </b>with a <i>request</i> of
           <b>PM_REC_STATUS</b>.  If the <i>rhp</i> argument to <b>pmRecordControl </b>is
           NULL, the status request is broadcast to all <b>pmlogger</b>
           processes in the current recording session.

           The display is generated directly by each <b>pmlogger </b>process
           and hence note the comments on the disposition of output from
           <b>pmlogger </b>below.

       7.  To detach a <b>pmlogger </b>instance identified by <i>rhp</i> and allow it
           to continue independent of the application that launched the
           recording session, call <b>pmRecordControl </b>with a <i>request</i> of
           <b>PM_REC_DETACH</b>.  If the <i>rhp</i> argument to <b>pmRecordControl </b>is
           NULL, the detach request is broadcast to all <b>pmlogger</b>
           processes in the current recording session.

           An informative dialog is generated directly by each <b>pmlogger</b>
           process and hence note the comments on the disposition of
           output from <b>pmlogger </b>below.

       The calling application should not close any of the returned
       <i>stdio</i> streams; this will be done by <b>pmRecordControl </b>when record‐
       ing is commenced.

       Once <b>pmlogger </b>has been started for a recording session, then <b>pm‐</b>
       <b>logger </b>will assume responsibility for any dialog with the user in
       the event that the application that launched the recording ses‐
       sion should exit, particularly without terminating the recording
       session.

       By default, information and dialogs from <b>pmlogger </b>will be dis‐
       played using <a href="../man1/pmquery.1.html">pmquery(1)</a> on the assumption that most applications
       wishing to launch a recording session are GUI-based.  In the
       event that <b>pmquery </b>fails to display the information (for example,
       because the <b>DISPLAY </b>environment variable is not set), <b>pmlogger</b>
       will write on its own <i>stderr</i> stream (<b>not </b>the <i>stderr</i> stream of the
       launching process); the output will be assigned to the
       <i>XXXXXX.host.</i><b>log </b>file described in the FILES section below.  For
       convenience, the full pathname to this file is provided via the
       <i>logfile</i> field in the <i>pmRecordHost</i> structure.

       If the <i>options</i> argument to <b>pmRecordControl </b>is not NULL, this
       string may be used to pass additional arguments to <a href="../man1/pmquery.1.html">pmquery(1)</a> in
       those cases where a dialog is to be displayed.  One use of this
       capability would be to provide a <b>-geometry </b>string to control the
       placement of the dialog.

       Premature termination of a launched <b>pmlogger </b>process may be de‐
       termined using the <i>pmRecordHost</i> structure, by calling <a href="../man2/select.2.html">select(2)</a>
       on the <i>fd_ipc</i> field or polling the <i>status</i> field that will contain
       the termination status from <a href="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid(2)</a> if known, else -1.

DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmRecordSetup </b>may return <b>NULL </b>in the event of an error.  Check
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> for the real cause, but the value <b>EINVAL </b>typically means
       that the order of calls to these routines is not correct (there
       is obvious state associated with the current recording session
       that is maintained across calls to these routines).  For example
       the following calls would produce this <b>EINVAL </b>error; calling <b>pm‐</b>
       <b>RecordControl </b>before calling <b>pmRecordAddHost </b>at least once, or
       calling <b>pmRecordAddHost </b>before calling <b>pmRecordSetup</b>.

       <b>pmRecordControl </b>and <b>pmRecordAddHost </b>both return 0 on success,
       else a value less than 0 suitable for decoding with <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>
       on failure.  The value <b>-EINVAL </b>has the same interpretation as <i>er‐</i>
       <i>rno</i> being set to <b>EINVAL </b>as described above.

       <b>pmRecordControl </b>will return <b>PM_ERR_IPC </b>if the associated <b>pmlogger</b>
       process has already exited.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       These routines create a number of files in the <b>same directory </b>as
       the <i>folio</i> file named in the call to <b>pmRecordSetup</b>.  In all cases,
       the ``XXXXXX'' component is the result of calling <a href="mktemp.3.html">mktemp(3)</a>.

       <i>XXXXXX</i> If <i>replay</i> is non-zero, this is the creator's replay con‐
              figuration file, else an empty control file, used to guar‐
              antee uniqueness.
       <i>folio</i>  The PCP Archive Folio, suitable for use with <a href="../man1/pmafm.1.html">pmafm(1)</a>.
       <i>XXXXXX.host.</i><b>config</b>
              The <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> configuration for each <i>host</i> - if the same
              <i>host</i> is used in different calls to <b>pmRecordAddHost </b>within
              the same recording session then one of the letters ``a''
              through ``z'' will be appended to the ``XXXXXX'' part of
              all associated file names to ensure uniqueness.
       <i>XXXXXX.host.</i><b>log</b>
              <i>stdout</i> and <i>stderr</i> for the <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance for each
              <i>host</i>.
       <i>XXXXXX.host.</i>{<b>0</b>,<b>meta</b>,<b>index</b>}
              The files comprising a single PCP archive for each <i>host</i>.
