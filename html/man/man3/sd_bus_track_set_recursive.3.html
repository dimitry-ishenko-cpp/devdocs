DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_bus_track_new() </b>creates a new bus peer tracking object. The
       object is allocated for the specified bus, and returned in the
       <i>*ret</i> parameter. After use, the object should be freed again by
       dropping the acquired reference with <b>sd_bus_track_unref() </b>(see
       below). A bus peer tracking object may be used to keep track of
       peers on a specific IPC bus, for cases where peers are making use
       of one or more local objects, in order to control the lifecycle
       of the local objects and ensure they stay around as long as the
       peers needing them are around, and unreferenced (and possibly
       destroyed) as soon as all relevant peers have vanished. Each bus
       peer tracking object may be used to track zero, one or more peers
       add a time. References to specific bus peers are added via
       <a href="sd_bus_track_add_name.3.html">sd_bus_track_add_name(3)</a> or <b>sd_bus_track_add_sender()</b>. They may
       be dropped again via <b>sd_bus_track_remove_name() </b>and
       <b>sd_bus_track_remove_sender()</b>. Alternatively, references on peers
       are removed automatically when they disconnect from the bus. If
       non-<b>NULL </b>the <i>handler</i> may specify a function that is invoked
       whenever the last reference is dropped, regardless whether the
       reference is dropped explicitly via <b>sd_bus_track_remove_name() </b>or
       implicitly because the peer disconnected from the bus. The final
       argument <i>userdata</i> may be used to attach a generic user data
       pointer to the object. This pointer is passed to the handler
       callback when it is invoked.

       <b>sd_bus_track_ref() </b>creates a new reference to a bus peer tracking
       object. This object will not be destroyed until
       <b>sd_bus_track_unref() </b>has been called as many times plus once
       more. Once the reference count has dropped to zero, the specified
       object cannot be used anymore, further calls to
       <b>sd_bus_track_ref() </b>or <b>sd_bus_track_unref() </b>on the same object are
       illegal.

       <b>sd_bus_track_unref() </b>destroys a reference to a bus peer tracking
       object.

       <b>sd_bus_track_unrefp() </b>is similar to <b>sd_bus_track_unref() </b>but
       takes a pointer to a pointer to an <b>sd_bus_track </b>object. This call
       is useful in conjunction with GCC's and LLVM's <b>Clean-up Variable</b>
       <b>Attribute</b>[1]. Note that this function is defined as inline
       function.

       <b>sd_bus_track_ref()</b>, <b>sd_bus_track_unref() </b>and
       <b>sd_bus_track_unrefp() </b>execute no operation if the passed in bus
       peer tracking object is <b>NULL</b>.

       Bus peer tracking objects may exist in two modes: by default they
       operate in non-recursive mode, but may optionally be switched
       into recursive mode. If operating in the default non-recursive
       mode a peer is either tracked or not tracked. In this mode
       invoking <b>sd_bus_track_add_name() </b>multiple times in a row for the
       same peer is fully equivalent to calling it just once, as the
       call adds the peer to the set of tracked peers if necessary, and
       executes no operation if the peer is already being tracked. A
       single invocation of <b>sd_bus_track_remove_name() </b>removes the
       reference on the peer again, regardless how many times
       <b>sd_bus_track_add_name() </b>was called before. If operating in
       recursive mode, the number of times <b>sd_bus_track_add_name() </b>is
       invoked for the same peer name is counted and
       <b>sd_bus_track_remove_name() </b>must be called the same number of
       times before the peer is not tracked anymore, with the exception
       when the tracked peer vanishes from the bus, in which case the
       count is irrelevant and the tracking of the specific peer is
       immediately removed.  <b>sd_bus_track_get_recursive() </b>may be used to
       determine whether the bus peer tracking object is operating in
       recursive mode.  <b>sd_bus_track_set_recursive() </b>may be used to
       enable or disable recursive mode. By default a bus peer tracking
       object operates in non-recursive mode, and
       <b>sd_bus_track_get_recursive() </b>for a newly allocated object hence
       returns a value equal to zero. Use <b>sd_bus_track_set_recursive()</b>
       to enable recursive mode, right after allocation. It takes a
       boolean argument to enable or disable recursive mode. Note that
       tracking objects for which <b>sd_bus_track_add_name() </b>was already
       invoked at least once (and which hence track already one or more
       peers) may not be switched from recursive to non-recursive mode
       anymore.

       <b>sd_bus_track_get_bus() </b>returns the bus object the bus peer
       tracking object belongs to. It returns the bus object initially
       passed to <b>sd_bus_track_new() </b>when the object was allocated.

       <b>sd_bus_track_get_userdata() </b>returns the generic user data pointer
       set on the bus peer tracking object at the time of creation using
       <b>sd_bus_track_new() </b>or at a later time, using
       <b>sd_bus_track_set_userdata()</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>sd_bus_track_new() </b>and <b>sd_bus_track_set_recursive()</b>
       return 0 or a positive integer. On failure, they return a
       negative errno-style error code.

       <b>sd_bus_track_ref() </b>always returns the argument.

       <b>sd_bus_track_unref() </b>always returns <b>NULL</b>.

       <b>sd_bus_track_get_recursive() </b>returns 0 if non-recursive mode is
       selected (default), and greater than 0 if recursive mode is
       selected. On failure a negative errno-style error code is
       returned.

       <b>sd_bus_track_get_bus() </b>returns the bus object associated to the
       bus peer tracking object.

       <b>sd_bus_track_get_userdata() </b>returns the generic user data pointer
       associated with the bus peer tracking object.
       <b>sd_bus_track_set_userdata() </b>returns the previous user data
       pointer set.
</pre> <h2>
REFERENCE OWNERSHIP </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sd_bus_track_new() </b>function creates a new object and the
       caller owns the sole reference. When not needed anymore, this
       reference should be destroyed with <b>sd_bus_track_unref()</b>.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-EBUSY</b>
           Bus peers have already been added to the bus peer tracking
           object and <b>sd_bus_track_set_recursive() </b>was called to change
           tracking mode.

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
           Specified parameter is invalid (<b>NULL </b>in case of output
           parameters).

       <b>-ENOMEM</b>
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
