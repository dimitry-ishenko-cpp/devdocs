<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_rwlock_destroy, pthread_rwlock_init — destroy and
       initialize a read-write lock object
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_rwlock_destroy(pthread_rwlock_t *<i>rwlock</i>);
       int pthread_rwlock_init(pthread_rwlock_t *restrict <i>rwlock</i>,
           const pthread_rwlockattr_t *restrict <i>attr</i>);
       pthread_rwlock_t <i>rwlock</i> = PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_destroy</i>() function shall destroy the read-
       write lock object referenced by <i>rwlock</i> and release any resources
       used by the lock. The effect of subsequent use of the lock is
       undefined until the lock is reinitialized by another call to
       <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>().  An implementation may cause
       <i>pthread_rwlock_destroy</i>() to set the object referenced by <i>rwlock</i>
       to an invalid value. Results are undefined if
       <i>pthread_rwlock_destroy</i>() is called when any thread holds <i>rwlock</i>.
       Attempting to destroy an uninitialized read-write lock results in
       undefined behavior.

       The <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() function shall allocate any resources
       required to use the read-write lock referenced by <i>rwlock</i> and
       initializes the lock to an unlocked state with attributes
       referenced by <i>attr</i>.  If <i>attr</i> is NULL, the default read-write lock
       attributes shall be used; the effect is the same as passing the
       address of a default read-write lock attributes object. Once
       initialized, the lock can be used any number of times without
       being reinitialized. Results are undefined if
       <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() is called specifying an already initialized
       read-write lock. Results are undefined if a read-write lock is
       used without first being initialized.

       If the <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() function fails, <i>rwlock</i> shall not be
       initialized and the contents of <i>rwlock</i> are undefined.

       See <i>Section 2.9.9</i>, <i>Synchronization Object Copies and Alternative</i>
       <i>Mappings</i> for further requirements.

       In cases where default read-write lock attributes are
       appropriate, the macro PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER can be used to
       initialize read-write locks. The effect shall be equivalent to
       dynamic initialization by a call to <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() with
       the <i>attr</i> parameter specified as NULL, except that no error checks
       are performed.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized read-write lock attributes object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_rwlock_destroy</i>() and
       <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() functions shall return zero; otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The system lacked the necessary resources (other than
              memory) to initialize another read-write lock.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory exists to initialize the read-write
              lock.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have the privilege to perform the
              operation.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications using these and related read-write lock functions
       may be subject to priority inversion, as discussed in the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.291</i>, <i>Priority</i>
       <i>Inversion</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>rwlock</i> argument to <i>pthread_rwlock_destroy</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized read-write lock object, it is recommended that the
       function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized read-write lock attributes object, it is recommended
       that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>rwlock</i> argument to <i>pthread_rwlock_destroy</i>() or
       <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() refers to a locked read-write lock object,
       or detects that the value specified by the <i>rwlock</i> argument to
       <i>pthread_rwlock_init</i>() refers to an already initialized read-write
       lock object, it is recommended that the function should fail and
       report an <b>[EBUSY] </b>error.
