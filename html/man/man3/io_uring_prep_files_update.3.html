       io_uring_prep_files_update - prepare a registered file update

SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;liburing.h&gt;</b>

       <b>void io_uring_prep_files_update(struct io_uring_sqe *</b><i>sqe</i><b>,</b>
                                       <b>int *</b><i>fds</i><b>,</b>
                                       <b>unsigned </b><i>nr_fds</i><b>,</b>
                                       <b>int </b><i>offset</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <a href="io_uring_prep_files_update.3.html">io_uring_prep_files_update(3)</a> function prepares a request for
       updating a number of previously registered file descriptors. The
       submission queue entry <i>sqe</i> is setup to use the file descriptor
       array pointed to by <i>fds</i> and of <i>nr_fds</i> in length to update that
       amount of previously registered files starting at offset <i>offset</i>.

       Once a previously registered file is updated with a new one, the
       existing entry is updated and then removed from the table. This
       operation is equivalent to first unregistering that entry and
       then inserting a new one, just bundled into one combined
       operation.

       If <i>offset</i> is specified as IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC, io_uring will
       allocate free direct descriptors instead of having the
       application to pass, and store allocated direct descriptors into
       <i>fds</i> array, <i>cqe-&gt;res</i> will return the number of direct descriptors
       allocated.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       None
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These are the errors that are reported in the CQE <i>res</i> field. On
       success, <i>res</i> will contain the number of successfully updated file
       descriptors. On error, the following errors can occur.

       <b>-ENOMEM</b>
              The kernel was unable to allocate memory for the request.

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
              One of the fields set in the SQE was invalid.

       <b>-EFAULT</b>
              The kernel was unable to copy in the memory pointed to by
              <i>fds</i>.

       <b>-EBADF </b>On of the descriptors located in <i>fds</i> didn't refer to a
              valid file descriptor, or one of the file descriptors in
              the array referred to an io_uring instance.

       <b>-EOVERFLOW</b>
              The product of <i>offset</i> and <i>nr_fds</i> exceed the valid amount
              or overflowed.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       As with any request that passes in data in a struct, that data
       must remain valid until the request has been successfully
       submitted. It need not remain valid until completion. Once a
       request has been submitted, the in-kernel state is stable. Very
       early kernels (5.4 and earlier) required state to be stable until
       the completion occurred. Applications can test for this behavior
       by inspecting the <b>IORING_FEAT_SUBMIT_STABLE </b>flag passed back from
       <a href="io_uring_queue_init_params.3.html">io_uring_queue_init_params(3)</a>.
