       int poll(struct pollfd <i>fds</i>[], nfds_t <i>nfds</i>, int <i>timeout</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>poll</i>() function provides applications with a mechanism for
       multiplexing input/output over a set of file descriptors. For
       each member of the array pointed to by <i>fds</i>, <i>poll</i>() shall examine
       the given file descriptor for the event(s) specified in <i>events</i>.
       The number of <b>pollfd </b>structures in the <i>fds</i> array is specified by
       <i>nfds</i>.  The <i>poll</i>() function shall identify those file descriptors
       on which an application can read or write data, or on which
       certain events have occurred.

       The <i>fds</i> argument specifies the file descriptors to be examined
       and the events of interest for each file descriptor. It is a
       pointer to an array with one member for each open file descriptor
       of interest. The array's members are <b>pollfd </b>structures within
       which <i>fd</i> specifies an open file descriptor and <i>events</i> and <i>revents</i>
       are bitmasks constructed by OR'ing a combination of the following
       event flags:

       POLLIN      Data other than high-priority data may be read
                   without blocking.

                   For STREAMS, this flag is set in <i>revents</i> even if the
                   message is of zero length. This flag shall be
                   equivalent to POLLRDNORM | POLLRDBAND.

       POLLRDNORM  Normal data may be read without blocking.

                   For STREAMS, data on priority band 0 may be read
                   without blocking. This flag is set in <i>revents</i> even if
                   the message is of zero length.

       POLLRDBAND  Priority data may be read without blocking.

                   For STREAMS, data on priority bands greater than 0
                   may be read without blocking. This flag is set in
                   <i>revents</i> even if the message is of zero length.

       POLLPRI     High-priority data may be read without blocking.

                   For STREAMS, this flag is set in <i>revents</i> even if the
                   message is of zero length.

       POLLOUT     Normal data may be written without blocking.

                   For STREAMS, data on priority band 0 may be written
                   without blocking.

       POLLWRNORM  Equivalent to POLLOUT.

       POLLWRBAND  Priority data may be written.

                   For STREAMS, data on priority bands greater than 0
                   may be written without blocking. If any priority band
                   has been written to on this STREAM, this event only
                   examines bands that have been written to at least
                   once.

       POLLERR     An error has occurred on the device or stream. This
                   flag is only valid in the <i>revents</i> bitmask; it shall
                   be ignored in the <i>events</i> member.

       POLLHUP     A device has been disconnected, or a pipe or FIFO has
                   been closed by the last process that had it open for
                   writing. Once set, the hangup state of a FIFO shall
                   persist until some process opens the FIFO for writing
                   or until all read-only file descriptors for the FIFO
                   are closed. This event and POLLOUT are mutually-
                   exclusive; a stream can never be writable if a hangup
                   has occurred. However, this event and POLLIN,
                   POLLRDNORM, POLLRDBAND, or POLLPRI are not mutually-
                   exclusive. This flag is only valid in the <i>revents</i>
                   bitmask; it shall be ignored in the <i>events</i> member.

       POLLNVAL    The specified <i>fd</i> value is invalid. This flag is only
                   valid in the <i>revents</i> member; it shall ignored in the
                   <i>events</i> member.

       The significance and semantics of normal, priority, and high-
       priority data are file and device-specific.

       If the value of <i>fd</i> is less than 0, <i>events</i> shall be ignored, and
       <i>revents</i> shall be set to 0 in that entry on return from <i>poll</i>().

       In each <b>pollfd </b>structure, <i>poll</i>() shall clear the <i>revents</i> member,
       except that where the application requested a report on a
       condition by setting one of the bits of <i>events</i> listed above,
       <i>poll</i>() shall set the corresponding bit in <i>revents</i> if the
       requested condition is true. In addition, <i>poll</i>() shall set the
       POLLHUP, POLLERR, and POLLNVAL flag in <i>revents</i> if the condition
       is true, even if the application did not set the corresponding
       bit in <i>events</i>.

       If none of the defined events have occurred on any selected file
       descriptor, <i>poll</i>() shall wait at least <i>timeout</i> milliseconds for
       an event to occur on any of the selected file descriptors. If the
       value of <i>timeout</i> is 0, <i>poll</i>() shall return immediately. If the
       value of <i>timeout</i> is -1, <i>poll</i>() shall block until a requested
       event occurs or until the call is interrupted.

       Implementations may place limitations on the granularity of
       timeout intervals. If the requested timeout interval requires a
       finer granularity than the implementation supports, the actual
       timeout interval shall be rounded up to the next supported value.

       The <i>poll</i>() function shall not be affected by the O_NONBLOCK flag.

       The <i>poll</i>() function shall support regular files, terminal and
       pseudo-terminal devices, FIFOs, pipes, sockets and STREAMS-based
       files.  The behavior of <i>poll</i>() on elements of <i>fds</i> that refer to
       other types of file is unspecified.

       Regular files shall always poll TRUE for reading and writing.

       A file descriptor for a socket that is listening for connections
       shall indicate that it is ready for reading, once connections are
       available.  A file descriptor for a socket that is connecting
       asynchronously shall indicate that it is ready for writing, once
       a connection has been established.

       Provided the application does not perform any action that results
       in unspecified or undefined behavior, the value of the <i>fd</i> and
       <i>events</i> members of each element of <i>fds</i> shall not be modified by
       <i>poll</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>poll</i>() shall return a non-negative
       value. A positive value indicates the total number of <b>pollfd</b>
       structures that have selected events (that is, those for which
       the <i>revents</i> member is non-zero). A value of 0 indicates that the
       call timed out and no file descriptors have been selected. Upon
       failure, <i>poll</i>() shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>poll</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The allocation of internal data structures failed but a
              subsequent request may succeed.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during <i>poll</i>().

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>nfds</i> argument is greater than {OPEN_MAX}, or one of
              the <i>fd</i> members refers to a STREAM or multiplexer that is
              linked (directly or indirectly) downstream from a
              multiplexer.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Checking for Events on a Stream</b>
       The following example opens a pair of STREAMS devices and then
       waits for either one to become writable. This example proceeds as
       follows:

        1. Sets the <i>timeout</i> parameter to 500 milliseconds.

        2. Opens the STREAMS devices <b>/dev/dev0 </b>and <b>/dev/dev1</b>, and then
           polls them, specifying POLLOUT and POLLWRBAND as the events
           of interest.

           The STREAMS device names <b>/dev/dev0 </b>and <b>/dev/dev1 </b>are only
           examples of how STREAMS devices can be named; STREAMS naming
           conventions may vary among systems conforming to the
           POSIX.1‐2008.

        3. Uses the <i>ret</i> variable to determine whether an event has
           occurred on either of the two STREAMS. The <i>poll</i>() function is
           given 500 milliseconds to wait for an event to occur (if it
           has not occurred prior to the <i>poll</i>() call).

        4. Checks the returned value of <i>ret</i>.  If a positive value is
           returned, one of the following can be done:

            a. Priority data can be written to the open STREAM on
               priority bands greater than 0, because the POLLWRBAND
               event occurred on the open STREAM (<i>fds</i>[0] or <i>fds</i>[1]).

            b. Data can be written to the open STREAM on priority-band
               0, because the POLLOUT event occurred on the open STREAM
               (<i>fds</i>[0] or <i>fds</i>[1]).

        5. If the returned value is not a positive value, permission to
           write data to the open STREAM (on any priority band) is
           denied.

        6. If the POLLHUP event occurs on the open STREAM (<i>fds</i>[0] or
           <i>fds</i>[1]), the device on the open STREAM has disconnected.

           #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;
           #include &lt;poll.h&gt;
           ...
           struct pollfd fds[2];
           int timeout_msecs = 500;
           int ret;
               int i;

           /* Open STREAMS device. */
           fds[0].fd = open("/dev/dev0", ...);
           fds[1].fd = open("/dev/dev1", ...);
           fds[0].events = POLLOUT | POLLWRBAND;
           fds[1].events = POLLOUT | POLLWRBAND;

           ret = poll(fds, 2, timeout_msecs);

           if (ret &gt; 0) {
               /* An event on one of the fds has occurred. */
               for (i=0; i&lt;2; i++) {
                   if (fds[i].revents &amp; POLLWRBAND) {
                   /* Priority data may be written on device number i. */
           ...
                   }
                   if (fds[i].revents &amp; POLLOUT) {
                   /* Data may be written on device number i. */
           ...
                   }
                   if (fds[i].revents &amp; POLLHUP) {
                   /* A hangup has occurred on device number i. */
           ...
                   }
               }
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The POLLHUP event does not occur for FIFOs just because the FIFO
       is not open for writing. It only occurs when the FIFO is closed
       by the last writer and persists until some process opens the FIFO
       for writing or until all read-only file descriptors for the FIFO
       are closed.
