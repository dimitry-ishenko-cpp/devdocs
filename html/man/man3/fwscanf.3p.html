DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fwscanf</i>() function shall read from the named input <i>stream</i>.
       The <i>wscanf</i>() function shall read from the standard input stream
       <i>stdin</i>.  The <i>swscanf</i>() function shall read from the wide-character
       string <i>ws</i>.  Each function reads wide characters, interprets them
       according to a format, and stores the results in its arguments.
       Each expects, as arguments, a control wide-character string
       <i>format</i> described below, and a set of <i>pointer</i> arguments indicating
       where the converted input should be stored. The result is
       undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the format. If
       the <i>format</i> is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess
       arguments are evaluated but are otherwise ignored.

       Conversions can be applied to the <i>n</i>th argument after the <i>format</i>
       in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument. In
       this case, the conversion specifier wide character <b>% </b>(see below)
       is replaced by the sequence <b>"%n$"</b>, where <i>n</i> is a decimal integer
       in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}].  This feature provides for the
       definition of <i>format</i> wide-character strings that select arguments
       in an order appropriate to specific languages. In <i>format</i> wide-
       character strings containing the "%<i>n</i>$" form of conversion
       specifications, it is unspecified whether numbered arguments in
       the argument list can be referenced from the <i>format</i> wide-
       character string more than once.

       The <i>format</i> can contain either form of a conversion specification—
       that is, <b>% </b>or "%<i>n</i>$"— but the two forms cannot normally be mixed
       within a single <i>format</i> wide-character string. The only exception
       to this is that <b>%% </b>or <b>%* </b>can be mixed with the "%<i>n</i>$" form. When
       numbered argument specifications are used, specifying the <i>N</i>th
       argument requires that all the leading arguments, from the first
       to the (<i>N</i>-1)th, are pointers.

       The <i>fwscanf</i>() function in all its forms allows for detection of a
       language-dependent radix character in the input string, encoded
       as a wide-character value. The radix character is defined in the
       current locale (category <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>).  In the POSIX locale, or in
       a locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix
       character shall default to a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>).

       The <i>format</i> is a wide-character string composed of zero or more
       directives. Each directive is composed of one of the following:
       one or more white-space wide characters (&lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;,
       &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;vertical-tab&gt;, or &lt;form-feed&gt;); an ordinary wide
       character (neither <b>'%' </b>nor a white-space character); or a
       conversion specification.  It is unspecified whether an encoding
       error occurs if the format string contains <b>wchar_t </b>values that do
       not correspond to members of the character set of the current
       locale and the specified semantics do not require that value to
       be processed by <i>wcrtomb</i>().

       Each conversion specification is introduced by the <b>'%' </b>or by the
       character sequence "%<i>n</i>$", after which the following appear in
       sequence:

        *  An optional assignment-suppressing character <b>'*'</b>.

        *  An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies the
           maximum field width.

        *  An optional assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>.

        *  An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the
           receiving object.

        *  A conversion specifier wide character that specifies the type
           of conversion to be applied. The valid conversion specifiers
           are described below.

       The <i>fwscanf</i>() functions shall execute each directive of the
       format in turn. If a directive fails, as detailed below, the
       function shall return. Failures are described as input failures
       (due to the unavailability of input bytes) or matching failures
       (due to inappropriate input).

       A directive composed of one or more white-space wide characters
       is executed by reading input until no more valid input can be
       read, or up to the first wide character which is not a white-
       space wide character, which remains unread.

       A directive that is an ordinary wide character shall be executed
       as follows. The next wide character is read from the input and
       compared with the wide character that comprises the directive; if
       the comparison shows that they are not equivalent, the directive
       shall fail, and the differing and subsequent wide characters
       remain unread. Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a
       read error prevents a wide character from being read, the
       directive shall fail.

       A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of
       matching input sequences, as described below for each conversion
       wide character. A conversion specification is executed in the
       following steps.

       Input white-space wide characters (as specified by <a href="iswspace.3p.html">iswspace(3p)</a>)
       shall be skipped, unless the conversion specification includes a
       <b>[</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>n </b>conversion specifier.

       An item shall be read from the input, unless the conversion
       specification includes an <b>n </b>conversion specifier wide character.
       An input item is defined as the longest sequence of input wide
       characters, not exceeding any specified field width, which is an
       initial subsequence of a matching sequence.  The first wide
       character, if any, after the input item shall remain unread. If
       the length of the input item is zero, the execution of the
       conversion specification shall fail; this condition is a matching
       failure, unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error
       prevented input from the stream, in which case it is an input
       failure.

       Except in the case of a <b>% </b>conversion specifier, the input item
       (or, in the case of a <b>%n </b>conversion specification, the count of
       input wide characters) shall be converted to a type appropriate
       to the conversion wide character. If the input item is not a
       matching sequence, the execution of the conversion specification
       shall fail; this condition is a matching failure. Unless
       assignment suppression was indicated by a <b>'*'</b>, the result of the
       conversion shall be placed in the object pointed to by the first
       argument following the <i>format</i> argument that has not already
       received a conversion result if the conversion specification is
       introduced by <b>%</b>, or in the <i>n</i>th argument if introduced by the
       wide-character sequence "%<i>n</i>$".  If this object does not have an
       appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be
       represented in the space provided, the behavior is undefined.

       The <b>%c</b>, <b>%s</b>, and <b>%[ </b>conversion specifiers shall accept an optional
       assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>, which shall cause a memory
       buffer to be allocated to hold the wide-character string
       converted including a terminating null wide character. In such a
       case, the argument corresponding to the conversion specifier
       should be a reference to a pointer value that will receive a
       pointer to the allocated buffer. The system shall allocate a
       buffer as if <i>malloc</i>() had been called. The application shall be
       responsible for freeing the memory after usage. If there is
       insufficient memory to allocate a buffer, the function shall set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[ENOMEM] </b>and a conversion error shall result. If the
       function returns EOF, any memory successfully allocated for
       parameters using assignment-allocation character <b>'m' </b>by this call
       shall be freed before the function returns.

       The length modifiers and their meanings are:

       hh      Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b>
               conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
               pointer to <b>signed char </b>or <b>unsigned char</b>.

       h       Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b>
               conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
               pointer to <b>short </b>or <b>unsigned short</b>.

       l (ell) Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b>
               conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
               pointer to <b>long </b>or <b>unsigned long</b>; that a following <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>,
               <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, or <b>G </b>conversion specifier applies to an
               argument with type pointer to <b>double</b>; or that a following
               <b>c</b>, <b>s</b>, or <b>[ </b>conversion specifier applies to an argument
               with type pointer to <b>wchar_t</b>.  If the <b>'m' </b>assignment-
               allocation character is specified, the conversion applies
               to an argument with the type pointer to a pointer to
               <b>wchar_t</b>.

       ll (ell-ell)
               Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b>
               conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
               pointer to <b>long long </b>or <b>unsigned long long</b>.

       j       Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b>
               conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
               pointer to <b>intmax_t </b>or <b>uintmax_t</b>.

       z       Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b>
               conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
               pointer to <b>size_t </b>or the corresponding signed integer
               type.

       t       Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, or <b>n</b>
               conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
               pointer to <b>ptrdiff_t </b>or the corresponding <b>unsigned </b>type.

       L       Specifies that a following <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, or <b>G</b>
               conversion specifier applies to an argument with type
               pointer to <b>long double</b>.

       If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other
       than as specified above, the behavior is undefined.

       The following conversion specifier wide characters are valid:

       d       Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose
               format is the same as expected for the subject sequence
               of <i>wcstol</i>() with the value 10 for the <i>base</i> argument. In
               the absence of a size modifier, the application shall
               ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to
               <b>int</b>.

       i       Matches an optionally signed integer, whose format is the
               same as expected for the subject sequence of <i>wcstol</i>()
               with 0 for the <i>base</i> argument. In the absence of a size
               modifier, the application shall ensure that the
               corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>int</b>.

       o       Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose format
               is the same as expected for the subject sequence of
               <i>wcstoul</i>() with the value 8 for the <i>base</i> argument. In the
               absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure
               that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>unsigned</b>.

       u       Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose
               format is the same as expected for the subject sequence
               of <i>wcstoul</i>() with the value 10 for the <i>base</i> argument. In
               the absence of a size modifier, the application shall
               ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to
               <b>unsigned</b>.

       x       Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer, whose
               format is the same as expected for the subject sequence
               of <i>wcstoul</i>() with the value 16 for the <i>base</i> argument. In
               the absence of a size modifier, the application shall
               ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to
               <b>unsigned</b>.

       a, e, f, g
               Matches an optionally signed floating-point number,
               infinity, or NaN whose format is the same as expected for
               the subject sequence of <i>wcstod</i>().  In the absence of a
               size modifier, the application shall ensure that the
               corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>float</b>.

               If the <i>fwprintf</i>() family of functions generates character
               string representations for infinity and NaN (a symbolic
               entity encoded in floating-point format) to support
               IEEE Std 754‐1985, the <i>fwscanf</i>() family of functions
               shall recognize them as input.

       s       Matches a sequence of non-white-space wide characters. If
               no <b>l </b>(ell) qualifier is present, characters from the
               input field shall be converted as if by repeated calls to
               the <i>wcrtomb</i>() function, with the conversion state
               described by an <b>mbstate_t </b>object initialized to zero
               before the first wide character is converted. If the <b>'m'</b>
               assignment-allocation character is not specified, the
               application shall ensure that the corresponding argument
               is a pointer to a character array large enough to accept
               the sequence and the terminating null character, which
               shall be added automatically.  Otherwise, the application
               shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer
               to a pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

               If the <b>l </b>(ell) qualifier is present and the <b>'m'</b>
               assignment-allocation character is not specified, the
               application shall ensure that the corresponding argument
               is a pointer to an array of <b>wchar_t </b>large enough to
               accept the sequence and the terminating null wide
               character, which shall be added automatically.  If the <b>l</b>
               (ell) qualifier is present and the <b>'m' </b>assignment-
               allocation character is present, the application shall
               ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a
               pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

       [       Matches a non-empty sequence of wide characters from a
               set of expected wide characters (the <i>scanset</i>).  If no <b>l</b>
               (ell) qualifier is present, wide characters from the
               input field shall be converted as if by repeated calls to
               the <i>wcrtomb</i>() function, with the conversion state
               described by an <b>mbstate_t </b>object initialized to zero
               before the first wide character is converted. If the <b>'m'</b>
               assignment-allocation character is not specified, the
               application shall ensure that the corresponding argument
               is a pointer to a character array large enough to accept
               the sequence and the terminating null character, which
               shall be added automatically.  Otherwise, the application
               shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer
               to a pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

               If an <b>l </b>(ell) qualifier is present and the <b>'m'</b>
               assignment-allocation character is not specified, the
               application shall ensure that the corresponding argument
               is a pointer to an array of <b>wchar_t </b>large enough to
               accept the sequence and the terminating null wide
               character.  If an <b>l </b>(ell) qualifier is present and the
               <b>'m' </b>assignment-allocation character is specified, the
               application shall ensure that the corresponding argument
               is a pointer to a pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

               The conversion specification includes all subsequent wide
               characters in the <i>format</i> string up to and including the
               matching &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; (<b>']'</b>).  The wide
               characters between the square brackets (the <i>scanlist</i>)
               comprise the scanset, unless the wide character after the
               &lt;left-square-bracket&gt; is a &lt;circumflex&gt; (<b>'^'</b>), in which
               case the scanset contains all wide characters that do not
               appear in the scanlist between the &lt;circumflex&gt; and the
               &lt;right-square-bracket&gt;.  If the conversion specification
               begins with <b>"[]" </b>or <b>"[^]"</b>, the &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; is
               included in the scanlist and the next &lt;right-square-
               bracket&gt; is the matching &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; that ends
               the conversion specification; otherwise, the first
               &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; is the one that ends the
               conversion specification. If a <b>'-' </b>is in the scanlist and
               is not the first wide character, nor the second where the
               first wide character is a <b>'^'</b>, nor the last wide
               character, the behavior is implementation-defined.

       c       Matches a sequence of wide characters of exactly the
               number specified by the field width (1 if no field width
               is present in the conversion specification).

               If no <b>l </b>(ell) length modifier is present, characters from
               the input field shall be converted as if by repeated
               calls to the <i>wcrtomb</i>() function, with the conversion
               state described by an <b>mbstate_t </b>object initialized to
               zero before the first wide character is converted. No
               null character is added. If the <b>'m' </b>assignment-allocation
               character is not specified, the application shall ensure
               that the corresponding argument is a pointer to the
               initial element of a character array large enough to
               accept the sequence.  Otherwise, the application shall
               ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a
               pointer to a <b>char</b>.

               No null wide character is added. If an <b>l </b>(ell) length
               modifier is present and the <b>'m' </b>assignment-allocation
               character is not specified, the application shall ensure
               that the corresponding argument shall be a pointer to the
               initial element of an array of <b>wchar_t </b>large enough to
               accept the sequence.  If an <b>l </b>(ell) qualifier is present
               and the <b>'m' </b>assignment-allocation character is specified,
               the application shall ensure that the corresponding
               argument is a pointer to a pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>.

       p       Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which
               shall be the same as the set of sequences that is
               produced by the <b>%p </b>conversion specification of the
               corresponding <i>fwprintf</i>() functions. The application shall
               ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a
               pointer to <b>void</b>.  The interpretation of the input item is
               implementation-defined. If the input item is a value
               converted earlier during the same program execution, the
               pointer that results shall compare equal to that value;
               otherwise, the behavior of the <b>%p </b>conversion is
               undefined.

       n       No input is consumed. The application shall ensure that
               the corresponding argument is a pointer to the integer
               into which is to be written the number of wide characters
               read from the input so far by this call to the <i>fwscanf</i>()
               functions. Execution of a <b>%n </b>conversion specification
               shall not increment the assignment count returned at the
               completion of execution of the function. No argument
               shall be converted, but one shall be consumed. If the
               conversion specification includes an assignment-
               suppressing wide character or a field width, the behavior
               is undefined.

       C       Equivalent to <b>lc</b>.

       S       Equivalent to <b>ls</b>.

       %       Matches a single <b>'%' </b>wide character; no conversion or
               assignment shall occur. The complete conversion
               specification shall be <b>%%</b>.

       If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is
       undefined.

       The conversion specifiers <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, and <b>X </b>are also valid and
       shall be equivalent to, respectively, <b>a</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>x</b>.

       If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion is
       terminated.  If end-of-file occurs before any wide characters
       matching the current conversion specification (except for <b>%n</b>)
       have been read (other than leading white-space, where permitted),
       execution of the current conversion specification shall terminate
       with an input failure. Otherwise, unless execution of the current
       conversion specification is terminated with a matching failure,
       execution of the following conversion specification (if any)
       shall be terminated with an input failure.

       Reaching the end of the string in <i>swscanf</i>() shall be equivalent
       to encountering end-of-file for <i>fwscanf</i>().

       If conversion terminates on a conflicting input, the offending
       input shall be left unread in the input. Any trailing white space
       (including &lt;newline&gt;) shall be left unread unless matched by a
       conversion specification. The success of literal matches and
       suppressed assignments is only directly determinable via the <b>%n</b>
       conversion specification.

       The <i>fwscanf</i>() and <i>wscanf</i>() functions may mark the last data
       access timestamp of the file associated with <i>stream</i> for update.
       The last data access timestamp shall be marked for update by the
       first successful execution of <i>fgetwc</i>(), <i>fgetws</i>(), <i>fwscanf</i>(),
       <i>getwc</i>(), <i>getwchar</i>(), <i>vfwscanf</i>(), <i>vwscanf</i>(), or <i>wscanf</i>() using
       <i>stream</i> that returns data not supplied by a prior call to
       <i>ungetwc</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
       number of successfully matched and assigned input items; this
       number can be zero in the event of an early matching failure. If
       the input ends before the first conversion (if any) has
       completed, and without a matching failure having occurred, EOF
       shall be returned. If an error occurs before the first conversion
       (if any) has completed, and without a matching failure having
       occurred, EOF shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to
       indicate the error.  If a read error occurs, the error indicator
       for the stream shall be set.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       For the conditions under which the <i>fwscanf</i>() functions shall fail
       and may fail, refer to <a href="fgetwc.3p.html">fgetwc(3p)</a>.

       In addition, the <i>fwscanf</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ </b>Input byte sequence does not form a valid character.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

       In addition, the <i>fwscanf</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>There are insufficient arguments.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The call:

           int i, n; float x; char name[50];
           n = wscanf(L"%d%f%s", &amp;i, &amp;x, name);

       with the input line:

           25 54.32E-1 Hamster

       assigns to <i>n</i> the value 3, to <i>i</i> the value 25, to <i>x</i> the value
       5.432, and <i>name</i> contains the string <b>"Hamster"</b>.

       The call:

           int i; float x; char name[50];
           (void) wscanf(L"%2d%f%*d %[0123456789]", &amp;i, &amp;x, name);

       with input:

           56789 0123 56a72

       assigns 56 to <i>i</i>, 789.0 to <i>x</i>, skips 0123, and places the string
       <b>"56\0" </b>in <i>name</i>.  The next call to <i>getchar</i>() shall return the
       character <b>'a'</b>.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       In format strings containing the <b>'%' </b>form of conversion
       specifications, each argument in the argument list is used
       exactly once.

       For functions that allocate memory as if by <i>malloc</i>(), the
       application should release such memory when it is no longer
       required by a call to <i>free</i>().  For <i>fwscanf</i>(), this is memory
       allocated via use of the <b>'m' </b>assignment-allocation character.
