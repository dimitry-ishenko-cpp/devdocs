NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ftw — traverse (walk) a file tree
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;ftw.h&gt;

       int ftw(const char *<i>path</i>, int (*<i>fn</i>)(const char *,
           const struct stat *<i>ptr</i>, int <i>flag</i>), int <i>ndirs</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ftw</i>() function shall recursively descend the directory
       hierarchy rooted in <i>path</i>.  For each object in the hierarchy,
       <i>ftw</i>() shall call the function pointed to by <i>fn</i>, passing it a
       pointer to a null-terminated character string containing the name
       of the object, a pointer to a <b>stat </b>structure containing
       information about the object, filled in as if <i>stat</i>() or <i>lstat</i>()
       had been called to retrieve the information. Possible values of
       the integer, defined in the <i>&lt;ftw.h&gt;</i> header, are:

       FTW_D     For a directory.

       FTW_DNR   For a directory that cannot be read.

       FTW_F     For a non-directory file.

       FTW_SL    For a symbolic link (but see also FTW_NS below).

       FTW_NS    For an object other than a symbolic link on which
                 <i>stat</i>() could not successfully be executed. If the
                 object is a symbolic link and <i>stat</i>() failed, it is
                 unspecified whether <i>ftw</i>() passes FTW_SL or FTW_NS to
                 the user-supplied function.

       If the integer is FTW_DNR, descendants of that directory shall
       not be processed. If the integer is FTW_NS, the <b>stat </b>structure
       contains undefined values. An example of an object that would
       cause FTW_NS to be passed to the function pointed to by <i>fn</i> would
       be a file in a directory with read but without execute (search)
       permission.

       The <i>ftw</i>() function shall visit a directory before visiting any of
       its descendants.

       The <i>ftw</i>() function shall use at most one file descriptor for each
       level in the tree.

       The argument <i>ndirs</i> should be in the range [1,{OPEN_MAX}].

       The tree traversal shall continue until either the tree is
       exhausted, an invocation of <i>fn</i> returns a non-zero value, or some
       error, other than <b>[EACCES]</b>, is detected within <i>ftw</i>().

       The <i>ndirs</i> argument shall specify the maximum number of directory
       streams or file descriptors or both available for use by <i>ftw</i>()
       while traversing the tree. When <i>ftw</i>() returns it shall close any
       directory streams and file descriptors it uses not counting any
       opened by the application-supplied <i>fn</i> function.

       The results are unspecified if the application-supplied <i>fn</i>
       function does not preserve the current working directory.

       The <i>ftw</i>() function need not be thread-safe.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the tree is exhausted, <i>ftw</i>() shall return 0. If the function
       pointed to by <i>fn</i> returns a non-zero value, <i>ftw</i>() shall stop its
       tree traversal and return whatever value was returned by the
       function pointed to by <i>fn</i>.  If <i>ftw</i>() detects an error, it shall
       return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.

       If <i>ftw</i>() encounters an error other than <b>[EACCES] </b>(see FTW_DNR and
       FTW_NS above), it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error. The external variable <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> may contain any error value
       that is possible when a directory is opened or when one of the
       <i>stat</i> functions is executed on a directory or file.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ftw</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied for any component of <i>path</i> or
              read permission is denied for <i>path</i>.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of <i>path</i> names an existing file that is neither
              a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              A field in the <b>stat </b>structure cannot be represented
              correctly in the current programming environment for one
              or more files found in the file hierarchy.

       The <i>ftw</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>ndirs</i> argument is invalid.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       In addition, if the function pointed to by <i>fn</i> encounters system
       errors, <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> may be set accordingly.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Walking a Directory Structure</b>
       The following example walks the current directory structure,
       calling the <i>fn</i> function for every directory entry, using at most
       10 file descriptors:

           #include &lt;ftw.h&gt;
           ...
           if (ftw(".", fn, 10) != 0) {
               perror("ftw"); exit(2);
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ftw</i>() function may allocate dynamic storage during its
       operation. If <i>ftw</i>() is forcibly terminated, such as by <i>longjmp</i>()
       or <i>siglongjmp</i>() being executed by the function pointed to by <i>fn</i>
       or an interrupt routine, <i>ftw</i>() does not have a chance to free
       that storage, so it remains permanently allocated. A safe way to
       handle interrupts is to store the fact that an interrupt has
       occurred, and arrange to have the function pointed to by <i>fn</i>
       return a non-zero value at its next invocation.

       Applications should use the <i>nftw</i>() function instead of the
       obsolescent <i>ftw</i>() function.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ftw</i>() function may be removed in a future version.
