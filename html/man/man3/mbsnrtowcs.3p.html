NAME </h2>

       mbsnrtowcs, mbsrtowcs — convert a character string to a wide-
       character string (restartable)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       size_t mbsnrtowcs(wchar_t *restrict <i>dst</i>, const char **restrict <i>src</i>,
           size_t <i>nmc</i>, size_t <i>len</i>, mbstate_t *restrict <i>ps</i>);
       size_t mbsrtowcs(wchar_t *restrict <i>dst</i>, const char **restrict <i>src</i>,
           size_t <i>len</i>, mbstate_t *restrict <i>ps</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For <i>mbsrtowcs</i>(): The functionality described on this reference
       page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is
       unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C
       standard.

       The <i>mbsrtowcs</i>() function shall convert a sequence of characters,
       beginning in the conversion state described by the object pointed
       to by <i>ps</i>, from the array indirectly pointed to by <i>src</i> into a
       sequence of corresponding wide characters. If <i>dst</i> is not a null
       pointer, the converted characters shall be stored into the array
       pointed to by <i>dst</i>.  Conversion continues up to and including a
       terminating null character, which shall also be stored.
       Conversion shall stop early in either of the following cases:

        *  A sequence of bytes is encountered that does not form a valid
           character.

        *  <i>len</i> codes have been stored into the array pointed to by <i>dst</i>
           (and <i>dst</i> is not a null pointer).

       Each conversion shall take place as if by a call to the <i>mbrtowc</i>()
       function.

       If <i>dst</i> is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by
       <i>src</i> shall be assigned either a null pointer (if conversion
       stopped due to reaching a terminating null character) or the
       address just past the last character converted (if any). If
       conversion stopped due to reaching a terminating null character,
       and if <i>dst</i> is not a null pointer, the resulting state described
       shall be the initial conversion state.

       If <i>ps</i> is a null pointer, the <i>mbsrtowcs</i>() function shall use its
       own internal <b>mbstate_t </b>object, which is initialized at program
       start-up to the initial conversion state. Otherwise, the
       <b>mbstate_t </b>object pointed to by <i>ps</i> shall be used to completely
       describe the current conversion state of the associated character
       sequence.

       The <i>mbsnrtowcs</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>mbsrtowcs</i>()
       function, except that the conversion of characters indirectly
       pointed to by <i>src</i> is limited to at most <i>nmc</i> bytes (the size of
       the input buffer), and under conditions where <i>mbsrtowcs</i>() would
       assign the address just past the last character converted (if
       any) to the pointer object pointed to by <i>src</i>, <i>mbsnrtowcs</i>() shall
       instead assign the address just past the last byte processed (if
       any) to that pointer object. If the input buffer ends with an
       incomplete character, it is unspecified whether conversion stops
       at the end of the previous character (if any), or at the end of
       the input buffer. In the latter case, a subsequent call to
       <i>mbsnrtowcs</i>() with an input buffer that starts with the remainder
       of the incomplete character shall correctly complete the
       conversion of that character.

       The behavior of these functions shall be affected by the <i>LC_CTYPE</i>
       category of the current locale.

       The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 calls these functions.

       The <i>mbsnrtowcs</i>() and <i>mbsrtowcs</i>() functions need not be thread-
       safe if called with a NULL <i>ps</i> argument.

       The <i>mbsrtowcs</i>() function shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the input conversion encounters a sequence of bytes that do
       not form a valid character, an encoding error occurs. In this
       case, these functions shall store the value of the macro <b>[EILSEQ]</b>
       in <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> and shall return (<b>size_t</b>)-1; the conversion state is
       undefined.  Otherwise, these functions shall return the number of
       characters successfully converted, not including the terminating
       null (if any).
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ </b>An invalid character sequence is detected.  In the POSIX
              locale an <b>[EILSEQ] </b>error cannot occur since all byte
              values are valid characters.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b><i>ps</i> points to an object that contains an invalid conversion
              state.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version may require that when the input buffer ends with
       an incomplete character, conversion stops at the end of the input
       buffer.
