PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       time — get time
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       time_t time(time_t *<i>tloc</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>time</i>() function shall return the value of time in seconds
       since the Epoch.

       The <i>tloc</i> argument points to an area where the return value is
       also stored. If <i>tloc</i> is a null pointer, no value is stored.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>time</i>() shall return the value of
       time. Otherwise, (<b>time_t</b>)-1 shall be returned.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>time</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The number of seconds since the Epoch will not fit in an
              object of type <b>time_t</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Getting the Current Time</b>
       The following example uses the <i>time</i>() function to calculate the
       time elapsed, in seconds, since the Epoch, <i>localtime</i>() to convert
       that value to a broken-down time, and <i>asctime</i>() to convert the
       broken-down time values into a printable string.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;time.h&gt;

           int main(void)
           {
           time_t result;

               result = time(NULL);
               printf("%s%ju secs since the Epoch\n",
                   asctime(localtime(&amp;result)),
                       (uintmax_t)result);
               return(0);
           }

       This example writes the current time to <i>stdout</i> in a form like
       this:

           Wed Jun 26 10:32:15 1996
           835810335 secs since the Epoch

   <b>Timing an Event</b>
       The following example gets the current time, prints it out in the
       user's format, and prints the number of minutes to an event being
       timed.

           #include &lt;time.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           ...
           time_t now;
           int minutes_to_event;
           ...
           time(&amp;now);
           minutes_to_event = ...;
           printf("The time is ");
           puts(asctime(localtime(&amp;now)));
           printf("There are %d minutes to the event.\n",
               minutes_to_event);
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>time</i>() function returns a value in seconds while
       <i>clock_gettime</i>() and <i>gettimeofday</i>() return a <b>struct timespec</b>
       (seconds and nanoseconds) and <b>struct timeval </b>(seconds and
       microseconds), respectively, and are therefore capable of
       returning more precise times. The <i>times</i>() function is also
       capable of more precision than <i>time</i>() as it returns a value in
       clock ticks, although it returns the elapsed time since an
       arbitrary point such as system boot time, not since the epoch.

       Implementations in which <b>time_t </b>is a 32-bit signed integer (many
       historical implementations) fail in the year 2038. POSIX.1‐2008
       does not address this problem. However, the use of the <b>time_t</b>
       type is mandated in order to ease the eventual fix.

       On some systems the <i>time</i>() function is implemented using a system
       call that does not return an error condition in addition to the
       return value. On these systems it is impossible to differentiate
       between valid and invalid return values and hence overflow
       conditions cannot be reliably detected.

       The use of the <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i> header instead of <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i> allows
       compatibility with the ISO C standard.

       Many historical implementations (including Version 7) and the
       1984 /usr/group standard use <b>long </b>instead of <b>time_t</b>.  This volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 uses the latter type in order to agree with the
       ISO C standard.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       In a future version of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <b>time_t </b>is
       likely to be required to be capable of representing times far in
       the future. Whether this will be mandated as a 64-bit type or a
       requirement that a specific date in the future be representable
       (for example, 10000 AD) is not yet determined. Systems purchased
       after the approval of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 should be
       evaluated to determine whether their lifetime will extend past
       2038.
