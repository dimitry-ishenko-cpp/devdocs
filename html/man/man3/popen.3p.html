NAME </h2>
<pre>
       popen — initiate pipe streams to or from a process
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       FILE *popen(const char *<i>command</i>, const char *<i>mode</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>popen</i>() function shall execute the command specified by the
       string <i>command</i>.  It shall create a pipe between the calling
       program and the executed command, and shall return a pointer to a
       stream that can be used to either read from or write to the pipe.

       The environment of the executed command shall be as if a child
       process were created within the <i>popen</i>() call using the <i>fork</i>()
       function, and the child invoked the <i>sh</i> utility using the call:

           execl(<i>shell path</i>, "sh", "-c", <i>command</i>, (char *)0);

       where <i>shell path</i> is an unspecified pathname for the <i>sh</i> utility.

       The <i>popen</i>() function shall ensure that any streams from previous
       <i>popen</i>() calls that remain open in the parent process are closed
       in the new child process.

       The <i>mode</i> argument to <i>popen</i>() is a string that specifies I/O mode:

        1. If <i>mode</i> is <i>r</i>, when the child process is started, its file
           descriptor STDOUT_FILENO shall be the writable end of the
           pipe, and the file descriptor <i>fileno</i>(<i>stream</i>) in the calling
           process, where <i>stream</i> is the stream pointer returned by
           <i>popen</i>(), shall be the readable end of the pipe.

        2. If <i>mode</i> is <i>w</i>, when the child process is started its file
           descriptor STDIN_FILENO shall be the readable end of the
           pipe, and the file descriptor <i>fileno</i>(<i>stream</i>) in the calling
           process, where <i>stream</i> is the stream pointer returned by
           <i>popen</i>(), shall be the writable end of the pipe.

        3. If <i>mode</i> is any other value, the result is unspecified.

       After <i>popen</i>(), both the parent and the child process shall be
       capable of executing independently before either terminates.

       Pipe streams are byte-oriented.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>popen</i>() shall return a pointer to an
       open stream that can be used to read or write to the pipe.
       Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and may set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>popen</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EMFILE </b>{STREAM_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

       The <i>popen</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EMFILE </b>{FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>mode</i> argument is invalid.

       The <i>popen</i>() function may also set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> values as described by
       <a href="fork.3p.html">fork(3p)</a> or <a href="pipe.3p.html">pipe(3p)</a>.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Using popen() to Obtain a List of Files from the ls Utility</b>
       The following example demonstrates the use of <i>popen</i>() and
       <i>pclose</i>() to execute the command <i>ls</i>* in order to obtain a list of
       files in the current directory:

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           ...

           FILE *fp;
           int status;
           char path[PATH_MAX];

           fp = popen("ls *", "r");
           if (fp == NULL)
               /* Handle error */;

           while (fgets(path, PATH_MAX, fp) != NULL)
               printf("%s", path);

           status = pclose(fp);
           if (status == -1) {
               /* Error reported by pclose() */
               ...
           } else {
               /* Use macros described under wait() to inspect `status' in order
                  to determine success/failure of command executed by popen() */
               ...
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since open files are shared, a mode <i>r</i> command can be used as an
       input filter and a mode <i>w</i> command as an output filter.

       Buffered reading before opening an input filter may leave the
       standard input of that filter mispositioned. Similar problems
       with an output filter may be prevented by careful buffer
       flushing; for example, with <a href="fflush.3p.html">fflush(3p)</a>.

       A stream opened by <i>popen</i>() should be closed by <i>pclose</i>().

       The behavior of <i>popen</i>() is specified for values of <i>mode</i> of <i>r</i> and
       <i>w</i>.  Other modes such as <i>rb</i> and <i>wb</i> might be supported by specific
       implementations, but these would not be portable features. Note
       that historical implementations of <i>popen</i>() only check to see if
       the first character of <i>mode</i> is <i>r</i>.  Thus, a <i>mode</i> of <i>robert the</i>
       <i>robot</i> would be treated as <i>mode r</i>, and a <i>mode</i> of <i>anything else</i>
       would be treated as <i>mode w</i>.

       If the application calls <i>waitpid</i>() or <i>waitid</i>() with a <i>pid</i>
       argument greater than 0, and it still has a stream that was
       called with <i>popen</i>() open, it must ensure that <i>pid</i> does not refer
       to the process started by <i>popen</i>().

       To determine whether or not the environment specified in the
       Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017 is present, use the
       function call:

           sysconf(_SC_2_VERSION)

       (See <a href="sysconf.3p.html">sysconf(3p)</a>).
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>popen</i>() function should not be used by programs that have set
       user (or group) ID privileges. The <i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i> family of
       functions (except <i>execlp</i>() and <i>execvp</i>()), should be used instead.
       This prevents any unforeseen manipulation of the environment of
       the user that could cause execution of commands not anticipated
       by the calling program.

       If the original and <i>popen</i>()ed processes both intend to read or
       write or read and write a common file, and either will be using
       FILE-type C functions (<i>fread</i>(), <i>fwrite</i>(), and so on), the rules
       for sharing file handles must be observed (see <i>Section 2.5.1</i>,
       <i>Interaction of File Descriptors and Standard I/O Streams</i>).
