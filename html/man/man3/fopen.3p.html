NAME </h2>

       fopen — open a stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       FILE *fopen(const char *restrict <i>pathname</i>, const char *restrict <i>mode</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fopen</i>() function shall open the file whose pathname is the
       string pointed to by <i>pathname</i>, and associates a stream with it.

       The <i>mode</i> argument points to a string. If the string is one of the
       following, the file shall be opened in the indicated mode.
       Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

       <i>r</i> or <i>rb</i>       Open file for reading.

       <i>w</i> or <i>wb</i>       Truncate to zero length or create file for writing.

       <i>a</i> or <i>ab</i>       Append; open or create file for writing at end-of-
                     file.

       <i>r+</i> or <i>rb+</i> or <i>r+b</i>
                     Open file for update (reading and writing).

       <i>w+</i> or <i>wb+</i> or <i>w+b</i>
                     Truncate to zero length or create file for update.

       <i>a+</i> or <i>ab+</i> or <i>a+b</i>
                     Append; open or create file for update, writing at
                     end-of-file.

       The character <b>'b' </b>shall have no effect, but is allowed for ISO C
       standard conformance.  Opening a file with read mode (<i>r</i> as the
       first character in the <i>mode</i> argument) shall fail if the file does
       not exist or cannot be read.

       Opening a file with append mode (<i>a</i> as the first character in the
       <i>mode</i> argument) shall cause all subsequent writes to the file to
       be forced to the then current end-of-file, regardless of
       intervening calls to <i>fseek</i>().

       When a file is opened with update mode (<b>'+' </b>as the second or
       third character in the <i>mode</i> argument), both input and output may
       be performed on the associated stream. However, the application
       shall ensure that output is not directly followed by input
       without an intervening call to <i>fflush</i>() or to a file positioning
       function (<i>fseek</i>(), <i>fsetpos</i>(), or <i>rewind</i>()), and input is not
       directly followed by output without an intervening call to a file
       positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-
       of-file.

       When opened, a stream is fully buffered if and only if it can be
       determined not to refer to an interactive device. The error and
       end-of-file indicators for the stream shall be cleared.

       If <i>mode</i> is <i>w</i>, <i>wb</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>w</i>+, <i>wb</i>+, <i>w</i>+<i>b</i>, <i>a</i>+, <i>ab</i>+, or <i>a</i>+<i>b</i>, and the
       file did not previously exist, upon successful completion,
       <i>fopen</i>() shall mark for update the last data access, last data
       modification, and last file status change timestamps of the file
       and the last file status change and last data modification
       timestamps of the parent directory.

       If <i>mode</i> is <i>w</i>, <i>wb</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>w</i>+, <i>wb</i>+, <i>w</i>+<i>b</i>, <i>a</i>+, <i>ab</i>+, or <i>a</i>+<i>b</i>, and the
       file did not previously exist, the <i>fopen</i>() function shall create
       a file as if it called the <i>creat</i>() function with a value
       appropriate for the <i>path</i> argument interpreted from <i>pathname</i> and a
       value of S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH |
       S_IWOTH for the <i>mode</i> argument.

       If <i>mode</i> is <i>w</i>, <i>wb</i>, <i>w</i>+, <i>wb</i>+, or <i>w</i>+<i>b</i>, and the file did previously
       exist, upon successful completion, <i>fopen</i>() shall mark for update
       the last data modification and last file status change timestamps
       of the file.

       After a successful call to the <i>fopen</i>() function, the orientation
       of the stream shall be cleared, the encoding rule shall be
       cleared, and the associated <b>mbstate_t </b>object shall be set to
       describe an initial conversion state.

       The file descriptor associated with the opened stream shall be
       allocated and opened as if by a call to <i>open</i>() with the following
       flags:
               ┌──────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
               │   <i>fopen</i><b>() Mode   </b>│       <i>open</i><b>() Flags        </b>│
               ├──────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
               │ <i>r</i> or <i>rb</i>          │ O_RDONLY                  │
               │ <i>w</i> or <i>wb</i>          │ O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC  │
               │ <i>a</i> or <i>ab</i>          │ O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND │
               │ <i>r+</i> or <i>rb+</i> or <i>r+b</i> │ O_RDWR                    │
               │ <i>w+</i> or <i>wb+</i> or <i>w+b</i> │ O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC    │
               │ <i>a+</i> or <i>ab+</i> or <i>a+b</i> │ O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_APPEND   │
               └──────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>fopen</i>() shall return a pointer to the
       object controlling the stream. Otherwise, a null pointer shall be
       returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fopen</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix, or the file exists and the permissions specified
              by <i>mode</i> are denied, or the file does not exist and write
              permission is denied for the parent directory of the file
              to be created.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during <i>fopen</i>().

       <b>EISDIR </b>The named file is a directory and <i>mode</i> requires write
              access.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>EMFILE </b>{STREAM_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in
              the system.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The <i>mode</i> string begins with <b>'r' </b>and a component of
              <i>pathname</i> does not name an existing file, or <i>mode</i> begins
              with <b>'w' </b>or <b>'a' </b>and a component of the path prefix of
              <i>pathname</i> does not name an existing file, or <i>pathname</i> is an
              empty string.

       <b>ENOENT </b>or <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>pathname</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters. If <i>pathname</i> without the trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters would name an existing file, an <b>[ENOENT] </b>error
              shall not occur.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The directory or file system that would contain the new
              file cannot be expanded, the file does not exist, and the
              file was to be created.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>pathname</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       <b>ENXIO  </b>The named file is a character special or block special
              file, and the device associated with this special file
              does not exist.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The named file is a regular file and the size of the file
              cannot be represented correctly in an object of type
              <b>off_t</b>.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The named file resides on a read-only file system and <i>mode</i>
              requires write access.

       The <i>fopen</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>mode</i> argument is not valid.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>EMFILE </b>{FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is
              being executed and <i>mode</i> requires write access.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Opening a File</b>
       The following example tries to open the file named <b>file </b>for
       reading. The <i>fopen</i>() function returns a file pointer that is used
       in subsequent <i>fgets</i>() and <i>fclose</i>() calls. If the program cannot
       open the file, it just ignores it.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           ...
           FILE *fp;
           ...
           void rgrep(const char *file)
           {
           ...
               if ((fp = fopen(file, "r")) == NULL)
                   return;
           ...
