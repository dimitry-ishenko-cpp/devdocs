       #include &lt;trace.h&gt;

       int posix_trace_eventid_equal(trace_id_t <i>trid</i>, trace_event_id_t <i>event1</i>,
           trace_event_id_t <i>event2</i>);

       int posix_trace_trid_eventid_open(trace_id_t <i>trid</i>,
           const char *restrict <i>event_name</i>,
           trace_event_id_t *restrict <i>event</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_eventid_equal</i>() function shall compare the trace
       event type identifiers <i>event1</i> and <i>event2</i> from the same trace
       stream or the same trace log identified by the <i>trid</i> argument. If
       the trace event type identifiers <i>event1</i> and <i>event2</i> are from
       different trace streams, the return value shall be unspecified.

       The <i>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</i>() function shall return, in the
       argument pointed to by <i>event_name</i>, the trace event name
       associated with the trace event type identifier identified by the
       argument <i>event</i>, for the trace stream or for the trace log
       identified by the <i>trid</i> argument. The name of the trace event
       shall have a maximum of {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which
       has the minimum value {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).  Successive
       calls to this function with the same trace event type identifier
       and the same trace stream identifier shall return the same event
       name.

       The <i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>() function shall associate a
       user trace event name with a trace event type identifier for a
       given trace stream. The trace stream is identified by the <i>trid</i>
       argument, and it shall be an active trace stream. The trace event
       name is the string pointed to by the argument <i>event_name</i>.  It
       shall have a maximum of {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which
       has the minimum value {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).  The number
       of user trace event type identifiers that can be defined for any
       given process is limited by the maximum value
       {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}, which has the minimum value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}.

       If the Trace Inherit option is not supported, the
       <i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>() function shall associate the user
       trace event name pointed to by the <i>event_name</i> argument with a
       trace event type identifier that is unique for the process being
       traced in the trace stream identified by the <i>trid</i> argument, and
       is returned in the variable pointed to by the <i>event</i> argument. If
       the user trace event name has already been mapped for the traced
       process, then the previously assigned trace event type identifier
       shall be returned. If the per-process user trace event name limit
       represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the pre-
       defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see <i>Table 2-7</i>, <i>Trace</i>
       <i>Option: User Trace Event</i>) user trace event shall be returned.

       If the Trace Inherit option is supported, the
       <i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>() function shall associate the user
       trace event name pointed to by the <i>event_name</i> argument with a
       trace event type identifier that is unique for all the processes
       being traced in the trace stream identified by the <i>trid</i> argument,
       and is returned in the variable pointed to by the <i>event</i> argument.
       If the user trace event name has already been mapped for the
       traced processes, then the previously assigned trace event type
       identifier shall be returned. If the per-process user trace event
       name limit represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been
       reached, the pre-defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see <i>Table</i>
       <i>2-7</i>, <i>Trace Option: User Trace Event</i>) user trace event shall be
       returned.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</i>()
       and <i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>() functions shall return a
       value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding
       error number.

       The <i>posix_trace_eventid_equal</i>() function shall return a non-zero
       value if <i>event1</i> and <i>event2</i> are equal; otherwise, a value of zero
       shall be returned. No errors are defined. If either <i>event1</i> or
       <i>event2</i> are not valid trace event type identifiers for the trace
       stream specified by <i>trid</i> or if the <i>trid</i> is invalid, the behavior
       shall be unspecified.

       The <i>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</i>() function stores the trace
       event name value in the object pointed to by <i>event_name</i>, if
       successful.

       The <i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>() function stores the trace
       event type identifier value in the object pointed to by <i>event</i>, if
       successful.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</i>() and
       <i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>trid</i> argument was not a valid trace stream identifier.

       The <i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The size of the name pointed to by the <i>event_name</i> argument
              was longer than the implementation-defined value
              {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}.

       The <i>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The trace event type identifier <i>event</i> was not associated
              with any name.
