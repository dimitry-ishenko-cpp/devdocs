NAME </h2>
<pre>
       alphasort, scandir — scan a directory
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;

       int alphasort(const struct dirent **<i>d1</i>, const struct dirent **<i>d2</i>);
       int scandir(const char *<i>dir</i>, struct dirent ***<i>namelist</i>,
           int (*<i>sel</i>)(const struct dirent *),
           int (*<i>compar</i>)(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **));
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>alphasort</i>() function can be used as the comparison function
       for the <i>scandir</i>() function to sort the directory entries, <i>d1</i> and
       <i>d2</i>, into alphabetical order. Sorting happens as if by calling the
       <i>strcoll</i>() function on the <i>d_name</i> element of the <b>dirent </b>structures
       passed as the two parameters. If the <i>strcoll</i>() function fails,
       the return value of <i>alphasort</i>() is unspecified.

       The <i>alphasort</i>() function shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful. Since no return value is reserved to indicate an
       error, an application wishing to check for error situations
       should set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to 0, then call <i>alphasort</i>(), then check <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.

       The <i>scandir</i>() function shall scan the directory <i>dir</i>, calling the
       function referenced by <i>sel</i> on each directory entry. Entries for
       which the function referenced by <i>sel</i> returns non-zero shall be
       stored in strings allocated as if by a call to <i>malloc</i>(), and
       sorted as if by a call to <i>qsort</i>() with the comparison function
       <i>compar</i>, except that <i>compar</i> need not provide total ordering. The
       strings are collected in array <i>namelist</i> which shall be allocated
       as if by a call to <i>malloc</i>().  If <i>sel</i> is a null pointer, all
       entries shall be selected.  If the comparison function <i>compar</i>
       does not provide total ordering, the order in which the directory
       entries are stored is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>alphasort</i>() function shall return
       an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according to
       whether the name of the directory entry pointed to by <i>d1</i> is
       lexically greater than, equal to, or less than the directory
       pointed to by <i>d2</i> when both are interpreted as appropriate to the
       current locale. There is no return value reserved to indicate an
       error.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>scandir</i>() function shall return
       the number of entries in the array and a pointer to the array
       through the parameter <i>namelist</i>.  Otherwise, the <i>scandir</i>()
       function shall return -1.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>scandir</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied for the component of the path
              prefix of <i>dir</i> or read permission is denied for <i>dir</i>.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>dir</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>dir</i> does not name an existing directory or
              <i>dir</i> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of <i>dir</i> names an existing file that is neither
              a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              One of the values to be returned or passed to a callback
              function cannot be represented correctly.

       The <i>scandir</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>dir</i> argument.

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENFILE </b>Too many files are currently open in the system.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       An example to print the files in the current directory:

           #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           ...
           struct dirent **namelist;
           int i,n;

               n = scandir(".", &amp;namelist, 0, alphasort);
               if (n &lt; 0)
                   perror("scandir");
               else {
                   for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
                       printf("%s\n", namelist[i]-&gt;d_name);
                       free(namelist[i]);
                       }
                   }
               free(namelist);
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>dir</i> contains filenames that do not form character strings, or
       which contain characters outside the domain of the collating
       sequence of the current locale, the <i>alphasort</i>() function need not
       provide a total ordering. This condition is not possible if all
       filenames within the directory consist only of characters from
       the portable filename character set.

       The <i>scandir</i>() function may allocate dynamic storage during its
       operation. If <i>scandir</i>() is forcibly terminated, such as by
       <i>longjmp</i>() or <i>siglongjmp</i>() being executed by the function pointed
       to by <i>sel</i> or <i>compar</i>, or by an interrupt routine, <i>scandir</i>() does
       not have a chance to free that storage, so it remains permanently
       allocated. A safe way to handle interrupts is to store the fact
       that an interrupt has occurred, then wait until <i>scandir</i>() returns
       to act on the interrupt.

       For functions that allocate memory as if by <i>malloc</i>(), the
       application should release such memory when it is no longer
       required by a call to <i>free</i>().  For <i>scandir</i>(), this is <i>namelist</i>
       (including all of the individual strings in <i>namelist</i>).
