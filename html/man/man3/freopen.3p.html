NAME </h2>
<pre>
       freopen — open a stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       FILE *freopen(const char *restrict <i>pathname</i>, const char *restrict <i>mode</i>,
           FILE *restrict <i>stream</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>freopen</i>() function shall first attempt to flush the stream
       associated with <i>stream</i> as if by a call to <i>fflush</i>(<i>stream</i>).
       Failure to flush the stream successfully shall be ignored. If
       <i>pathname</i> is not a null pointer, <i>freopen</i>() shall close any file
       descriptor associated with <i>stream</i>.  Failure to close the file
       descriptor successfully shall be ignored.  The error and end-of-
       file indicators for the stream shall be cleared.

       The <i>freopen</i>() function shall open the file whose pathname is the
       string pointed to by <i>pathname</i> and associate the stream pointed to
       by <i>stream</i> with it. The <i>mode</i> argument shall be used just as in
       <i>fopen</i>().

       The original stream shall be closed regardless of whether the
       subsequent open succeeds.

       If <i>pathname</i> is a null pointer, the <i>freopen</i>() function shall
       attempt to change the mode of the stream to that specified by
       <i>mode</i>, as if the name of the file currently associated with the
       stream had been used. In this case, the file descriptor
       associated with the stream need not be closed if the call to
       <i>freopen</i>() succeeds. It is implementation-defined which changes of
       mode are permitted (if any), and under what circumstances.

       After a successful call to the <i>freopen</i>() function, the
       orientation of the stream shall be cleared, the encoding rule
       shall be cleared, and the associated <b>mbstate_t </b>object shall be
       set to describe an initial conversion state.

       If <i>pathname</i> is not a null pointer, or if <i>pathname</i> is a null
       pointer and the specified mode change necessitates the file
       descriptor associated with the stream to be closed and reopened,
       the file descriptor associated with the reopened stream shall be
       allocated and opened as if by a call to <i>open</i>() with the following
       flags:
               ┌──────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
               │  <i>freopen</i><b>() Mode  </b>│       <i>open</i><b>() Flags        </b>│
               ├──────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
               │ <i>r</i> or <i>rb</i>          │ O_RDONLY                  │
               │ <i>w</i> or <i>wb</i>          │ O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC  │
               │ <i>a</i> or <i>ab</i>          │ O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND │
               │ <i>r+</i> or <i>rb+</i> or <i>r+b</i> │ O_RDWR                    │
               │ <i>w+</i> or <i>wb+</i> or <i>w+b</i> │ O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC    │
               │ <i>a+</i> or <i>ab+</i> or <i>a+b</i> │ O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_APPEND   │
               └──────────────────┴───────────────────────────┘
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>freopen</i>() shall return the value of
       <i>stream</i>.  Otherwise, a null pointer shall be returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       shall be set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>freopen</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix, or the file exists and the permissions specified
              by <i>mode</i> are denied, or the file does not exist and write
              permission is denied for the parent directory of the file
              to be created.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The file descriptor underlying the stream is not a valid
              file descriptor when <i>pathname</i> is a null pointer.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during <i>freopen</i>().

       <b>EISDIR </b>The named file is a directory and <i>mode</i> requires write
              access.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in
              the system.

       <b>ENOENT </b>The <i>mode</i> string begins with <b>'r' </b>and a component of
              <i>pathname</i> does not name an existing file, or <i>mode</i> begins
              with <b>'w' </b>or <b>'a' </b>and a component of the path prefix of
              <i>pathname</i> does not name an existing file, or <i>pathname</i> is an
              empty string.

       <b>ENOENT </b>or <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>pathname</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters. If <i>pathname</i> without the trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters would name an existing file, an <b>[ENOENT] </b>error
              shall not occur.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The directory or file system that would contain the new
              file cannot be expanded, the file does not exist, and it
              was to be created.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>pathname</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       <b>ENXIO  </b>The named file is a character special or block special
              file, and the device associated with this special file
              does not exist.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The named file is a regular file and the size of the file
              cannot be represented correctly in an object of type
              <b>off_t</b>.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The named file resides on a read-only file system and <i>mode</i>
              requires write access.

       The <i>freopen</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The mode with which the file descriptor underlying the
              stream was opened does not support the requested mode when
              <i>pathname</i> is a null pointer.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>mode</i> argument is not valid.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

       <b>ENXIO  </b>A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request
              was outside the capabilities of the device.

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is
              being executed and <i>mode</i> requires write access.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Directing Standard Output to a File</b>
       The following example logs all standard output to the
       <b>/tmp/logfile </b>file.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           ...
           FILE *fp;
           ...
           fp = freopen ("/tmp/logfile", "a+", stdout);
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>freopen</i>() function is typically used to attach the pre-opened
       <i>streams</i> associated with <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>, and <i>stderr</i> to other files.

       Since implementations are not required to support any stream mode
       changes when the <i>pathname</i> argument is NULL, portable applications
       cannot rely on the use of <i>freopen</i>() to change the stream mode,
       and use of this feature is discouraged. The feature was
       originally added to the ISO C standard in order to facilitate
       changing <i>stdin</i> and <i>stdout</i> to binary mode. Since a <b>'b' </b>character
       in the mode has no effect on POSIX systems, this use of the
       feature is unnecessary in POSIX applications. However, even
       though the <b>'b' </b>is ignored, a successful call to <i>freopen</i>(NULL,
       "<i>wb</i>", <i>stdout</i>) does have an effect. In particular, for regular
       files it truncates the file and sets the file-position indicator
       for the stream to the start of the file. It is possible that
       these side-effects are an unintended consequence of the way the
       feature is specified in the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, but
       unless or until the ISO C standard is changed, applications which
       successfully call <i>freopen</i>(NULL, "<i>wb</i>", <i>stdout</i>) will behave in
       unexpected ways on conforming systems in situations such as:

           { appl file1; appl file2; } &gt; file3

       which will result in <b>file3 </b>containing only the output from the
       second invocation of <i>appl</i>.
