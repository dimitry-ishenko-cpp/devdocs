DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A  Performance  Metrics  Domain  Agent  (PMDA) that exports event
       records must effectively act an event multiplexer.   Events  con‐
       sumed  by  the  PMDA may have to be forwarded on to any number of
       monitoring tools (or "client contexts").  These tools may be  re‐
       questing events at different sampling intervals, and are very un‐
       likely  to request an event at the exact moment it arrives at the
       PMDA, making some form of event buffering and  queuing  scheme  a
       necessity.  Events must be held by the PMDA until either all reg‐
       istered  clients have been sent them, or until a memory limit has
       been reached by the PMDA at which point  it  must  discard  older
       events as new ones arrive.

       The  routines  described here are designed to assist the PMDA de‐
       veloper in managing both client contexts and queues of events  at
       a  high level.  These fit logically above lower level primitives,
       such as those described in <a href="pmdaeventnewarray.3.html">pmdaEventNewArray(3)</a>, and  shield  the
       average  PMDA  from the details of directly building event record
       arrays for individual client contexts.

       The PMDA registers a new queue of events using either  <b>pmdaEvent‐</b>
       <b>NewQueue </b>or <b>pmdaEventNewActiveQueue</b>.  These are passed an identi‐
       fying <i>name</i> (for diagnostic purposes, and for subsequent lookup by
       <b>pmdaEventQueueHandle</b>)  and  <i>maxmem</i>,  an upper bound on the memory
       (in bytes) that can be consumed by events in this  queue,  before
       beginning  to  discard them (resulting in "missed" events for any
       client that has not kept up).  If a queue is dynamically allocat‐
       ed (such that the PMDA may already have  clients  connected)  the
       <b>pmdaEventNewActiveQueue  </b>interface should be used, with the addi‐
       tional <i>nclients</i> parameter indicating the count of  active  client
       connections.   The  return  is  a negative error code on failure,
       suitable for decoding by the <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a> routine.  Any  non-nega‐
       tive  value indicates success, and provides a <i>handle</i> suitable for
       passing into the other API routines.

       For each new event received by the PMDA, the <b>pmdaEventQueueAppend</b>
       routine should be called, placing that event into the queue iden‐
       tified by <i>handle</i>.  The event itself  must  be  contained  in  the
       passed  in <i>buffer</i>, having <i>bytes</i> length.  The timestamp associated
       with the event (time at which the event occurred)  is  passed  in
       via the final <i>tv</i> parameter.

       In  the PMDAs specific implementation of its fetch callback, when
       values for an event metric have  been  requested,  the  <b>pmdaEven‐</b>
       <b>tQueueRecords  </b>routine  should  be  used.  It is passed the queue
       <i>handle</i> and the <i>avp</i>  pmAtomValue  structure  to  fill  with  event
       records,  for the client making that fetch request (identified by
       the <i>context</i> parameter).  Finally, the PMDA must also pass  in  an
       event  decoding  routine,  which  is responsible for decoding the
       fields of a single event into the individual event parameters  of
       that  event.   The <i>data</i> parameter is an opaque cookie that can be
       used to pass situation-specific information into each <i>decoder</i> in‐
       vocation.

       Under some situations it is useful for the PMDA to  export  state
       about  the queues under its control.  The accessor routines - <b>pm‐</b>
       <b>daEventQueueClients</b>,  <b>pmdaEventQueueCounter</b>,  <b>pmdaEventQueueBytes</b>
       and <b>pmdaEventQueueMemory </b>provide a mechanism for querying a queue
       by  its  <i>handle</i>  and  filling in a <b>pmAtomValue </b>structure that the
       <b>pmdaFetchCallBack </b>method should return.
