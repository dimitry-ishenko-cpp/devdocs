</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fork</i>() function shall create a new process. The new process
       (child process) shall be an exact copy of the calling process
       (parent process) except as detailed below:

        *  The child process shall have a unique process ID.

        *  The child process ID also shall not match any active process
           group ID.

        *  The child process shall have a different parent process ID,
           which shall be the process ID of the calling process.

        *  The child process shall have its own copy of the parent's
           file descriptors. Each of the child's file descriptors shall
           refer to the same open file description with the
           corresponding file descriptor of the parent.

        *  The child process shall have its own copy of the parent's
           open directory streams. Each open directory stream in the
           child process may share directory stream positioning with the
           corresponding directory stream of the parent.

        *  The child process shall have its own copy of the parent's
           message catalog descriptors.

        *  The child process values of <i>tms_utime</i>, <i>tms_stime</i>, <i>tms_cutime</i>,
           and <i>tms_cstime</i> shall be set to 0.

        *  The time left until an alarm clock signal shall be reset to
           zero, and the alarm, if any, shall be canceled; see
           <a href="alarm.3p.html">alarm(3p)</a>.

        *  All <i>semadj</i> values shall be cleared.

        *  File locks set by the parent process shall not be inherited
           by the child process.

        *  The set of signals pending for the child process shall be
           initialized to the empty set.

        *  Interval timers shall be reset in the child process.

        *  Any semaphores that are open in the parent process shall also
           be open in the child process.

        *  The child process shall not inherit any address space memory
           locks established by the parent process via calls to
           <i>mlockall</i>() or <i>mlock</i>().

        *  Memory mappings created in the parent shall be retained in
           the child process. MAP_PRIVATE mappings inherited from the
           parent shall also be MAP_PRIVATE mappings in the child, and
           any modifications to the data in these mappings made by the
           parent prior to calling <i>fork</i>() shall be visible to the child.
           Any modifications to the data in MAP_PRIVATE mappings made by
           the parent after <i>fork</i>() returns shall be visible only to the
           parent. Modifications to the data in MAP_PRIVATE mappings
           made by the child shall be visible only to the child.

        *  For the SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR scheduling policies, the
           child process shall inherit the policy and priority settings
           of the parent process during a <i>fork</i>() function. For other
           scheduling policies, the policy and priority settings on
           <i>fork</i>() are implementation-defined.

        *  Per-process timers created by the parent shall not be
           inherited by the child process.

        *  The child process shall have its own copy of the message
           queue descriptors of the parent. Each of the message
           descriptors of the child shall refer to the same open message
           queue description as the corresponding message descriptor of
           the parent.

        *  No asynchronous input or asynchronous output operations shall
           be inherited by the child process. Any use of asynchronous
           control blocks created by the parent produces undefined
           behavior.

        *  A process shall be created with a single thread. If a multi-
           threaded process calls <i>fork</i>(), the new process shall contain
           a replica of the calling thread and its entire address space,
           possibly including the states of mutexes and other resources.
           Consequently, to avoid errors, the child process may only
           execute async-signal-safe operations until such time as one
           of the <i>exec</i> functions is called.

           When the application calls <i>fork</i>() from a signal handler and
           any of the fork handlers registered by <i>pthread_atfork</i>() calls
           a function that is not async-signal-safe, the behavior is
           undefined.

        *  If the Trace option and the Trace Inherit option are both
           supported:

           If the calling process was being traced in a trace stream
           that had its inheritance policy set to POSIX_TRACE_INHERITED,
           the child process shall be traced into that trace stream, and
           the child process shall inherit the parent's mapping of trace
           event names to trace event type identifiers. If the trace
           stream in which the calling process was being traced had its
           inheritance policy set to POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD, the
           child process shall not be traced into that trace stream. The
           inheritance policy is set by a call to the
           <i>posix_trace_attr_setinherited</i>() function.

        *  If the Trace option is supported, but the Trace Inherit
           option is not supported:

           The child process shall not be traced into any of the trace
           streams of its parent process.

        *  If the Trace option is supported, the child process of a
           trace controller process shall not control the trace streams
           controlled by its parent process.

        *  The initial value of the CPU-time clock of the child process
           shall be set to zero.

        *  The initial value of the CPU-time clock of the single thread
           of the child process shall be set to zero.

       All other process characteristics defined by POSIX.1‐2008 shall
       be the same in the parent and child processes. The inheritance of
       process characteristics not defined by POSIX.1‐2008 is
       unspecified by POSIX.1‐2008.

       After <i>fork</i>(), both the parent and the child processes shall be
       capable of executing independently before either one terminates.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>fork</i>() shall return 0 to the child
       process and shall return the process ID of the child process to
       the parent process. Both processes shall continue to execute from
       the <i>fork</i>() function. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned to the
       parent process, no child process shall be created, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       shall be set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fork</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The system lacked the necessary resources to create
              another process, or the system-imposed limit on the total
              number of processes under execution system-wide or by a
              single user {CHILD_MAX} would be exceeded.

       The <i>fork</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Many historical implementations have timing windows where a
       signal sent to a process group (for example, an interactive
       SIGINT) just prior to or during execution of <i>fork</i>() is delivered
       to the parent following the <i>fork</i>() but not to the child because
       the <i>fork</i>() code clears the child's set of pending signals. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not require, or even permit, this
       behavior. However, it is pragmatic to expect that problems of
       this nature may continue to exist in implementations that appear
       to conform to this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 and pass available
       verification suites. This behavior is only a consequence of the
       implementation failing to make the interval between signal
       generation and delivery totally invisible.  From the
       application's perspective, a <i>fork</i>() call should appear atomic. A
       signal that is generated prior to the <i>fork</i>() should be delivered
       prior to the <i>fork</i>().  A signal sent to the process group after
       the <i>fork</i>() should be delivered to both parent and child. The
       implementation may actually initialize internal data structures
       corresponding to the child's set of pending signals to include
       signals sent to the process group during the <i>fork</i>().  Since the
       <i>fork</i>() call can be considered as atomic from the application's
       perspective, the set would be initialized as empty and such
       signals would have arrived after the <i>fork</i>(); see also <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>.

       One approach that has been suggested to address the problem of
       signal inheritance across <i>fork</i>() is to add an <b>[EINTR] </b>error,
       which would be returned when a signal is detected during the
       call. While this is preferable to losing signals, it was not
       considered an optimal solution. Although it is not recommended
       for this purpose, such an error would be an allowable extension
       for an implementation.

       The <b>[ENOMEM] </b>error value is reserved for those implementations
       that detect and distinguish such a condition. This condition
       occurs when an implementation detects that there is not enough
       memory to create the process. This is intended to be returned
       when <b>[EAGAIN] </b>is inappropriate because there can never be enough
       memory (either primary or secondary storage) to perform the
       operation. Since <i>fork</i>() duplicates an existing process, this must
       be a condition where there is sufficient memory for one such
       process, but not for two. Many historical implementations
       actually return <b>[ENOMEM] </b>due to temporary lack of memory, a case
       that is not generally distinct from <b>[EAGAIN] </b>from the perspective
       of a conforming application.

       Part of the reason for including the optional error <b>[ENOMEM] </b>is
       because the SVID specifies it and it should be reserved for the
       error condition specified there. The condition is not applicable
       on many implementations.

       IEEE Std 1003.1‐1988 neglected to require concurrent execution of
       the parent and child of <i>fork</i>().  A system that single-threads
       processes was clearly not intended and is considered an
       unacceptable ``toy implementation'' of this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017.  The only objection anticipated to the phrase
       ``executing independently'' is testability, but this assertion
       should be testable.  Such tests require that both the parent and
       child can block on a detectable action of the other, such as a
       write to a pipe or a signal.  An interactive exchange of such
       actions should be possible for the system to conform to the
       intent of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The <b>[EAGAIN] </b>error exists to warn applications that such a
       condition might occur.  Whether it occurs or not is not in any
       practical sense under the control of the application because the
       condition is usually a consequence of the user's use of the
       system, not of the application's code. Thus, no application can
       or should rely upon its occurrence under any circumstances, nor
       should the exact semantics of what concept of ``user'' is used be
       of concern to the application developer.  Validation writers
       should be cognizant of this limitation.

       There are two reasons why POSIX programmers call <i>fork</i>().  One
       reason is to create a new thread of control within the same
       program (which was originally only possible in POSIX by creating
       a new process); the other is to create a new process running a
       different program. In the latter case, the call to <i>fork</i>() is soon
       followed by a call to one of the <i>exec</i> functions.

       The general problem with making <i>fork</i>() work in a multi-threaded
       world is what to do with all of the threads.  There are two
       alternatives. One is to copy all of the threads into the new
       process. This causes the programmer or implementation to deal
       with threads that are suspended on system calls or that might be
       about to execute system calls that should not be executed in the
       new process.  The other alternative is to copy only the thread
       that calls <i>fork</i>().  This creates the difficulty that the state of
       process-local resources is usually held in process memory. If a
       thread that is not calling <i>fork</i>() holds a resource, that resource
       is never released in the child process because the thread whose
       job it is to release the resource does not exist in the child
       process.

       When a programmer is writing a multi-threaded program, the first
       described use of <i>fork</i>(), creating new threads in the same
       program, is provided by the <i>pthread_create</i>() function. The <i>fork</i>()
       function is thus used only to run new programs, and the effects
       of calling functions that require certain resources between the
       call to <i>fork</i>() and the call to an <i>exec</i> function are undefined.

       The addition of the <i>forkall</i>() function to the standard was
       considered and rejected. The <i>forkall</i>() function lets all the
       threads in the parent be duplicated in the child. This
       essentially duplicates the state of the parent in the child. This
       allows threads in the child to continue processing and allows
       locks and the state to be preserved without explicit
       <i>pthread_atfork</i>() code. The calling process has to ensure that the
       threads processing state that is shared between the parent and
       child (that is, file descriptors or MAP_SHARED memory) behaves
       properly after <i>forkall</i>().  For example, if a thread is reading a
       file descriptor in the parent when <i>forkall</i>() is called, then two
       threads (one in the parent and one in the child) are reading the
       file descriptor after the <i>forkall</i>().  If this is not desired
       behavior, the parent process has to synchronize with such threads
       before calling <i>forkall</i>().

       While the <i>fork</i>() function is async-signal-safe, there is no way
       for an implementation to determine whether the fork handlers
       established by <i>pthread_atfork</i>() are async-signal-safe. The fork
       handlers may attempt to execute portions of the implementation
       that are not async-signal-safe, such as those that are protected
       by mutexes, leading to a deadlock condition.  It is therefore
       undefined for the fork handlers to execute functions that are not
       async-signal-safe when <i>fork</i>() is called from a signal handler.

       When <i>forkall</i>() is called, threads, other than the calling thread,
       that are in functions that can return with an <b>[EINTR] </b>error may
       have those functions return <b>[EINTR] </b>if the implementation cannot
       ensure that the function behaves correctly in the parent and
       child. In particular, <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() and
       <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() need to return in order to ensure that
       the condition has not changed.  These functions can be awakened
       by a spurious condition wakeup rather than returning <b>[EINTR]</b>.
