NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_dump_ftell, pcap_dump_ftell64 - get the current file offset
       for a savefile being written
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>long pcap_dump_ftell(pcap_dumper_t *p);</b>
       <b>int64_t pcap_dump_ftell64(pcap_dumper_t *p);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_dump_ftell</b>() returns the current file position for the
       ``savefile'', representing the number of bytes written by
       <b>pcap_dump_open</b>(3PCAP) and <b>pcap_dump</b>(3PCAP).  <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is
       returned on error. If the current file position does not fit in a
       <b>long</b>, it will be truncated; this can happen on 32-bit UNIX-like
       systems with large file support and on Windows.
       <b>pcap_dump_ftell64</b>() returns the current file position in a
       <b>int64_t</b>, so if file offsets that don't fit in a <b>long </b>but that fit
       in a <b>int64_t </b>are supported, this will return the file offset
       without truncation.  <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is returned on error.
</pre> <h2>
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       The function <b>pcap_dump_ftell64</b>() became available in libpcap
       release 1.9.0.  In previous releases, there was no mechanism to
       obtain a file offset that is too large to fit in a <b>long</b>.
