DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A few programs exit with the following error codes.

       The successful exit is always indicated by a status of <b>0</b>, or
       <b>EX_OK </b>(equivalent to <b>EXIT_SUCCESS </b>from <i>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</i>).  Error
       numbers begin at <b>EX__BASE </b>to reduce the possibility of clashing
       with other exit statuses that random programs may already return.
       The meaning of the code is approximately as follows:

       <b>EX_USAGE</b>
              The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the wrong
              number of arguments, a bad flag, bad syntax in a
              parameter, or whatever.

       <b>EX_DATAERR</b>
              The input data was incorrect in some way.  This should
              only be used for user's data and not system files.

       <b>EX_NOINPUT</b>
              An input file (not a system file) did not exist or was not
              readable.  This could also include errors like "No
              message" to a mailer (if it cared to catch it).

       <b>EX_NOUSER</b>
              The user specified did not exist.  This might be used for
              mail addresses or remote logins.

       <b>EX_NOHOST</b>
              The host specified did not exist.  This is used in mail
              addresses or network requests.

       <b>EX_UNAVAILABLE</b>
              A service is unavailable.  This can occur if a support
              program or file does not exist.  This can also be used as
              a catch-all message when something you wanted to do
              doesn't work, but you don't know why.

       <b>EX_SOFTWARE</b>
              An internal software error has been detected.  This should
              be limited to non-operating system related errors if
              possible.

       <b>EX_OSERR</b>
              An operating system error has been detected.  This is
              intended to be used for such things as "cannot fork",
              "cannot create pipe", or the like.  It includes things
              like <a href="../man2/getuid.2.html">getuid(2)</a> returning a user that does not exist in the
              <a href="../man5/passwd.5.html">passwd(5)</a> file.

       <b>EX_OSFILE</b>
              Some system file (e.g., <i>/etc/passwd</i>, <i>/etc/utmp</i>, etc.)
              does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some sort of
              error (e.g., syntax error).

       <b>EX_CANTCREAT</b>
              A (user specified) output file cannot be created.

       <b>EX_IOERR</b>
              An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.

       <b>EX_TEMPFAIL</b>
              Temporary failure, indicating something that is not really
              an error.  For example that a mailer could not create a
              connection, and the request should be reattempted later.

       <b>EX_PROTOCOL</b>
              The remote system returned something that was "not
              possible" during a protocol exchange.

       <b>EX_OSFILE</b>
              You did not have sufficient permission to perform the
              operation.  This is not intended for file system problems,
              which should use <b>EX_NOINPUT </b>or <b>EX_CANTCREAT</b>, but rather
              for higher level permissions.

       <b>EX_CONFIG</b>
              Something was found in an unconfigured or misconfigured
              state.

       The numerical values corresponding to the symbolical ones are
       given in parenthesis for easy reference.
