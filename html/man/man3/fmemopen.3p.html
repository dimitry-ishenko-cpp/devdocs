NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fmemopen — open a memory buffer stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       FILE *fmemopen(void *restrict <i>buf</i>, size_t <i>size</i>,
           const char *restrict <i>mode</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fmemopen</i>() function shall associate the buffer given by the
       <i>buf</i> and <i>size</i> arguments with a stream. The <i>buf</i> argument shall be
       either a null pointer or point to a buffer that is at least <i>size</i>
       bytes long.

       The <i>mode</i> argument points to a string. If the string is one of the
       following, the stream shall be opened in the indicated mode.
       Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

       <i>r</i>       Open the stream for reading.

       <i>w</i>       Open the stream for writing.

       <i>a</i>       Append; open the stream for writing at the first null
               byte.

       <i>r</i>+      Open the stream for update (reading and writing).

       <i>w</i>+      Open the stream for update (reading and writing).
               Truncate the buffer contents.

       <i>a</i>+      Append; open the stream for update (reading and writing);
               the initial position is at the first null byte.

       Implementations shall accept all mode strings allowed by <i>fopen</i>(),
       but the use of the character <b>'b' </b>shall produce implementation-
       defined results, where the resulting <b>FILE * </b>need not behave the
       same as if <b>'b' </b>were omitted.

       If a null pointer is specified as the <i>buf</i> argument, <i>fmemopen</i>()
       shall allocate <i>size</i> bytes of memory as if by a call to <i>malloc</i>().
       This buffer shall be automatically freed when the stream is
       closed.  Because this feature is only useful when the stream is
       opened for updating (because there is no way to get a pointer to
       the buffer) the <i>fmemopen</i>() call may fail if the <i>mode</i> argument
       does not include a <b>'+'</b>.

       The stream shall maintain a current position in the buffer. This
       position shall be initially set to either the beginning of the
       buffer (for <i>r</i> and <i>w</i> modes) or to the first null byte in the
       buffer (for <i>a</i> modes). If no null byte is found in append mode,
       the initial position shall be set to one byte after the end of
       the buffer.

       If <i>buf</i> is a null pointer, the initial position shall always be
       set to the beginning of the buffer.

       The stream shall also maintain the size of the current buffer
       contents; use of <i>fseek</i>() or <i>fseeko</i>() on the stream with SEEK_END
       shall seek relative to this size. For modes <i>r</i> and <i>r+</i> the size
       shall be set to the value given by the <i>size</i> argument. For modes <i>w</i>
       and <i>w+</i> the initial size shall be zero and for modes <i>a</i> and <i>a+</i> the
       initial size shall be:

        *  Zero, if <i>buf</i> is a null pointer

        *  The position of the first null byte in the buffer, if one is
           found

        *  The value of the <i>size</i> argument, if <i>buf</i> is not a null pointer
           and no null byte is found

       A read operation on the stream shall not advance the current
       buffer position beyond the current buffer size. Reaching the
       buffer size in a read operation shall count as ``end-of-file''.
       Null bytes in the buffer shall have no special meaning for reads.
       The read operation shall start at the current buffer position of
       the stream.

       A write operation shall start either at the current position of
       the stream (if <i>mode</i> has not specified <b>'a' </b>as the first character)
       or at the current size of the stream (if <i>mode</i> had <b>'a' </b>as the
       first character). If the current position at the end of the write
       is larger than the current buffer size, the current buffer size
       shall be set to the current position. A write operation on the
       stream shall not advance the current buffer size beyond the size
       given in the <i>size</i> argument.

       When a stream open for writing is flushed or closed, a null byte
       shall be written at the current position or at the end of the
       buffer, depending on the size of the contents. If a stream open
       for update is flushed or closed and the last write has advanced
       the current buffer size, a null byte shall be written at the end
       of the buffer if it fits.

       An attempt to seek a memory buffer stream to a negative position
       or to a position larger than the buffer size given in the <i>size</i>
       argument shall fail.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>fmemopen</i>() shall return a pointer to
       the object controlling the stream. Otherwise, a null pointer
       shall be returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fmemopen</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EMFILE </b>{STREAM_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

       The <i>fmemopen</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>mode</i> argument is not valid.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>buf</i> argument is a null pointer and the <i>mode</i> argument
              does not include a <b>'+' </b>character.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>size</i> argument specifies a buffer size of zero and the
              implementation does not support this.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The <i>buf</i> argument is a null pointer and the allocation of a
              buffer of length <i>size</i> has failed.

       <b>EMFILE </b>{FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;string.h&gt;

           static char buffer[] = "foobar";

           int
           main (void)
           {
               int ch;
               FILE *stream;

               stream = fmemopen(buffer, strlen (buffer), "r");
               if (stream == NULL)
                   /* handle error */;

               while ((ch = fgetc(stream)) != EOF)
                   printf("Got %c\n", ch);

               fclose(stream);
               return (0);
           }

       This program produces the following output:

           Got f
           Got o
           Got o
           Got b
           Got a
           Got r
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       This interface has been introduced to eliminate many of the
       errors encountered in the construction of strings, notably
       overflowing of strings. This interface prevents overflow.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version of this standard may mandate specific behavior
       when the <i>mode</i> argument includes <b>'b'</b>.

       A future version of this standard may require support of zero-
       length buffer streams explicitly.
