PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       tcsetpgrp — set the foreground process group ID
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int tcsetpgrp(int <i>fildes</i>, pid_t <i>pgid_id</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If the process has a controlling terminal, <i>tcsetpgrp</i>() shall set
       the foreground process group ID associated with the terminal to
       <i>pgid_id</i>.  The application shall ensure that the file associated
       with <i>fildes</i> is the controlling terminal of the calling process
       and the controlling terminal is currently associated with the
       session of the calling process. The application shall ensure that
       the value of <i>pgid_id</i> matches a process group ID of a process in
       the same session as the calling process.

       Attempts to use <i>tcsetpgrp</i>() from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a <i>fildes</i> associated with its
       controlling terminal shall cause the process group to be sent a
       SIGTTOU signal. If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals
       or the process is ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be
       allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tcsetpgrp</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EINVAL </b>This implementation does not support the value in the
              <i>pgid_id</i> argument.

       <b>EIO    </b>The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the
              calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is
              not ignoring SIGTTOU.

       <b>ENOTTY </b>The calling process does not have a controlling terminal,
              or the file is not the controlling terminal, or the
              controlling terminal is no longer associated with the
              session of the calling process.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The value of <i>pgid_id</i> is a value supported by the
              implementation, but does not match the process group ID of
              a process in the same session as the calling process.
