DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These functions translate between internal and external
       representations of a capability state.  The external
       representation is an exportable, contiguous, persistent
       representation of a capability state in user-managed space.  The
       internal representation is managed by the capability functions in
       working storage.

       <b>cap_size</b>() returns the total length (in bytes) that the
       capability state in working storage identified by <i>cap_p</i> would
       require when converted by <b>cap_copy_ext</b>().  This function is used
       primarily to determine the amount of buffer space that must be
       provided to the <b>cap_copy_ext</b>() function in order to hold the
       capability data record created from <i>cap_p</i>.

       <b>cap_copy_ext</b>() copies a capability state in working storage,
       identified by <i>cap_p</i>, from system-managed space to user-managed
       space (pointed to by <i>ext_p</i>) and returns the length of the
       resulting data record.  The size parameter represents the maximum
       size, in bytes, of the resulting data record.  The <b>cap_copy_ext</b>()
       function will do any conversions necessary to convert the
       capability state from the undefined internal format to an
       exportable, contiguous, persistent data record.  It is the
       responsibility of the user to allocate a buffer large enough to
       hold the copied data.  The buffer length required to hold the
       copied data may be obtained by a call to the <b>cap_size</b>() function.

       <b>cap_copy_int</b>() copies a capability state from a capability data
       record in user-managed space to a new capability state in working
       storage, allocating any memory necessary, and returning a pointer
       to the newly created capability state.  The function initializes
       the capability state and then copies the capability state from
       the record pointed to by <i>ext_p</i> into the capability state,
       converting, if necessary, the data from a contiguous, persistent
       format to an opaque, internal format.  Once copied into internal
       format, the object can be manipulated by the capability state
       manipulation functions (see <a href="cap_clear.3.html">cap_clear(3)</a>).  Note that the record
       pointed to by <i>ext_p</i> must have been obtained from a previous,
       successful call to <b>cap_copy_ext</b>() for this function to work
       successfully.  The caller should free any releasable memory, when
       the capability state in working storage is no longer required, by
       calling <b>cap_free</b>() with the <i>cap_t</i> as an argument.

       <b>cap_copy_int_check</b>() performs the same operation as
       <b>cap_copy_int</b>() but additionally checks that the provided external
       data's size is not larger than the noted length.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cap_size</b>() returns the length required to hold a capability data
       record on success, and -1 on failure.

       <b>cap_copy_ext</b>() returns the number of bytes placed in the user
       managed space pointed to by <i>ext_p</i> on success, and -1 on failure.

       <b>cap_copy_int</b>() and <b>cap_copy_int_check</b>() return a pointer to the
       newly created capability state in working storage on success, and
       NULL on failure.

       On failure, <b>errno </b>is set to <b>EINVAL</b>, <b>ENOMEM</b>, or <b>ERANGE</b>.
</pre> <h2>
