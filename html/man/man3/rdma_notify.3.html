NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rdma_notify - Notifies the librdmacm of an asynchronous event.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int rdma_notify (struct rdma_cm_id *</b><i>id</i><b>, enum ibv_event_type</b>
       <i>event</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       id          RDMA identifier.

       event       Asynchronous event.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Used to notify the librdmacm of asynchronous events that have
       occurred on a QP associated with the rdma_cm_id.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno
       will be set to indicate the failure reason.  If errno is set to
       EISCONN (transport endpoint is already connected), this indicates
       that the the underlying communication manager established the
       connection before the call to rdma_notify could be processed.  In
       this case, the error may safely be ignored.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Asynchronous events that occur on a QP are reported through the
       user's device event handler.  This routine is used to notify the
       librdmacm of communication events.  In most cases, use of this
       routine is not necessary, however if connection establishment is
       done out of band (such as done through Infiniband), it's possible
       to receive data on a QP that is not yet considered connected.
       This routine forces the connection into an established state in
       this case in order to handle the rare situation where the
       connection never forms on its own.  Calling this routine ensures
       the delivery of the RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED event to the
       application.  Events that should be reported to the CM are:
       IB_EVENT_COMM_EST.
