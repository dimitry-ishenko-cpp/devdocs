NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_icx_unc_pcu - support for Intel IcelakeX Server PCU
       uncore PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: icx_unc_pcu</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel IcelakeX PCU uncore PMU</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel IcelakeX PCU (Power Control Unit)
       uncore PMU. There is one PCU per system.  Each PCU PMU implements
       4 generic counters.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel IcelakeX PCU
       uncore PMU:

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to
              one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t      </b>Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the
              counter counts the number of PCU clockticks in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:63].

       <b>i      </b>Invert the threshold (t) test from strictly greater than
              to less or equal to. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>occ_i  </b>Invert the threshold (t) for occupancy events
              <b>POWER_STATE_OCCUPANY </b>test from strictly greater than to
              less or equal to. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>occ_e  </b>Enable edge detection for occupancy events
              <b>POWER_STATE_OCCUPANCY</b>, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to
              one.  This is a boolean modifier.
