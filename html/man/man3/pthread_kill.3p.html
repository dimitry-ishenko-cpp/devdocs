PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_kill — send a signal to a thread
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

       int pthread_kill(pthread_t <i>thread</i>, int <i>sig</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_kill</i>() function shall request that a signal be
       delivered to the specified thread.

       As in <i>kill</i>(), if <i>sig</i> is zero, error checking shall be performed
       but no signal shall actually be sent.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the function shall return a value of
       zero.  Otherwise, the function shall return an error number. If
       the <i>pthread_kill</i>() function fails, no signal shall be sent.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_kill</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>sig</i> argument is an invalid or unsupported
              signal number.

       The <i>pthread_kill</i>() function shall not return an error code of
       <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_kill</i>() function provides a mechanism for
       asynchronously directing a signal at a thread in the calling
       process. This could be used, for example, by one thread to affect
       broadcast delivery of a signal to a set of threads.

       Note that <i>pthread_kill</i>() only causes the signal to be handled in
       the context of the given thread; the signal action (termination
       or stopping) affects the process as a whole.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of
       its lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and
       report an <b>[ESRCH] </b>error.

       Existing implementations vary on the result of a <i>pthread_kill</i>()
       with a thread ID indicating an inactive thread (a terminated
       thread that has not been detached or joined). Some indicate
       success on such a call, while others give an error of <b>[ESRCH]</b>.
       Since the definition of thread lifetime in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 covers inactive threads, the <b>[ESRCH] </b>error as
       described is inappropriate in this case. In particular, this
       means that an application cannot have one thread check for
       termination of another with <i>pthread_kill</i>().
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version of this standard may require that <i>pthread_kill</i>()
       not fail with <b>[ESRCH] </b>in the case of sending signals to an
       inactive thread (a terminated thread not yet detached or joined),
       even though no signal will be delivered because the thread is no
       longer running.
