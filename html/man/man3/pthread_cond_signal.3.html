DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A condition (short for ``condition variable'') is a
       synchronization device that allows threads to suspend execution
       and relinquish the processors until some predicate on shared data
       is satisfied.  The basic operations on conditions are: signal the
       condition (when the predicate becomes true), and wait for the
       condition, suspending the thread execution until another thread
       signals the condition.

       A condition variable must always be associated with a mutex, to
       avoid the race condition where a thread prepares to wait on a
       condition variable and another thread signals the condition just
       before the first thread actually waits on it.

       <b>pthread_cond_init </b>initializes the condition variable <i>cond</i>, using
       the condition attributes specified in <i>cond_attr</i>, or default
       attributes if <i>cond_attr</i> is <b>NULL</b>.  The LinuxThreads implementation
       supports no attributes for conditions, hence the <i>cond_attr</i>
       parameter is actually ignored.

       Variables of type <b>pthread_cond_t </b>can also be initialized
       statically, using the constant <b>PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER</b>.

       <b>pthread_cond_signal </b>restarts one of the threads that are waiting
       on the condition variable <i>cond</i>.  If no threads are waiting on
       <i>cond</i>, nothing happens.  If several threads are waiting on <i>cond</i>,
       exactly one is restarted, but it is not specified which.

       <b>pthread_cond_broadcast </b>restarts all the threads that are waiting
       on the condition variable <i>cond</i>.  Nothing happens if no threads
       are waiting on <i>cond</i>.

       <b>pthread_cond_wait </b>atomically unlocks the <i>mutex</i> (as per
       <b>pthread_unlock_mutex</b>) and waits for the condition variable <i>cond</i>
       to be signaled.  The thread execution is suspended and does not
       consume any CPU time until the condition variable is signaled.
       The <i>mutex</i> must be locked by the calling thread on entrance to
       <b>pthread_cond_wait</b>.  Before returning to the calling thread,
       <b>pthread_cond_wait </b>re-acquires <i>mutex</i> (as per <b>pthread_lock_mutex</b>).

       Unlocking the mutex and suspending on the condition variable is
       done atomically.  Thus, if all threads always acquire the mutex
       before signaling the condition, this guarantees that the
       condition cannot be signaled (and thus ignored) between the time
       a thread locks the mutex and the time it waits on the condition
       variable.

       <b>pthread_cond_timedwait </b>atomically unlocks <i>mutex</i> and waits on
       <i>cond</i>, as <b>pthread_cond_wait </b>does, but it also bounds the duration
       of the wait.  If <i>cond</i> has not been signaled within the amount of
       time specified by <i>abstime</i>, the mutex <i>mutex</i> is re-acquired and
       <b>pthread_cond_timedwait </b>returns the error <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>.  The <i>abstime</i>
       parameter specifies an absolute time, with the same origin as
       <a href="../man2/time.2.html">time(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/gettimeofday.2.html">gettimeofday(2)</a>: an <i>abstime</i> of 0 corresponds to
       00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970.

       <b>pthread_cond_destroy </b>destroys a condition variable, freeing the
       resources it might hold.  No threads must be waiting on the
       condition variable on entrance to <b>pthread_cond_destroy</b>.  In the
       LinuxThreads implementation, no resources are associated with
       condition variables, thus <b>pthread_cond_destroy </b>actually does
       nothing except checking that the condition has no waiting
       threads.
</pre> <h2>
CANCELLATION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pthread_cond_wait </b>and <b>pthread_cond_timedwait </b>are cancelation
       points.  If a thread is cancelled while suspended in one of these
       functions, the thread immediately resumes execution, then locks
       again the <i>mutex</i> argument to <b>pthread_cond_wait </b>and
       <b>pthread_cond_timedwait</b>, and finally executes the cancelation.
       Consequently, cleanup handlers are assured that <i>mutex</i> is locked
       when they are called.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNC-SIGNAL SAFETY </h2>
<pre>
       The condition functions are not async-signal safe, and should not
       be called from a signal handler.  In particular, calling
       <b>pthread_cond_signal </b>or <b>pthread_cond_broadcast </b>from a signal
       handler may deadlock the calling thread.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       All condition variable functions return 0 on success and a non-
       zero error code on error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pthread_cond_init</b>, <b>pthread_cond_signal</b>, <b>pthread_cond_broadcast</b>,
       and <b>pthread_cond_wait </b>never return an error code.

       The <b>pthread_cond_timedwait </b>function returns the following error
       codes on error:

              <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
                     The condition variable was not signaled until the
                     timeout specified by <i>abstime</i>.

              <b>EINTR  pthread_cond_timedwait </b>was interrupted by a signal.

       The <b>pthread_cond_destroy </b>function returns the following error
       code on error:

              <b>EBUSY  </b>Some threads are currently waiting on <i>cond</i>.

EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       Consider two shared variables <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, protected by the mutex
       <i>mut</i>, and a condition variable <i>cond</i> that is to be signaled
       whenever <i>x</i> becomes greater than <i>y</i>.

              <b>int x,y;</b>
              <b>pthread_mutex_t mut = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;</b>
              <b>pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;</b>

       Waiting until <i>x</i> is greater than <i>y</i> is performed as follows:

              <b>pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mut);</b>
              <b>while (x &lt;= y) {</b>
                      <b>pthread_cond_wait(&amp;cond, &amp;mut);</b>
              <b>}</b>
              <b>/* operate on x and y */</b>
              <b>pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mut);</b>

       Modifications on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> that may cause <i>x</i> to become greater than
       <i>y</i> should signal the condition if needed:

              <b>pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mut);</b>
              <b>/* modify x and y */</b>
              <b>if (x &gt; y) pthread_cond_broadcast(&amp;cond);</b>
              <b>pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mut);</b>

       If it can be proved that at most one waiting thread needs to be
       waken up (for instance, if there are only two threads
       communicating through <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>), <b>pthread_cond_signal </b>can be used
       as a slightly more efficient alternative to
       <b>pthread_cond_broadcast</b>.  In doubt, use <b>pthread_cond_broadcast</b>.

       To wait for <i>x</i> to become greater than <i>y</i> with a timeout of 5
       seconds, do:

              <b>struct timeval now;</b>
              <b>struct timespec timeout;</b>
              <b>int retcode;</b>

              <b>pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;mut);</b>
              <b>gettimeofday(&amp;now);</b>
              <b>timeout.tv_sec = now.tv_sec + 5;</b>
              <b>timeout.tv_nsec = now.tv_usec * 1000;</b>
              <b>retcode = 0;</b>
              <b>while (x &lt;= y &amp;&amp; retcode != ETIMEDOUT) {</b>
                      <b>retcode = pthread_cond_timedwait(&amp;cond, &amp;mut, &amp;timeout);</b>
              <b>}</b>
              <b>if (retcode == ETIMEDOUT) {</b>
                      <b>/* timeout occurred */</b>
              <b>} else {</b>
                      <b>/* operate on x and y */</b>
              <b>}</b>
              <b>pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;mut);</b>
