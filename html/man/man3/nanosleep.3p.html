PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       nanosleep — high resolution sleep
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       int nanosleep(const struct timespec *<i>rqtp</i>, struct timespec *<i>rmtp</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>nanosleep</i>() function shall cause the current thread to be
       suspended from execution until either the time interval specified
       by the <i>rqtp</i> argument has elapsed or a signal is delivered to the
       calling thread, and its action is to invoke a signal-catching
       function or to terminate the process. The suspension time may be
       longer than requested because the argument value is rounded up to
       an integer multiple of the sleep resolution or because of the
       scheduling of other activity by the system. But, except for the
       case of being interrupted by a signal, the suspension time shall
       not be less than the time specified by <i>rqtp</i>, as measured by the
       system clock CLOCK_REALTIME.

       The use of the <i>nanosleep</i>() function has no effect on the action
       or blockage of any signal.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the <i>nanosleep</i>() function returns because the requested time
       has elapsed, its return value shall be zero.

       If the <i>nanosleep</i>() function returns because it has been
       interrupted by a signal, it shall return a value of -1 and set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the interruption. If the <i>rmtp</i> argument is non-
       NULL, the <b>timespec </b>structure referenced by it is updated to
       contain the amount of time remaining in the interval (the
       requested time minus the time actually slept). The <i>rqtp</i> and <i>rmtp</i>
       arguments can point to the same object. If the <i>rmtp</i> argument is
       NULL, the remaining time is not returned.

       If <i>nanosleep</i>() fails, it shall return a value of -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>nanosleep</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>nanosleep</i>() function was interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>rqtp</i> argument specified a nanosecond value less than
              zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       It is common to suspend execution of a thread for an interval in
       order to poll the status of a non-interrupting function. A large
       number of actual needs can be met with a simple extension to
       <i>sleep</i>() that provides finer resolution.

       In the POSIX.1‐1990 standard and SVR4, it is possible to
       implement such a routine, but the frequency of wakeup is limited
       by the resolution of the <i>alarm</i>() and <i>sleep</i>() functions. In 4.3
       BSD, it is possible to write such a routine using no static
       storage and reserving no system facilities. Although it is
       possible to write a function with similar functionality to
       <i>sleep</i>() using the remainder of the <i>timer_*</i>() functions, such a
       function requires the use of signals and the reservation of some
       signal number. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that
       <i>nanosleep</i>() be non-intrusive of the signals function.

       The <i>nanosleep</i>() function shall return a value of 0 on success and
       -1 on failure or if interrupted. This latter case is different
       from <i>sleep</i>().  This was done because the remaining time is
       returned via an argument structure pointer, <i>rmtp</i>, instead of as
       the return value.
