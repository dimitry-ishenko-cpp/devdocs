<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       bind — bind a name to a socket
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int bind(int <i>socket</i>, const struct sockaddr *<i>address</i>,
           socklen_t <i>address_len</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>bind</i>() function shall assign a local socket address <i>address</i>
       to a socket identified by descriptor <i>socket</i> that has no local
       socket address assigned. Sockets created with the <i>socket</i>()
       function are initially unnamed; they are identified only by their
       address family.

       The <i>bind</i>() function takes the following arguments:

       <i>socket</i>      Specifies the file descriptor of the socket to be
                   bound.

       <i>address</i>     Points to a <b>sockaddr </b>structure containing the address
                   to be bound to the socket. The length and format of
                   the address depend on the address family of the
                   socket.

       <i>address_len</i> Specifies the length of the <b>sockaddr </b>structure
                   pointed to by the <i>address</i> argument.

       The socket specified by <i>socket</i> may require the process to have
       appropriate privileges to use the <i>bind</i>() function.

       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX and the pathname
       in <i>address</i> names a symbolic link, <i>bind</i>() shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       to <b>[EADDRINUSE]</b>.

       If the socket address cannot be assigned immediately and
       O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the socket, <i>bind</i>()
       shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINPROGRESS]</b>, but the assignment
       request shall not be aborted, and the assignment shall be
       completed asynchronously. Subsequent calls to <i>bind</i>() for the same
       socket, before the assignment is completed, shall fail and set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EALREADY]</b>.

       When the assignment has been performed asynchronously, <i>pselect</i>(),
       <i>select</i>(), and <i>poll</i>() shall indicate that the file descriptor for
       the socket is ready for reading and writing.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>bind</i>() shall return 0; otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>bind</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EADDRINUSE</b>
              The specified address is already in use.

       <b>EADDRNOTAVAIL</b>
              The specified address is not available from the local
              machine.

       <b>EAFNOSUPPORT</b>
              The specified address is not a valid address for the
              address family of the specified socket.

       <b>EALREADY</b>
              An assignment request is already in progress for the
              specified socket.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>socket</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EINPROGRESS</b>
              O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the socket
              and the assignment cannot be immediately performed; the
              assignment shall be performed asynchronously.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The socket is already bound to an address, and the
              protocol does not support binding to a new address; or the
              socket has been shut down.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available to complete the
              call.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <i>socket</i> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The socket type of the specified socket does not support
              binding to an address.

       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <i>bind</i>() shall
       fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>A component of the path prefix denies search permission,
              or the requested name requires writing in a directory with
              a mode that denies write permission.

       <b>EDESTADDRREQ </b>or <b>EISDIR</b>
              The <i>address</i> argument is a null pointer.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the pathname in <i>address</i>.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of the path prefix of the pathname in <i>address</i>
              does not name an existing file or the pathname is an empty
              string.

       <b>ENOENT </b>or <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The pathname in <i>address</i> contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters. If the pathname without the trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters would name an existing file, an <b>[ENOENT] </b>error
              shall not occur.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix of the pathname in <i>address</i>
              names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a
              symbolic link to a directory, or the pathname in <i>address</i>
              contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends with
              one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters and the last
              pathname component names an existing file that is neither
              a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The name would reside on a read-only file system.

       The <i>bind</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The specified address is protected and the current user
              does not have permission to bind to it.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>address_len</i> argument is not a valid length for the
              address family.

       <b>EISCONN</b>
              The socket is already connected.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the pathname in <i>address</i>.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following code segment shows how to create a socket and bind
       it to a name in the AF_UNIX domain.

           #define MY_SOCK_PATH "/somepath"

           int sfd;
           struct sockaddr_un my_addr;

           sfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
           if (sfd == -1)
               /* Handle error */;

           memset(&amp;my_addr, '\0', sizeof(struct sockaddr_un));
                                /* Clear structure */
           my_addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
           strncpy(my_addr.sun_path, MY_SOCK_PATH, sizeof(my_addr.sun_path) -1);

           if (bind(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;my_addr,
               sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)) == -1)
               /* Handle error */;
