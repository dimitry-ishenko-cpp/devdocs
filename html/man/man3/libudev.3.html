NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libudev - API for enumerating and introspecting local devices
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;libudev.h&gt;</b>

       <b>pkg-config --cflags --libs libudev</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       libudev.h provides an API to introspect and enumerate devices on
       the local system. This library is supported, but should not be
       used in new projects. Please see <a href="sd-device.3.html">sd-device(3)</a> for an equivalent
       replacement with a more modern API.

       All functions require a libudev context to operate. This context
       can be created via <a href="udev_new.3.html">udev_new(3)</a>. It is used to track library state
       and link objects together. No global state is used by libudev,
       everything is always linked to a udev context.

       All functions listed here are thread-agnostic and only a single
       specific thread may operate on a given object during its entire
       lifetime. It's safe to allocate multiple independent objects and
       use each from a specific thread in parallel. However, it's not
       safe to allocate such an object in one thread, and operate or
       free it from any other, even if locking is used to ensure these
       threads don't operate on it at the very same time.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.

       To introspect a local device on a system, a udev device object
       can be created via <a href="udev_device_new_from_syspath.3.html">udev_device_new_from_syspath(3)</a> and friends.
       The device object allows one to query current state, read and
       write attributes and lookup properties of the device in question.

       To enumerate local devices on the system, an enumeration object
       can be created via <a href="udev_enumerate_new.3.html">udev_enumerate_new(3)</a>.

       To monitor the local system for hotplugged or unplugged devices,
       a monitor can be created via <a href="udev_monitor_new_from_netlink.3.html">udev_monitor_new_from_netlink(3)</a>.

       Whenever libudev returns a list of objects, the
       <a href="udev_list_entry.3.html">udev_list_entry(3)</a> API should be used to iterate, access and
       modify those lists.

       Furthermore, libudev also exports legacy APIs that should not be
       used by new software (and as such are not documented as part of
       this manual). This includes the hardware database known as
       <b>udev_hwdb </b>(please use the new <a href="sd-hwdb.3.html">sd-hwdb(3)</a> API instead) and the
       <b>udev_queue </b>object to query the udev daemon (which should not be
       used by new software at all).
