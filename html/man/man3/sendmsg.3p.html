NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sendmsg — send a message on a socket using a message structure
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       ssize_t sendmsg(int <i>socket</i>, const struct msghdr *<i>message</i>, int <i>flags</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sendmsg</i>() function shall send a message through a connection-
       mode or connectionless-mode socket. If the socket is a
       connectionless-mode socket, the message shall be sent to the
       address specified by <b>msghdr </b>if no pre-specified peer address has
       been set. If a peer address has been pre-specified, either the
       message shall be sent to the address specified in <b>msghdr</b>
       (overriding the pre-specified peer address), or the function
       shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EISCONN]</b>.  If the socket is
       connection-mode, the destination address in <b>msghdr </b>shall be
       ignored.

       The <i>sendmsg</i>() function takes the following arguments:

       <i>socket</i>      Specifies the socket file descriptor.

       <i>message</i>     Points to a <b>msghdr </b>structure, containing both the
                   destination address and the buffers for the outgoing
                   message. The length and format of the address depend
                   on the address family of the socket. The <i>msg_flags</i>
                   member is ignored.

       <i>flags</i>       Specifies the type of message transmission. The
                   application may specify 0 or the following flag:

                   MSG_EOR       Terminates a record (if supported by
                                 the protocol).

                   MSG_OOB       Sends out-of-band data on sockets that
                                 support out-of-bound data. The
                                 significance and semantics of out-of-
                                 band data are protocol-specific.

                   MSG_NOSIGNAL  Requests not to send the SIGPIPE signal
                                 if an attempt to send is made on a
                                 stream-oriented socket that is no
                                 longer connected. The <b>[EPIPE] </b>error
                                 shall still be returned.

       The <i>msg_iov</i> and <i>msg_iovlen</i> fields of <i>message</i> specify zero or more
       buffers containing the data to be sent.  <i>msg_iov</i> points to an
       array of <b>iovec </b>structures; <i>msg_iovlen</i> shall be set to the
       dimension of this array. In each <b>iovec </b>structure, the <i>iov_base</i>
       field specifies a storage area and the <i>iov_len</i> field gives its
       size in bytes. Some of these sizes can be zero. The data from
       each storage area indicated by <i>msg_iov</i> is sent in turn.

       Successful completion of a call to <i>sendmsg</i>() does not guarantee
       delivery of the message. A return value of -1 indicates only
       locally-detected errors.

       If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the
       message to be transmitted and the socket file descriptor does not
       have O_NONBLOCK set, the <i>sendmsg</i>() function shall block until
       space is available. If space is not available at the sending
       socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file
       descriptor does have O_NONBLOCK set, the <i>sendmsg</i>() function shall
       fail.

       If the socket protocol supports broadcast and the specified
       address is a broadcast address for the socket protocol, <i>sendmsg</i>()
       shall fail if the SO_BROADCAST option is not set for the socket.

       The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate
       privileges to use the <i>sendmsg</i>() function.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>sendmsg</i>() shall return the number of
       bytes sent. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sendmsg</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and the
              requested operation would block.

       <b>EAFNOSUPPORT</b>
              Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used
              with this socket.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>socket</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal interrupted <i>sendmsg</i>() before any data was
              transmitted.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The sum of the <i>iov_len</i> values overflows an <b>ssize_t</b>.

       <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              The message is too large to be sent all at once (as the
              socket requires), or the <i>msg_iovlen</i> member of the <b>msghdr</b>
              structure pointed to by <i>message</i> is less than or equal to 0
              or is greater than {IOV_MAX}.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              The socket is connection-mode but is not connected.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <i>socket</i> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The <i>socket</i> argument is associated with a socket that does
              not support one or more of the values set in <i>flags</i>.

       <b>EPIPE  </b>The socket is shut down for writing, or the socket is
              connection-mode and is no longer connected. In the latter
              case, and if the socket is of type SOCK_STREAM or
              SOCK_SEQPACKET and the MSG_NOSIGNAL flag is not set, the
              SIGPIPE signal is generated to the calling thread.

       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <i>sendmsg</i>()
       shall fail if:

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
              file system.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the pathname in the socket address.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of the pathname does not name an existing file
              or the path name is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix of the pathname in the
              socket address names an existing file that is neither a
              directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the
              pathname in the socket address contains at least one
              non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends with one or more trailing
              &lt;slash&gt; characters and the last pathname component names
              an existing file that is neither a directory nor a
              symbolic link to a directory.

       The <i>sendmsg</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied for a component of the path
              prefix; or write access to the named socket is denied.

       <b>EDESTADDRREQ</b>
              The socket is not connection-mode and does not have its
              peer address set, and no destination address was
              specified.

       <b>EHOSTUNREACH</b>
              The destination host cannot be reached (probably because
              the host is down or a remote router cannot reach it).

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
              file system.

       <b>EISCONN</b>
              A destination address was specified and the socket is
              already connected.

       <b>ENETDOWN</b>
              The local network interface used to reach the destination
              is down.

       <b>ENETUNREACH</b>
              No route to the network is present.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to
              perform the operation.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.

       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <i>sendmsg</i>()
       may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the pathname in the socket address.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.
