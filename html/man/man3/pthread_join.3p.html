NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_join — wait for thread termination
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_join(pthread_t <i>thread</i>, void **<i>value_ptr</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_join</i>() function shall suspend execution of the
       calling thread until the target <i>thread</i> terminates, unless the
       target <i>thread</i> has already terminated. On return from a successful
       <i>pthread_join</i>() call with a non-NULL <i>value_ptr</i> argument, the value
       passed to <i>pthread_exit</i>() by the terminating thread shall be made
       available in the location referenced by <i>value_ptr</i>.  When a
       <i>pthread_join</i>() returns successfully, the target thread has been
       terminated. The results of multiple simultaneous calls to
       <i>pthread_join</i>() specifying the same target thread are undefined.
       If the thread calling <i>pthread_join</i>() is canceled, then the target
       thread shall not be detached.

       It is unspecified whether a thread that has exited but remains
       unjoined counts against {PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX}.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>thread</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_join</i>() does not refer to a joinable thread.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>thread</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_join</i>() refers to the calling thread.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_join</i>() function shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_join</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock was detected.

       The <i>pthread_join</i>() function shall not return an error code of
       <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       An example of thread creation and deletion follows:

           typedef struct {
               int *ar;
               long n;
           } subarray;

           void *
           incer(void *arg)
           {
               long i;

               for (i = 0; i &lt; ((subarray *)arg)-&gt;n; i++)
                   ((subarray *)arg)-&gt;ar[i]++;
           }

           int main(void)
           {
               int        ar[1000000];
               pthread_t  th1, th2;
               subarray   sb1, sb2;

               sb1.ar = &amp;ar[0];
               sb1.n  = 500000;
               (void) pthread_create(&amp;th1, NULL, incer, &amp;sb1);

               sb2.ar = &amp;ar[500000];
               sb2.n  = 500000;
               (void) pthread_create(&amp;th2, NULL, incer, &amp;sb2);

               (void) pthread_join(th1, NULL);
               (void) pthread_join(th2, NULL);
               return 0;
           }

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_join</i>() function is a convenience that has proven
       useful in multi-threaded applications. It is true that a
       programmer could simulate this function if it were not provided
       by passing extra state as part of the argument to the
       <i>start_routine</i>().  The terminating thread would set a flag to
       indicate termination and broadcast a condition that is part of
       that state; a joining thread would wait on that condition
       variable. While such a technique would allow a thread to wait on
       more complex conditions (for example, waiting for multiple
       threads to terminate), waiting on individual thread termination
       is considered widely useful. Also, including the <i>pthread_join</i>()
       function in no way precludes a programmer from coding such
       complex waits. Thus, while not a primitive, including
       <i>pthread_join</i>() in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 was considered
       valuable.

       The <i>pthread_join</i>() function provides a simple mechanism allowing
       an application to wait for a thread to terminate. After the
       thread terminates, the application may then choose to clean up
       resources that were used by the thread. For instance, after
       <i>pthread_join</i>() returns, any application-provided stack storage
       could be reclaimed.

       The <i>pthread_join</i>() or <i>pthread_detach</i>() function should eventually
       be called for every thread that is created with the <i>detachstate</i>
       attribute set to PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE so that storage
       associated with the thread may be reclaimed.

       The interaction between <i>pthread_join</i>() and cancellation is well-
       defined for the following reasons:

        *  The <i>pthread_join</i>() function, like all other non-async-cancel-
           safe functions, can only be called with deferred
           cancelability type.

        *  Cancellation cannot occur in the disabled cancelability
           state.

       Thus, only the default cancelability state need be considered. As
       specified, either the <i>pthread_join</i>() call is canceled, or it
       succeeds, but not both. The difference is obvious to the
       application, since either a cancellation handler is run or
       <i>pthread_join</i>() returns. There are no race conditions since
       <i>pthread_join</i>() was called in the deferred cancelability state.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>thread</i> argument to <i>pthread_join</i>() does not refer to a joinable
       thread, it is recommended that the function should fail and
       report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>thread</i> argument to <i>pthread_join</i>() refers to the calling thread,
       it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
       <b>[EDEADLK] </b>error.

       If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of
       its lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and
       report an <b>[ESRCH] </b>error.
