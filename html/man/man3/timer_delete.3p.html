PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       timer_delete — delete a per-process timer
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       int timer_delete(timer_t <i>timerid</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>timer_delete</i>() function deletes the specified timer, <i>timerid</i>,
       previously created by the <i>timer_create</i>() function. If the timer
       is armed when <i>timer_delete</i>() is called, the behavior shall be as
       if the timer is automatically disarmed before removal. The
       disposition of pending signals for the deleted timer is
       unspecified.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>timerid</i>
       argument to <i>timer_delete</i>() does not correspond to a timer ID
       returned by <i>timer_create</i>() but not yet deleted by <i>timer_delete</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>timer_delete</i>() function shall return a value
       of zero. Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1 and
       set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>timerid</i> argument to <i>timer_delete</i>() does not correspond to a timer
       ID returned by <i>timer_create</i>() but not yet deleted by
       <i>timer_delete</i>(), it is recommended that the function should fail
       and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>

       None.
