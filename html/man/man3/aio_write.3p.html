NAME </h2>
<pre>
       aio_write — asynchronous write to a file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;aio.h&gt;

       int aio_write(struct aiocb *<i>aiocbp</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_write</i>() function shall write <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> to the
       file associated with <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i> from the buffer pointed
       to by <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_buf</i>. The function shall return when the write
       request has been initiated or, at a minimum, queued to the file
       or device.

       If prioritized I/O is supported for this file, then the
       asynchronous operation shall be submitted at a priority equal to
       a base scheduling priority minus <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_reqprio</i>. If Thread
       Execution Scheduling is not supported, then the base scheduling
       priority is that of the calling process;
       otherwise, the base scheduling priority is that of the calling
       thread.

       The <i>aiocbp</i> argument may be used as an argument to <i>aio_error</i>() and
       <i>aio_return</i>() in order to determine the error status and return
       status, respectively, of the asynchronous operation while it is
       proceeding.

       The <i>aiocbp</i> argument points to an <b>aiocb </b>structure. If the buffer
       pointed to by <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_buf</i> or the control block pointed to by
       <i>aiocbp</i> becomes an illegal address prior to asynchronous I/O
       completion, then the behavior is undefined.

       If O_APPEND is not set for the file descriptor <i>aio_fildes</i>, then
       the requested operation shall take place at the absolute position
       in the file as given by <i>aio_offset</i>, as if <i>lseek</i>() were called
       immediately prior to the operation with an <i>offset</i> equal to
       <i>aio_offset</i> and a <i>whence</i> equal to SEEK_SET.  If O_APPEND is set
       for the file descriptor, or if <i>aio_fildes</i> is associated with a
       device that is incapable of seeking, write operations append to
       the file in the same order as the calls were made, except under
       circumstances described in <i>Section 2.8.2</i>, <i>Asynchronous I/O</i>.
       After a successful call to enqueue an asynchronous I/O operation,
       the value of the file offset for the file is unspecified.

       The <i>aio_sigevent</i> member specifies the notification which occurs
       when the request is completed.

       The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_lio_opcode</i> field shall be ignored by <i>aio_write</i>().

       Simultaneous asynchronous operations using the same <i>aiocbp</i>
       produce undefined results.

       If synchronized I/O is enabled on the file associated with
       <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>, the behavior of this function shall be
       according to the definitions of synchronized I/O data integrity
       completion, and synchronized I/O file integrity completion.

       For any system action that changes the process memory space while
       an asynchronous I/O is outstanding to the address range being
       changed, the result of that action is undefined.

       For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset
       maximum established in the open file description associated with
       <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_write</i>() function shall return the value zero if the I/O
       operation is successfully queued; otherwise, the function shall
       return the value -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_write</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The requested asynchronous I/O operation was not queued
              due to system resource limitations.

       Each of the following conditions may be detected synchronously at
       the time of the call to <i>aio_write</i>(), or asynchronously. If any of
       the conditions below are detected synchronously, the <i>aio_write</i>()
       function shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the corresponding
       value. If any of the conditions below are detected
       asynchronously, the return status of the asynchronous operation
       shall be set to -1, and the error status of the asynchronous
       operation is set to the corresponding value.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i> argument is not a valid file
              descriptor open for writing.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The file offset value implied by <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> would
              be invalid,
              <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_reqprio</i> is not a valid value, or
              <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> is an invalid value.

       In the case that the <i>aio_write</i>() successfully queues the I/O
       operation, the return status of the asynchronous operation shall
       be one of the values normally returned by the <i>write</i>() function
       call. If the operation is successfully queued but is subsequently
       canceled or encounters an error, the error status for the
       asynchronous operation contains one of the values normally set by
       the <i>write</i>() function call, or one of the following:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i> argument is not a valid file
              descriptor open for writing.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The file offset value implied by <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> would
              be invalid.

       <b>ECANCELED</b>
              The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O completed
              due to an explicit <i>aio_cancel</i>() request.

       The following condition may be detected synchronously or
       asynchronously:

       <b>EFBIG  </b>The file is a regular file, <i>aiobcp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> is greater
              than 0, and the starting offset in <i>aiobcp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> is
              at or beyond the offset maximum in the open file
              description associated with <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.
