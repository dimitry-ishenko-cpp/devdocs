PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       seekdir — set the position of a directory stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;

       void seekdir(DIR *<i>dirp</i>, long <i>loc</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>seekdir</i>() function shall set the position of the next
       <i>readdir</i>() operation on the directory stream specified by <i>dirp</i> to
       the position specified by <i>loc</i>.  The value of <i>loc</i> should have been
       returned from an earlier call to <i>telldir</i>() using the same
       directory stream. The new position reverts to the one associated
       with the directory stream when <i>telldir</i>() was performed.

       If the value of <i>loc</i> was not obtained from an earlier call to
       <i>telldir</i>(), or if a call to <i>rewinddir</i>() occurred between the call
       to <i>telldir</i>() and the call to <i>seekdir</i>(), the results of subsequent
       calls to <i>readdir</i>() are unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>seekdir</i>() function shall not return a value.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The original standard developers perceived that there were
       restrictions on the use of the <i>seekdir</i>() and <i>telldir</i>() functions
       related to implementation details, and for that reason these
       functions need not be supported on all POSIX-conforming systems.
       They are required on implementations supporting the XSI option.

       One of the perceived problems of implementation is that returning
       to a given point in a directory is quite difficult to describe
       formally, in spite of its intuitive appeal, when systems that use
       B-trees, hashing functions, or other similar mechanisms to order
       their directories are considered. The definition of <i>seekdir</i>() and
       <i>telldir</i>() does not specify whether, when using these interfaces,
       a given directory entry will be seen at all, or more than once.

       On systems not supporting these functions, their capability can
       sometimes be accomplished by saving a filename found by <i>readdir</i>()
       and later using <i>rewinddir</i>() and a loop on <i>readdir</i>() to relocate
       the position from which the filename was saved.
