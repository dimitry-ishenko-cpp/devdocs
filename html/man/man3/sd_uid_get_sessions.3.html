</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_uid_get_state() </b>may be used to determine the login state of a
       specific Unix user identifier. The following states are currently
       known: "offline" (user not logged in at all), "lingering" (user
       not logged in, but some user services running), "online" (user
       logged in, but not active, i.e. has no session in the
       foreground), "active" (user logged in, and has at least one
       active session, i.e. one session in the foreground), "closing"
       (user not logged in, and not lingering, but some processes are
       still around). In the future additional states might be defined,
       client code should be written to be robust in regards to
       additional state strings being returned. The returned string
       needs to be freed with the libc <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a> call after use.

       <b>sd_uid_is_on_seat() </b>may be used to determine whether a specific
       user is logged in or active on a specific seat. Accepts a Unix
       user identifier and a seat identifier string as parameters. The
       <i>require_active</i> parameter is a boolean value. If non-zero (true),
       this function will test if the user is active (i.e. has a session
       that is in the foreground and accepting user input) on the
       specified seat, otherwise (false) only if the user is logged in
       (and possibly inactive) on the specified seat.

       <b>sd_uid_get_sessions() </b>may be used to determine the current
       sessions of the specified user. Accepts a Unix user identifier as
       parameter. The <i>require_active</i> parameter controls whether the
       returned list shall consist of only those sessions where the user
       is currently active (&gt; 0), where the user is currently online but
       possibly inactive (= 0), or logged in but possibly closing the
       session (&lt; 0). The call returns a <b>NULL </b>terminated string array of
       session identifiers in <i>sessions</i> which needs to be freed by the
       caller with the libc <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a> call after use, including all the
       strings referenced. If the string array parameter is passed as
       <b>NULL</b>, the array will not be filled in, but the return code still
       indicates the number of current sessions. Note that instead of an
       empty array <b>NULL </b>may be returned and should be considered
       equivalent to an empty array.

       Similarly, <b>sd_uid_get_seats() </b>may be used to determine the list
       of seats on which the user currently has sessions. Similar
       semantics apply, however note that the user may have multiple
       sessions on the same seat as well as sessions with no attached
       seat and hence the number of entries in the returned array may
       differ from the one returned by <b>sd_uid_get_sessions()</b>.

       <b>sd_uid_get_display() </b>returns the name of the "primary" session of
       a user. If the user has graphical sessions, it will be the oldest
       graphical session. Otherwise, it will be the oldest open session.

       <b>sd_uid_get_login_time() </b>may be used to determine the time the
       user's service manager has been invoked, which is the time when
       the user's first active session, since which they stayed logged
       in continuously, began. The <i>usec</i> is in microseconds since the
       epoch (<b>CLOCK_REALTIME</b>). This call will fail with <b>-ENXIO </b>if the
       user is not currently logged in.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>sd_uid_get_state() </b>and <b>sd_uid_get_login_time()</b>
       returns 0 or a positive integer. If the test succeeds,
       <b>sd_uid_is_on_seat() </b>returns a positive integer; if it fails, 0.
       <b>sd_uid_get_sessions() </b>and <b>sd_uid_get_seats() </b>return the number of
       entries in the returned arrays.  <b>sd_uid_get_display() </b>returns a
       non-negative code on success. On failure, these calls return a
       negative errno-style error code.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-ENODATA</b>
           The given field is not specified for the described user.

       <b>-ENXIO</b>
           The specified seat is unknown.

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
           An input parameter was invalid (out of range, or <b>NULL</b>, where
           that is not accepted). This is also returned if the passed
           user ID is <b>0xFFFF </b>or <b>0xFFFFFFFF</b>, which are undefined on
           Linux.

       <b>-ENOMEM</b>
           Memory allocation failed.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
