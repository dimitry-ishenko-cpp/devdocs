PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_setschedprio — dynamic thread scheduling parameters
       access (<b>REALTIME THREADS</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_setschedprio(pthread_t <i>thread</i>, int <i>prio</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_setschedprio</i>() function shall set the scheduling
       priority for the thread whose thread ID is given by <i>thread</i> to the
       value given by <i>prio</i>.  See <i>Scheduling Policies</i> for a description
       on how this function call affects the ordering of the thread in
       the thread list for its new priority.

       If the <i>pthread_setschedprio</i>() function fails, the scheduling
       priority of the target thread shall not be changed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_setschedprio</i>() function shall return
       zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
       the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_setschedprio</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>prio</i> is invalid for the scheduling policy of
              the specified thread.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have appropriate privileges to set the
              scheduling priority of the specified thread.

       The <i>pthread_setschedprio</i>() function shall not return an error
       code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_setschedprio</i>() function provides a way for an
       application to temporarily raise its priority and then lower it
       again, without having the undesired side-effect of yielding to
       other threads of the same priority. This is necessary if the
       application is to implement its own strategies for bounding
       priority inversion, such as priority inheritance or priority
       ceilings. This capability is especially important if the
       implementation does not support the Thread Priority Protection or
       Thread Priority Inheritance options, but even if those options
       are supported it is needed if the application is to bound
       priority inheritance for other resources, such as semaphores.

       The standard developers considered that while it might be
       preferable conceptually to solve this problem by modifying the
       specification of <i>pthread_setschedparam</i>(), it was too late to make
       such a change, as there may be implementations that would need to
       be changed. Therefore, this new function was introduced.

       If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of
       its lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and
       report an <b>[ESRCH] </b>error.
