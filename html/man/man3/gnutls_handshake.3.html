NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gnutls_handshake - API function
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int gnutls_handshake(gnutls_session_t </b><i>session</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a <b>gnutls_session_t </b>type.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This function performs the handshake of the TLS/SSL protocol, and
       initializes the TLS session parameters.

       The non-fatal errors expected by this function are:
       <b>GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED</b>, <b>GNUTLS_E_AGAIN</b>,
       <b>GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED</b>. When this function is called for
       re-handshake under TLS 1.2 or earlier, the non-fatal error code
       <b>GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA </b>may also be returned.

       The former two interrupt the handshake procedure due to the
       transport layer being interrupted, and the latter because of a
       "warning" alert that was sent by the peer (it is always a good
       idea to check any received alerts). On these non-fatal errors
       call this function again, until it returns 0; cf.
       <b>gnutls_record_get_direction() </b>and <b>gnutls_error_is_fatal()</b>. In
       DTLS sessions the non-fatal error <b>GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET </b>is also
       possible, and indicates that the MTU should be adjusted.

       When this function is called by a server after a rehandshake
       request under TLS 1.2 or earlier the
       <b>GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA </b>error code indicates that some data
       were pending prior to peer initiating the handshake.  Under TLS
       1.3 this function when called after a successful handshake, is a
       no-op and always succeeds in server side; in client side this
       function is equivalent to <b>gnutls_session_key_update() </b>with
       <b>GNUTLS_KU_PEER </b>flag.

       This function handles both full and abbreviated TLS handshakes
       (resumption).  For abbreviated handshakes, in client side, the
       <b>gnutls_session_set_data() </b>should be called prior to this function
       to set parameters from a previous session.  In server side,
       resumption is handled by either setting a DB back-end, or setting
       up keys for session tickets.

RETURNS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS </b>on a successful handshake, otherwise a negative
       error code.
