<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_trace_clear — clear trace stream and trace log (<b>TRACING</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;trace.h&gt;

       int posix_trace_clear(trace_id_t <i>trid</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() function shall reinitialize the trace
       stream identified by the argument <i>trid</i> as if it were returning
       from the <i>posix_trace_create</i>() function, except that the same
       allocated resources shall be reused, the mapping of trace event
       type identifiers to trace event names shall be unchanged, and the
       trace stream status shall remain unchanged (that is, if it was
       running, it remains running and if it was suspended, it remains
       suspended).

       All trace events in the trace stream recorded before the call to
       <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() shall be lost. The <i>posix_stream_full_status</i>
       status shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL.  There is no
       guarantee that all trace events that occurred during the
       <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() call are recorded; the behavior with respect
       to trace points that may occur during this call is unspecified.

       If the Trace Log option is supported and the trace stream has
       been created with a log, the <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() function shall
       reinitialize the trace stream with the same behavior as if the
       trace stream was created without the log, plus it shall
       reinitialize the trace log associated with the trace stream
       identified by the argument <i>trid</i> as if it were returning from the
       <i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>() function, except that the same
       allocated resources, for the trace log, may be reused and the
       associated trace stream status remains unchanged.  The first
       trace event recorded in the trace log after the call to
       <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() shall be the same as the first trace event
       recorded in the active trace stream after the call to
       <i>posix_trace_clear</i>().  The <i>posix_log_full_status</i> status shall be
       set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL. There is no guarantee that all trace
       events that occurred during the <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() call are
       recorded in the trace log; the behavior with respect to trace
       points that may occur during this call is unspecified. If the log
       full policy is POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the effect of a call to this
       function is unspecified for the trace log associated with the
       trace stream identified by the <i>trid</i> argument.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() function
       shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, it shall return the
       corresponding error number.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_clear</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>trid</i> argument does not correspond to an
              active trace stream.
