PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock — lock a read-write lock for writing
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       int pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *restrict <i>rwlock</i>,
           const struct timespec *restrict <i>abstime</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</i>() function shall apply a write
       lock to the read-write lock referenced by <i>rwlock</i> as in the
       <i>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</i>() function. However, if the lock cannot be
       acquired without waiting for other threads to unlock the lock,
       this wait shall be terminated when the specified timeout expires.
       The timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by
       <i>abstime</i> passes, as measured by the clock on which timeouts are
       based (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds
       <i>abstime</i>), or if the absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i> has
       already been passed at the time of the call.

       The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.  The
       resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of the
       CLOCK_REALTIME clock. The <b>timespec </b>data type is defined in the
       <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i> header. Under no circumstances shall the function fail
       with a timeout if the lock can be acquired immediately. The
       validity of the <i>abstime</i> parameter need not be checked if the lock
       can be immediately acquired.

       If a signal that causes a signal handler to be executed is
       delivered to a thread blocked on a read-write lock via a call to
       <i>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</i>(), upon return from the signal handler
       the thread shall resume waiting for the lock as if it was not
       interrupted.

       The calling thread may deadlock if at the time the call is made
       it holds the read-write lock. The results are undefined if this
       function is called with an uninitialized read-write lock.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</i>() function shall return zero if
       the lock for writing on the read-write lock object referenced by
       <i>rwlock</i> is acquired. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned
       to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The lock could not be acquired before the specified
              timeout expired.

       The <i>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock condition was detected or the calling thread
              already holds the <i>rwlock</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>abstime</i> nanosecond value is less than zero or greater
              than or equal to 1000 million.

       This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications using this function may be subject to priority
       inversion, as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.291</i>, <i>Priority Inversion</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>rwlock</i> argument to <i>pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock</i>() does not refer to
       an initialized read-write lock object, it is recommended that the
       function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
