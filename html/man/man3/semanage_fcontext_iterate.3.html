NAME </h2>
<pre>
       semanage_iterate - SELinux Management API
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       The following iterate function is supported for any semanage
       record.
       Replace the function and object name as necessary.

       <b>extern int ITERATE_FUNCTION (</b>
            <b>semanage_handle_t *</b><i>handle</i><b>,</b>
            <b>int (*handler) (</b>
                          <b>const semanage_OBJECT_t *</b><i>object</i><b>,</b>
                          <b>void *</b><i>varg</i><b>),</b>
            <b>void *</b><i>handler_arg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Behavior:</b>
              The iterate function will execute the specified handler
              over all objects in the selected location. An arbitrary
              argument can be passed into the handler function along
              with each object.

              The object passed in is property of the libsemanage
              library, and may not be modified or preserved - use
              <b>semanage_OBJECT_clone </b>if that is necessary.

              The handler code may not invoke any semanage write
              requests for the same object type (i.e. modifying the
              underlying store is not allowed). The iterate function is
              reentrant only while inside a transaction (see
              <b>semanage_begin_transaction </b>). It is not safe to execute
              other semanage read or write requests within iterate if
              not inside a transaction. The handler may return -1 to
              signal error exit, 0 to signal continue, and 1 to signal
              successful exit early (the iterate function will stop
              accordingly).

       <b>Parameters:</b>
              The <i>handle</i> is used to track persistent state across
              semanage calls, and for error reporting. The <i>handler</i> is
              the function to execute, with <i>handler_arg</i> as its second
              parameter, and each object as its first parameter.

       <b>Requirements:</b>
              This function requires an semanage connection to be
              established (see <b>semanage_connect</b>(3) )
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       In case of failure, -1 is returned, and the semanage error
       callback is invoked, describing the error.  Otherwise a non-
       negative integer is returned (a commit number). The same number
       will be returned by all other semanage object read calls until
       the next commit.
