NAME </h2>
<pre>
       seccomp_version - Query the libseccomp version information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;seccomp.h&gt;</b>

       <b>struct scmp_version {</b>
            <b>unsigned int major;</b>
            <b>unsigned int minor;</b>
            <b>unsigned int micro;</b>
       <b>}</b>

       <b>const struct scmp_version *seccomp_version(</b><i>void</i><b>);</b>

       Link with <i>-lseccomp</i>.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>seccomp_version</b>() and <b>seccomp_reset</b>() functions return a
       pointer to a <b>scmp_version </b>struct which contains the version
       information of the currently loaded libseccomp library.  This
       function can be used by applications that need to verify that
       they are linked to a specific libseccomp version at runtime.

       The caller should not attempt to free the returned <b>scmp_version</b>
       struct when finished.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>seccomp_version</b>() function returns a pointer to a
       <b>scmp_version </b>structure on success, NULL on failure.  The caller
       should not attempt to free the returned structure.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;seccomp.h&gt;

       int main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
            const struct scmp_version *ver;

            ver = seccomp_version();
            if (ver == NULL)
                 goto err;

            /* ... */

            return 0;

       err:
            return 1;
       }
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       While the seccomp filter can be generated independent of the
       kernel, kernel support is required to load and enforce the
       seccomp filter generated by libseccomp.

       The libseccomp project site, with more information and the source
       code repository, can be found at
       <a href="https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp">https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp</a>.  This tool, as well as the
       libseccomp library, is currently under development, please report
       any bugs at the project site or directly to the author.
