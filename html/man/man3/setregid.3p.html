PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       setregid — set real and effective group IDs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int setregid(gid_t <i>rgid</i>, gid_t <i>egid</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setregid</i>() function shall set the real and effective group
       IDs of the calling process.

       If <i>rgid</i> is -1, the real group ID shall not be changed; if <i>egid</i> is
       -1, the effective group ID shall not be changed.

       The real and effective group IDs may be set to different values
       in the same call.

       Only a process with appropriate privileges can set the real group
       ID and the effective group ID to any valid value.

       A non-privileged process can set either the real group ID to the
       saved set-group-ID from one of the <i>exec</i> family of functions, or
       the effective group ID to the saved set-group-ID or the real
       group ID.

       If the real group ID is being set (<i>rgid</i> is not -1), or the
       effective group ID is being set to a value not equal to the real
       group ID, then the saved set-group-ID of the current process
       shall be set equal to the new effective group ID.

       Any supplementary group IDs of the calling process remain
       unchanged.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error, and
       neither of the group IDs are changed.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setregid</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>rgid</i> or <i>egid</i> argument is invalid or out-
              of-range.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The process does not have appropriate privileges and a
              change other than changing the real group ID to the saved
              set-group-ID, or changing the effective group ID to the
              real group ID or the saved set-group-ID, was requested.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If a non-privileged set-group-ID process sets its effective group
       ID to its real group ID, it can only set its effective group ID
       back to the previous value if <i>rgid</i> was -1 in the <i>setregid</i>() call,
       since the saved-group-ID is not changed in that case. If <i>rgid</i> was
       equal to the real group ID in the <i>setregid</i>() call, then the saved
       set-group-ID will also have been changed to the real user ID.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Earlier versions of this standard did not specify whether the
       saved set-group-ID was affected by <i>setregid</i>() calls. This version
       specifies common existing practice that constitutes an important
       security feature. The ability to set both the effective group ID
       and saved set-group-ID to be the same as the real group ID means
       that any security weakness in code that is executed after that
       point cannot result in malicious code being executed with the
       previous effective group ID. Privileged applications could
       already do this using just <i>setgid</i>(), but for non-privileged
       applications the only standard method available is to use this
       feature of <i>setregid</i>().
