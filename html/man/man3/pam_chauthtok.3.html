NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_chauthtok - updating authentication tokens
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pam_chauthtok(pam_handle_t *</b><i>pamh</i><b>, int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pam_chauthtok </b>function is used to change the authentication
       token for a given user (as indicated by the state associated with
       the handle <i>pamh</i>).

       The <i>pamh</i> argument is an authentication handle obtained by a prior
       call to pam_start(). The flags argument is the binary or of zero
       or more of the following values:

       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.

       PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK
           This argument indicates to the modules that the user's
           authentication token (password) should only be changed if it
           has expired. If this argument is not passed, the application
           requires that all authentication tokens are to be changed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_AUTHTOK_ERR
           A module was unable to obtain the new authentication token.

       PAM_AUTHTOK_RECOVERY_ERR
           A module was unable to obtain the old authentication token.

       PAM_AUTHTOK_LOCK_BUSY
           One or more of the modules was unable to change the
           authentication token since it is currently locked.

       PAM_AUTHTOK_DISABLE_AGING
           Authentication token aging has been disabled for at least one
           of the modules.

       PAM_PERM_DENIED
           Permission denied.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           The authentication token was successfully updated.

       PAM_TRY_AGAIN
           Not all of the modules were in a position to update the
           authentication token(s). In such a case none of the user's
           authentication tokens are updated.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           User unknown to password service.
