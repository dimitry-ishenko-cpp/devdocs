CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The input instance domain is passed in as either a physical
       metadata record via <i>rbuf</i> or in the ``loaded'' format identified
       by <i>lidp</i>.  As these are alternate formats for the input instance
       domain, <b>pmaTryDeltaInDom </b>demands that <b>exactly </b>one of <i>rbuf</i> and
       <i>lidp</i> must be <b>NULL</b>, else the return value is -2.

       The input instance domain is on the path to being written to the
       archive identified by <i>lcp</i>.

       If possible, the instance domain will be converted to the ``delta
       indom'' format, and the converted instance domain returned via
       <i>rbuf</i> or <i>lidp</i> (whichever is not <b>NULL</b>).  If conversion takes place,
       any storage associated with the input instance domain will have
       been free'd.

       The ``delta indom'' format is only supported for Version 3
       archives and it is the caller's responsibility to determine if
       calling <b>pmaTryDeltaInDom </b>is appropriate.

       To determine if the ``delta indom'' format is the most efficient
       encoding, <b>pmaTryDeltaInDom </b>maintains a per-instance domain cache
       of the last seen ``full'' instance domain.  To avoid data
       corruption, this means <b>pmaTryDeltaInDom </b>first copies the input
       instance domain.  The copy and the cache are all managed
       privately by <b>pmaTryDeltaInDom </b>so the caller is unaware of this
       activity.

       The caching scheme requires that the caller must call
       <b>pmaTryDeltaInDom </b>for <b>every </b>instance domain record, independent of
       whether the ``delta indom'' format is likely to be appropriate.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS AND RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       In several places, fatal errors will trigger an error message and
       force the application to exit.

       A return value of -1 indicates that <i>rbuf</i> was not <b>NULL </b>and the
       physical record therein was not a <b>TYPE_INDOM </b>(Version 3 ``full''
       instance domain) record as expected.  A return value of 1 means
       <i>rbuf</i> or <i>lidp</i> has been rewritten, and is now a <b>TYPE_INDOM_DELTA</b>
       record.  Otherwise the return value is 0.
