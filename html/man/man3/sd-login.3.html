NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sd-login - APIs for tracking logins
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;systemd/sd-login.h&gt;</b>

       <b>pkg-config --cflags --libs libsystemd</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       sd-login.h is part of <a href="libsystemd.3.html">libsystemd(3)</a> and provides APIs to
       introspect and monitor seat, login session, and user status
       information on the local system.

       Note that these APIs only allow purely passive access and
       monitoring of seats, sessions and users. To actively make changes
       to the seat configuration, terminate login sessions, or switch
       session on a seat you need to utilize the D-Bus API of
       systemd-logind, instead.

       These functions synchronously access data in /proc/,
       /sys/fs/cgroup/ and /run/. All of these are virtual file systems,
       hence the runtime cost of the accesses is relatively cheap.

       It is possible (and often a very good choice) to mix calls to the
       synchronous interface of sd-login.h with the asynchronous D-Bus
       interface of systemd-logind. However, if this is done you need to
       think a bit about possible races since the stream of events from
       D-Bus and from sd-login.h interfaces such as the login monitor
       are asynchronous and not ordered against each other.

       If the functions return string arrays, these are generally <b>NULL</b>
       terminated and need to be freed by the caller with the libc
       <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a> call after use, including the strings referenced therein.
       Similarly, individual strings returned need to be freed, as well.

       As a special exception, instead of an empty string array <b>NULL </b>may
       be returned, which should be treated equivalent to an empty
       string array.

DEFINITION OF TERMS </h2>
<pre>
       seat
           A seat consists of all hardware devices assigned to a
           specific workplace. It consists of at least one graphics
           device, and usually also includes keyboard, mouse. It can
           also include video cameras, sound cards and more. Seats are
           identified by seat names, which are strings (&lt;= 255
           characters), that start with the four characters "seat"
           followed by at least one character from the range
           [a-zA-Z0-9], "_" and "-". They are suitable for use as file
           names. Seat names may or may not be stable and may be reused
           if a seat becomes available again.

           Added in version 235.

       session
           A session is defined by the time a user is logged in until
           they log out. A session is bound to one or no seats (the
           latter for 'virtual' ssh logins). Multiple sessions can be
           attached to the same seat, but only one of them can be
           active, the others are in the background. A session is
           identified by a short string.

           <a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> ensures that audit sessions are identical to
           systemd sessions, and uses the audit session ID as session ID
           in systemd (if auditing is enabled). In general the session
           identifier is a short string consisting only of [a-zA-Z0-9],
           "_" and "-", suitable for use as a file name. Session IDs are
           unique on the local machine and are never reused as long as
           the machine is online. A user (the way we know it on UNIX)
           corresponds to the person using a computer. A single user can
           have multiple sessions open at the same time. A user is
           identified by a numeric user id (UID) or a user name (a
           string). A multi-session system allows multiple user sessions
           on the same seat at the same time. A multi-seat system allows
           multiple independent seats that can be individually and
           simultaneously used by different users.

           Added in version 235.

       All hardware devices that are eligible to being assigned to a
       seat, are assigned to one. A device can be assigned to only one
       seat at a time. If a device is not assigned to any particular
       other seat it is implicitly assigned to the special default seat
       called "seat0".

       Note that hardware like printers, hard disks or network cards is
       generally not assigned to a specific seat. They are available to
       all seats equally. (Well, with one exception: USB sticks can be
       assigned to a seat.)

       "seat0" always exists.
</pre> <h2>
UDEV RULES </h2>
<pre>
       Assignment of hardware devices to seats is managed inside the
       udev database, via settings on the devices:

       Tag "seat"
           When set, a device is eligible to be assigned to a seat. This
           tag is set for graphics devices, mice, keyboards, video
           cards, sound cards and more. Note that some devices like
           sound cards consist of multiple subdevices (i.e. a PCM for
           input and another one for output). This tag will be set only
           for the originating device, not for the individual
           subdevices. A UI for configuring assignment of devices to
           seats should enumerate and subscribe to all devices with this
           tag set and show them in the UI. Note that USB hubs can be
           assigned to a seat as well, in which case all (current and
           future) devices plugged into it will also be assigned to the
           same seat (unless they are explicitly assigned to another
           seat).

           Added in version 235.

       Tag "master-of-seat"
           When set, this device is enough for a seat to be considered
           existent. This tag is usually set for the framebuffer device
           of graphics cards. A seat hence consists of an arbitrary
           number of devices marked with the "seat" tag, but (at least)
           one of these devices needs to be tagged with "master-of-seat"
           before the seat is actually considered to be around.

           Added in version 235.

       Property <i>ID_SEAT</i>
           This property specifies the name of the seat a specific
           device is assigned to. If not set the device is assigned to
           "seat0". Also, to speed up enumeration of hardware belonging
           to a specific seat, the seat is also set as tag on the
           device. I.e. if the property <i>ID_SEAT=seat-waldo</i> is set for a
           device, the tag "seat-waldo" will be set as well. Note that
           if a device is assigned to "seat0", it will usually not carry
           such a tag and you need to enumerate all devices and check
           the <i>ID_SEAT</i> property manually. Again, if a device is assigned
           to seat0 this is visible on the device in two ways: with a
           property <i>ID_SEAT=seat0</i> and with no property <i>ID_SEAT</i> set for
           it at all.

           Added in version 235.

       Property <i>ID_AUTOSEAT</i>
           When set to "1", this device automatically generates a new
           and independent seat, which is named after the path of the
           device. This is set for specialized USB hubs like the
           Pluggable devices, which when plugged in should create a
           hotplug seat without further configuration.

           Added in version 235.

       Property <i>ID_FOR_SEAT</i>
           When creating additional (manual) seats starting from a
           graphics device this is a good choice to name the seat after.
           It is created from the path of the device. This is useful in
           UIs for configuring seats: as soon as you create a new seat
           from a graphics device, read this property and prefix it with
           "seat-" and use it as name for the seat.

           Added in version 235.

       A seat exists only and exclusively because a properly tagged
       device with the right <i>ID_SEAT</i> property exists. Besides udev rules
       there is no persistent data about seats stored on disk.

       Note that <a href="../man8/systemd-logind.8.html">systemd-logind(8)</a> manages ACLs on a number of device
       classes, to allow user code to access the device nodes attached
       to a seat as long as the user has an active session on it. This
       is mostly transparent to applications. As mentioned above, for
       certain user software it might be a good idea to watch whether
       they can access device nodes instead of thinking about seats.
