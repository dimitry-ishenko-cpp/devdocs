NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>QmcIndom </b>- container for a instance domain description
</pre> <h2>
C++ SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;QmcIndom.h&gt;</b>

       <b>c++ ... -lpcp_qmc -lpcp</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A <b>QmcIndom </b>object represents a <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> instance domain.  This
       includes a description of all the instances in the instance
       domain.

       A <b>QmcInstance </b>is a structure used to describe each instance in
       the instance domain.  This includes:

          - internal identifier. If this is less than zero, the instance
          is treated as a NULL entry in the instance table.

          - external name

          - reference count, i.e. the number of <b>QmcMetric </b>objects
          referring to this instance.

          - the likely position of the instance in the <b>pmResult </b>from a
          <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a>.  This is also used to indicate the position of the
          next NULL instance in the instance table, if this entry is
          also NULL.

          - a flag indicating if the instance was in the last
          <a href="pmgetindom.3.html">pmGetInDom(3)</a>.

       The <b>QmcIndom </b>object has a list of <b>QmcInstance </b>structures, and
       various flags and counters to support dynamic instance domains
       where instances may come and go with each fetch and efficient
       profile generation.
</pre> <h2>
CONSTRUCTORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>QmcIndom::QmcIndom(int type, QmcDesc &amp;desc);</b>
           Calls <a href="pmgetindom.3.html">pmGetInDom(3)</a> and <a href="pmgetindomarchive.3.html">pmGetInDomArchive(3)</a> for host and
           archive contexts to obtain the entire instance list for the
           instance domain of <i>type</i> and identified in <i>desc</i>.
</pre> <h2>
DYNAMIC INDOMS </h2>
<pre>
       The support of dynamic instance domains for live contexts is
       complex since many metrics may be referencing any of the
       instances in the domain.  Therefore the instance list may be
       sparse as the position of instances in the list must be
       maintained.

       When the instance domain is updated, instances may be removed
       from the list if they are not in the new instance list (as
       returned by <a href="pmgetindom.3.html">pmGetInDom(3)</a>) and is not referenced by any metrics.
       Each instance in the new list is then compared with the old list
       to determine which instances are still active, and any new
       instances need to be added.  An instance is considered the same
       if both the internal and external identifiers are the same.  New
       instances are first inserted into positions of deleted instances
       before being appended to the list.

       This algorithm is expensive (potentially O(N^2)).

       <b>bool changed() const;</b>
           Returns <b>true </b>if the instance domain may have changed in the
           last fetch.

       <b>void newFetch();</b>
           Reset the flags that may have indicated that the instance
           domain had changed.  This is called by <b>QmcContext::fetch</b>.

       <b>void hasChanged();</b>
           Set the flags to indicate that the instance domain may have
           changed.  This is called by <b>QmcMetric::extractValues</b>.

       <b>int update();</b>
           Update the instance domain as described above. On subsequent
           calls, before the next fetch, this method will remove any
           instances that are no longer referenced without updating the
           instance list with a <a href="pmgetindom.3.html">pmGetInDom(3)</a> call.

       <b>uint_t numInsts() const;</b>
           Returns the number of instances that are not NULL.

       <b>uint_t numActiveInsts() const;</b>
           Returns the number of instances that are active according to
           the last <b>QmcIndom::update </b>call.

       <b>uint_t listLen() const;</b>
           Returns the length of the instance list, including NULL
           instances.
</pre> <h2>
PROFILES </h2>
<pre>
       The algorithm for determining the most compact profile uses the
       number of instances (<b>_instances.length()</b>), the number of
       referenced instances (<b>_count</b>), the number of active instances
       (<b>_numActive</b>) and the number of referenced active instances
       (<b>_numActiveRef</b>).

               if (all active instances are referenced
                   or there are no active instances)

                       request all instances implicitly

               else if (the number of referenced instances
                        is less than the number of active
                        instances that are not referenced)

                       delete all instances from profile
                       add all referenced instances

               else

                       add all instances to profile
                       delete all instances that are not referenced

       <b>bool diffProfile() const;</b>
           Returns <b>true </b>if the profile has potentially changed since the
           last call to <b>QmcIndom::genProfile</b>.

       <b>int genProfile();</b>
           Generates a new profile for the instance domain. a <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a>
           error code is returned if the profile failed.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       Error messages are generated using <a href="pmprintf.3.html">pmprintf(3)</a> but are not
       flushed. It is the responsibility of the user to call <a href="pmflush.3.html">pmflush(3)</a>
       to output any messages.

       Additional diagnostics may be activated by adding the options <b>pmc</b>
       and/or <b>indom </b>to the global debugging specification, as described
       in <a href="pmsetdebug.3.html">pmSetDebug(3)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Users have no control over the algorithm used to generate the
       profile. In the case of <i>proc</i> metrics, an implicit profile could
       be generated if all process instances are required, even though
       this will result in no values being returned in the fetch.
