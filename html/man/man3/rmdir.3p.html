NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rmdir — remove a directory
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int rmdir(const char *<i>path</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>rmdir</i>() function shall remove a directory whose name is given
       by <i>path</i>.  The directory shall be removed only if it is an empty
       directory.

       If the directory is the root directory or the current working
       directory of any process, it is unspecified whether the function
       succeeds, or whether it shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EBUSY]</b>.

       If <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, then <i>rmdir</i>() shall fail and set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[ENOTDIR]</b>.

       If the <i>path</i> argument refers to a path whose final component is
       either dot or dot-dot, <i>rmdir</i>() shall fail.

       If the directory's link count becomes 0 and no process has the
       directory open, the space occupied by the directory shall be
       freed and the directory shall no longer be accessible. If one or
       more processes have the directory open when the last link is
       removed, the dot and dot-dot entries, if present, shall be
       removed before <i>rmdir</i>() returns and no new entries may be created
       in the directory, but the directory shall not be removed until
       all references to the directory are closed.

       If the directory is not an empty directory, <i>rmdir</i>() shall fail
       and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EEXIST] </b>or <b>[ENOTEMPTY]</b>.

       Upon successful completion, <i>rmdir</i>() shall mark for update the
       last data modification and last file status change timestamps of
       the parent directory.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the function <i>rmdir</i>() shall return 0.
       Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the
       error. If -1 is returned, the named directory shall not be
       changed.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>rmdir</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix, or write permission is denied on the parent
              directory of the directory to be removed.

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The directory to be removed is currently in use by the
              system or some process and the implementation considers
              this to be an error.

       [EEXIST] or [ENOTEMPTY]
                   The <i>path</i> argument names a directory that is not an
                   empty directory, or there are hard links to the
                   directory other than dot or a single entry in dot-
                   dot.

       <b>EINVAL      </b>The <i>path</i> argument contains a last component that is
                   dot.

       <b>EIO         </b>A physical I/O error has occurred.

       <b>ELOOP       </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
                   resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
                   The length of a component of a pathname is longer
                   than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT      </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file,
                   or the <i>path</i> argument names a nonexistent directory or
                   points to an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR     </b>A component of <i>path</i> names an existing file that is
                   neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a
                   directory.

       [EPERM] or [EACCES]
                   The S_ISVTX flag is set on the directory containing
                   the file referred to by the <i>path</i> argument and the
                   process does not satisfy the criteria specified in
                   the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section</i>
                   <i>4.3</i>, <i>Directory Protection</i>.

       <b>EROFS       </b>The directory entry to be removed resides on a read-
                   only file system.

       The <i>rmdir</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Removing a Directory</b>
       The following example shows how to remove a directory named
       <b>/home/cnd/mod1</b>.

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

           int status;
           ...
           status = rmdir("/home/cnd/mod1");
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>rmdir</i>() and <i>rename</i>() functions originated in 4.2 BSD, and
       they used <b>[ENOTEMPTY] </b>for the condition when the directory to be
       removed does not exist or <i>new</i> already exists. When the 1984
       /usr/group standard was published, it contained <b>[EEXIST] </b>instead.
       When these functions were adopted into System V, the 1984
       /usr/group standard was used as a reference. Therefore, several
       existing applications and implementations support/use both forms,
       and no agreement could be reached on either value. All
       implementations are required to supply both <b>[EEXIST] </b>and
       <b>[ENOTEMPTY] </b>in <i>&lt;errno.h&gt;</i> with distinct values, so that
       applications can use both values in C-language <b>case </b>statements.

       The meaning of deleting <i>pathname</i><b>/dot </b>is unclear, because the name
       of the file (directory) in the parent directory to be removed is
       not clear, particularly in the presence of multiple links to a
       directory.

       The POSIX.1‐1990 standard was silent with regard to the behavior
       of <i>rmdir</i>() when there are multiple hard links to the directory
       being removed. The requirement to set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EEXIST] </b>or
       <b>[ENOTEMPTY] </b>clarifies the behavior in this case.

       If the current working directory of the process is being removed,
       that should be an allowed error.

       Virtually all existing implementations detect <b>[ENOTEMPTY] </b>or the
       case of dot-dot. The text in <i>Section 2.3</i>, <i>Error Numbers</i> about
       returning any one of the possible errors permits that behavior to
       continue. The <b>[ELOOP] </b>error may be returned if more than
       {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links are encountered during resolution of
       the <i>path</i> argument.
