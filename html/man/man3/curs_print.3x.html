NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mcprint </b>- ship binary data to printer
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;curses.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int mcprint(char *</b><i>data</i><b>, int </b><i>len</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This function uses the <b>mc5p </b>or <b>mc4 </b>and <b>mc5 </b>capabilities, if they
       are present, to ship given data to a printer attached to the
       terminal.

       Note that the <b>mcprint </b>code has no way to do flow control with the
       printer or to know how much buffering it has.  Your application
       is responsible for keeping the rate of writes to the printer
       below its continuous throughput rate (typically about half of its
       nominal cps rating).  Dot-matrix printers and 6-page-per-minute
       lasers can typically handle 80cps, so a good conservative rule of
       thumb is to sleep for a second after shipping each 80-character
       line.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>mcprint </b>function returns <b>ERR </b>if the write operation aborted
       for some reason.  In this case, <b>errno </b>will contain either an
       error associated with <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> or one of the following:

       ENODEV
            Capabilities for printer redirection do not exist.

       ENOMEM
            Couldn't allocate sufficient memory to buffer the printer
            write.

       When <b>mcprint </b>succeeds, it returns the number of characters
       actually sent to the printer.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>mcprint </b>call was designed for <b>ncurses</b>(3X), and is not found
       in SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of
       curses.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Padding in the <b>mc5p</b>, <b>mc4 </b>and <b>mc5 </b>capabilities will not be
       interpreted.
