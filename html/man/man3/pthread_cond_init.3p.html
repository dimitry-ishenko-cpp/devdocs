       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the

       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_cond_destroy, pthread_cond_init — destroy and initialize
       condition variables
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_cond_destroy(pthread_cond_t *<i>cond</i>);
       int pthread_cond_init(pthread_cond_t *restrict <i>cond</i>,
           const pthread_condattr_t *restrict <i>attr</i>);
       pthread_cond_t <i>cond</i> = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_cond_destroy</i>() function shall destroy the given
       condition variable specified by <i>cond</i>; the object becomes, in
       effect, uninitialized. An implementation may cause
       <i>pthread_cond_destroy</i>() to set the object referenced by <i>cond</i> to an
       invalid value. A destroyed condition variable object can be
       reinitialized using <i>pthread_cond_init</i>(); the results of otherwise
       referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.

       It shall be safe to destroy an initialized condition variable
       upon which no threads are currently blocked. Attempting to
       destroy a condition variable upon which other threads are
       currently blocked results in undefined behavior.

       The <i>pthread_cond_init</i>() function shall initialize the condition
       variable referenced by <i>cond</i> with attributes referenced by <i>attr</i>.
       If <i>attr</i> is NULL, the default condition variable attributes shall
       be used; the effect is the same as passing the address of a
       default condition variable attributes object. Upon successful
       initialization, the state of the condition variable shall become
       initialized.

       See <i>Section 2.9.9</i>, <i>Synchronization Object Copies and Alternative</i>
       <i>Mappings</i> for further requirements.

       Attempting to initialize an already initialized condition
       variable results in undefined behavior.

       In cases where default condition variable attributes are
       appropriate, the macro PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER can be used to
       initialize condition variables. The effect shall be equivalent to
       dynamic initialization by a call to <i>pthread_cond_init</i>() with
       parameter <i>attr</i> specified as NULL, except that no error checks are
       performed.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>cond</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_cond_destroy</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized condition variable.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_cond_init</i>() does not refer to an initialized
       condition variable attributes object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_cond_destroy</i>() and <i>pthread_cond_init</i>()
       functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
       returned to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_cond_init</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The system lacked the necessary resources (other than
              memory) to initialize another condition variable.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory exists to initialize the condition
              variable.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       A condition variable can be destroyed immediately after all the
       threads that are blocked on it are awakened. For example,
       consider the following code:

           struct list {
               pthread_mutex_t lm;
               ...
           }

           struct elt {
               key k;
               int busy;
               pthread_cond_t notbusy;
               ...
           }

           /* Find a list element and reserve it. */
           struct elt *
           list_find(struct list *lp, key k)
           {
               struct elt *ep;

               pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;lp-&gt;lm);
               while ((ep = find_elt(l, k) != NULL) &amp;&amp; ep-&gt;busy)
                   pthread_cond_wait(&amp;ep-&gt;notbusy, &amp;lp-&gt;lm);
               if (ep != NULL)
                   ep-&gt;busy = 1;
               pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;lp-&gt;lm);
               return(ep);
           }

           delete_elt(struct list *lp, struct elt *ep)
           {
               pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;lp-&gt;lm);
               assert(ep-&gt;busy);
               ... remove ep from list ...
               ep-&gt;busy = 0;  /* Paranoid. */
           (A) pthread_cond_broadcast(&amp;ep-&gt;notbusy);
               pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;lp-&gt;lm);
           (B) pthread_cond_destroy(&amp;ep-&gt;notbusy);
               free(ep);
           }

       In this example, the condition variable and its list element may
       be freed (line B) immediately after all threads waiting for it
       are awakened (line A), since the mutex and the code ensure that
       no other thread can touch the element to be deleted.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>cond</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_cond_destroy</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized condition variable, it is recommended that the
       function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>cond</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_cond_destroy</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_init</i>() refers
       to a condition variable that is in use (for example, in a
       <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() call) by another thread, or detects that the
       value specified by the <i>cond</i> argument to <i>pthread_cond_init</i>()
       refers to an already initialized condition variable, it is
       recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EBUSY]</b>
       error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_cond_init</i>() does not refer to an initialized
       condition variable attributes object, it is recommended that the
       function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
