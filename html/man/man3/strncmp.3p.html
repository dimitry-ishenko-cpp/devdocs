PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       strncmp — compare part of two strings
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       int strncmp(const char *<i>s1</i>, const char *<i>s2</i>, size_t <i>n</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>strncmp</i>() function shall compare not more than <i>n</i> bytes (bytes
       that follow a NUL character are not compared) from the array
       pointed to by <i>s1</i> to the array pointed to by <i>s2</i>.

       The sign of a non-zero return value is determined by the sign of
       the difference between the values of the first pair of bytes
       (both interpreted as type <b>unsigned char</b>) that differ in the
       strings being compared.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>strncmp</i>() shall return an integer
       greater than, equal to, or less than 0, if the possibly null-
       terminated array pointed to by <i>s1</i> is greater than, equal to, or
       less than the possibly null-terminated array pointed to by <i>s2</i>
       respectively.
