PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_mutex_consistent — mark state protected by robust mutex
       as consistent
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_mutex_consistent(pthread_mutex_t *<i>mutex</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>mutex</i> is a robust mutex in an inconsistent state, the
       <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>() function can be used to mark the state
       protected by the mutex referenced by <i>mutex</i> as consistent again.

       If an owner of a robust mutex terminates while holding the mutex,
       the mutex becomes inconsistent and the next thread that acquires
       the mutex lock shall be notified of the state by the return value
       <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>.  In this case, the mutex does not become normally
       usable again until the state is marked consistent.

       If the thread which acquired the mutex lock with the return value
       <b>[EOWNERDEAD] </b>terminates before calling either
       <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>() or <i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>(), the next
       thread that acquires the mutex lock shall be notified about the
       state of the mutex by the return value <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>mutex</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized mutex.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>()
       function shall return zero. Otherwise, an error value shall be
       returned to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The mutex object referenced by <i>mutex</i> is not robust or does
              not protect an inconsistent state.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>() function is only responsible for
       notifying the implementation that the state protected by the
       mutex has been recovered and that normal operations with the
       mutex can be resumed. It is the responsibility of the application
       to recover the state so it can be reused. If the application is
       not able to perform the recovery, it can notify the
       implementation that the situation is unrecoverable by a call to
       <i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>() without a prior call to
       <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>(), in which case subsequent threads that
       attempt to lock the mutex will fail to acquire the lock and be
       returned <b>[ENOTRECOVERABLE]</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>mutex</i> argument to <i>pthread_mutex_consistent</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized mutex, it is recommended that the function should
       fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
