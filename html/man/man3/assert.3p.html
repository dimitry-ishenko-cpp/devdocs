PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       assert — insert program diagnostics
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;assert.h&gt;

       void assert(scalar <i>expression</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>assert</i>() macro shall insert diagnostics into programs; it
       shall expand to a <b>void </b>expression. When it is executed, if
       <i>expression</i> (which shall have a <b>scalar </b>type) is false (that is,
       compares equal to 0), <i>assert</i>() shall write information about the
       particular call that failed on <i>stderr</i> and shall call <i>abort</i>().

       The information written about the call that failed shall include
       the text of the argument, the name of the source file, the source
       file line number, and the name of the enclosing function; the
       latter are, respectively, the values of the preprocessing macros
       __FILE__ and __LINE__ and of the identifier __func__.

       Forcing a definition of the name NDEBUG, either from the compiler
       command line or with the preprocessor control statement <b>#define</b>
       NDEBUG ahead of the <b>#include </b><i>&lt;assert.h&gt;</i> statement, shall stop
       assertions from being compiled into the program.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>assert</i>() macro shall not return a value.
</pre> <h2>
