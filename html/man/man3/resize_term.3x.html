DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It provides callers
       with a hook into the <b>ncurses </b>data to resize windows, primarily
       for use by programs running in an X Window terminal (e.g., xterm)
       when the terminal's screen size is changed by the user:

       •   Curses windows cannot extend outside the screen.  If the
           terminal is shrunk, curses windows must be shrunk to fit.

       •   If the terminal is stretched, rows and/or columns can be
           added to existing windows.  The added cells should match the
           current attributes of the windows.

       If the calling program has not set up a handler for <b>SIGWINCH </b>when
       it initializes <b>ncurses </b>(e.g., using <b>initscr</b>(3X) or <b>newterm</b>(3X)),
       then <b>ncurses </b>sets a handler for <b>SIGWINCH </b>which notifies the
       library when a window-size event has occurred.  The library
       checks for this notification

       •   when reading input data,

       •   when implicitly resuming program mode (e.g., between
           <b>endwin</b>(3X) and <b>wrefresh</b>(3X)), and

       •   when explicitly resuming program mode in <b>restartterm</b>(3X).

       When the library has found that the terminal's window-size has
       changed, it calls <b>resizeterm </b>to update its data structures.

       An application which establishes its own <b>SIGWINCH </b>handler can
       call <b>resizeterm</b>, but in that case, the library will not see
       <b>SIGWINCH</b>, and proper layout will rely upon the application.
</pre> <h2>
FUNCTIONS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>resizeterm</b>
       The function <b>resizeterm </b>resizes the standard and current windows
       (i.e., <b>stdscr </b>and <b>curscr</b>) to the specified dimensions, and
       adjusts other bookkeeping data used by the <b>ncurses </b>library that
       record the window dimensions such as the <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLS</b>
       variables.

   <b>resize_term</b>
       Most of the work for <b>resizeterm </b>is done by the inner function
       <b>resize_term</b>.  The outer function <b>resizeterm </b>adds bookkeeping for
       the <b>SIGWINCH </b>handler, as well as repainting the soft-key area
       (see <b>slk_touch</b>(3X)).

       The <b>resize_term </b>function attempts to resize all windows.  This
       helps with simple applications.  However:

       •   It is not possible to automatically resize pads.

       •   Applications which have complicated layouts should check for
           <b>KEY_RESIZE </b>returned from <b>wgetch</b>, and adjust their layout,
           e.g., using <b>wresize </b>and <b>mvwin</b>, or by recreating the windows.

       When resizing windows, <b>resize_term </b>recursively adjusts
       subwindows, keeping them within the updated parent window's
       limits.  If a top-level window happens to extend to the screen's
       limits, then on resizing the window, <b>resize_term </b>will keep the
       window extending to the corresponding limit, regardless of
       whether the screen has shrunk or grown.

   <b>is_term_resized</b>
       A support function <b>is_term_resized </b>is provided so that
       applications can check if the <b>resize_term </b>function would modify
       the window structures.  It returns <b>TRUE </b>if the windows would be
       modified, and <b>FALSE </b>otherwise.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Except as noted, these functions return the integer <b>ERR </b>upon
       failure and <b>OK </b>on success.  They will fail if either of the
       dimensions are less than or equal to zero, or if an error occurs
       while (re)allocating memory for the windows.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       While these functions are intended to be used to support a signal
       handler (i.e., for <b>SIGWINCH</b>), care should be taken to avoid
       invoking them in a context where <b>malloc </b>or <b>realloc </b>may have been
       interrupted, since it uses those functions.

       If ncurses is configured to supply its own <b>SIGWINCH </b>handler,

       •   on receipt of a <b>SIGWINCH</b>, the handler sets a flag

       •   which is tested in <b>wgetch</b>(3X), <b>doupdate</b>(3X) and
           <b>restartterm</b>(3X),

       •   in turn, calling the <b>resizeterm </b>function,

       •   which <b>ungetch</b>'s a <b>KEY_RESIZE </b>which will be read on the next
           call to <b>wgetch</b>.

           The <b>KEY_RESIZE </b>alerts an application that the screen size has
           changed, and that it should repaint special features such as
           pads that cannot be done automatically.

           Calling <b>resizeterm </b>or <b>resize_term </b>directly from a signal
           handler is unsafe.  This indirect method is used to provide a
           safe way to resize the ncurses data structures.

       If the environment variables <b>LINES </b>or <b>COLUMNS </b>are set, this
       overrides the library's use of the window size obtained from the
       operating system.  Thus, even if a <b>SIGWINCH </b>is received, no
       screen size change may be recorded.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       It is possible to resize the screen with SVr4 curses, by

       •   exiting curses with <b>endwin</b>(3X) and

       •   resuming using <b>refresh</b>(3X).

       Doing that clears the screen and is visually distracting.

       This extension of ncurses was introduced in mid-1995.  It was
       adopted in NetBSD curses (2001) and PDCurses (2003).
