       mknod, mknodat — make directory, special file, or regular file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

       int mknod(const char *<i>path</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>, dev_t <i>dev</i>);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int mknodat(int <i>fd</i>, const char *<i>path</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>, dev_t <i>dev</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mknod</i>() function shall create a new file named by the
       pathname to which the argument <i>path</i> points.

       The file type for <i>path</i> is OR'ed into the <i>mode</i> argument, and the
       application shall select one of the following symbolic constants:
              ┌────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┐
              │    <b>Name    </b>│           <b>Description            </b>│
              ├────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┤
              │ S_IFIFO    │ FIFO-special                     │
              │ S_IFCHR    │ Character-special (non-portable) │
              │ S_IFDIR    │ Directory (non-portable)         │
              │ S_IFBLK    │ Block-special (non-portable)     │
              │ S_IFREG    │ Regular (non-portable)           │
              └────────────┴──────────────────────────────────┘

       The only portable use of <i>mknod</i>() is to create a FIFO-special
       file. If <i>mode</i> is not S_IFIFO or <i>dev</i> is not 0, the behavior of
       <i>mknod</i>() is unspecified.

       The permissions for the new file are OR'ed into the <i>mode</i>
       argument, and may be selected from any combination of the
       following symbolic constants:
         ┌────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
         │    <b>Name    </b>│                 <b>Description                 </b>│
         ├────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
         │ S_ISUID    │ Set user ID on execution.                   │
         │ S_ISGID    │ Set group ID on execution.                  │
         │ S_IRWXU    │ Read, write, or execute (search) by owner.  │
         │ S_IRUSR    │ Read by owner.                              │
         │ S_IWUSR    │ Write by owner.                             │
         │ S_IXUSR    │ Execute (search) by owner.                  │
         │ S_IRWXG    │ Read, write, or execute (search) by group.  │
         │ S_IRGRP    │ Read by group.                              │
         │ S_IWGRP    │ Write by group.                             │
         │ S_IXGRP    │ Execute (search) by group.                  │
         │ S_IRWXO    │ Read, write, or execute (search) by others. │
         │ S_IROTH    │ Read by others.                             │
         │ S_IWOTH    │ Write by others.                            │
         │ S_IXOTH    │ Execute (search) by others.                 │
         │ S_ISVTX    │ On directories, restricted deletion flag.   │
         └────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

       The user ID of the file shall be initialized to the effective
       user ID of the process. The group ID of the file shall be
       initialized to either the effective group ID of the process or
       the group ID of the parent directory. Implementations shall
       provide a way to initialize the file's group ID to the group ID
       of the parent directory. Implementations may, but need not,
       provide an implementation-defined way to initialize the file's
       group ID to the effective group ID of the calling process. The
       owner, group, and other permission bits of <i>mode</i> shall be modified
       by the file mode creation mask of the process. The <i>mknod</i>()
       function shall clear each bit whose corresponding bit in the file
       mode creation mask of the process is set.

       If <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, <i>mknod</i>() shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       to <b>[EEXIST]</b>.

       Upon successful completion, <i>mknod</i>() shall mark for update the
       last data access, last data modification, and last file status
       change timestamps of the file. Also, the last data modification
       and last file status change timestamps of the directory that
       contains the new entry shall be marked for update.

       Only a process with appropriate privileges may invoke <i>mknod</i>() for
       file types other than FIFO-special.

       The <i>mknodat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>mknod</i>()
       function except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a relative path.
       In this case the newly created directory, special file, or
       regular file is located relative to the directory associated with
       the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the current working directory.
       If the access mode of the open file description associated with
       the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH, the function shall check
       whether directory searches are permitted using the current
       permissions of the directory underlying the file descriptor. If
       the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the
       check.

       If <i>mknodat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to <i>mknod</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
       Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error. If -1 is returned, the new file shall not be
       created.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>A component of the path prefix denies search permission,
              or write permission is denied on the parent directory.

       <b>EEXIST </b>The named file exists.

       <b>EINVAL </b>An invalid argument exists.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while accessing the file system.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of the path prefix of <i>path</i> does not name an
              existing file or <i>path</i> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOENT </b>or <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters. If <i>path</i> without the trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters would name an existing file, an <b>[ENOENT] </b>error
              shall not occur.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The directory that would contain the new file cannot be
              extended or the file system is out of file allocation
              resources.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The invoking process does not have appropriate privileges
              and the file type is not FIFO-special.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The directory in which the file is to be created is
              located on a read-only file system.

       The <i>mknodat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd</i> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path</i> argument does not specify an absolute path and
              the <i>fd</i> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
              descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument is not an absolute path and <i>fd</i> is a file
              descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Creating a FIFO Special File</b>
       The following example shows how to create a FIFO special file
       named <b>/home/cnd/mod_done</b>, with read/write permissions for owner,
       and with read permissions for group and others.

           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

           dev_t dev;
           int   status;
           ...
           status  = mknod("/home/cnd/mod_done", S_IFIFO | S_IWUSR |
               S_IRUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH, dev);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mkfifo</i>() function is preferred over this function for making
       FIFO special files.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The POSIX.1‐1990 standard required that the group ID of a newly
       created file be set to the group ID of its parent directory or to
       the effective group ID of the creating process. FIPS 151‐2
       required that implementations provide a way to have the group ID
       be set to the group ID of the containing directory, but did not
       prohibit implementations also supporting a way to set the group
       ID to the effective group ID of the creating process.  Conforming
       applications should not assume which group ID will be used. If it
       matters, an application can use <i>chown</i>() to set the group ID after
       the file is created, or determine under what conditions the
       implementation will set the desired group ID.

       The purpose of the <i>mknodat</i>() function is to create directories,
       special files, or regular files in directories other than the
       current working directory without exposure to race conditions.
       Any part of the path of a file could be changed in parallel to a
       call to <i>mknod</i>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a
       file descriptor for the target directory and using the <i>mknodat</i>()
       function it can be guaranteed that the newly created directory,
       special file, or regular file is located relative to the desired
       directory.
