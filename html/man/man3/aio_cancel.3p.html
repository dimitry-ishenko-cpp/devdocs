       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the

       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       aio_cancel — cancel an asynchronous I/O request
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;aio.h&gt;

       int aio_cancel(int <i>fildes</i>, struct aiocb *<i>aiocbp</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_cancel</i>() function shall attempt to cancel one or more
       asynchronous I/O requests currently outstanding against file
       descriptor <i>fildes</i>.  The <i>aiocbp</i> argument points to the
       asynchronous I/O control block for a particular request to be
       canceled. If <i>aiocbp</i> is NULL, then all outstanding cancelable
       asynchronous I/O requests against <i>fildes</i> shall be canceled.

       Normal asynchronous notification shall occur for asynchronous I/O
       operations that are successfully canceled. If there are requests
       that cannot be canceled, then the normal asynchronous completion
       process shall take place for those requests when they are
       completed.

       For requested operations that are successfully canceled, the
       associated error status shall be set to <b>[ECANCELED] </b>and the
       return status shall be -1. For requested operations that are not
       successfully canceled, the <i>aiocbp</i> shall not be modified by
       <i>aio_cancel</i>().

       If <i>aiocbp</i> is not NULL, then if <i>fildes</i> does not have the same
       value as the file descriptor with which the asynchronous
       operation was initiated, unspecified results occur.

       Which operations are cancelable is implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_cancel</i>() function shall return the value AIO_CANCELED if
       the requested operation(s) were canceled.  The value
       AIO_NOTCANCELED shall be returned if at least one of the
       requested operation(s) cannot be canceled because it is in
       progress. In this case, the state of the other operations, if
       any, referenced in the call to <i>aio_cancel</i>() is not indicated by
       the return value of <i>aio_cancel</i>().  The application may determine
       the state of affairs for these operations by using <i>aio_error</i>().
       The value AIO_ALLDONE is returned if all of the operations have
       already completed.  Otherwise, the function shall return -1 and
       set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_cancel</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.
