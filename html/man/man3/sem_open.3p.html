NAME </h2>

       sem_open — initialize and open a named semaphore
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;semaphore.h&gt;

       sem_t *sem_open(const char *<i>name</i>, int <i>oflag</i>, ...);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sem_open</i>() function shall establish a connection between a
       named semaphore and a process. Following a call to <i>sem_open</i>()
       with semaphore name <i>name</i>, the process may reference the semaphore
       associated with <i>name</i> using the address returned from the call.
       This semaphore may be used in subsequent calls to <i>sem_wait</i>(),
       <i>sem_timedwait</i>(), <i>sem_trywait</i>(), <i>sem_post</i>(), and <i>sem_close</i>().  The
       semaphore remains usable by this process until the semaphore is
       closed by a successful call to <i>sem_close</i>(), <i>_exit</i>(), or one of
       the <i>exec</i> functions.

       The <i>oflag</i> argument controls whether the semaphore is created or
       merely accessed by the call to <i>sem_open</i>().  The following flag
       bits may be set in <i>oflag</i>:

       O_CREAT   This flag is used to create a semaphore if it does not
                 already exist.  If O_CREAT is set and the semaphore
                 already exists, then O_CREAT has no effect, except as
                 noted under O_EXCL. Otherwise, <i>sem_open</i>() creates a
                 named semaphore. The O_CREAT flag requires a third and
                 a fourth argument: <i>mode</i>, which is of type <b>mode_t</b>, and
                 <i>value</i>, which is of type <b>unsigned</b>.  The semaphore is
                 created with an initial value of <i>value</i>.  Valid initial
                 values for semaphores are less than or equal to
                 {SEM_VALUE_MAX}.

                 The user ID of the semaphore shall be set to the
                 effective user ID of the process. The group ID of the
                 semaphore shall be set to the effective group ID of the
                 process; however, if the <i>name</i> argument is visible in
                 the file system, the group ID may be set to the group
                 ID of the containing directory. The permission bits of
                 the semaphore are set to the value of the <i>mode</i> argument
                 except those set in the file mode creation mask of the
                 process. When bits in <i>mode</i> other than the file
                 permission bits are specified, the effect is
                 unspecified.

                 After the semaphore named <i>name</i> has been created by
                 <i>sem_open</i>() with the O_CREAT flag, other processes can
                 connect to the semaphore by calling <i>sem_open</i>() with the
                 same value of <i>name</i>.

       O_EXCL    If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set, <i>sem_open</i>() fails if the
                 semaphore <i>name</i> exists. The check for the existence of
                 the semaphore and the creation of the semaphore if it
                 does not exist are atomic with respect to other
                 processes executing <i>sem_open</i>() with O_EXCL and O_CREAT
                 set. If O_EXCL is set and O_CREAT is not set, the
                 effect is undefined.

                 If flags other than O_CREAT and O_EXCL are specified in
                 the <i>oflag</i> parameter, the effect is unspecified.

       The <i>name</i> argument points to a string naming a semaphore object.
       It is unspecified whether the name appears in the file system and
       is visible to functions that take pathnames as arguments. The
       <i>name</i> argument conforms to the construction rules for a pathname,
       except that the interpretation of &lt;slash&gt; characters other than
       the leading &lt;slash&gt; character in <i>name</i> is implementation-defined,
       and that the length limits for the <i>name</i> argument are
       implementation-defined and need not be the same as the pathname
       limits {PATH_MAX} and {NAME_MAX}.  If <i>name</i> begins with the
       &lt;slash&gt; character, then processes calling <i>sem_open</i>() with the
       same value of <i>name</i> shall refer to the same semaphore object, as
       long as that name has not been removed. If <i>name</i> does not begin
       with the &lt;slash&gt; character, the effect is implementation-defined.

       If a process makes multiple successful calls to <i>sem_open</i>() with
       the same value for <i>name</i>, the same semaphore address shall be
       returned for each such successful call, provided that there have
       been no calls to <i>sem_unlink</i>() for this semaphore, and at least
       one previous successful <i>sem_open</i>() call for this semaphore has
       not been matched with a <i>sem_close</i>() call.

       References to copies of the semaphore produce undefined results.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>sem_open</i>() function shall return
       the address of the semaphore. Otherwise, it shall return a value
       of SEM_FAILED and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error. The symbol
       SEM_FAILED is defined in the <i>&lt;semaphore.h&gt;</i> header. No successful
       return from <i>sem_open</i>() shall return the value SEM_FAILED.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If any of the following conditions occur, the <i>sem_open</i>() function
       shall return SEM_FAILED and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the corresponding value:

       <b>EACCES </b>The named semaphore exists and the permissions specified
              by <i>oflag</i> are denied, or the named semaphore does not exist
              and permission to create the named semaphore is denied.

       <b>EEXIST </b>O_CREAT and O_EXCL are set and the named semaphore already
              exists.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>sem_open</i>() operation was interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>sem_open</i>() operation is not supported for the given
              name, or O_CREAT was specified in <i>oflag</i> and <i>value</i> was
              greater than {SEM_VALUE_MAX}.

       <b>EMFILE </b>Too many semaphore descriptors or file descriptors are
              currently in use by this process.

       <b>ENFILE </b>Too many semaphores are currently open in the system.

       <b>ENOENT </b>O_CREAT is not set and the named semaphore does not exist.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>There is insufficient memory for the creation of the new
              named semaphore.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>There is insufficient space on a storage device for the
              creation of the new named semaphore.

       If any of the following conditions occur, the <i>sem_open</i>() function
       may return SEM_FAILED and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the corresponding value:

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of the <i>name</i> argument exceeds {_POSIX_PATH_MAX}
              on systems that do not support the XSI option or exceeds
              {_XOPEN_PATH_MAX} on XSI systems, or has a pathname
              component that is longer than {_POSIX_NAME_MAX} on systems
              that do not support the XSI option or longer than
              {_XOPEN_NAME_MAX} on XSI systems.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Early drafts required an error return value of -1 with the type
       <b>sem_t * </b>for the <i>sem_open</i>() function, which is not guaranteed to
       be portable across implementations. The revised text provides the
       symbolic error code SEM_FAILED to eliminate the type conflict.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version might require the <i>sem_open</i>() and <i>sem_unlink</i>()
       functions to have semantics similar to normal file system
       operations.
