DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pselect</i>() function shall examine the file descriptor sets
       whose addresses are passed in the <i>readfds</i>, <i>writefds</i>, and <i>errorfds</i>
       parameters to see whether some of their descriptors are ready for
       reading, are ready for writing, or have an exceptional condition
       pending, respectively.

       The <i>select</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>pselect</i>()
       function, except as follows:

        *  For the <i>select</i>() function, the timeout period is given in
           seconds and microseconds in an argument of type <b>struct</b>
           <b>timeval</b>, whereas for the <i>pselect</i>() function the timeout
           period is given in seconds and nanoseconds in an argument of
           type <b>struct timespec</b>.

        *  The <i>select</i>() function has no <i>sigmask</i> argument; it shall
           behave as <i>pselect</i>() does when <i>sigmask</i> is a null pointer.

        *  Upon successful completion, the <i>select</i>() function may modify
           the object pointed to by the <i>timeout</i> argument.

       The <i>pselect</i>() and <i>select</i>() functions shall support regular files,
       terminal and pseudo-terminal devices, STREAMS-based files, FIFOs,
       pipes, and sockets. The behavior of <i>pselect</i>() and <i>select</i>() on
       file descriptors that refer to other types of file is
       unspecified.

       The <i>nfds</i> argument specifies the range of descriptors to be
       tested. The first <i>nfds</i> descriptors shall be checked in each set;
       that is, the descriptors from zero through <i>nfds</i>-1 in the
       descriptor sets shall be examined.

       If the <i>readfds</i> argument is not a null pointer, it points to an
       object of type <b>fd_set </b>that on input specifies the file
       descriptors to be checked for being ready to read, and on output
       indicates which file descriptors are ready to read.

       If the <i>writefds</i> argument is not a null pointer, it points to an
       object of type <b>fd_set </b>that on input specifies the file
       descriptors to be checked for being ready to write, and on output
       indicates which file descriptors are ready to write.

       If the <i>errorfds</i> argument is not a null pointer, it points to an
       object of type <b>fd_set </b>that on input specifies the file
       descriptors to be checked for error conditions pending, and on
       output indicates which file descriptors have error conditions
       pending.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>pselect</i>() or <i>select</i>() function
       shall modify the objects pointed to by the <i>readfds</i>, <i>writefds</i>, and
       <i>errorfds</i> arguments to indicate which file descriptors are ready
       for reading, ready for writing, or have an error condition
       pending, respectively, and shall return the total number of ready
       descriptors in all the output sets. For each file descriptor less
       than <i>nfds</i>, the corresponding bit shall be set upon successful
       completion if it was set on input and the associated condition is
       true for that file descriptor.

       If none of the selected descriptors are ready for the requested
       operation, the <i>pselect</i>() or <i>select</i>() function shall block until
       at least one of the requested operations becomes ready, until the
       <i>timeout</i> occurs, or until interrupted by a signal.  The <i>timeout</i>
       parameter controls how long the <i>pselect</i>() or <i>select</i>() function
       shall take before timing out. If the <i>timeout</i> parameter is not a
       null pointer, it specifies a maximum interval to wait for the
       selection to complete. If the specified time interval expires
       without any requested operation becoming ready, the function
       shall return. If the <i>timeout</i> parameter is a null pointer, then
       the call to <i>pselect</i>() or <i>select</i>() shall block indefinitely until
       at least one descriptor meets the specified criteria. To effect a
       poll, the <i>timeout</i> parameter should not be a null pointer, and
       should point to a zero-valued <b>timespec </b>structure.

       The use of a timeout does not affect any pending timers set up by
       <i>alarm</i>() or <i>setitimer</i>().

       Implementations may place limitations on the maximum timeout
       interval supported. All implementations shall support a maximum
       timeout interval of at least 31 days. If the <i>timeout</i> argument
       specifies a timeout interval greater than the implementation-
       defined maximum value, the maximum value shall be used as the
       actual timeout value. Implementations may also place limitations
       on the granularity of timeout intervals. If the requested timeout
       interval requires a finer granularity than the implementation
       supports, the actual timeout interval shall be rounded up to the
       next supported value.

       If <i>sigmask</i> is not a null pointer, then the <i>pselect</i>() function
       shall replace the signal mask of the caller by the set of signals
       pointed to by <i>sigmask</i> before examining the descriptors, and shall
       restore the signal mask of the calling thread before returning.

       A descriptor shall be considered ready for reading when a call to
       an input function with O_NONBLOCK clear would not block, whether
       or not the function would transfer data successfully. (The
       function might return data, an end-of-file indication, or an
       error other than one indicating that it is blocked, and in each
       of these cases the descriptor shall be considered ready for
       reading.)

       A descriptor shall be considered ready for writing when a call to
       an output function with O_NONBLOCK clear would not block, whether
       or not the function would transfer data successfully.

       If a socket has a pending error, it shall be considered to have
       an exceptional condition pending. Otherwise, what constitutes an
       exceptional condition is file type-specific. For a file
       descriptor for use with a socket, it is protocol-specific except
       as noted below. For other file types it is implementation-
       defined. If the operation is meaningless for a particular file
       type, <i>pselect</i>() or <i>select</i>() shall indicate that the descriptor is
       ready for read or write operations, and shall indicate that the
       descriptor has no exceptional condition pending.

       If a descriptor refers to a socket, the implied input function is
       the <i>recvmsg</i>() function with parameters requesting normal and
       ancillary data, such that the presence of either type shall cause
       the socket to be marked as readable. The presence of out-of-band
       data shall be checked if the socket option SO_OOBINLINE has been
       enabled, as out-of-band data is enqueued with normal data. If the
       socket is currently listening, then it shall be marked as
       readable if an incoming connection request has been received, and
       a call to the <i>accept</i>() function shall complete without blocking.

       If a descriptor refers to a socket, the implied output function
       is the <i>sendmsg</i>() function supplying an amount of normal data
       equal to the current value of the SO_SNDLOWAT option for the
       socket. If a non-blocking call to the <i>connect</i>() function has been
       made for a socket, and the connection attempt has either
       succeeded or failed leaving a pending error, the socket shall be
       marked as writable.

       A socket shall be considered to have an exceptional condition
       pending if a receive operation with O_NONBLOCK clear for the open
       file description and with the MSG_OOB flag set would return out-
       of-band data without blocking. (It is protocol-specific whether
       the MSG_OOB flag would be used to read out-of-band data.) A
       socket shall also be considered to have an exceptional condition
       pending if an out-of-band data mark is present in the receive
       queue. Other circumstances under which a socket may be considered
       to have an exceptional condition pending are protocol-specific
       and implementation-defined.

       If the <i>readfds</i>, <i>writefds</i>, and <i>errorfds</i> arguments are all null
       pointers and the <i>timeout</i> argument is not a null pointer, the
       <i>pselect</i>() or <i>select</i>() function shall block for the time
       specified, or until interrupted by a signal. If the <i>readfds</i>,
       <i>writefds</i>, and <i>errorfds</i> arguments are all null pointers and the
       <i>timeout</i> argument is a null pointer, the <i>pselect</i>() or <i>select</i>()
       function shall block until interrupted by a signal.

       File descriptors associated with regular files shall always
       select true for ready to read, ready to write, and error
       conditions.

       On failure, the objects pointed to by the <i>readfds</i>, <i>writefds</i>, and
       <i>errorfds</i> arguments shall not be modified. If the timeout interval
       expires without the specified condition being true for any of the
       specified file descriptors, the objects pointed to by the
       <i>readfds</i>, <i>writefds</i>, and <i>errorfds</i> arguments shall have all bits set
       to 0.

       File descriptor masks of type <b>fd_set </b>can be initialized and
       tested with <i>FD_CLR</i>(), <i>FD_ISSET</i>(), <i>FD_SET</i>(), and <i>FD_ZERO</i>().  It is
       unspecified whether each of these is a macro or a function. If a
       macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual
       function, or a program defines an external identifier with any of
       these names, the behavior is undefined.

       <i>FD_CLR</i>(<i>fd</i>, <i>fdsetp</i>) shall remove the file descriptor <i>fd</i> from the
       set pointed to by <i>fdsetp</i>.  If <i>fd</i> is not a member of this set,
       there shall be no effect on the set, nor will an error be
       returned.

       <i>FD_ISSET</i>(<i>fd</i>, <i>fdsetp</i>) shall evaluate to non-zero if the file
       descriptor <i>fd</i> is a member of the set pointed to by <i>fdsetp</i>, and
       shall evaluate to zero otherwise.

       <i>FD_SET</i>(<i>fd</i>, <i>fdsetp</i>) shall add the file descriptor <i>fd</i> to the set
       pointed to by <i>fdsetp</i>.  If the file descriptor <i>fd</i> is already in
       this set, there shall be no effect on the set, nor will an error
       be returned.

       <i>FD_ZERO</i>(<i>fdsetp</i>) shall initialize the descriptor set pointed to by
       <i>fdsetp</i> to the null set. No error is returned if the set is not
       empty at the time <i>FD_ZERO</i>() is invoked.

       The behavior of these macros is undefined if the <i>fd</i> argument is
       less than 0 or greater than or equal to FD_SETSIZE, or if <i>fd</i> is
       not a valid file descriptor, or if any of the arguments are
       expressions with side-effects.

       If a thread gets canceled during a <i>pselect</i>() call, the signal
       mask in effect when executing the registered cleanup functions is
       either the original signal mask or the signal mask installed as
       part of the <i>pselect</i>() call.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>pselect</i>() and <i>select</i>() functions
       shall return the total number of bits set in the bit masks.
       Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to
       indicate the error.

       <i>FD_CLR</i>(), <i>FD_SET</i>(), and <i>FD_ZERO</i>() do not return a value.
       <i>FD_ISSET</i>() shall return a non-zero value if the bit for the file
       descriptor <i>fd</i> is set in the file descriptor set pointed to by
       <i>fdset</i>, and 0 otherwise.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Under the following conditions, <i>pselect</i>() and <i>select</i>() shall fail
       and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to:

       <b>EBADF  </b>One or more of the file descriptor sets specified a file
              descriptor that is not a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The function was interrupted while blocked waiting for any
              of the selected descriptors to become ready and before the
              timeout interval expired.

                   If SA_RESTART has been set for the interrupting
                   signal, it is implementation-defined whether the
                   function restarts or returns with <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>An invalid timeout interval was specified.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>nfds</i> argument is less than 0 or greater than
              FD_SETSIZE.

       <b>EINVAL </b>One of the specified file descriptors refers to a STREAM
              or multiplexer that is linked (directly or indirectly)
              downstream from a multiplexer.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       In earlier versions of the Single UNIX Specification, the
       <i>select</i>() function was defined in the <i>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</i> header. This is
       now changed to <i>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</i>.  The rationale for this change was
       as follows: the introduction of the <i>pselect</i>() function included
       the <i>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</i> header and the <i>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</i> header defines
       all the related definitions for the <i>pselect</i>() and <i>select</i>()
       functions. Backwards-compatibility to existing XSI
       implementations is handled by allowing <i>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</i> to include
       <i>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</i>.

       Code which wants to avoid the ambiguity of the signal mask for
       thread cancellation handlers can install an additional
       cancellation handler which resets the signal mask to the expected
       value.

           void cleanup(void *arg)
           {
               sigset_t *ss = (sigset_t *) arg;
               pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, ss, NULL);
           }

           int call_pselect(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds,
               fd_set errorfds, const struct timespec *timeout,
               const sigset_t *sigmask)
           {
               sigset_t oldmask;
               int result;
               pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, NULL, &amp;oldmask);
               pthread_cleanup_push(cleanup, &amp;oldmask);
               result = pselect(nfds, readfds, writefds, errorfds, timeout, sigmask);
               pthread_cleanup_pop(0);
               return result;
           }
