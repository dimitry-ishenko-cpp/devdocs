</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These functions create, access, and modify a database.

       A <b>datum </b>consists of at least two members, <i>dptr</i> and <i>dsize</i>.  The
       <i>dptr</i> member points to an object that is <i>dsize</i> bytes in length.
       Arbitrary binary data, as well as character strings, may be
       stored in the object pointed to by <i>dptr</i>.

       A database shall be stored in one or two files. When one file is
       used, the name of the database file shall be formed by appending
       the suffix <b>.db </b>to the <i>file</i> argument given to <i>dbm_open</i>().  When
       two files are used, the names of the database files shall be
       formed by appending the suffixes <b>.dir </b>and <b>.pag </b>respectively to
       the <i>file</i> argument.

       The <i>dbm_open</i>() function shall open a database. The <i>file</i> argument
       to the function is the pathname of the database. The <i>open_flags</i>
       argument has the same meaning as the <i>flags</i> argument of <i>open</i>()
       except that a database opened for write-only access opens the
       files for read and write access and the behavior of the O_APPEND
       flag is unspecified. The <i>file_mode</i> argument has the same meaning
       as the third argument of <i>open</i>().

       The <i>dbm_open</i>() function need not accept pathnames longer than
       {PATH_MAX}-4 bytes (including the terminating null), or pathnames
       with a last component longer than {NAME_MAX}-4 bytes (excluding
       the terminating null).

       The <i>dbm_close</i>() function shall close a database. The application
       shall ensure that argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a <b>dbm </b>structure
       that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().

       These database functions shall support an internal block size
       large enough to support key/content pairs of at least 1023 bytes.

       The <i>dbm_fetch</i>() function shall read a record from a database. The
       argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure that has been
       returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().  The argument <i>key</i> is a <b>datum</b>
       that has been initialized by the application to the value of the
       key that matches the key of the record the program is fetching.

       The <i>dbm_store</i>() function shall write a record to a database. The
       argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure that has been
       returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().  The argument <i>key</i> is a <b>datum</b>
       that has been initialized by the application to the value of the
       key that identifies (for subsequent reading, writing, or
       deleting) the record the application is writing. The argument
       <i>content</i> is a <b>datum </b>that has been initialized by the application
       to the value of the record the program is writing. The argument
       <i>store_mode</i> controls whether <i>dbm_store</i>() replaces any pre-existing
       record that has the same key that is specified by the <i>key</i>
       argument. The application shall set <i>store_mode</i> to either
       DBM_INSERT or DBM_REPLACE. If the database contains a record that
       matches the <i>key</i> argument and <i>store_mode</i> is DBM_REPLACE, the
       existing record shall be replaced with the new record. If the
       database contains a record that matches the <i>key</i> argument and
       <i>store_mode</i> is DBM_INSERT, the existing record shall be left
       unchanged and the new record ignored. If the database does not
       contain a record that matches the <i>key</i> argument and <i>store_mode</i> is
       either DBM_INSERT or DBM_REPLACE, the new record shall be
       inserted in the database.

       If the sum of a key/content pair exceeds the internal block size,
       the result is unspecified. Moreover, the application shall ensure
       that all key/content pairs that hash together fit on a single
       block. The <i>dbm_store</i>() function shall return an error in the
       event that a disk block fills with inseparable data.

       The <i>dbm_delete</i>() function shall delete a record and its key from
       the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database
       structure that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().  The
       argument <i>key</i> is a <b>datum </b>that has been initialized by the
       application to the value of the key that identifies the record
       the program is deleting.

       The <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() function shall return the first key in the
       database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure
       that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().

       The <i>dbm_nextkey</i>() function shall return the next key in the
       database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure
       that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().  The
       application shall ensure that the <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() function is
       called before calling <i>dbm_nextkey</i>().  Subsequent calls to
       <i>dbm_nextkey</i>() return the next key until all of the keys in the
       database have been returned.

       The <i>dbm_error</i>() function shall return the error condition of the
       database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure
       that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().

       The <i>dbm_clearerr</i>() function shall clear the error condition of
       the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database
       structure that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().

       The <i>dptr</i> pointers returned by these functions may point into
       static storage that may be changed by subsequent calls.

       These functions need not be thread-safe.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>dbm_store</i>() and <i>dbm_delete</i>() functions shall return 0 when
       they succeed and a negative value when they fail.

       The <i>dbm_store</i>() function shall return 1 if it is called with a
       <i>flags</i> value of DBM_INSERT and the function finds an existing
       record with the same key.

       The <i>dbm_error</i>() function shall return 0 if the error condition is
       not set and return a non-zero value if the error condition is
       set.

       The return value of <i>dbm_clearerr</i>() is unspecified.

       The <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() and <i>dbm_nextkey</i>() functions shall return a key
       <b>datum</b>.  When the end of the database is reached, the <i>dptr</i> member
       of the key is a null pointer. If an error is detected, the <i>dptr</i>
       member of the key shall be a null pointer and the error condition
       of the database shall be set.

       The <i>dbm_fetch</i>() function shall return a content <b>datum</b>.  If no
       record in the database matches the key or if an error condition
       has been detected in the database, the <i>dptr</i> member of the content
       shall be a null pointer.

       The <i>dbm_open</i>() function shall return a pointer to a database
       structure. If an error is detected during the operation,
       <i>dbm_open</i>() shall return a (<b>DBM *</b>)0.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The following code can be used to traverse the database:

           for(key = dbm_firstkey(db); key.dptr != NULL; key = dbm_nextkey(db))

       The <i>dbm_</i>* functions provided in this library should not be
       confused in any way with those of a general-purpose database
       management system. These functions do not provide for multiple
       search keys per entry, they do not protect against multi-user
       access (in other words they do not lock records or files), and
       they do not provide the many other useful database functions that
       are found in more robust database management systems. Creating
       and updating databases by use of these functions is relatively
       slow because of data copies that occur upon hash collisions.
       These functions are useful for applications requiring fast lookup
       of relatively static information that is to be indexed by a
       single key.

       Note that a strictly conforming application is extremely limited
       by these functions: since there is no way to determine that the
       keys in use do not all hash to the same value (although that
       would be rare), a strictly conforming application cannot be
       guaranteed that it can store more than one block's worth of data
       in the database. As long as a key collision does not occur,
       additional data may be stored, but because there is no way to
       determine whether an error is due to a key collision or some
       other error condition (<i>dbm_error</i>() being effectively a Boolean),
       once an error is detected, the application is effectively limited
       to guessing what the error might be if it wishes to continue
       using these functions.

       The <i>dbm_delete</i>() function need not physically reclaim file space,
       although it does make it available for reuse by the database.

       After calling <i>dbm_store</i>() or <i>dbm_delete</i>() during a pass through
       the keys by <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() and <i>dbm_nextkey</i>(), the application
       should reset the database by calling <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() before again
       calling <i>dbm_nextkey</i>().  The contents of these files are
       unspecified and may not be portable.

       Applications should take care that database pathname arguments
       specified to <i>dbm_open</i>() are not prefixes of unrelated files. This
       might be done, for example, by placing databases in a separate
       directory.

       Since some implementations use three characters for a suffix and
       others use four characters for a suffix, applications should
       ensure that the maximum portable pathname length passed to
       <i>dbm_open</i>() is no greater than {PATH_MAX}-4 bytes, with the last
       component of the pathname no greater than {NAME_MAX}-4 bytes.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Previously the standard required the database to be stored in two
       files, one file being a directory containing a bitmap of keys and
       having <b>.dir </b>as its suffix. The second file containing all data
       and having <b>.pag </b>as its suffix. This has been changed not to
       specify the use of the files and to allow newer implementations
       of the Berkeley DB interface using a single file that have
       evolved while remaining compatible with the application
       programming interface. The standard developers considered
       removing the specific suffixes altogether but decided to retain
       them so as not to pollute the application file name space more
       than necessary and to allow for portable backups of the database.
