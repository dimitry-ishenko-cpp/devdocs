NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stapvars - systemtap variables
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The following sections enumerate the public variables provided by
       standard tapsets installed, (the installation path is show in the
       stappaths (7) manual page).  Each variable is described with a
       type, and its behavior/restrictions.  The syntax is the same as
       printed with the <i>stap</i> option <i>-p2</i>.  Examples:

       example1:long
              Variable "example1" contains an integer.

       example2:string [long]
              Variable "example2" is an array of strings, indexed by
              integers.

   <b>ARGV</b>
       argc:long
              Contains the value of the $# value: the number of command
              line arguments passed to the systemtap script.  It is
              initialized with an implicit begin(-1) probe.

       argv:string [long]
              Contains each command line argument as a string.  argv[1]
              will equal @1 if there was at least one command line
              argument.  Arguments beyond #32 are not transcribed, and
              produce a warning message within the begin(-1) probe that
              initializes this array.

   <b>NULL</b>
       NULL:long
              Simply defined as the number 0.
