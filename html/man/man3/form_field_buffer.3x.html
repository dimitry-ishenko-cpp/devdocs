DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The function <b>set_field_buffer </b>sets the numbered buffer of the
       given field to contain a given string:

          •   Buffer 0 is the displayed value of the field.

          •   Other numbered buffers may be allocated by applications
              through the <b>nbuf </b>argument of (see <b>form_field_new</b>(3X)) but
              are not manipulated by the forms library.

       The function <b>field_buffer </b>returns a pointer to the contents of
       the given numbered buffer:

          •   The buffer contents always have the same length, and are
              padded with trailing spaces as needed to ensure this
              length is the same.

          •   The buffer may contain leading spaces, depending on how it
              was set.

          •   The buffer contents are set with <b>set_field_buffer</b>, or as a
              side effect of any editing operations on the corresponding
              field.

          •   Editing operations are based on the <i>window</i> which displays
              the field, rather than a <i>string</i>.  The window contains only
              printable characters, and is filled with blanks.  If you
              want the raw data, you must write your own routine that
              copies the value out of the buffer and removes the leading
              and trailing spaces.

          •   Because editing operations change the content of the
              buffer to correspond to the window, you should not rely on
              using buffers for long-term storage of form data.

       The function <b>set_field_status </b>sets the associated status flag of
       <i>field</i>; <b>field_status </b>gets the current value.  The status flag is
       set to a nonzero value whenever the field changes.

       The function <b>set_max_field </b>sets the maximum size for a dynamic
       field.  An argument of 0 turns off any maximum size threshold for
       that field.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>field_buffer </b>function returns NULL on error.  It sets <b>errno</b>
       according to their success:

       <b>E_OK </b>The routine succeeded.

       <b>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</b>
            Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

       The <b>field_status </b>function returns <b>TRUE </b>or <b>FALSE</b>.

       The remaining routines return one of the following:

       <b>E_OK </b>The routine succeeded.

       <b>E_SYSTEM_ERROR</b>
            System error occurred (see <a href="errno.3.html">errno(3)</a>).

       <b>E_BAD_ARGUMENT</b>
            Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The header file <b>&lt;form.h&gt; </b>automatically includes the header file

       When configured for wide characters, <b>field_buffer </b>returns a
       pointer to temporary storage (allocated and freed by the
       library).  The application should not attempt to modify the data.
       It will be freed on the next call to <b>field_buffer </b>to return the
       same buffer.  <b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b>.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
       supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

       The <b>set_max_field </b>function checks for an ncurses extension
       <b>O_INPUT_FIELD </b>which allows a dynamic field to shrink if the new
       limit is smaller than the current field size.
