NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_sm_setcred - PAM service function to alter credentials
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;security/pam_modules.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pam_sm_setcred(pam_handle_t *</b><i>pamh</i><b>, int </b><i>flags</i><b>, int </b><i>argc</i><b>,</b>
                          <b>const char **</b><i>argv</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pam_sm_setcred </b>function is the service module's
       implementation of the <a href="pam_setcred.3.html">pam_setcred(3)</a> interface.

       This function performs the task of altering the credentials of
       the user with respect to the corresponding authorization scheme.
       Generally, an authentication module may have access to more
       information about a user than their authentication token. This
       function is used to make such information available to the
       application. It should only be called <i>after</i> the user has been
       authenticated but before a session has been established.

       Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with <i>PAM_SILENT</i>, are:

       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.

       PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED
           Initialize the credentials for the user.

       PAM_DELETE_CRED
           Delete the credentials associated with the authentication
           service.

       PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED
           Reinitialize the user credentials.

       PAM_REFRESH_CRED
           Extend the lifetime of the user credentials.

       The way the <b>auth </b>stack is navigated in order to evaluate the
       <b>pam_setcred</b>() function call, independent of the <b>pam_sm_setcred</b>()
       return codes, is exactly the same way that it was navigated when
       evaluating the <b>pam_authenticate</b>() library call. Typically, if a
       stack entry was ignored in evaluating <b>pam_authenticate</b>(), it will
       be ignored when libpam evaluates the <b>pam_setcred</b>() function call.
       Otherwise, the return codes from each module specific
       <b>pam_sm_setcred</b>() call are treated as <b>required</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL
           This module cannot retrieve the user's credentials.

       PAM_CRED_EXPIRED
           The user's credentials have expired.

       PAM_CRED_ERR
           This module was unable to set the credentials of the user.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           The user credential was successfully set.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
           The user is not known to this authentication module.

       These, non-<i>PAM_SUCCESS</i>, return values will typically lead to the
       credential stack <i>failing</i>. The first such error will dominate in
       the return value of <b>pam_setcred</b>().
