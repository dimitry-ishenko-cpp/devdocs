<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy, posix_spawn_file_actions_init —
       destroy and initialize spawn file actions object (<b>ADVANCED</b>
       <b>REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;spawn.h&gt;

       int posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
           *<i>file_actions</i>);
       int posix_spawn_file_actions_init(posix_spawn_file_actions_t
           *<i>file_actions</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy</i>() function shall destroy the
       object referenced by <i>file_actions</i>; the object becomes, in effect,
       uninitialized. An implementation may cause
       <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy</i>() to set the object referenced
       by <i>file_actions</i> to an invalid value. A destroyed spawn file
       actions object can be reinitialized using
       <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_init</i>(); the results of otherwise
       referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.

       The <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_init</i>() function shall initialize the
       object referenced by <i>file_actions</i> to contain no file actions for
       <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() to perform.

       A spawn file actions object is as defined in
       <a href="posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose.3p.html">posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(3p)</a>.

       The effect of initializing an already initialized spawn file
       actions object is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_init</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory exists to initialize the spawn file
              actions object.

       The <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value specified by <i>file_actions</i> is invalid.

       provided on all implementations.
