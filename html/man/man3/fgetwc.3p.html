PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fgetwc — get a wide-character code from a stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wint_t fgetwc(FILE *<i>stream</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fgetwc</i>() function shall obtain the next character (if
       present) from the input stream pointed to by <i>stream</i>, convert that
       to the corresponding wide-character code, and advance the
       associated file position indicator for the stream (if defined).

       If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position
       indicator for the stream is unspecified.

       The <i>fgetwc</i>() function may mark the last data access timestamp of
       the file associated with <i>stream</i> for update. The last data access
       timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful
       execution of <i>fgetwc</i>(), <i>fgetws</i>(), <i>fwscanf</i>(), <i>getwc</i>(), <i>getwchar</i>(),
       <i>vfwscanf</i>(), <i>vwscanf</i>(), or <i>wscanf</i>() using <i>stream</i> that returns data
       not supplied by a prior call to <i>ungetwc</i>().

       The <i>fgetwc</i>() function shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>fgetwc</i>() function shall return
       the wide-character code of the character read from the input
       stream pointed to by <i>stream</i> converted to a type <b>wint_t</b>.  If the
       end-of-file indicator for the stream is set, or if the stream is
       at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream shall be
       set and <i>fgetwc</i>() shall return WEOF. If a read error occurs, the
       error indicator for the stream shall be set, <i>fgetwc</i>() shall
       return WEOF, and shall set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.  If an
       encoding error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall
       be set, <i>fgetwc</i>() shall return WEOF, and shall set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fgetwc</i>() function shall fail if data needs to be read and:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor
              underlying <i>stream</i> and the thread would be delayed in the
              <i>fgetwc</i>() operation.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The file descriptor underlying <i>stream</i> is not a valid file
              descriptor open for reading.

       <b>EILSEQ </b>The data obtained from the input stream does not form a
              valid character.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a
              signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EIO    </b>A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is in a
              background process group attempting to read from its
              controlling terminal, and either the calling thread is
              blocking SIGTTIN or the process is ignoring SIGTTIN or the
              process group of the process is orphaned.  This error may
              also be generated for implementation-defined reasons.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to read
              at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
              corresponding stream.

       The <i>fgetwc</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

       <b>ENXIO  </b>A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request
              was outside the capabilities of the device.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ferror</i>() or <i>feof</i>() functions must be used to distinguish
       between an error condition and an end-of-file condition.
