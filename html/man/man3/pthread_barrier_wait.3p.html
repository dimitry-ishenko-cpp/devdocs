PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_barrier_wait — synchronize at a barrier
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_barrier_wait(pthread_barrier_t *<i>barrier</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() function shall synchronize
       participating threads at the barrier referenced by <i>barrier</i>.  The
       calling thread shall block until the required number of threads
       have called <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() specifying the barrier.

       When the required number of threads have called
       <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() specifying the barrier, the constant
       PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD shall be returned to one
       unspecified thread and zero shall be returned to each of the
       remaining threads. At this point, the barrier shall be reset to
       the state it had as a result of the most recent
       <i>pthread_barrier_init</i>() function that referenced it.

       The constant PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD is defined in
       <i>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</i> and its value shall be distinct from any other value
       returned by <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>().

       The results are undefined if this function is called with an
       uninitialized barrier.

       If a signal is delivered to a thread blocked on a barrier, upon
       return from the signal handler the thread shall resume waiting at
       the barrier if the barrier wait has not completed (that is, if
       the required number of threads have not arrived at the barrier
       during the execution of the signal handler); otherwise, the
       thread shall continue as normal from the completed barrier wait.
       Until the thread in the signal handler returns from it, it is
       unspecified whether other threads may proceed past the barrier
       once they have all reached it.

       A thread that has blocked on a barrier shall not prevent any
       unblocked thread that is eligible to use the same processing
       resources from eventually making forward progress in its
       execution. Eligibility for processing resources shall be
       determined by the scheduling policy.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() function
       shall return PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD for a single
       (arbitrary) thread synchronized at the barrier and zero for each
       of the other threads. Otherwise, an error number shall be
       returned to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications using this function may be subject to priority
       inversion, as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.291</i>, <i>Priority Inversion</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>barrier</i> argument to <i>pthread_barrier_wait</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized barrier object, it is recommended that the function
       should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
