       misc_conv - text based conversation function

SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;security/pam_misc.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int misc_conv(int </b><i>num_msg</i><b>, const struct pam_message **</b><i>msgm</i><b>,</b>
                     <b>struct pam_response **</b><i>response</i><b>, void *</b><i>appdata_ptr</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>misc_conv </b>function is part of <b>libpam_misc </b>and not of the
       standard <b>libpam </b>library. This function will prompt the user with
       the appropriate comments and obtain the appropriate inputs as
       directed by authentication modules.

       In addition to simply slotting into the appropriate <a href="pam_conv.3.html">pam_conv(3)</a>,
       this function provides some time-out facilities. The function
       exports five variables that can be used by an application
       programmer to limit the amount of time this conversation function
       will spend waiting for the user to type something. The five
       variables are as follows:

       <b>time_t </b><i>pam_misc_conv_warn_time</i>;
           This variable contains the <i>time</i> (as returned by <a href="../man2/time.2.html">time(2)</a>) that
           the user should be first warned that the clock is ticking. By
           default it has the value 0, which indicates that no such
           warning will be given. The application may set its value to
           sometime in the future, but this should be done prior to
           passing control to the <i>Linux-PAM</i> library.

       <b>const char *</b><i>pam_misc_conv_warn_line</i>;
           Used in conjunction with <i>pam_misc_conv_warn_time</i>, this
           variable is a pointer to the string that will be displayed
           when it becomes time to warn the user that the timeout is
           approaching. Its default value is a translated version of
           “...Time is running out...”, but this can be changed by the
           application prior to passing control to <i>Linux-PAM</i>.

       <b>time_t </b><i>pam_misc_conv_die_time</i>;
           This variable contains the <i>time</i> (as returned by <a href="../man2/time.2.html">time(2)</a>) that
           the will time out. By default it has the value 0, which
           indicates that the conversation function will not timeout.
           The application may set its value to sometime in the future,
           but this should be done prior to passing control to the
           <i>Linux-PAM</i> library.

       <b>const char *</b><i>pam_misc_conv_die_line</i>;
           Used in conjunction with <i>pam_misc_conv_die_time</i>, this
           variable is a pointer to the string that will be displayed
           when the conversation times out. Its default value is a
           translated version of “...Sorry, your time is up!”, but this
           can be changed by the application prior to passing control to
           <i>Linux-PAM</i>.

       <b>int </b><i>pam_misc_conv_died</i>;
           Following a return from the <i>Linux-PAM</i> library, the value of
           this variable indicates whether the conversation has timed
           out. A value of 1 indicates the time-out occurred.

       The following two function pointers are available for supporting
       binary prompts in the conversation function. They are optimized
       for the current incarnation of the <b>libpamc </b>library and are
       subject to change.

       <b>int </b><i>(*pam_binary_handler_fn)</i>(<b>void *</b><i>appdata</i>, <b>pamc_bp_t *</b><i>prompt_p</i>);
           This function pointer is initialized to NULL but can be
           filled with a function that provides machine-machine (hidden)
           message exchange. It is intended for use with hidden
           authentication protocols such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman key
           exchanges. (This is still under development.)

       <b>int </b><i>(*pam_binary_handler_free)</i>(<b>void *</b><i>appdata</i>, <b>pamc_bp_t</b>
       <b>*</b><i>delete_me</i>);
           This function pointer is initialized to
           <b>PAM_BP_RENEW(delete_me, 0, 0)</b>, but can be redefined as
           desired by the application.
