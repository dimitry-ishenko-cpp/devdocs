DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The  <i>curses trace</i> routines are used for debugging the ncurses li‐
       braries, as well as applications which use the ncurses libraries.
       Some limitations apply:

       •   Aside from <b>curses_trace</b>, the other functions are normally
           available only with the debugging library e.g., <b>libncurs‐</b>
           <b>es_g.a</b>.

           All of the trace functions may be compiled into any model
           (shared, static, profile) by defining the symbol <b>TRACE</b>.

       •   Additionally, the functions which use <b>cchar_t </b>are only avail‐
           able with the wide-character configuration of the libraries.

   <b>Functions</b>
       The principal parts of this interface are

       •   <b>curses_trace</b>, which selectively enables different tracing
           features, and

       •   <b>_tracef</b>, which writes formatted data to the <i>trace</i> file.

           The other functions either return a pointer to a string-area
           (allocated by the corresponding function), or return no value
           (such as <b>_tracedump</b>, which implements the screen dump for
           <b>TRACE_UPDATE</b>).  The caller should not free these strings,
           since the allocation is reused on successive calls.  To work
           around the problem of a single string-area per function, some
           use a buffer-number parameter, telling the library to allo‐
           cate additional string-areas.

       The <b>curses_trace </b>function is always available, whether or not the
       other trace functions are available:

       •   If tracing is available, calling <b>curses_trace </b>with a nonzero
           parameter updates the trace mask, and returns the previous
           trace mask.

           When the trace mask is nonzero, ncurses creates the file
           “trace” in the current directory for output.  If the file al‐
           ready exists, no tracing is done.

       •   If tracing is not available, <b>curses_trace </b>returns zero (0).

   <b>Trace Parameter</b>
       The trace parameter is formed by OR'ing values from the list of
       <b>TRACE_</b><i>xxx</i> definitions in <b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b>.  These include:

       <b>TRACE_DISABLE</b>
            turn off tracing by passing a zero parameter.

            The library flushes the output file, but retains an open
            file-descriptor to the trace file so that it can resume
            tracing later if a nonzero parameter is passed to the <b>curs‐</b>
            <b>es_trace </b>function.

       <b>TRACE_TIMES</b>
            trace user and system times of updates.

       <b>TRACE_TPUTS</b>
            trace <b>tputs</b>(3X) calls.

       <b>TRACE_UPDATE</b>
            trace update actions, old &amp; new screens.

       <b>TRACE_MOVE</b>
            trace cursor movement and scrolling.

       <b>TRACE_CHARPUT</b>
            trace all character outputs.

       <b>TRACE_ORDINARY</b>
            trace all update actions.  The old and new screen contents
            are written to the trace file for each refresh.

       <b>TRACE_CALLS</b>
            trace all curses calls.  The parameters for each call are
            traced, as well as return values.

       <b>TRACE_VIRTPUT</b>
            trace virtual character puts, i.e., calls to <b>addch</b>.

       <b>TRACE_IEVENT</b>
            trace low-level input processing, including timeouts.

       <b>TRACE_BITS</b>
            trace state of TTY control bits.

       <b>TRACE_ICALLS</b>
            trace internal/nested calls.

       <b>TRACE_CCALLS</b>
            trace per-character calls.

       <b>TRACE_DATABASE</b>
            trace read/write of terminfo/termcap data.

       <b>TRACE_ATTRS</b>
            trace changes to video attributes and colors.

       <b>TRACE_MAXIMUM</b>
            maximum trace level, enables all of the separate trace fea‐
            tures.

       Some tracing features are enabled whenever the <b>curses_trace </b>para‐
       meter is nonzero.  Some features overlap.  The specific names are
       used as a guideline.

   <b>Initialization</b>
       These functions check the <b>NCURSES_TRACE </b>environment variable, to
       set the tracing feature as if <b>curses_trace </b>was called:

           filter, initscr, new_prescr, newterm, nofilter, restartterm,
           ripoffline, setupterm, slk_init, tgetent, use_env,
           use_extended_names, use_tioctl

   <b>Command-line Utilities</b>
       The command-line utilities such as <b>tic</b>(1) provide a  verbose  op‐
       tion  which  extends  the set of messages written using the <b>curs‐</b>
       <b>es_trace </b>function.  Both of these (<b>-v </b>and <b>curses_trace</b>)  use  the
       same  variable (<b>_nc_tracing</b>), which determines the messages which
       are written.

       Because the command-line utilities may call initialization  func‐
       tions  such  as <b>setupterm</b>, <b>tgetent </b>or <b>use_extended_names</b>, some of
       their debugging output may be directed to the <i>trace</i> file  if  the
       <b>NCURSES_TRACE </b>environment variable is set:

       •   messages produced in the utility are written to the standard
           error.

       •   messages produced by the underlying library are written to
           <i>trace</i>.

       If ncurses is built without tracing, none of the latter are pro‐
       duced, and fewer diagnostics are provided by the command-line
       utilities.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Routines which return a value are designed to be used as parame‐
       ters to the <b>_tracef </b>routine.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are not part of the XSI interface.  Some other
       curses implementations are known to have similar features, but
       they are not compatible with ncurses:

       •   SVr4 provided <b>traceon </b>and <b>traceoff</b>, to control whether debug‐
           ging information was written to the “trace” file.  While the
           functions were always available, this feature was only en‐
           abled if <b>DEBUG </b>was defined when building the library.

           The SVr4 tracing feature is undocumented.

       •   PDCurses provides <b>traceon </b>and <b>traceoff</b>, which (like SVr4) are
           always available, and enable tracing to the “trace” file only
           when a debug-library is built.

           PDCurses has a short description of these functions, with a
           note that they are not present in X/Open Curses, ncurses or
           NetBSD.  It does not mention SVr4, but the functions' inclu‐
           sion in a header file section labeled “Quasi-standard” hints
           at the origin.

       •   NetBSD does not provide functions for enabling/disabling
           traces.  It uses environment variables <b>CURSES_TRACE_MASK </b>and
           <b>CURSES_TRACE_FILE </b>to determine what is traced, and where the
           results are written.  This is available only when a debug-li‐
           brary is built.

           The NetBSD tracing feature is undocumented.

       A few ncurses functions are not provided when symbol versioning
       is used:

           _nc_tracebits, _tracedump, _tracemouse

       The original <b>trace </b>routine was deprecated because it often con‐
       flicted with application names.
