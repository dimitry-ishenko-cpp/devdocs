       <b>#include &lt;attr/attributes.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int attr_get (const char *</b><i>path</i><b>, const char *</b><i>attrname</i><b>,</b>
                     <b>char *</b><i>attrvalue</i><b>, int *</b><i>valuelength</i><b>, int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>attr_get </b>and <b>attr_getf </b>functions provide a way to retrieve
       the value of an attribute.

       <i>Path</i> points to a path name for a filesystem object, and <i>fd</i> refers
       to the file descriptor associated with a file.  If the attribute
       <i>attrname</i> exists, the value associated with it will be copied into
       the <i>attrvalue</i> buffer.  The <i>valuelength</i> argument is an
       input/output argument that on the call to <b>attr_get </b>should contain
       the maximum size of attribute value the process is willing to
       accept.  On return, the <i>valuelength</i> will have been modified to
       show the actual size of the attribute value returned.  The <i>flags</i>
       argument can contain the following symbols bitwise OR'ed
       together:

       ATTR_ROOT
              Look for <i>attrname</i> in the <b>root </b>address space, not in the
              <b>user </b>address space.  (limited to use by super-user only)

       ATTR_DONTFOLLOW
              Do not follow symbolic links when resolving a <i>path</i> on an
              <b>attr_get </b>function call.  The default is to follow symbolic
              links.

       <b>attr_get </b>will fail if one or more of the following are true:

       [ENOATTR]
              The attribute name given is not associated with the
              indicated filesystem object.

       [E2BIG]
              The value of the given attribute is too large to fit into
              the buffer.  The integer that the <i>valuelength</i> argument
              points to has been modified to show the actual number of
              bytes that would be required to store the value of that
              attribute.

       [ENOENT]
              The named file does not exist.

       [EPERM]
              The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file
              and the effective user ID is not super-user.

       [ENOTDIR]
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       [EACCES]
              Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix.

       [EINVAL]
              A bit was set in the <i>flag</i> argument that is not defined for
              this system call.

       [EFAULT]
              <i>Path, attrname, attrvalue,</i> or <i>valuelength</i> points outside
              the allocated address space of the process.

       [ELOOP]
              A path name lookup involved too many symbolic links.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]
              The length of <i>path</i> exceeds {<i>MAXPATHLEN</i>}, or a pathname
              component is longer than {<i>MAXNAMELEN</i>}.

       <b>attr_getf </b>will fail if:

       [ENOATTR]
              The attribute name given is not associated with the
              indicated filesystem object.

       [E2BIG]
              The value of the given attribute is too large to fit into
              the buffer.  The integer that the <i>valuelength</i> argument
              points to has been modified to show the actual number of
              bytes that would be required to store the value of that
              attribute.

       [EINVAL]
              A bit was set in the <i>flag</i> argument that is not defined for
              this system call, or <i>fd</i> refers to a socket, not a file.

       [EFAULT]
              <i>Attrname, attrvalue,</i> or <i>valuelength</i> points outside the
              allocated address space of the process.

       [EBADF]
              <i>Fd</i> does not refer to a valid descriptor.

DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set appropriately.
