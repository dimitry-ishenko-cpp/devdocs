DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>General note</i>: Most programs should use mutexes instead of spin
       locks.  Spin locks are primarily useful in conjunction with real-
       time scheduling policies.  See NOTES.

       The <b>pthread_spin_init</b>() function allocates any resources required
       for the use of the spin lock referred to by <i>lock</i> and initializes
       the lock to be in the unlocked state.  The <i>pshared</i> argument must
       have one of the following values:

       <b>PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE</b>
              The spin lock is to be operated on only by threads in the
              same process as the thread that calls <b>pthread_spin_init</b>().
              (Attempting to share the spin lock between processes
              results in undefined behavior.)

       <b>PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED</b>
              The spin lock may be operated on by any thread in any
              process that has access to the memory containing the lock
              (i.e., the lock may be in a shared memory object that is
              shared among multiple processes).

       Calling <b>pthread_spin_init</b>() on a spin lock that has already been
       initialized results in undefined behavior.

       The <b>pthread_spin_destroy</b>() function destroys a previously
       initialized spin lock, freeing any resources that were allocated
       for that lock.  Destroying a spin lock that has not been
       previously been initialized or destroying a spin lock while
       another thread holds the lock results in undefined behavior.

       Once a spin lock has been destroyed, performing any operation on
       the lock other than once more initializing it with
       <b>pthread_spin_init</b>() results in undefined behavior.

       The result of performing operations such as <a href="pthread_spin_lock.3.html">pthread_spin_lock(3)</a>,
       <a href="pthread_spin_unlock.3.html">pthread_spin_unlock(3)</a>, and <b>pthread_spin_destroy</b>() on <i>copies</i> of
       the object referred to by <i>lock</i> is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, there functions return zero.  On failure, they return
       an error number.  In the event that <b>pthread_spin_init</b>() fails,
       the lock is not initialized.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pthread_spin_init</b>() may fail with the following errors:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The system has insufficient resources to initialize a new
              spin lock.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory to initialize the spin lock.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1-2008.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       glibc 2.2.  POSIX.1-2001.

       Support for process-shared spin locks is a POSIX option.  The
       option is supported in the glibc implementation.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Spin locks should be employed in conjunction with real-time
       scheduling policies (<b>SCHED_FIFO</b>, or possibly <b>SCHED_RR</b>).  Use of
       spin locks with nondeterministic scheduling policies such as
       <b>SCHED_OTHER </b>probably indicates a design mistake.  The problem is
       that if a thread operating under such a policy is scheduled off
       the CPU while it holds a spin lock, then other threads will waste
       time spinning on the lock until the lock holder is once more
       rescheduled and releases the lock.

       If threads create a deadlock situation while employing spin
       locks, those threads will spin forever consuming CPU time.

       User-space spin locks are <i>not</i> applicable as a general locking
       solution.  They are, by definition, prone to priority inversion
       and unbounded spin times.  A programmer using spin locks must be
       exceptionally careful not only in the code, but also in terms of
       system configuration, thread placement, and priority assignment.
