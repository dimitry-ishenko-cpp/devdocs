PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_cancel — cancel execution of a thread
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_cancel(pthread_t <i>thread</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function shall request that <i>thread</i> be
       canceled. The target thread's cancelability state and type
       determines when the cancellation takes effect. When the
       cancellation is acted on, the cancellation cleanup handlers for
       <i>thread</i> shall be called. When the last cancellation cleanup
       handler returns, the thread-specific data destructor functions
       shall be called for <i>thread</i>.  When the last destructor function
       returns, <i>thread</i> shall be terminated.

       The cancellation processing in the target thread shall run
       asynchronously with respect to the calling thread returning from
       <i>pthread_cancel</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function shall not return an error code of
       <b>[EINTR]</b>.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Two alternative functions were considered for sending the
       cancellation notification to a thread. One would be to define a
       new SIGCANCEL signal that had the cancellation semantics when
       delivered; the other was to define the new <i>pthread_cancel</i>()
       function, which would trigger the cancellation semantics.

       The advantage of a new signal was that so much of the delivery
       criteria were identical to that used when trying to deliver a
       signal that making cancellation notification a signal was seen as
       consistent. Indeed, many implementations implement cancellation
       using a special signal. On the other hand, there would be no
       signal functions that could be used with this signal except
       <i>pthread_kill</i>(), and the behavior of the delivered cancellation
       signal would be unlike any previously existing defined signal.

       The benefits of a special function include the recognition that
       this signal would be defined because of the similar delivery
       criteria and that this is the only common behavior between a
       cancellation request and a signal. In addition, the cancellation
       delivery mechanism does not have to be implemented as a signal.
       There are also strong, if not stronger, parallels with language
       exception mechanisms than with signals that are potentially
       obscured if the delivery mechanism is visibly closer to signals.

       In the end, it was considered that as there were so many
       exceptions to the use of the new signal with existing signals
       functions it would be misleading. A special function has resolved
       this problem.  This function was carefully defined so that an
       implementation wishing to provide the cancellation functions on
       top of signals could do so.  The special function also means that
       implementations are not obliged to implement cancellation with
       signals.

       If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of
       its lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and
       report an <b>[ESRCH] </b>error.
