NAME </h2>
<pre>
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)
</pre> <h2>
PCRE2 REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY </h2>
<pre>

       The full syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that are
       supported by PCRE2 are described in the <b>pcre2pattern</b>
       documentation. This document contains a quick-reference summary
       of the syntax.
</pre> <h2>
QUOTING </h2>
<pre>

         \x         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
         \Q...\E    treat enclosed characters as literal

       Note that white space inside \Q...\E is always treated as
       literal, even if PCRE2_EXTENDED is set, causing most other white
       space to be ignored.
</pre> <h2>
BRACED ITEMS </h2>
<pre>

       With one exception, wherever brace characters { and } are
       required to enclose data for constructions such as \g{2} or
       \k{name}, space and/or horizontal tab characters that follow { or
       precede } are allowed and are ignored. In the case of
       quantifiers, they may also appear before or after the comma. The
       exception is \u{...} which is not Perl-compatible and is
       recognized only when PCRE2_EXTRA_ALT_BSUX is set. This is an
       ECMAScript compatibility feature, and follows ECMAScript's
       behaviour.
</pre> <h2>
ESCAPED CHARACTERS </h2>
<pre>

       This table applies to ASCII and Unicode environments. An
       unrecognized escape sequence causes an error.

         \a         alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
         \cx        "control-x", where x is a non-control ASCII
       character
         \e         escape (hex 1B)
         \f         form feed (hex 0C)
         \n         newline (hex 0A)
         \r         carriage return (hex 0D)
         \t         tab (hex 09)
         \0dd       character with octal code 0dd
         \ddd       character with octal code ddd, or backreference
         \o{ddd..}  character with octal code ddd..
         \N{U+hh..} character with Unicode code point hh.. (Unicode mode
       only)
         \xhh       character with hex code hh
         \x{hh..}   character with hex code hh..

       If PCRE2_ALT_BSUX or PCRE2_EXTRA_ALT_BSUX is set ("ALT_BSUX
       mode"), the following are also recognized:

         \U         the character "U"
         \uhhhh     character with hex code hhhh
         \u{hh..}   character with hex code hh.. but only for
       EXTRA_ALT_BSUX

       When \x is not followed by {, from zero to two hexadecimal digits
       are read, but in ALT_BSUX mode \x must be followed by two
       hexadecimal digits to be recognized as a hexadecimal escape;
       otherwise it matches a literal "x".  Likewise, if \u (in ALT_BSUX
       mode) is not followed by four hexadecimal digits or (in
       EXTRA_ALT_BSUX mode) a sequence of hex digits in curly brackets,
       it matches a literal "u".

       Note that \0dd is always an octal code. The treatment of
       backslash followed by a non-zero digit is complicated; for
       details see the section "Non-printing characters" in the
       <b>pcre2pattern </b>documentation, where details of escape processing in
       EBCDIC environments are also given. \N{U+hh..} is synonymous with
       \x{hh..} in PCRE2 but is not supported in EBCDIC environments.
       Note that \N not followed by an opening curly bracket has a
       different meaning (see below).
</pre> <h2>
CHARACTER TYPES </h2>
<pre>

         .          any character except newline;
                      in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
         \C         one code unit, even in UTF mode (best avoided)
         \d         a decimal digit
         \D         a character that is not a decimal digit
         \h         a horizontal white space character
         \H         a character that is not a horizontal white space
       character
         \N         a character that is not a newline
         \p{<i>xx</i>}     a character with the <i>xx</i> property
         \P{<i>xx</i>}     a character without the <i>xx</i> property
         \R         a newline sequence
         \s         a white space character
         \S         a character that is not a white space character
         \v         a vertical white space character
         \V         a character that is not a vertical white space
       character
         \w         a "word" character
         \W         a "non-word" character
         \X         a Unicode extended grapheme cluster

       \C is dangerous because it may leave the current matching point
       in the middle of a UTF-8 or UTF-16 character. The application can
       lock out the use of \C by setting the PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C
       option. It is also possible to build PCRE2 with the use of \C
       permanently disabled.

       By default, \d, \s, and \w match only ASCII characters, even in
       UTF-8 mode or in the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries. However, if
       locale-specific matching is happening, \s and \w may also match
       characters with code points in the range 128-255. If the
       PCRE2_UCP option is set, the behaviour of these escape sequences
       is changed to use Unicode properties and they match many more
       characters, but there are some option settings that can restrict
       individual sequences to matching only ASCII characters.

       Property descriptions in \p and \P are matched caselessly;
       hyphens, underscores, and white space are ignored, in accordance
       with Unicode's "loose matching" rules.

       Perl and POSIX space are now the same. Perl added VT to its space
       character set at release 5.18.
</pre> <h2>
BINARY PROPERTIES FOR \p AND \P </h2>
<pre>

       Unicode defines a number of binary properties, that is,
       properties whose only values are true or false. You can obtain a
       list of those that are recognized by \p and \P, along with their
       abbreviations, by running this command:

         pcre2test -LP
</pre> <h2>
SCRIPT MATCHING WITH \p AND \P </h2>
<pre>

       Many script names and their 4-letter abbreviations are recognized
       in \p{sc:...} or \p{scx:...} items, or on their own with \p (and
       also \P of course). You can obtain a list of these scripts by
       running this command:

         pcre2test -LS
</pre> <h2>
THE BIDI_CLASS PROPERTY FOR \p AND \P </h2>

       class
         \p{BC:&lt;class&gt;}           matches a character with the given
       class

       The recognized classes are:

OPTION SETTING </h2>
<pre>
       Changes of these options within a group are automatically
       cancelled at the end of the group.

         (?a)            all ASCII options
         (?aD)           restrict \d to ASCII in UCP mode
         (?aS)           restrict \s to ASCII in UCP mode
         (?aW)           restrict \w to ASCII in UCP mode
         (?aP)           restrict all POSIX classes to ASCII in UCP mode
         (?aT)           restrict POSIX digit classes to ASCII in UCP
       mode
         (?i)            caseless
         (?J)            allow duplicate named groups
         (?m)            multiline
         (?n)            no auto capture
         (?r)            restrict caseless to either ASCII or non-ASCII
         (?s)            single line (dotall)
         (?U)            default ungreedy (lazy)
         (?x)            ignore white space except in classes or \Q...\E
         (?xx)           as (?x) but also ignore space and tab in
       classes
         (?-...)         unset the given option(s)
         (?^)            unset imnrsx options

       (?aP) implies (?aT) as well, though this has no additional
       effect. However, it means that (?-aP) is really (?-PT) which
       disables all ASCII restrictions for POSIX classes.

       Unsetting x or xx unsets both. Several options may be set at
       once, and a mixture of setting and unsetting such as (?i-x) is
       allowed, but there may be only one hyphen. Setting (but no
       unsetting) is allowed after (?^ for example (?^in). An option
       setting may appear at the start of a non-capture group, for
       example (?i:...).

       The following are recognized only at the very start of a pattern
       or after one of the newline or \R options with similar syntax.
       More than one of them may appear. For the first three, d is a
       decimal number.

         (*LIMIT_DEPTH=d) set the backtracking limit to d
         (*LIMIT_HEAP=d)  set the heap size limit to d * 1024 bytes
         (*LIMIT_MATCH=d) set the match limit to d
         (*NOTEMPTY)      set PCRE2_NOTEMPTY when matching
         (*NOTEMPTY_ATSTART) set PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART when matching
         (*NO_AUTO_POSSESS) no auto-possessification
       (PCRE2_NO_AUTO_POSSESS)
         (*NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR) no .* anchoring (PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR)
         (*NO_JIT)       disable JIT optimization
         (*NO_START_OPT) no start-match optimization
       (PCRE2_NO_START_OPTIMIZE)
         (*UTF)          set appropriate UTF mode for the library in use
         (*UCP)          set PCRE2_UCP (use Unicode properties for \d
       etc)

       Note that LIMIT_DEPTH, LIMIT_HEAP, and LIMIT_MATCH can only
       reduce the value of the limits set by the caller of <b>pcre2_match()</b>
       or <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>, not increase them. LIMIT_RECURSION is an
       obsolete synonym for LIMIT_DEPTH. The application can lock out
       the use of (*UTF) and (*UCP) by setting the PCRE2_NEVER_UTF or
       PCRE2_NEVER_UCP options, respectively, at compile time.

         (*negative_lookbehind:...)  )

       Each top-level branch of a lookbehind must have a limit for the
       number of characters it matches. If any branch can match a
       variable number of characters, the maximum for each branch is
       limited to a value set by the caller of <b>pcre2_compile() </b>or
       defaulted. The default is set when PCRE2 is built (ultimate
       default 255). If every branch matches a fixed number of
       characters, the limit for each branch is 65535 characters.

       exists.
</pre> <h2>
BACKTRACKING CONTROL </h2>
<pre>

       All backtracking control verbs may be in the form (*VERB:NAME).
       For (*MARK) the name is mandatory, for the others it is optional.
       (*SKIP) changes its behaviour if :NAME is present. The others
       just set a name for passing back to the caller, but this is not a
       name that (*SKIP) can see. The following act immediately they are
       reached:

         (*ACCEPT)       force successful match
         (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)
         (*MARK:NAME)    set name to be passed back; synonym (*:NAME)

       The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a
       backtrack to reach them. They all force a match failure, but they
       differ in what happens afterwards. Those that advance the start-
       of-match point do so only if the pattern is not anchored.

         (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
         (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
         (*SKIP)         advance to current matching position
         (*SKIP:NAME)    advance to position corresponding to an earlier
                         (*MARK:NAME); if not found, the (*SKIP) is
       ignored
         (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation

       The effect of one of these verbs in a group called as a
       subroutine is confined to the subroutine call.

       The allowed string delimiters are ` ' " ^ % # $ (which are the
       same for the start and the end), and the starting delimiter {
       matched with the ending delimiter }. To encode the ending
       delimiter within the string, double it.
