DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are an extension to the curses library.  They
       permit an application to dynamically allocate a color pair using
       the foreground/background colors rather than assign a fixed color
       pair number, and return an unused pair to the pool.

       The number of colors may be related to the number of possible
       color pairs for a given terminal, or it may not:

       •   While almost all terminals allow setting the color <i>attributes</i>
           independently, it is unlikely that your terminal allows you
           to modify the attributes of a given character cell without
           rewriting it.  That is, the foreground and background colors
           are applied as a pair.

       •   Color pairs are the curses library's way of managing a color
           palette on a terminal.  If the library does not keep track of
           the <i>combinations</i> of colors which are displayed, it will be
           inefficient.

       •   For simple terminal emulators with only a few dozen color
           combinations, it is convenient to use the maximum number of
           combinations as the limit on color pairs:

               <b>COLORS </b><i>*</i> <b>COLORS</b>

       •   Terminals which support <i>default colors</i> distinct from “ANSI
           colors” add to the possible combinations, producing this
           total:

               <i>(</i> <b>COLORS </b><i>+ 1 ) * (</i> <b>COLORS </b><i>+ 1 )</i>

       •   An application might use up to a few dozen color pairs to
           implement a predefined color scheme.

           Beyond that lies in the realm of programs using the
           foreground and background colors for “ASCII art” (or some
           other non-textual application).

           Also beyond those few dozen pairs, the required size for a
           table to represent the combinations grows rapidly with an
           increasing number of colors.

           These functions allow a developer to let the screen library
           manage color pairs.

   <b>alloc_pair</b>
       The <b>alloc_pair </b>function accepts parameters for foreground and
       background color, and checks if that color combination is already
       associated with a color pair.

       •   If the combination already exists, <b>alloc_pair </b>returns the
           existing pair.

       •   If the combination does not exist, <b>alloc_pair </b>allocates a new
           color pair and returns that.

       •   If the table fills up, <b>alloc_pair </b>discards the least-recently
           allocated entry using <b>free_pair </b>and allocates a new color
           pair.

       All of the color pairs are allocated from a table of possible
       color pairs.  The size of the table is determined by the terminfo
       <b>pairs </b>capability.  The table is shared with <b>init_pair</b>; in fact
       <b>alloc_pair </b>calls <b>init_pair </b>after updating the ncurses library's
       fast index to the colors versus color pairs.

   <b>find_pair</b>
       The <b>find_pair </b>function accepts parameters for foreground and
       background color, and checks if that color combination is already
       associated with a color pair, returning the pair number if it has
       been allocated.  Otherwise it returns -1.

   <b>free_pair</b>
       Marks the given color pair as unused, i.e., like color pair 0.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>alloc_pair </b>function returns a color pair number in the range
       1 through <b>COLOR_PAIRS</b>-1, unless it encounters an error updating
       its fast index to the color pair values, preventing it from
       allocating a color pair.  In that case, it returns -1.

       The <b>find_pair </b>function returns a color pair number if the given
       color combination has been associated with a color pair, or -1 if
       not.

       Likewise, <b>free_pair </b>returns <b>OK </b>unless it encounters an error
       updating the fast index or if no such color pair is in use.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported
       on Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended
       that any code depending on them be conditioned using
       NCURSES_VERSION.
