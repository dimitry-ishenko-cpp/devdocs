NAME </h2>
<pre>
       accept — accept a new connection on a socket
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int accept(int <i>socket</i>, struct sockaddr *restrict <i>address</i>,
           socklen_t *restrict <i>address_len</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>accept</i>() function shall extract the first connection on the
       queue of pending connections, create a new socket with the same
       socket type protocol and address family as the specified socket,
       and allocate a new file descriptor for that socket. The file
       descriptor shall be allocated as described in <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>File</i>
       <i>Descriptor Allocation</i>.

       The <i>accept</i>() function takes the following arguments:

       <i>socket</i>      Specifies a socket that was created with <i>socket</i>(),
                   has been bound to an address with <i>bind</i>(), and has
                   issued a successful call to <i>listen</i>().

       <i>address</i>     Either a null pointer, or a pointer to a <b>sockaddr</b>
                   structure where the address of the connecting socket
                   shall be returned.

       <i>address_len</i> Either a null pointer, if <i>address</i> is a null pointer,
                   or a pointer to a <b>socklen_t </b>object which on input
                   specifies the length of the supplied <b>sockaddr</b>
                   structure, and on output specifies the length of the
                   stored address.

       If <i>address</i> is not a null pointer, the address of the peer for the
       accepted connection shall be stored in the <b>sockaddr </b>structure
       pointed to by <i>address</i>, and the length of this address shall be
       stored in the object pointed to by <i>address_len</i>.

       If the actual length of the address is greater than the length of
       the supplied <b>sockaddr </b>structure, the stored address shall be
       truncated.

       If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients, and the
       peer is not bound, then the value stored in the object pointed to
       by <i>address</i> is unspecified.

       If the listen queue is empty of connection requests and
       O_NONBLOCK is not set on the file descriptor for the socket,
       <i>accept</i>() shall block until a connection is present. If the
       <i>listen</i>() queue is empty of connection requests and O_NONBLOCK is
       set on the file descriptor for the socket, <i>accept</i>() shall fail
       and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EAGAIN] </b>or <b>[EWOULDBLOCK]</b>.

       The accepted socket cannot itself accept more connections. The
       original socket remains open and can accept more connections.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>accept</i>() shall return the non-
       negative file descriptor of the accepted socket.  Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned, <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the error, and
       any object pointed to by <i>address_len</i> shall remain unchanged.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>accept</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              O_NONBLOCK is set for the socket file descriptor and no
              connections are present to be accepted.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>socket</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNABORTED</b>
              A connection has been aborted.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>accept</i>() function was interrupted by a signal that was
              caught before a valid connection arrived.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>socket</i> is not accepting connections.

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The maximum number of file descriptors in the system are
              already open.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              No buffer space is available.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>There was insufficient memory available to complete the
              operation.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <i>socket</i> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The socket type of the specified socket does not support
              accepting connections.

       The <i>accept</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EPROTO </b>A protocol error has occurred; for example, the STREAMS
              protocol stack has not been initialized.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       When a connection is available, <i>select</i>() indicates that the file
       descriptor for the socket is ready for reading.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
