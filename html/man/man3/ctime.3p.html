PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ctime, ctime_r — convert a time value to a date and time string
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       char *ctime(const time_t *<i>clock</i>);
       char *ctime_r(const time_t *<i>clock</i>, char *<i>buf</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For <i>ctime</i>(): The functionality described on this reference page
       is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is
       unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C
       standard.

       The <i>ctime</i>() function shall convert the time pointed to by <i>clock</i>,
       representing time in seconds since the Epoch, to local time in
       the form of a string. It shall be equivalent to:

           asctime(localtime(clock))

       The <i>asctime</i>(), <i>ctime</i>(), <i>gmtime</i>(), and <i>localtime</i>() functions shall
       return values in one of two static objects: a broken-down time
       structure and an array of <b>char</b>.  Execution of any of the
       functions may overwrite the information returned in either of
       these objects by any of the other functions.

       The <i>ctime</i>() function need not be thread-safe.

       The <i>ctime_r</i>() function shall convert the calendar time pointed to
       by <i>clock</i> to local time in exactly the same form as <i>ctime</i>() and
       put the string into the array pointed to by <i>buf</i> (which shall be
       at least 26 bytes in size) and return <i>buf</i>.

       Unlike <i>ctime</i>(), the <i>ctime_r</i>() function is not required to set
       <i>tzname</i>.  If <i>ctime_r</i>() sets <i>tzname</i>, it shall also set <i>daylight</i> and
       <i>timezone</i>.  If <i>ctime_r</i>() does not set <i>tzname</i>, it shall not set
       <i>daylight</i> and shall not set <i>timezone</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ctime</i>() function shall return the pointer returned by
       <i>asctime</i>() with that broken-down time as an argument.

       Upon successful completion, <i>ctime_r</i>() shall return a pointer to
       the string pointed to by <i>buf</i>.  When an error is encountered, a
       null pointer shall be returned.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are included only for compatibility with older
       implementations. They have undefined behavior if the resulting
       string would be too long, so the use of these functions should be
       discouraged.  On implementations that do not detect output string
       length overflow, it is possible to overflow the output buffers in
       such a way as to cause applications to fail, or possible system
       security violations. Also, these functions do not support
       localized date and time formats. To avoid these problems,
       applications should use <i>strftime</i>() to generate strings from
       broken-down times.

       Values for the broken-down time structure can be obtained by
       calling <i>gmtime</i>() or <i>localtime</i>().

       The <i>ctime_r</i>() function is thread-safe and shall return values in
       a user-supplied buffer instead of possibly using a static data
       area that may be overwritten by each call.

       Attempts to use <i>ctime</i>() or <i>ctime_r</i>() for times before the Epoch
       or for times beyond the year 9999 produce undefined results.
       Refer to <a href="asctime.3p.html">asctime(3p)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The standard developers decided to mark the <i>ctime</i>() and <i>ctime_r</i>()
       functions obsolescent even though they are in the ISO C standard
       due to the possibility of buffer overflow. The ISO C standard
       also provides the <i>strftime</i>() function which can be used to avoid
       these problems.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions may be removed in a future version.
