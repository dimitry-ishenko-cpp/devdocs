NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_lookupnet - find the IPv4 network number and netmask for a
       device
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];</b>

       <b>int pcap_lookupnet(const char *device, bpf_u_int32 *netp,</b>
           <b>bpf_u_int32 *maskp, char *errbuf);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_lookupnet</b>() is used to determine the IPv4 network number and
       mask associated with the network device <i>device</i>.  Both <i>netp</i> and
       <i>maskp</i> are <b>bpf_u_int32 </b>pointers.  <i>errbuf</i> is a buffer large enough
       to hold at least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE </b>chars.

       This function is not available on Windows.  It supports neither
       IPv6 nor multiple IPv4 addresses per interface, which obviously
       is not practical in modern networks.  See <b>pcap_findalldevs</b>(3PCAP)
       for a more elaborate solution to the problem.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_lookupnet</b>() returns <b>0 </b>on success and <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>on failure.
       If <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is returned, <i>errbuf</i> is filled in with an
       appropriate error message.
