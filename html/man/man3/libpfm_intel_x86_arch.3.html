NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_x86_arch - support for Intel X86 architectural PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: ix86arch</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel X86 architectural PMU</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports any processor implementing the Intel
       architectural PMU. This is a minimal PMU with a variable number
       of counters but predefined set of events. It is implemented in
       all recent processors  starting with Intel Core Duo/Core Solo.

       It acts as a default PMU support in case the library is run on a
       very recent processor for which the specific support has not yet
       been implemented.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel architectural PMU:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       <b>t      </b>Measure on both threads at the same time assuming hyper-
              threading is enabled. This modifier requires at least
              version 3 of the architectural PMU. This is a boolean
              modifier.
