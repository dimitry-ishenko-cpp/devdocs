<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       times — get process and waited-for child process times
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/times.h&gt;

       clock_t times(struct tms *<i>buffer</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>times</i>() function shall fill the <b>tms </b>structure pointed to by
       <i>buffer</i> with time-accounting information. The <b>tms </b>structure is
       defined in <i>&lt;sys/times.h&gt;</i>.

       All times are measured in terms of the number of clock ticks
       used.

       The times of a terminated child process shall be included in the
       <i>tms_cutime</i> and <i>tms_cstime</i> elements of the parent when <i>wait</i>(),
       <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>() returns the process ID of this terminated
       child. If a child process has not waited for its children, their
       times shall not be included in its times.

        *  The <i>tms_utime</i> structure member is the CPU time charged for
           the execution of user instructions of the calling process.

        *  The <i>tms_stime</i> structure member is the CPU time charged for
           execution by the system on behalf of the calling process.

        *  The <i>tms_cutime</i> structure member is the sum of the <i>tms_utime</i>
           and <i>tms_cutime</i> times of the child processes.

        *  The <i>tms_cstime</i> structure member is the sum of the <i>tms_stime</i>
           and <i>tms_cstime</i> times of the child processes.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>times</i>() shall return the elapsed real
       time, in clock ticks, since an arbitrary point in the past (for
       example, system start-up time). This point does not change from
       one invocation of <i>times</i>() within the process to another. The
       return value may overflow the possible range of type <b>clock_t</b>.  If
       <i>times</i>() fails, (<b>clock_t</b>)-1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>times</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The return value would overflow the range of <b>clock_t</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Timing a Database Lookup</b>
       The following example defines two functions, <i>start_clock</i>() and
       <i>end_clock</i>(), that are used to time a lookup. It also defines
       variables of type <b>clock_t </b>and <b>tms </b>to measure the duration of
       transactions. The <i>start_clock</i>() function saves the beginning
       times given by the <i>times</i>() function. The <i>end_clock</i>() function
       gets the ending times and prints the difference between the two
       times.

           #include &lt;sys/times.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           ...
           void start_clock(void);
           void end_clock(char *msg);
           ...
           static clock_t st_time;
           static clock_t en_time;
           static struct tms st_cpu;
           static struct tms en_cpu;
           ...
           void
           start_clock()
           {
               st_time = times(&amp;st_cpu);
           }

           /* This example assumes that the result of each subtraction
              is within the range of values that can be represented in
              an integer type. */
           void
           end_clock(char *msg)
           {
               en_time = times(&amp;en_cpu);

               fputs(msg,stdout);
               printf("Real Time: %jd, User Time %jd, System Time %jd\n",
                   (intmax_t)(en_time - st_time),
                   (intmax_t)(en_cpu.tms_utime - st_cpu.tms_utime),
                   (intmax_t)(en_cpu.tms_stime - st_cpu.tms_stime));
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications should use <i>sysconf</i>(_SC_CLK_TCK) to determine the
       number of clock ticks per second as it may vary from system to
       system.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The accuracy of the times reported is intentionally left
       unspecified to allow implementations flexibility in design, from
       uniprocessor to multi-processor networks.

       The inclusion of times of child processes is recursive, so that a
       parent process may collect the total times of all of its
       descendants.  But the times of a child are only added to those of
       its parent when its parent successfully waits on the child. Thus,
       it is not guaranteed that a parent process can always see the
       total times of all its descendants; see also the discussion of
       the term ``realtime'' in <a href="alarm.3p.html">alarm(3p)</a>.

       If the type <b>clock_t </b>is defined to be a signed 32-bit integer, it
       overflows in somewhat more than a year if there are 60 clock
       ticks per second, or less than a year if there are 100. There are
       individual systems that run continuously for longer than that.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 permits an implementation to make the
       reference point for the returned value be the start-up time of
       the process, rather than system start-up time.

       The term ``charge'' in this context has nothing to do with
       billing for services. The operating system accounts for time used
       in this way. That information must be correct, regardless of how
       that information is used.
