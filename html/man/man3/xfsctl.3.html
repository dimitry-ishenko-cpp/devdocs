<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;xfs/xfs.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int xfsctl(const char *</b><i>path</i><b>, int </b><i>fd</i><b>, int </b><i>cmd</i><b>, void *</b><i>ptr</i><b>);</b>

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Some functionality specific to the XFS filesystem is accessible
       to applications through platform-specific system call interfaces.
       These operations can be divided into two sections - operations
       that operate on individual files, and operations that operate on
       the filesystem itself. Care should be taken when issuing <b>xfsctl</b>()
       calls to ensure the target path and file descriptor (both must be
       supplied) do indeed represent a file from an XFS filesystem.  The
       <a href="../man2/statfs.2.html">statfs(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/fstatfs.2.html">fstatfs(2)</a> system calls can be used to determine
       whether or not an arbitrary path or file descriptor belong to an
       XFS filesystem.  These are not portable however, so the routines
       <b>platform_test_xfs_fd</b>() and <b>platform_test_xfs_path</b>() provide a
       platform-independent mechanism.

   <b>File Operations</b>
       In order to effect an operation on an individual file, the
       pathname and descriptor arguments passed to <b>xfsctl </b>identifies the
       file being operated on.  The final argument described below
       refers to the final argument of <b>xfsctl</b>.  All of the data
       structures and macros mentioned below are defined in the
       &lt;<i>xfs/xfs_fs.h</i>&gt; header file.

       <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP64</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP64</b>
              Alter storage space associated with a section of the
              ordinary file specified.  The section is specified by a
              variable of type <b>xfs_flock64_t</b>, pointed to by the final
              argument.  The data type <b>xfs_flock64_t </b>contains the
              following members: <b>l_whence </b>is 0, 1, or 2 to indicate that
              the relative offset <b>l_start </b>will be measured from the
              start of the file, the current position, or the end of the
              file, respectively (i.e., <b>l_start </b>is the offset from the
              position specified in <b>l_whence</b>).  If the offset specified
              is before the current end of file, any data previously
              written into this section is no longer accessible.  If the
              offset specified is beyond the current end of file, the
              file is grown and filled with zeroes.  The <b>l_len </b>field is
              currently ignored, and should be set to zero.

              <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP</b>, <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP64</b>, <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP </b>and
              <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP64 </b>operations are all identical.

              These ioctls are no longer supported as of Linux 5.17.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETDM</b>
              Set the di_dmevmask and di_dmstate fields in an XFS on-
              disk inode.  The only legitimate values for these fields
              are those previously returned in the <b>bs_dmevmask </b>and
              <b>bs_dmstate </b>fields of the bulkstat structure.  The data
              referred to by the final argument is a <b>struct fsdmidata</b>.
              This structure's members are <b>fsd_dmevmask </b>and <b>fsd_dmstate</b>.
              The di_dmevmask field is set to the value in <b>fsd_dmevmask</b>.
              The di_dmstate field is set to the value in <b>fsd_dmstate</b>.
              This command is restricted to root or to processes with
              device management capabilities.  Its sole purpose is to
              allow backup and restore programs to restore the
              aforementioned critical on-disk inode fields.  This ioctl
              is not supported as of Linux 5.5.

       <b>XFS_IOC_DIOINFO</b>
              Get information required to perform direct I/O on the
              specified file descriptor.  Direct I/O is performed
              directly to and from a user's data buffer.  Since the
              kernel's buffer cache is no longer between the two, the
              user's data buffer must conform to the same type of
              constraints as required for accessing a raw disk
              partition.  The final argument points to a variable of
              type <b>struct dioattr</b>, which contains the following members:
              <b>d_mem </b>is the memory alignment requirement of the user's
              data buffer.  <b>d_miniosz </b>specifies block size, minimum I/O
              request size, and I/O alignment.  The size of all I/O
              requests must be a multiple of this amount and the value
              of the seek pointer at the time of the I/O request must
              also be an integer multiple of this amount.  <b>d_maxiosz </b>is
              the maximum I/O request size which can be performed on the
              file descriptor.  If an I/O request does not meet these
              constraints, the <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> will fail with
              EINVAL.  All I/O requests are kept consistent with any
              data brought into the cache with an access through a non-
              direct I/O file descriptor.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTRA</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR</b>
              See <a href="../man2/ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr.2.html">ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr(2)</a> for more information.

       <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAPA</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAPX</b>
              See <b>ioctl_getbmap</b>(2) for more information.

       <b>XFS_IOC_RESVSP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_RESVSP64</b>
              This command is used to allocate space to a file.  A range
              of bytes is specified using a pointer to a variable of
              type <b>xfs_flock64_t </b>in the final argument.  The blocks are
              allocated, but not zeroed, and the file size does not
              change.  If the XFS filesystem is configured to flag
              unwritten file extents, performance will be negatively
              affected when writing to preallocated space, since extra
              filesystem transactions are required to convert extent
              flags on the range of the file written.  If <a href="../man8/xfs_info.8.html">xfs_info(8)</a>
              reports unwritten=1, then the filesystem was made to flag
              unwritten extents.

       <b>XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP64</b>
              This command is used to free space from a file.  A range
              of bytes is specified using a pointer to a variable of
              type <b>xfs_flock64_t </b>in the final argument.  Partial
              filesystem blocks are zeroed, and whole filesystem blocks
              are removed from the file.  The file size does not change.

       <b>XFS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE</b>
              This command is used to convert a range of a file to zeros
              without issuing data IO.  A range of bytes is specified
              using a pointer to a variable of type <b>xfs_flock64_t </b>in the
              final argument.  Blocks are preallocated for regions that
              span holes in the file, and the entire range is converted
              to unwritten extents.  This operation is a fast method of
              overwriting any from the range specified with zeros
              without removing any blocks or having to write zeros to
              disk.  Any subsequent read in the given range will return
              zeros until new data is written.  This functionality
              requires filesystems to support unwritten extents.  If
              <a href="../man8/xfs_info.8.html">xfs_info(8)</a> reports unwritten=1, then the filesystem was
              made to flag unwritten extents.

       <b>XFS_IOC_PATH_TO_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_PATH_TO_FSHANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FD_TO_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_OPEN_BY_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_READLINK_BY_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_ATTR_LIST_BY_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_ATTR_MULTI_BY_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETDM_BY_HANDLE</b>
              These are all interfaces that are used to implement
              various <i>libhandle</i> functions (see <a href="open_by_handle.3.html">open_by_handle(3)</a>).  They
              are all subject to change and should not be called
              directly by applications.  XFS_IOC_FSSETDM_BY_HANDLE is
              not supported as of Linux 5.5.

   <b>Filesystem Operations</b>
       In order to effect one of the following operations, the pathname
       and descriptor arguments passed to <b>xfsctl</b>() can be any open file
       in the XFS filesystem in question.

              these operations will not be described further as they are
              not of general use to applications.
