DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These functions translate a capability state between an internal
       representation and a textual one.  The internal representation is
       managed by the capability functions in working storage. The
       textual representation is a structured, human-readable string
       suitable for display.

       <b>cap_from_text</b>() allocates and initializes a capability state in
       working storage. It then sets the contents of this newly created
       capability state to the state represented by a human-readable,
       nul-terminated character string pointed to by <i>buf_p</i>.  It returns
       a pointer to the newly created capability state.  When the
       capability state in working storage is no longer required, the
       caller should free any releasable memory by calling <b>cap_free</b>()
       with <i>cap_t</i> as an argument.  The function returns an error if it
       cannot parse the contents of the string pointed to by <i>buf_p</i> or
       does not recognize any <i>capability_name</i> or flag character as
       valid.  The function also returns an error if any flag is both
       set and cleared within a single clause.

       <b>cap_to_text</b>() converts the capability state in working storage
       identified by <i>caps</i> into a nul-terminated human-readable string.
       This function allocates any memory necessary to contain the
       string, and returns a pointer to the string.  If the pointer
       <i>len_p</i> is not NULL, the function shall also return the full length
       of the string (not including the nul terminator) in the location
       pointed to by <i>len_p</i>.  The capability state in working storage,
       identified by <i>caps</i>, is completely represented in the character
       string.  When the capability state in working storage is no
       longer required, the caller should free any releasable memory by
       calling <b>cap_free</b>() with the returned string pointer as an
       argument.

       <b>cap_from_name</b>() converts a text representation of a capability,
       such as "cap_chown", to its numerical representation
       (<b>CAP_CHOWN=0</b>), writing the decoded value into <i>*cap_p</i>.  If <i>cap_p</i>
       is NULL no result is written, but the return code of the function
       indicates whether or not the specified capability can be
       represented by the library.

       <b>cap_to_name</b>() converts a capability index value, <i>cap</i>, to a
       libcap-allocated textual string. This string should be
       deallocated with <b>cap_free</b>().
</pre> <h2>
TEXTUAL REPRESENTATION </h2>
<pre>
       A textual representation of capability sets consists of one or
       more whitespace-separated <i>clauses</i>.  Each clause specifies some
       operations on a capability set; the set starts out with all
       capabilities lowered, and the meaning of the string is the state
       of the capability set after all the clauses have been applied in
       order.

       Each clause consists of a list of comma-separated capability
       names (or the word `<b>all</b>'), followed by an <i>action-list</i>.  An
       action-list consists of a sequence of <i>operator flag</i> pairs.  Legal
       operators are: `<b>=</b>', '<b>+</b>', and `<b>-</b>'.  Legal flags are: `<b>e</b>', `<b>i</b>', and
       `<b>p</b>'.  These flags are case-sensitive and specify the Effective,
       Inheritable and Permitted sets respectively.

       In the capability name lists, all names are case-insensitive.
       The special name `<b>all</b>' specifies all capabilities; it is
       equivalent to a list naming every capability individually.

       Unnamed capabilities can also be specified by number. This
       feature ensures that libcap can support capabilities that were
       not allocated at the time libcap was compiled. However, generally
       upgrading libcap will add names for recently allocated
       capabilities.

       The `<b>=</b>' operator indicates that the listed capabilities are first
       reset in all three capability sets.  The subsequent flags (which
       are optional when associated with this operator) indicate that
       the listed capabilities for the corresponding set are to be
       raised.  For example: "all=p" means lower every capability in the
       Effective and Inheritable sets but raise all of the Permitted
       capabilities; or, "cap_fowner=ep" means raise the Effective and
       Permitted override-file-ownership capability, while lowering this
       Inheritable capability.

       In the case that the leading operator is `<b>=</b>', and no list of
       capabilities is provided, the action-list is assumed to refer to
       `all' capabilities.  For example, the following three clauses are
       equivalent to each other (and indicate a completely empty
       capability set): "all="; "="; "cap_chown,&lt;every-other-
       capability&gt;=".

       The operators, `+' and `-' both require an explicit preceding
       capability list and one or more explicit trailing flags.  The `+'
       operator will raise all of the listed capabilities in the flagged
       capability sets.  The `-' operator will lower all of the listed
       capabilities in the flagged capability sets.  For example:
       "all+p" will raise all of the Permitted capabilities and
       "cap_fowner-i" will lower the override-file-ownership in the
       Inheritable set.

       The action list can consist of multiple <i>operator flag</i> pairs; the
       actions are performed in left-to-right order.  Thus, for example,
       "cap_fowner+p-i" is equivalent to "cap_fowner+p cap_fowner-i".
       As another example, "cap_fowner+pe-i" and "cap_fowner=+pe" are
       equivalent.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cap_from_text</b>(), <b>cap_to_text</b>() and <b>cap_to_name</b>() return a non-
       NULL value on success, and NULL on failure.  <b>cap_from_name</b>()
       returns 0 for success, and -1 on failure (unknown capability).

       On failure, <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to <b>EINVAL</b>, or <b>ENOMEM</b>.
</pre> <h2>
CONFORMING TO </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cap_from_text</b>() and <b>cap_to_text</b>() are specified by the withdrawn
       POSIX.1e draft specification.  <b>cap_from_name</b>() and <b>cap_to_name</b>()
       are Linux extensions.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       The example program below demonstrates the use of <b>cap_from_text</b>()
       and <b>cap_to_text</b>().  The following shell session shows some
       example runs:

       $ ./a.out "cap_chown=p cap_chown+e"
       caps_to_text() returned "cap_chown=ep"
       $ ./a.out "all=pe cap_chown-e cap_kill-pe"
       caps_to_text() returned "=ep cap_chown-e cap_kill-ep"

       The source code of the program is as follows:

       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;sys/capability.h&gt;

       #define handle_error(msg) \
           do { perror(msg); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } while (0)

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           cap_t caps;
           char *txt_caps;

           if (argc != 2) {
               fprintf(stderr, "%s &lt;textual-cap-set&gt;\n", argv[0]);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           caps = cap_from_text(argv[1]);
           if (caps == NULL)
               handle_error("cap_from_text");

           txt_caps = cap_to_text(caps, NULL);
           if (txt_caps == NULL)
               handle_error("cap_to_text");

           printf("caps_to_text() returned \"%s\"\n", txt_caps);

           if (cap_free(txt_caps) != 0 || cap_free(caps) != 0)
               handle_error("cap_free");

           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
