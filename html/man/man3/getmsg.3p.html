       int getmsg(int <i>fildes</i>, struct strbuf *restrict <i>ctlptr</i>,
           struct strbuf *restrict <i>dataptr</i>, int *restrict <i>flagsp</i>);

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getmsg</i>() function shall retrieve the contents of a message
       located at the head of the STREAM head read queue associated with
       a STREAMS file and place the contents into one or more buffers.
       The message contains either a data part, a control part, or both.
       The data and control parts of the message shall be placed into
       separate buffers, as described below. The semantics of each part
       are defined by the originator of the message.

       The <i>getpmsg</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>getmsg</i>(), except
       that it provides finer control over the priority of the messages
       received. Except where noted, all requirements on <i>getmsg</i>() also
       pertain to <i>getpmsg</i>().

       The <i>fildes</i> argument specifies a file descriptor referencing a
       STREAMS-based file.

       The <i>ctlptr</i> and <i>dataptr</i> arguments each point to a <b>strbuf</b>
       structure, in which the <i>buf</i> member points to a buffer in which
       the data or control information is to be placed, and the <i>maxlen</i>
       member indicates the maximum number of bytes this buffer can
       hold. On return, the <i>len</i> member shall contain the number of bytes
       of data or control information actually received. The <i>len</i> member
       shall be set to 0 if there is a zero-length control or data part
       and <i>len</i> shall be set to -1 if no data or control information is
       present in the message.

       When <i>getmsg</i>() is called, <i>flagsp</i> should point to an integer that
       indicates the type of message the process is able to receive.
       This is described further below.

       The <i>ctlptr</i> argument is used to hold the control part of the
       message, and <i>dataptr</i> is used to hold the data part of the
       message. If <i>ctlptr</i> (or <i>dataptr</i>) is a null pointer or the <i>maxlen</i>
       member is -1, the control (or data) part of the message shall not
       be processed and shall be left on the STREAM head read queue, and
       if the <i>ctlptr</i> (or <i>dataptr</i>) is not a null pointer, <i>len</i> shall be
       set to -1. If the <i>maxlen</i> member is set to 0 and there is a zero-
       length control (or data) part, that zero-length part shall be
       removed from the read queue and <i>len</i> shall be set to 0. If the
       <i>maxlen</i> member is set to 0 and there are more than 0 bytes of
       control (or data) information, that information shall be left on
       the read queue and <i>len</i> shall be set to 0. If the <i>maxlen</i> member in
       <i>ctlptr</i> (or <i>dataptr</i>) is less than the control (or data) part of
       the message, <i>maxlen</i> bytes shall be retrieved. In this case, the
       remainder of the message shall be left on the STREAM head read
       queue and a non-zero return value shall be provided.

       By default, <i>getmsg</i>() shall process the first available message on
       the STREAM head read queue. However, a process may choose to
       retrieve only high-priority messages by setting the integer
       pointed to by <i>flagsp</i> to RS_HIPRI. In this case, <i>getmsg</i>() shall
       only process the next message if it is a high-priority message.
       When the integer pointed to by <i>flagsp</i> is 0, any available message
       shall be retrieved. In this case, on return, the integer pointed
       to by <i>flagsp</i> shall be set to RS_HIPRI if a high-priority message
       was retrieved, or 0 otherwise.

       For <i>getpmsg</i>(), the flags are different. The <i>flagsp</i> argument
       points to a bitmask with the following mutually-exclusive flags
       defined: MSG_HIPRI, MSG_BAND, and MSG_ANY.  Like <i>getmsg</i>(),
       <i>getpmsg</i>() shall process the first available message on the STREAM
       head read queue. A process may choose to retrieve only high-
       priority messages by setting the integer pointed to by <i>flagsp</i> to
       MSG_HIPRI and the integer pointed to by <i>bandp</i> to 0. In this case,
       <i>getpmsg</i>() shall only process the next message if it is a high-
       priority message.  In a similar manner, a process may choose to
       retrieve a message from a particular priority band by setting the
       integer pointed to by <i>flagsp</i> to MSG_BAND and the integer pointed
       to by <i>bandp</i> to the priority band of interest. In this case,
       <i>getpmsg</i>() shall only process the next message if it is in a
       priority band equal to, or greater than, the integer pointed to
       by <i>bandp</i>, or if it is a high-priority message. If a process wants
       to get the first message off the queue, the integer pointed to by
       <i>flagsp</i> should be set to MSG_ANY and the integer pointed to by
       <i>bandp</i> should be set to 0. On return, if the message retrieved was
       a high-priority message, the integer pointed to by <i>flagsp</i> shall
       be set to MSG_HIPRI and the integer pointed to by <i>bandp</i> shall be
       set to 0. Otherwise, the integer pointed to by <i>flagsp</i> shall be
       set to MSG_BAND and the integer pointed to by <i>bandp</i> shall be set
       to the priority band of the message.

       If O_NONBLOCK is not set, <i>getmsg</i>() and <i>getpmsg</i>() shall block
       until a message of the type specified by <i>flagsp</i> is available at
       the front of the STREAM head read queue. If O_NONBLOCK is set and
       a message of the specified type is not present at the front of
       the read queue, <i>getmsg</i>() and <i>getpmsg</i>() shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

       If a hangup occurs on the STREAM from which messages are
       retrieved, <i>getmsg</i>() and <i>getpmsg</i>() shall continue to operate
       normally, as described above, until the STREAM head read queue is
       empty. Thereafter, they shall return 0 in the <i>len</i> members of
       <i>ctlptr</i> and <i>dataptr</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>getmsg</i>() and <i>getpmsg</i>() shall return a
       non-negative value. A value of 0 indicates that a full message
       was read successfully. A return value of MORECTL indicates that
       more control information is waiting for retrieval. A return value
       of MOREDATA indicates that more data is waiting for retrieval. A
       return value of the bitwise-logical OR of MORECTL and MOREDATA
       indicates that both types of information remain. Subsequent
       <i>getmsg</i>() and <i>getpmsg</i>() calls shall retrieve the remainder of the
       message. However, if a message of higher priority has come in on
       the STREAM head read queue, the next call to <i>getmsg</i>() or
       <i>getpmsg</i>() shall retrieve that higher-priority message before
       retrieving the remainder of the previous message.

       If the high priority control part of the message is consumed, the
       message shall be placed back on the queue as a normal message of
       band 0. Subsequent <i>getmsg</i>() and <i>getpmsg</i>() calls shall retrieve
       the remainder of the message. If, however, a priority message
       arrives or already exists on the STREAM head, the subsequent call
       to <i>getmsg</i>() or <i>getpmsg</i>() shall retrieve the higher-priority
       message before retrieving the remainder of the message that was
       put back.

       Upon failure, <i>getmsg</i>() and <i>getpmsg</i>() shall return -1 and set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getmsg</i>() and <i>getpmsg</i>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The O_NONBLOCK flag is set and no messages are available.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor open
              for reading.

       <b>EBADMSG</b>
              The queued message to be read is not valid for <i>getmsg</i>() or
              <i>getpmsg</i>() or a pending file descriptor is at the STREAM
              head.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during <i>getmsg</i>() or <i>getpmsg</i>().

       <b>EINVAL </b>An illegal value was specified by <i>flagsp</i>, or the STREAM or
              multiplexer referenced by <i>fildes</i> is linked (directly or
              indirectly) downstream from a multiplexer.

       <b>ENOSTR </b>A STREAM is not associated with <i>fildes</i>.

       In addition, <i>getmsg</i>() and <i>getpmsg</i>() shall fail if the STREAM head
       had processed an asynchronous error before the call. In this
       case, the value of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> does not reflect the result of <i>getmsg</i>()
       or <i>getpmsg</i>() but reflects the prior error.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Getting Any Message</b>
       In the following example, the value of <i>fd</i> is assumed to refer to
       an open STREAMS file. The call to <i>getmsg</i>() retrieves any
       available message on the associated STREAM-head read queue,
       returning control and data information to the buffers pointed to
       by <i>ctrlbuf</i> and <i>databuf</i>, respectively.

           #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;
           ...
           int fd;
           char ctrlbuf[128];
           char databuf[512];
           struct strbuf ctrl;
           struct strbuf data;
           int flags = 0;
           int ret;

           ctrl.buf = ctrlbuf;
           ctrl.maxlen = sizeof(ctrlbuf);

           data.buf = databuf;
           data.maxlen = sizeof(databuf);

           ret = getmsg (fd, &amp;ctrl, &amp;data, &amp;flags);

   <b>Getting the First Message off the Queue</b>
       In the following example, the call to <i>getpmsg</i>() retrieves the
       first available message on the associated STREAM-head read queue.

           #include &lt;stropts.h&gt;
           ...

           int fd;
           char ctrlbuf[128];
           char databuf[512];
           struct strbuf ctrl;
           struct strbuf data;
           int band = 0;
           int flags = MSG_ANY;
           int ret;

           ctrl.buf = ctrlbuf;
           ctrl.maxlen = sizeof(ctrlbuf);

           data.buf = databuf;
           data.maxlen = sizeof(databuf);

           ret = getpmsg (fd, &amp;ctrl, &amp;data, &amp;band, &amp;flags);
