PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mprotect — set protection of memory mapping
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int mprotect(void *<i>addr</i>, size_t <i>len</i>, int <i>prot</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mprotect</i>() function shall change the access protections to be
       that specified by <i>prot</i> for those whole pages containing any part
       of the address space of the process starting at address <i>addr</i> and
       continuing for <i>len</i> bytes. The parameter <i>prot</i> determines whether
       read, write, execute, or some combination of accesses are
       permitted to the data being mapped. The <i>prot</i> argument should be
       either PROT_NONE or the bitwise-inclusive OR of one or more of
       PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, and PROT_EXEC.

       If an implementation cannot support the combination of access
       types specified by <i>prot</i>, the call to <i>mprotect</i>() shall fail.

       An implementation may permit accesses other than those specified
       by <i>prot</i>; however, no implementation shall permit a write to
       succeed where PROT_WRITE has not been set or shall permit any
       access where PROT_NONE alone has been set. Implementations shall
       support at least the following values of <i>prot</i>: PROT_NONE,
       PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, and the bitwise-inclusive OR of PROT_READ
       and PROT_WRITE. If PROT_WRITE is specified, the application shall
       ensure that it has opened the mapped objects in the specified
       address range with write permission, unless MAP_PRIVATE was
       specified in the original mapping, regardless of whether the file
       descriptors used to map the objects have since been closed.

       The implementation may require that <i>addr</i> be a multiple of the
       page size as returned by <i>sysconf</i>().

       The behavior of this function is unspecified if the mapping was
       not established by a call to <i>mmap</i>().

       When <i>mprotect</i>() fails for reasons other than <b>[EINVAL]</b>, the
       protections on some of the pages in the range [<i>addr</i>,<i>addr</i>+<i>len</i>) may
       have been changed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>mprotect</i>() shall return 0; otherwise,
       it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mprotect</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The <i>prot</i> argument specifies a protection that violates the
              access permission the process has to the underlying memory
              object.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The <i>prot</i> argument specifies PROT_WRITE over a MAP_PRIVATE
              mapping and there are insufficient memory resources to
              reserve for locking the private page.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Addresses in the range [<i>addr</i>,<i>addr</i>+<i>len</i>) are invalid for the
              address space of a process, or specify one or more pages
              which are not mapped.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The <i>prot</i> argument specifies PROT_WRITE on a MAP_PRIVATE
              mapping, and it would require more space than the system
              is able to supply for locking the private pages, if
              required.

       <b>ENOTSUP</b>
              The implementation does not support the combination of
              accesses requested in the <i>prot</i> argument.

       The <i>mprotect</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>addr</i> argument is not a multiple of the page size as
              returned by <i>sysconf</i>().
