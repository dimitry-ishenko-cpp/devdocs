NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_skl - support for Intel SkyLake core PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: skl</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel SkyLake</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel SkyLake core PMU. It should be
       noted that this PMU model only covers each core's PMU and not the
       socket level PMU.

       On SkyLake, the number of generic counters depends on the
       Hyperthreading (HT) mode.

       counters are available. The <b>pfm_get_pmu_info() </b>function returns
       the maximum number of generic counters in <b>num_cntrs.</b>
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel SkyLake
       processors:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a counter mask modifier (m) with a value greater or equal
              to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       <b>t      </b>Measure on both threads at the same time assuming hyper-
              threading is enabled. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>ldlat  </b>Pass a latency threshold to the
              MEM_TRANS_RETIRED:LOAD_LATENCY event.  This is an integer
              attribute that must be in the range [1:65535]. It is
              required for this event.  Note that the event must be used
              with precise sampling (PEBS).

       <b>intx   </b>Monitor the event only when executing inside a
              transactional memory region (in tx). Event does not count
              otherwise. This is a boolean modifiers. Default value is
              0.

       <b>intxcp </b>Do not count occurrences of the event when they are inside
              an aborted transactional memory region. This is a boolean
              modifier. Default value is 0.

       <b>fe_thres</b>
              This modifier is for the FRONTEND_RETIRED event only. It
              defines the period in core cycles after which the
              IDQ_*_BUBBLES umask counts. It acts as a threshold, i.e.,
              at least a period of N core cycles where the frontend did
              not deliver X uops. It can only be used with the
              IDQ_*_BUBBLES umasks. If not specified, the default
              threshold value is 1 cycle. the valid values are in
              [1-4095].
</pre> <h2>
OFFCORE_RESPONSE events </h2>
<pre>
       Intel SkyLake provides two offcore_response events. They are
       called OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0 and OFFCORE_RESPONSE_1.

       Those events need special treatment in the performance monitoring
       infrastructure because each event uses an extra register to store
       some settings. Thus, in case multiple offcore_response events are
       monitored simultaneously, the kernel needs to manage the sharing
       of that extra register.

       The offcore_response events are exposed as a normal events by the
       library. The extra settings are exposed as regular umasks. The
       library takes care of encoding the events according to the
       underlying kernel interface.

       On Intel SkyLake, the umasks are divided into three categories:
       request, supplier and snoop. The user must provide at least one
       umask for each category. The categories are shown in the umask
       descriptions.

       There is also the special response umask called <b>ANY_RESPONSE</b>.
       When this umask is used then it overrides any supplier and snoop
       umasks. In other words, users can specify either <b>ANY_RESPONSE OR</b>
       any combinations of supplier + snoops.

       In case no supplier or snoop is specified, the library defaults
       to using <b>ANY_RESPONSE</b>.

       For instance, the following are valid event selections:

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:DMND_DATA_RD:ANY_RESPONSE</b>

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:ANY_REQUEST</b>

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:ANY_RFO:LLC_HITM:SNOOP_ANY</b>

       But the following are illegal:

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:ANY_RFO:LLC_HITM:ANY_RESPONSE</b>

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:ANY_RFO:LLC_HITM:SNOOP_ANY:ANY_RESPONSE</b>
