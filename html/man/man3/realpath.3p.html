PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       realpath — resolve a pathname
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       char *realpath(const char *restrict <i>file_name</i>,
           char *restrict <i>resolved_name</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>realpath</i>() function shall derive, from the pathname pointed
       to by <i>file_name</i>, an absolute pathname that resolves to the same
       directory entry, whose resolution does not involve <b>'.'</b>, <b>'..'</b>, or
       symbolic links. If <i>resolved_name</i> is a null pointer, the generated
       pathname shall be stored as a null-terminated string in a buffer
       allocated as if by a call to <i>malloc</i>().  Otherwise, if {PATH_MAX}
       is defined as a constant in the <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> header, then the
       generated pathname shall be stored as a null-terminated string,
       up to a maximum of {PATH_MAX} bytes, in the buffer pointed to by
       <i>resolved_name</i>.

       If <i>resolved_name</i> is not a null pointer and {PATH_MAX} is not
       defined as a constant in the <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> header, the behavior is
       undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>realpath</i>() shall return a pointer to
       the buffer containing the resolved name.  Otherwise, <i>realpath</i>()
       shall return a null pointer and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.

       If the <i>resolved_name</i> argument is a null pointer, the pointer
       returned by <i>realpath</i>() can be passed to <i>free</i>().

       If the <i>resolved_name</i> argument is not a null pointer and the
       <i>realpath</i>() function fails, the contents of the buffer pointed to
       by <i>resolved_name</i> are undefined.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>realpath</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission was denied for a component of the path
              prefix of <i>file_name</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>file_name</i> argument is a null pointer.

       <b>EIO    </b>An error occurred while reading from the file system.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>file_name</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>file_name</i> does not name an existing file or
              <i>file_name</i> points to an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>file_name</i> argument contains at least one
              non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends with one or more trailing
              &lt;slash&gt; characters and the last pathname component names
              an existing file that is neither a directory nor a
              symbolic link to a directory.

       The <i>realpath</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The <i>file_name</i> argument does not begin with a &lt;slash&gt; and
              none of the symbolic links (if any) processed during
              pathname resolution of <i>file_name</i> had contents that began
              with a &lt;slash&gt;, and either search permission was denied
              for the current directory or read or search permission was
              denied for a directory above the current directory in the
              file hierarchy.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>file_name</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Generating an Absolute Pathname</b>
       The following example generates an absolute pathname for the file
       identified by the <i>symlinkpath</i> argument. The generated pathname is
       stored in the buffer pointed to by <i>actualpath</i>.

           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           ...
           char *symlinkpath = "/tmp/symlink/file";
           char *actualpath;

           actualpath = realpath(symlinkpath, NULL);
           if (actualpath != NULL)
           {
               ... use actualpath ...

               free(actualpath);
           }
           else
           {
               ... handle error ...
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       For functions that allocate memory as if by <i>malloc</i>(), the
       application should release such memory when it is no longer
       required by a call to <i>free</i>().  For <i>realpath</i>(), this is the return
       value.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Since <i>realpath</i>() has no <i>length</i> argument, if {PATH_MAX} is not
       defined as a constant in <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i>, applications have no way of
       determining how large a buffer they need to allocate for it to be
       safe to pass to <i>realpath</i>().  A {PATH_MAX} value obtained from a
       prior <i>pathconf</i>() call is out-of-date by the time <i>realpath</i>() is
       called. Hence the only reliable way to use <i>realpath</i>() when
       {PATH_MAX} is not defined in <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> is to pass a null pointer
       for <i>resolved_name</i> so that <i>realpath</i>() will allocate a buffer of
       the necessary size.
