SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       ssize_t recvmsg(int <i>socket</i>, struct msghdr *<i>message</i>, int <i>flags</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>recvmsg</i>() function shall receive a message from a connection-
       mode or connectionless-mode socket. It is normally used with
       connectionless-mode sockets because it permits the application to
       retrieve the source address of received data.

       The <i>recvmsg</i>() function takes the following arguments:

       <i>socket</i>      Specifies the socket file descriptor.

       <i>message</i>     Points to a <b>msghdr </b>structure, containing both the
                   buffer to store the source address and the buffers
                   for the incoming message. The length and format of
                   the address depend on the address family of the
                   socket. The <i>msg_flags</i> member is ignored on input, but
                   may contain meaningful values on output.

       <i>flags</i>       Specifies the type of message reception. Values of
                   this argument are formed by logically OR'ing zero or
                   more of the following values:

                   MSG_OOB     Requests out-of-band data. The
                               significance and semantics of out-of-band
                               data are protocol-specific.

                   MSG_PEEK    Peeks at the incoming message.

                   MSG_WAITALL On SOCK_STREAM sockets this requests that
                               the function block until the full amount
                               of data can be returned. The function may
                               return the smaller amount of data if the
                               socket is a message-based socket, if a
                               signal is caught, if the connection is
                               terminated, if MSG_PEEK was specified, or
                               if an error is pending for the socket.

       The <i>recvmsg</i>() function shall receive messages from unconnected or
       connected sockets and shall return the length of the message.

       The <i>recvmsg</i>() function shall return the total length of the
       message. For message-based sockets, such as SOCK_DGRAM and
       SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message shall be read in a single
       operation. If a message is too long to fit in the supplied
       buffers, and MSG_PEEK is not set in the <i>flags</i> argument, the
       excess bytes shall be discarded, and MSG_TRUNC shall be set in
       the <i>msg_flags</i> member of the <b>msghdr </b>structure. For stream-based
       sockets, such as SOCK_STREAM, message boundaries shall be
       ignored. In this case, data shall be returned to the user as soon
       as it becomes available, and no data shall be discarded.

       If the MSG_WAITALL flag is not set, data shall be returned only
       up to the end of the first message.

       If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is not
       set on the socket's file descriptor, <i>recvmsg</i>() shall block until
       a message arrives. If no messages are available at the socket and
       O_NONBLOCK is set on the socket's file descriptor, the <i>recvmsg</i>()
       function shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EAGAIN] </b>or <b>[EWOULDBLOCK]</b>.

       In the <b>msghdr </b>structure, the <i>msg_name</i> member may be a null
       pointer if the source address is not required.  Otherwise, if the
       socket is unconnected, the <i>msg_name</i> member points to a <b>sockaddr</b>
       structure in which the source address is to be stored, and the
       <i>msg_namelen</i> member on input specifies the length of the supplied
       <b>sockaddr </b>structure and on output specifies the length of the
       stored address.  If the actual length of the address is greater
       than the length of the supplied <b>sockaddr </b>structure, the stored
       address shall be truncated. If the socket is connected, the
       <i>msg_name</i> and <i>msg_namelen</i> members shall be ignored. The <i>msg_iov</i>
       and <i>msg_iovlen</i> fields are used to specify where the received data
       shall be stored.  The <i>msg_iov</i> member points to an array of <b>iovec</b>
       structures; the <i>msg_iovlen</i> member shall be set to the dimension
       of this array. In each <b>iovec </b>structure, the <i>iov_base</i> field
       specifies a storage area and the <i>iov_len</i> field gives its size in
       bytes. Each storage area indicated by <i>msg_iov</i> is filled with
       received data in turn until all of the received data is stored or
       all of the areas have been filled.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>msg_flags</i> member of the message
       header shall be the bitwise-inclusive OR of all of the following
       flags that indicate conditions detected for the received message:

       MSG_EOR     End-of-record was received (if supported by the
                   protocol).

       MSG_OOB     Out-of-band data was received.

       MSG_TRUNC   Normal data was truncated.

       MSG_CTRUNC  Control data was truncated.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>recvmsg</i>() shall return the length of
       the message in bytes. If no messages are available to be received
       and the peer has performed an orderly shutdown, <i>recvmsg</i>() shall
       return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>recvmsg</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and no
              data is waiting to be received; or MSG_OOB is set and no
              out-of-band data is available and either the socket's file
              descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK or the socket does not
              support blocking to await out-of-band data.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>socket</i> argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.

       <b>EINTR  </b>This function was interrupted by a signal before any data
              was available.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The sum of the <i>iov_len</i> values overflows a <b>ssize_t</b>, or the
              MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data is available.

       <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              The <i>msg_iovlen</i> member of the <b>msghdr </b>structure pointed to
              by <i>message</i> is less than or equal to 0, or is greater than
              {IOV_MAX}.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              A receive is attempted on a connection-mode socket that is
              not connected.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <i>socket</i> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The specified flags are not supported for this socket
              type.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The connection timed out during connection establishment,
              or due to a transmission timeout on active connection.

       The <i>recvmsg</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
              file system.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to
              perform the operation.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.
