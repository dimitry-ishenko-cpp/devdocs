DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>p</i> refers to a network device that was opened for a live
       capture using a combination of <b>pcap_create</b>(3PCAP) and
       <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP), or using <b>pcap_open_live</b>(3PCAP),
       <b>pcap_fileno</b>() returns the file descriptor from which captured
       packets are read.

       If <i>p</i> refers to a ``savefile'' that was opened using functions
       such as <b>pcap_open_offline</b>(3PCAP) or <b>pcap_fopen_offline</b>(3PCAP), a
       ``dead'' <b>pcap_t </b>opened using <b>pcap_open_dead</b>(3PCAP), or a <b>pcap_t</b>
       that was created with <b>pcap_create</b>() but that has not yet been
       activated with <b>pcap_activate</b>(), it returns <b>PCAP_ERROR</b>.
