DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fwprintf</i>() function shall place output on the named output
       <i>stream</i>.  The <i>wprintf</i>() function shall place output on the
       standard output stream <i>stdout</i>.  The <i>swprintf</i>() function shall
       place output followed by the null wide character in consecutive
       wide characters starting at *<i>ws</i>; no more than <i>n</i> wide characters
       shall be written, including a terminating null wide character,
       which is always added (unless <i>n</i> is zero).

       Each of these functions shall convert, format, and print its
       arguments under control of the <i>format</i> wide-character string. The
       <i>format</i> is composed of zero or more directives: <i>ordinary wide-</i>
       <i>characters</i>, which are simply copied to the output stream, and
       <i>conversion specifications</i>, each of which results in the fetching
       of zero or more arguments. The results are undefined if there are
       insufficient arguments for the <i>format</i>.  If the <i>format</i> is
       exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments are
       evaluated but are otherwise ignored.

       Conversions can be applied to the <i>n</i>th argument after the <i>format</i>
       in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument. In
       this case, the conversion specifier wide character <b>% </b>(see below)
       is replaced by the sequence <b>"%n$"</b>, where <i>n</i> is a decimal integer
       in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}], giving the position of the argument
       in the argument list. This feature provides for the definition of
       <i>format</i> wide-character strings that select arguments in an order
       appropriate to specific languages (see the EXAMPLES section).

       The <i>format</i> can contain either numbered argument specifications
       (that is, "%<i>n</i>$" and "*<i>m</i>$"), or unnumbered argument conversion
       specifications (that is, <b>% </b>and <b>*</b>), but not both. The only
       exception to this is that <b>%% </b>can be mixed with the "%<i>n</i>$" form.
       The results of mixing numbered and unnumbered argument
       specifications in a <i>format</i> wide-character string are undefined.
       When numbered argument specifications are used, specifying the
       <i>N</i>th argument requires that all the leading arguments, from the
       first to the (<i>N</i>-1)th, are specified in the <i>format</i> wide-character
       string.

       In <i>format</i> wide-character strings containing the "%<i>n</i>$" form of
       conversion specification, numbered arguments in the argument list
       can be referenced from the <i>format</i> wide-character string as many
       times as required.

       In <i>format</i> wide-character strings containing the <b>% </b>form of
       conversion specification, each argument in the argument list
       shall be used exactly once. It is unspecified whether an encoding
       error occurs if the format string contains <b>wchar_t </b>values that do
       not correspond to members of the character set of the current
       locale and the specified semantics do not require that value to
       be processed by <i>wcrtomb</i>().

       All forms of the <i>fwprintf</i>() function allow for the insertion of a
       locale-dependent radix character in the output string, output as
       a wide-character value. The radix character is defined in the
       current locale (category <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>).  In the POSIX locale, or in
       a locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix
       character shall default to a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>).

       Each conversion specification is introduced by the <b>'%' </b>wide
       character or by the wide-character sequence "%<i>n</i>$", after which
       the following appear in sequence:

        *  Zero or more <i>flags</i> (in any order), which modify the meaning
           of the conversion specification.

        *  An optional minimum <i>field width</i>.  If the converted value has
           fewer wide characters than the field width, it shall be
           padded with &lt;space&gt; characters by default on the left; it
           shall be padded on the right, if the left-adjustment flag
           (<b>'-'</b>), described below, is given to the field width. The
           field width takes the form of an &lt;asterisk&gt; (<b>'*'</b>), described
           below, or a decimal integer.

        *  An optional <i>precision</i> that gives the minimum number of digits
           to appear for the <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, and <b>X </b>conversion specifiers;
           the number of digits to appear after the radix character for
           the <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, and <b>F </b>conversion specifiers; the maximum
           number of significant digits for the <b>g </b>and <b>G </b>conversion
           specifiers; or the maximum number of wide characters to be
           printed from a string in the <b>s </b>conversion specifiers. The
           precision takes the form of a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>)  followed either
           by an &lt;asterisk&gt; (<b>'*'</b>), described below, or an optional
           decimal digit string, where a null digit string is treated as
           0. If a precision appears with any other conversion wide
           character, the behavior is undefined.

        *  An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the
           argument.

        *  A <i>conversion specifier</i> wide character that indicates the type
           of conversion to be applied.

       A field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
       &lt;asterisk&gt; (<b>'*'</b>).  In this case an argument of type <b>int </b>supplies
       the field width or precision. Applications shall ensure that
       arguments specifying field width, or precision, or both appear in
       that order before the argument, if any, to be converted. A
       negative field width is taken as a <b>'-' </b>flag followed by a
       positive field width. A negative precision is taken as if the
       precision were omitted.  In <i>format</i> wide-character strings
       containing the "%<i>n</i>$" form of a conversion specification, a field
       width or precision may be indicated by the sequence "*<i>m</i>$", where
       <i>m</i> is a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}] giving the
       position in the argument list (after the <i>format</i> argument) of an
       integer argument containing the field width or precision, for
       example:

           wprintf(L"%1$d:%2$.*3$d:%4$.*3$d\n", hour, min, precision, sec);

       The flag wide characters and their meanings are:

       '       (The &lt;apostrophe&gt;.)  The integer portion of the result of
               a decimal conversion (<b>%i</b>, <b>%d</b>, <b>%u</b>, <b>%f</b>, <b>%F</b>, <b>%g</b>, or <b>%G</b>)
               shall be formatted with thousands' grouping wide
               characters. For other conversions, the behavior is
               undefined. The numeric grouping wide character is used.

       -       The result of the conversion shall be left-justified
               within the field.  The conversion shall be right-
               justified if this flag is not specified.

       +       The result of a signed conversion shall always begin with
               a sign (<b>'+' </b>or <b>'-'</b>).  The conversion shall begin with a
               sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag
               is not specified.

       &lt;space&gt; If the first wide character of a signed conversion is not
               a sign, or if a signed conversion results in no wide
               characters, a &lt;space&gt; shall be prefixed to the result.
               This means that if the &lt;space&gt; and <b>'+' </b>flags both appear,
               the &lt;space&gt; flag shall be ignored.

       #       Specifies that the value is to be converted to an
               alternative form.  For <b>o </b>conversion, it shall increase
               the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the
               first digit of the result to be zero (if the value and
               precision are both 0, a single 0 is printed). For <b>x </b>or <b>X</b>
               conversion specifiers, a non-zero result shall have 0x
               (or 0X) prefixed to it. For <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>G</b>
               conversion specifiers, the result shall always contain a
               radix character, even if no digits follow it. Without
               this flag, a radix character appears in the result of
               these conversions only if a digit follows it. For <b>g </b>and <b>G</b>
               conversion specifiers, trailing zeros shall <i>not</i> be
               removed from the result as they normally are. For other
               conversion specifiers, the behavior is undefined.

       0       For <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>X</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>G</b>
               conversion specifiers, leading zeros (following any
               indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field
               width rather than performing space padding, except when
               converting an infinity or NaN. If the <b>'0' </b>and <b>'-' </b>flags
               both appear, the <b>'0' </b>flag shall be ignored. For <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>,
               <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, and <b>X </b>conversion specifiers, if a precision is
               specified, the <b>'0' </b>flag shall be ignored.  If the <b>'0' </b>and
               &lt;apostrophe&gt; flags both appear, the grouping wide
               characters are inserted before zero padding. For other
               conversions, the behavior is undefined.

       The length modifiers and their meanings are:

       hh      Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, or <b>X </b>conversion
               specifier applies to a <b>signed char </b>or <b>unsigned char</b>
               argument (the argument will have been promoted according
               to the integer promotions, but its value shall be
               converted to <b>signed char </b>or <b>unsigned char </b>before
               printing); or that a following <b>n </b>conversion specifier
               applies to a pointer to a <b>signed char </b>argument.

       h       Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, or <b>X </b>conversion
               specifier applies to a <b>short </b>or <b>unsigned short </b>argument
               (the argument will have been promoted according to the
               integer promotions, but its value shall be converted to
               <b>short </b>or <b>unsigned short </b>before printing); or that a
               following <b>n </b>conversion specifier applies to a pointer to
               a <b>short </b>argument.

       l (ell) Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, or <b>X </b>conversion
               specifier applies to a <b>long </b>or <b>unsigned long </b>argument;
               that a following <b>n </b>conversion specifier applies to a
               pointer to a <b>long </b>argument; that a following <b>c </b>conversion
               specifier applies to a <b>wint_t </b>argument; that a following
               <b>s </b>conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a <b>wchar_t</b>
               argument; or has no effect on a following <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>,
               <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, or <b>G </b>conversion specifier.

       ll (ell-ell)
               Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, or <b>X </b>conversion
               specifier applies to a <b>long long </b>or <b>unsigned long long</b>
               argument; or that a following <b>n </b>conversion specifier
               applies to a pointer to a <b>long long </b>argument.

       j       Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, or <b>X </b>conversion
               specifier applies to an <b>intmax_t </b>or <b>uintmax_t </b>argument;
               or that a following <b>n </b>conversion specifier applies to a
               pointer to an <b>intmax_t </b>argument.

       z       Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, or <b>X </b>conversion
               specifier applies to a <b>size_t </b>or the corresponding signed
               integer type argument; or that a following <b>n </b>conversion
               specifier applies to a pointer to a signed integer type
               corresponding to a <b>size_t </b>argument.

       t       Specifies that a following <b>d</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>x</b>, or <b>X </b>conversion
               specifier applies to a <b>ptrdiff_t </b>or the corresponding
               <b>unsigned </b>type argument; or that a following <b>n </b>conversion
               specifier applies to a pointer to a <b>ptrdiff_t </b>argument.

       L       Specifies that a following <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, or <b>G</b>
               conversion specifier applies to a <b>long double </b>argument.

       If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other
       than as specified above, the behavior is undefined.

       The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

       d, i    The <b>int </b>argument shall be converted to a signed decimal
               in the style "[-]<i>dddd"</i>. The precision specifies the
               minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being
               converted can be represented in fewer digits, it shall be
               expanded with leading zeros. The default precision shall
               be 1. The result of converting zero with an explicit
               precision of zero shall be no wide characters.

       o       The <b>unsigned </b>argument shall be converted to unsigned
               octal format in the style <b>"dddd"</b>.  The precision
               specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the
               value being converted can be represented in fewer digits,
               it shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default
               precision shall be 1. The result of converting zero with
               an explicit precision of zero shall be no wide
               characters.

       u       The <b>unsigned </b>argument shall be converted to unsigned
               decimal format in the style <b>"dddd"</b>.  The precision
               specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the
               value being converted can be represented in fewer digits,
               it shall be expanded with leading zeros. The default
               precision shall be 1. The result of converting zero with
               an explicit precision of zero shall be no wide
               characters.

       x       The <b>unsigned </b>argument shall be converted to unsigned
               hexadecimal format in the style <b>"dddd"</b>; the letters
               <b>"abcdef" </b>are used. The precision specifies the minimum
               number of digits to appear; if the value being converted
               can be represented in fewer digits, it shall be expanded
               with leading zeros. The default precision shall be 1. The
               result of converting zero with an explicit precision of
               zero shall be no wide characters.

       X       Equivalent to the <b>x </b>conversion specifier, except that
               letters <b>"ABCDEF" </b>are used instead of <b>"abcdef"</b>.

       f, F    The <b>double </b>argument shall be converted to decimal
               notation in the style "[-]<i>ddd.ddd"</i>, where the number of
               digits after the radix character shall be equal to the
               precision specification. If the precision is missing, it
               shall be taken as 6; if the precision is explicitly zero
               and no <b>'#' </b>flag is present, no radix character shall
               appear. If a radix character appears, at least one digit
               shall appear before it. The value shall be rounded in an
               implementation-defined manner to the appropriate number
               of digits.

               A <b>double </b>argument representing an infinity shall be
               converted in one of the styles <b>"[-]inf" </b>or <b>"[-]infinity"</b>;
               which style is implementation-defined. A <b>double </b>argument
               representing a NaN shall be converted in one of the
               styles <b>"[-]nan" </b>or "[-]nan(<i>n-char-sequence</i>)"; which
               style, and the meaning of any <i>n-char-sequence</i>, is
               implementation-defined. The <b>F </b>conversion specifier
               produces <b>"INF"</b>, <b>"INFINITY"</b>, or <b>"NAN" </b>instead of <b>"inf"</b>,
               <b>"infinity"</b>, or <b>"nan"</b>, respectively.

       e, E    The <b>double </b>argument shall be converted in the style
               "[-]<i>d.ddd</i>e±dd", where there shall be one digit before the
               radix character (which is non-zero if the argument is
               non-zero) and the number of digits after it shall be
               equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it
               shall be taken as 6; if the precision is zero and no <b>'#'</b>
               flag is present, no radix character shall appear. The
               value shall be rounded in an implementation-defined
               manner to the appropriate number of digits. The <b>E</b>
               conversion wide character shall produce a number with <b>'E'</b>
               instead of <b>'e' </b>introducing the exponent. The exponent
               shall always contain at least two digits. If the value is
               zero, the exponent shall be zero.

               A <b>double </b>argument representing an infinity or NaN shall
               be converted in the style of an <b>f </b>or <b>F </b>conversion
               specifier.

       g, G    The <b>double </b>argument representing a floating-point number
               shall be converted in the style <b>f </b>or <b>e </b>(or in the style <b>F</b>
               or <b>E </b>in the case of a <b>G </b>conversion specifier), depending
               on the value converted and the precision.  Let <b>P </b>equal
               the precision if non-zero, 6 if the precision is omitted,
               or 1 if the precision is zero. Then, if a conversion with
               style <b>E </b>would have an exponent of <i>X</i>:

               --  If <b>P</b>&gt;<i>X</i>≥-4, the conversion shall be with style <b>f </b>(or
                   <b>F</b>) and precision <b>P</b>-(<i>X</i>+1).

               --  Otherwise, the conversion shall be with style <b>e </b>(or
                   <b>E</b>) and precision <b>P</b>-1.

               Finally, unless the <b>'#' </b>flag is used, any trailing zeros
               shall be removed from the fractional portion of the
               result and the decimal-point character shall be removed
               if there is no fractional portion remaining.

               A <b>double </b>argument representing an infinity or NaN shall
               be converted in the style of an <b>f </b>or <b>F </b>conversion
               specifier.

       a, A    A <b>double </b>argument representing a floating-point number
               shall be converted in the style "[-]0x<i>h</i>.<i>hhhh</i>p±<i>d</i>", where
               there shall be one hexadecimal digit (which is non-zero
               if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and
               is otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point wide
               character and the number of hexadecimal digits after it
               shall be equal to the precision; if the precision is
               missing and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, then the precision
               shall be sufficient for an exact representation of the
               value; if the precision is missing and FLT_RADIX is not a
               power of 2, then the precision shall be sufficient to
               distinguish values of type <b>double</b>, except that trailing
               zeros may be omitted; if the precision is zero and the
               <b>'#' </b>flag is not specified, no decimal-point wide
               character shall appear.  The letters <b>"abcdef" </b>are used
               for <b>a </b>conversion and the letters <b>"ABCDEF" </b>for <b>A</b>
               conversion. The <b>A </b>conversion specifier produces a number
               with <b>'X' </b>and <b>'P' </b>instead of <b>'x' </b>and <b>'p'</b>.  The exponent
               shall always contain at least one digit, and only as many
               more digits as necessary to represent the decimal
               exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent shall
               be zero.

               A <b>double </b>argument representing an infinity or NaN shall
               be converted in the style of an <b>f </b>or <b>F </b>conversion
               specifier.

       c       If no <b>l </b>(ell) qualifier is present, the <b>int </b>argument
               shall be converted to a wide character as if by calling
               the <i>btowc</i>() function and the resulting wide character
               shall be written. Otherwise, the <b>wint_t </b>argument shall be
               converted to <b>wchar_t</b>, and written.

       s       If no <b>l </b>(ell) qualifier is present, the application shall
               ensure that the argument is a pointer to a character
               array containing a character sequence beginning in the
               initial shift state. Characters from the array shall be
               converted as if by repeated calls to the <i>mbrtowc</i>()
               function, with the conversion state described by an
               <b>mbstate_t </b>object initialized to zero before the first
               character is converted, and written up to (but not
               including) the terminating null wide character.  If the
               precision is specified, no more than that many wide
               characters shall be written. If the precision is not
               specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the
               application shall ensure that the array contains a null
               wide character.

               If an <b>l </b>(ell) qualifier is present, the application shall
               ensure that the argument is a pointer to an array of type
               <b>wchar_t</b>.  Wide characters from the array shall be written
               up to (but not including) a terminating null wide
               character. If no precision is specified, or is greater
               than the size of the array, the application shall ensure
               that the array contains a null wide character. If a
               precision is specified, no more than that many wide
               characters shall be written.

       p       The application shall ensure that the argument is a
               pointer to <b>void</b>.  The value of the pointer shall be
               converted to a sequence of printable wide characters in
               an implementation-defined manner.

       n       The application shall ensure that the argument is a
               pointer to an integer into which is written the number of
               wide characters written to the output so far by this call
               to one of the <i>fwprintf</i>() functions. No argument shall be
               converted, but one shall be consumed.  If the conversion
               specification includes any flags, a field width, or a
               precision, the behavior is undefined.

       C       Equivalent to <b>lc</b>.

       S       Equivalent to <b>ls</b>.

       %       Output a <b>'%' </b>wide character; no argument shall be
               converted. The entire conversion specification shall be
               <b>%%</b>.

       If a conversion specification does not match one of the above
       forms, the behavior is undefined.

       In no case does a nonexistent or small field width cause
       truncation of a field; if the result of a conversion is wider
       than the field width, the field shall be expanded to contain the
       conversion result.  Characters generated by <i>fwprintf</i>() and
       <i>wprintf</i>() shall be printed as if <i>fputwc</i>() had been called.

       For <b>a </b>and <b>A </b>conversions, if FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2 and the
       result is not exactly representable in the given precision, the
       result should be one of the two adjacent numbers in hexadecimal
       floating style with the given precision, with the extra
       stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the
       current rounding direction.

       For <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>G </b>conversion specifiers, if the number of
       significant decimal digits is at most DECIMAL_DIG, then the
       result should be correctly rounded. If the number of significant
       decimal digits is more than DECIMAL_DIG but the source value is
       exactly representable with DECIMAL_DIG digits, then the result
       should be an exact representation with trailing zeros.
       Otherwise, the source value is bounded by two adjacent decimal
       strings <i>L</i> &lt; <i>U</i>, both having DECIMAL_DIG significant digits; the
       value of the resultant decimal string <i>D</i> should satisfy <i>L</i> &lt;= <i>D</i> &lt;=
       <i>U</i>, with the extra stipulation that the error should have a
       correct sign for the current rounding direction.

       The last data modification and last file status change timestamps
       of the file shall be marked for update between the call to a
       successful execution of <i>fwprintf</i>() or <i>wprintf</i>() and the next
       successful completion of a call to <i>fflush</i>() or <i>fclose</i>() on the
       same stream, or a call to <i>exit</i>() or <i>abort</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
       number of wide characters transmitted, excluding the terminating
       null wide character in the case of <i>swprintf</i>(), or a negative
       value if an output error was encountered, and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.

       If <i>n</i> or more wide characters were requested to be written,
       <i>swprintf</i>() shall return a negative value, and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       For the conditions under which <i>fwprintf</i>() and <i>wprintf</i>() fail and
       may fail, refer to <a href="fputwc.3p.html">fputwc(3p)</a>.

       In addition, all forms of <i>fwprintf</i>() shall fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ </b>A wide-character code that does not correspond to a valid
              character has been detected.

       In addition, <i>fwprintf</i>() and <i>wprintf</i>() may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

       The <i>swprintf</i>() shall fail if:

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The value of <i>n</i> is greater than {INT_MAX} or the number of
              bytes needed to hold the output excluding the terminating
              null is greater than {INT_MAX}.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To print the language-independent date and time format, the
       following statement could be used:

           wprintf(format, weekday, month, day, hour, min);

       For American usage, <i>format</i> could be a pointer to the wide-
       character string:

           L"%s, %s %d, %d:%.2d\n"

       producing the message:

           Sunday, July 3, 10:02

       whereas for German usage, <i>format</i> could be a pointer to the wide-
       character string:

           L"%1$s, %3$d. %2$s, %4$d:%5$.2d\n"

       producing the message:

           Sonntag, 3. Juli, 10:02
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that there are insufficient
       arguments for the format, it is recommended that the function
       should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
