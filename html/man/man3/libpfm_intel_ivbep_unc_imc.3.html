NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_ivbep_unc_imc - support for Intel Ivy Bridge-EP
       Integrated Memory Controller (IMC)  uncore PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: ivbep_unc_imc[0-7]</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Ivy Bridge-EP IMC uncore PMU</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Ivy Bridge Integrated Memory
       Controller (IMC) uncore PMU.  This PMU model only exists on Ivy
       Bridge model 62.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Ivy Bridge C-Box
       uncore PMU:

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to
              one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t      </b>Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the
              counter counts the number of IMC cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].
