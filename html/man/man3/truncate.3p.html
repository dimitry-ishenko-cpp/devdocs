PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       truncate — truncate a file to a specified length
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int truncate(const char *<i>path</i>, off_t <i>length</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>truncate</i>() function shall cause the regular file named by
       <i>path</i> to have a size which shall be equal to <i>length</i> bytes.

       If the file previously was larger than <i>length</i>, the extra data is
       discarded. If the file was previously shorter than <i>length</i>, its
       size is increased, and the extended area appears as if it were
       zero-filled.

       The application shall ensure that the process has write
       permission for the file.

       If the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file
       size limit for the process, the request shall fail and the
       implementation shall generate the SIGXFSZ signal for the process.

       The <i>truncate</i>() function shall not modify the file offset for any
       open file descriptions associated with the file. Upon successful
       completion, <i>truncate</i>() shall mark for update the last data
       modification and last file status change timestamps of the file,
       and the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may be cleared.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>truncate</i>() shall return 0. Otherwise,
       -1 shall be returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>truncate</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during execution.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>length</i> argument was less than 0.

       <b>EFBIG </b>or <b>EINVAL</b>
              The <i>length</i> argument was greater than the maximum file
              size.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a
              file system.

       <b>EACCES </b>A component of the path prefix denies search permission,
              or write permission is denied on the file.

       <b>EISDIR </b>The named file is a directory.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       The <i>truncate</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.
