       <b>#include &lt;pcp/pmapi.h&gt;</b>

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       As a consequence of network, host or Performance Metrics
       Collector Daemon (PMCD) failures, an application's connection to
       a PMCD may be established and then subsequently lost.

       The routine <b>pmReconnectContext </b>allows an application to request
       that the context identified by <i>handle</i> should be re-established,
       provided the associated metrics source is accessible.

       When the source of metrics associated with the context <i>handle</i> is
       <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, then to avoid flooding the system with reconnect
       requests, <b>pmReconnectContext </b>will only attempt a reconnection
       after a suitable delay from the previous unsuccessful attempt to
       reconnect this context. This imposed restriction on the reconnect
       re-try time interval uses an exponential back-off so that the
       initial delay is 5 seconds after the first unsuccessful attempt,
       then 10 seconds, then 20 seconds, then 40 seconds and then 80
       seconds thereafter.

       The environment variable <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT </b>may be used to
       redefine the back-off intervals, see <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a>.

       Calling <b>pmReconnectContext </b>with a handle identifying a currently
       connected <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> context will cause the connection to be broken
       before any reconnection is attempted.

       If <i>handle</i> identifies a context associated with an archive source
       of metrics, <b>pmReconnectContext </b>returns without delay.

       If the reconnection succeeds, <b>pmReconnectContext </b>returns <i>handle</i>.

       As a side-effect of reconnecting, any derived metrics that have
       previously been defined using <a href="pmregisterderived.3.html">pmRegisterDerived(3)</a>,
       <a href="pmregisterderivedmetric.3.html">pmRegisterDerivedMetric(3)</a> or <a href="pmloadderivedconfig.3.html">pmLoadDerivedConfig(3)</a> will be re-
       processed and re-bound to the available metrics from the
       reconnected source.  The support of dynamic definition for
       derived metrics provides one use case where <b>pmReconnectContext</b>
       may be called even if the connection to the metrics source has
       not been lost.

       Note that even in the case of a successful reconnection,
       <b>pmReconnectContext </b>does not change the current Performance
       Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) context, so
       <i>handle</i> remains valid.

       When attempting to connect to a remote <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on a machine that
       is booting, <b>pmReconnectContext </b>could potentially block for a long
       time until the remote machine finishes its initialization.
       <b>pmReconnectContext </b>will abort and return an error if the
       connection has not been established after some specified interval
       has elapsed.  The default interval is 5 seconds.  This may be
       modified by setting <b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT </b>in the environment to a
       real number of seconds for the desired timeout.  This is most
       useful in cases where the remote host is at the end of a slow
       network, requiring longer latencies to establish the connection
       correctly.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       Applications that use <a href="gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname(3)</a> should exercise caution
       because the static fields in <i>struct hostent</i> may not be preserved
       across some <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> calls.  In particular, <a href="pmnewcontext.3.html">pmNewContext(3)</a> and
       <a href="pmreconnectcontext.3.html">pmReconnectContext(3)</a> both may call <a href="gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname(3)</a> internally.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT</b>

              <i>handle</i> does not identify a valid PMAPI context

       <b>-ETIMEDOUT</b>

              The re-try time has not elapsed, or the reconnection is
              attempted and fails.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>
              Timeout period (in seconds) for <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> connection
              attempts.

       <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>
              Redefines the back-off intervals - refer to <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a>.
