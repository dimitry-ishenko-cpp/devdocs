SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;aio.h&gt;

       int lio_listio(int <i>mode</i>, struct aiocb *restrict const <i>list</i>[restrict],
           int <i>nent</i>, struct sigevent *restrict <i>sig</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>lio_listio</i>() function shall initiate a list of I/O requests
       with a single function call.

       The <i>mode</i> argument takes one of the values LIO_WAIT or LIO_NOWAIT
       declared in <i>&lt;aio.h&gt;</i> and determines whether the function returns
       when the I/O operations have been completed, or as soon as the
       operations have been queued. If the <i>mode</i> argument is LIO_WAIT,
       the function shall wait until all I/O is complete and the <i>sig</i>
       argument shall be ignored.

       If the <i>mode</i> argument is LIO_NOWAIT, the function shall return
       immediately, and asynchronous notification shall occur, according
       to the <i>sig</i> argument, when all the I/O operations complete. If <i>sig</i>
       is NULL, then no asynchronous notification shall occur. If <i>sig</i> is
       not NULL, asynchronous notification occurs as specified in
       <i>Section 2.4.1</i>, <i>Signal Generation and Delivery</i> when all the
       requests in <i>list</i> have completed.

       The I/O requests enumerated by <i>list</i> are submitted in an
       unspecified order.

       The <i>list</i> argument is an array of pointers to <b>aiocb </b>structures.
       The array contains <i>nent</i> elements. The array may contain NULL
       elements, which shall be ignored.

       If the buffer pointed to by <i>list</i> or the <b>aiocb </b>structures pointed
       to by the elements of the array <i>list</i> become illegal addresses
       before all asynchronous I/O completed and, if necessary, the
       notification is sent, then the behavior is undefined. If the
       buffers pointed to by the <i>aio_buf</i> member of the <b>aiocb </b>structure
       pointed to by the elements of the array <i>list</i> become illegal
       addresses prior to the asynchronous I/O associated with that
       <b>aiocb </b>structure being completed, the behavior is undefined.

       The <i>aio_lio_opcode</i> field of each <b>aiocb </b>structure specifies the
       operation to be performed. The supported operations are LIO_READ,
       LIO_WRITE, and LIO_NOP; these symbols are defined in <i>&lt;aio.h&gt;</i>.
       The LIO_NOP operation causes the list entry to be ignored. If the
       <i>aio_lio_opcode</i> element is equal to LIO_READ, then an I/O
       operation is submitted as if by a call to <i>aio_read</i>() with the
       <i>aiocbp</i> equal to the address of the <b>aiocb </b>structure. If the
       <i>aio_lio_opcode</i> element is equal to LIO_WRITE, then an I/O
       operation is submitted as if by a call to <i>aio_write</i>() with the
       <i>aiocbp</i> equal to the address of the <b>aiocb </b>structure.

       The <i>aio_fildes</i> member specifies the file descriptor on which the
       operation is to be performed.

       The <i>aio_buf</i> member specifies the address of the buffer to or from
       which the data is transferred.

       The <i>aio_nbytes</i> member specifies the number of bytes of data to be
       transferred.

       The members of the <b>aiocb </b>structure further describe the I/O
       operation to be performed, in a manner identical to that of the
       corresponding <b>aiocb </b>structure when used by the <i>aio_read</i>() and
       <i>aio_write</i>() functions.

       The <i>nent</i> argument specifies how many elements are members of the
       list; that is, the length of the array.

       The behavior of this function is altered according to the
       definitions of synchronized I/O data integrity completion and
       synchronized I/O file integrity completion if synchronized I/O is
       enabled on the file associated with <i>aio_fildes</i>.

       For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset
       maximum established in the open file description associated with
       <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.

       If <i>sig</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify</i> is SIGEV_THREAD and
       <i>sig</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> is a non-null pointer and the block
       pointed to by this pointer becomes an illegal address prior to
       all asynchronous I/O being completed, then the behavior is
       undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the <i>mode</i> argument has the value LIO_NOWAIT, the <i>lio_listio</i>()
       function shall return the value zero if the I/O operations are
       successfully queued; otherwise, the function shall return the
       value -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.

       If the <i>mode</i> argument has the value LIO_WAIT, the <i>lio_listio</i>()
       function shall return the value zero when all the indicated I/O
       has completed successfully. Otherwise, <i>lio_listio</i>() shall return
       a value of -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.

       In either case, the return value only indicates the success or
       failure of the <i>lio_listio</i>() call itself, not the status of the
       individual I/O requests. In some cases one or more of the I/O
       requests contained in the list may fail.  Failure of an
       individual request does not prevent completion of any other
       individual request. To determine the outcome of each I/O request,
       the application shall examine the error status associated with
       each <b>aiocb </b>control block. The error statuses so returned are
       identical to those returned as the result of an <i>aio_read</i>() or
       <i>aio_write</i>() function.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>lio_listio</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The resources necessary to queue all the I/O requests were
              not available. The application may check the error status
              for each <b>aiocb </b>to determine the individual request(s) that
              failed.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The number of entries indicated by <i>nent</i> would cause the
              system-wide limit {AIO_MAX} to be exceeded.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>mode</i> argument is not a proper value, or the value of
              <i>nent</i> was greater than {AIO_LISTIO_MAX}.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was delivered while waiting for all I/O requests
              to complete during an LIO_WAIT operation. Note that, since
              each I/O operation invoked by <i>lio_listio</i>() may possibly
              provoke a signal when it completes, this error return may
              be caused by the completion of one (or more) of the very
              I/O operations being awaited. Outstanding I/O requests are
              not canceled, and the application shall examine each list
              element to determine whether the request was initiated,
              canceled, or completed.

       <b>EIO    </b>One or more of the individual I/O operations failed. The
              application may check the error status for each <b>aiocb</b>
              structure to determine the individual request(s) that
              failed.

       In addition to the errors returned by the <i>lio_listio</i>() function,
       if the <i>lio_listio</i>() function succeeds or fails with errors of
       <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, <b>[EINTR]</b>, or <b>[EIO]</b>, then some of the I/O specified by
       the list may have been initiated. If the <i>lio_listio</i>() function
       fails with an error code other than <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, <b>[EINTR]</b>, or <b>[EIO]</b>,
       no operations from the list shall have been initiated. The I/O
       operation indicated by each list element can encounter errors
       specific to the individual read or write function being
       performed. In this event, the error status for each <b>aiocb </b>control
       block contains the associated error code. The error codes that
       can be set are the same as would be set by a <i>read</i>() or <i>write</i>()
       function, with the following additional error codes possible:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The requested I/O operation was not queued due to resource
              limitations.

       <b>ECANCELED</b>
              The requested I/O was canceled before the I/O completed
              due to an explicit <i>aio_cancel</i>() request.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_lio_opcode</i> is LIO_WRITE, the file is a
              regular file, <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> is greater than 0, and
              the <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> is greater than or equal to the
              offset maximum in the open file description associated
              with <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.

       <b>EINPROGRESS</b>
              The requested I/O is in progress.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_lio_opcode</i> is LIO_READ, the file is a
              regular file, <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_nbytes</i> is greater than 0, and
              the <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_offset</i> is before the end-of-file and is
              greater than or equal to the offset maximum in the open
              file description associated with <i>aiocbp</i>-&gt;<i>aio_fildes</i>.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Although it may appear that there are inconsistencies in the
       specified circumstances for error codes, the <b>[EIO] </b>error
       condition applies when any circumstance relating to an individual
       operation makes that operation fail. This might be due to a badly
       formulated request (for example, the <i>aio_lio_opcode</i> field is
       invalid, and <i>aio_error</i>() returns <b>[EINVAL]</b>) or might arise from
       application behavior (for example, the file descriptor is closed
       before the operation is initiated, and <i>aio_error</i>() returns
       <b>[EBADF]</b>).

       The limitation on the set of error codes returned when operations
       from the list shall have been initiated enables applications to
       know when operations have been started and whether <i>aio_error</i>() is
       valid for a specific operation.
