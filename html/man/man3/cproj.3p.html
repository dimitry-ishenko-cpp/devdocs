       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cproj, cprojf, cprojl — complex projection functions
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;complex.h&gt;

       double complex cproj(double complex <i>z</i>);
       float complex cprojf(float complex <i>z</i>);
       long double complex cprojl(long double complex <i>z</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall compute a projection of <i>z</i> onto the Riemann
       sphere: <i>z</i> projects to <i>z</i>, except that all complex infinities (even
       those with one infinite part and one NaN part) project to
       positive infinity on the real axis. If <i>z</i> has an infinite part,
       then <i>cproj</i>(<i>z</i>) shall be equivalent to:

           INFINITY + I * copysign(0.0, cimag(z))
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall return the value of the projection onto the
       Riemann sphere.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Two topologies are commonly used in complex mathematics: the
       complex plane with its continuum of infinities, and the Riemann
       sphere with its single infinity. The complex plane is better
       suited for transcendental functions, the Riemann sphere for
       algebraic functions. The complex types with their multiplicity of
       infinities provide a useful (though imperfect) model for the
       complex plane. The <i>cproj</i>() function helps model the Riemann
       sphere by mapping all infinities to one, and should be used just
       before any operation, especially comparisons, that might give
       spurious results for any of the other infinities. Note that a
       complex value with one infinite part and one NaN part is regarded
       as an infinity, not a NaN, because if one part is infinite, the
       complex value is infinite independent of the value of the other
       part. For the same reason, <i>cabs</i>() returns an infinity if its
       argument has an infinite part and a NaN part.
