PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       getgroups — get supplementary group IDs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int getgroups(int <i>gidsetsize</i>, gid_t <i>grouplist</i>[]);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getgroups</i>() function shall fill in the array <i>grouplist</i> with
       the current supplementary group IDs of the calling process. It is
       implementation-defined whether <i>getgroups</i>() also returns the
       effective group ID in the <i>grouplist</i> array.

       The <i>gidsetsize</i> argument specifies the number of elements in the
       array <i>grouplist</i>.  The actual number of group IDs stored in the
       array shall be returned.  The values of array entries with
       indices greater than or equal to the value returned are
       undefined.

       If <i>gidsetsize</i> is 0, <i>getgroups</i>() shall return the number of group
       IDs that it would otherwise return without modifying the array
       pointed to by <i>grouplist</i>.

       If the effective group ID of the process is returned with the
       supplementary group IDs, the value returned shall always be
       greater than or equal to one and less than or equal to the value
       of {NGROUPS_MAX}+1.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the number of supplementary group IDs
       shall be returned. A return value of -1 indicates failure and
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getgroups</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>gidsetsize</i> argument is non-zero and less than the
              number of group IDs that would have been returned.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Getting the Supplementary Group IDs of the Calling Process</b>
       The following example places the current supplementary group IDs
       of the calling process into the <i>group</i> array.

           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           ...
           gid_t *group;
           int nogroups;
           long ngroups_max;

           ngroups_max = sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) + 1;
           group = (gid_t *)malloc(ngroups_max *sizeof(gid_t));

           ngroups = getgroups(ngroups_max, group);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The related function <i>setgroups</i>() is a privileged operation and
       therefore is not covered by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       As implied by the definition of supplementary groups, the
       effective group ID may appear in the array returned by
       <i>getgroups</i>() or it may be returned only by <i>getegid</i>().  Duplication
       may exist, but the application needs to call <i>getegid</i>() to be sure
       of getting all of the information. Various implementation
       variations and administrative sequences cause the set of groups
       appearing in the result of <i>getgroups</i>() to vary in order and as to
       whether the effective group ID is included, even when the set of
       groups is the same (in the mathematical sense of ``set''). (The
       history of a process and its parents could affect the details of
       the result.)

       Application developers should note that {NGROUPS_MAX} is not
       necessarily a constant on all implementations.
