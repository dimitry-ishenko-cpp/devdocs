DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_bus_request_name() </b>requests a well-known service name on a
       bus. It takes a bus connection, a valid bus name, and a flags
       parameter. The flags parameter is a combination of zero or more
       of the following flags:

       <b>SD_BUS_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT</b>
           After acquiring the name successfully, permit other peers to
           take over the name when they try to acquire it with the
           <b>SD_BUS_NAME_REPLACE_EXISTING </b>flag set. If
           <b>SD_BUS_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT </b>is not set on the original
           request, such a request by other peers will be denied.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>SD_BUS_NAME_REPLACE_EXISTING</b>
           Take over the name if it was already acquired by another
           peer, and that other peer has permitted takeover by setting
           <b>SD_BUS_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT </b>while acquiring it.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>SD_BUS_NAME_QUEUE</b>
           Queue the acquisition of the name when the name is already
           taken.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>sd_bus_request_name() </b>operates in a synchronous fashion: a
       message requesting the name is sent to the bus broker, and the
       call waits until the broker responds.

       <b>sd_bus_request_name_async() </b>is an asynchronous version of
       <b>sd_bus_request_name()</b>. Instead of waiting for the request to
       complete, the request message is enqueued. The specified <i>callback</i>
       will be called when the broker's response is received. If the
       parameter is specified as <b>NULL </b>a default implementation is used
       instead which will terminate the connection when the name cannot
       be acquired. The function returns a slot object in its <i>slot</i>
       parameter — if it is passed as non-<b>NULL </b>— which may be used as a
       reference to the name request operation. Use <a href="sd_bus_slot_unref.3.html">sd_bus_slot_unref(3)</a>
       to destroy this reference. Note that destroying the reference
       will not unregister the name, but simply ensure the specified
       callback is no longer called.

       <b>sd_bus_release_name() </b>releases an acquired well-known name. It
       takes a bus connection and a valid bus name as parameters. This
       function operates synchronously, sending a release request
       message to the bus broker and waiting for it to reply.

       <b>sd_bus_release_name_async() </b>is an asynchronous version of
       <b>sd_bus_release_name()</b>. The specified <i>callback</i> function is called
       when the name has been released successfully. If specified as
       <b>NULL </b>a generic implementation is used that ignores the result of
       the operation. As above, the <i>slot</i> (if non-<b>NULL</b>) is set to an
       object that may be used to reference the operation.

       These functions are supported only on bus connections, i.e.
       connections to a bus broker and not on direct connections.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, these calls return 0 or a positive integer. On
       failure, these calls return a negative errno-style error code.

       If <b>SD_BUS_NAME_QUEUE </b>is specified, <b>sd_bus_request_name() </b>will
       return 0 when the name is already taken by another peer and the
       client has been added to the queue for the name. In that case,
       the caller can subscribe to "NameOwnerChanged" signals to be
       notified when the name is successfully acquired.
       <b>sd_bus_request_name() </b>returns &gt; 0 when the name has immediately
       been acquired successfully.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-EALREADY</b>
           The caller already is the owner of the specified name.

       <b>-EEXIST</b>
           The name has already been acquired by a different peer, and
           SD_BUS_NAME_REPLACE_EXISTING was not specified or the other
           peer did not specify SD_BUS_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT while
           acquiring the name.

       <b>-ESRCH</b>
           It was attempted to release a name that is currently not
           registered on the bus.

       <b>-EADDRINUSE</b>
           It was attempted to release a name that is owned by a
           different peer on the bus.

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
           A specified parameter is invalid. This is also generated when
           the requested name is a special service name reserved by the
           D-Bus specification, or when the operation is requested on a
           connection that does not refer to a bus.

       <b>-ENOTCONN</b>
           The bus connection has been disconnected.

       <b>-ECHILD</b>
           The bus connection has been created in a different process
           than the current one.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
