PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stpncpy, strncpy — copy fixed length string, returning a pointer
       to the array end
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;string.h&gt;

       char *stpncpy(char *restrict <i>s1</i>, const char *restrict <i>s2</i>, size_t <i>n</i>);
       char *strncpy(char *restrict <i>s1</i>, const char *restrict <i>s2</i>, size_t <i>n</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For <i>strncpy</i>(): The functionality described on this reference page
       is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is
       unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C
       standard.

       The <i>stpncpy</i>() and <i>strncpy</i>() functions shall copy not more than <i>n</i>
       bytes (bytes that follow a NUL character are not copied) from the
       array pointed to by <i>s2</i> to the array pointed to by <i>s1</i>.

       If the array pointed to by <i>s2</i> is a string that is shorter than <i>n</i>
       bytes, NUL characters shall be appended to the copy in the array
       pointed to by <i>s1</i>, until <i>n</i> bytes in all are written.

       If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior
       is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If a NUL character is written to the destination, the <i>stpncpy</i>()
       function shall return the address of the first such NUL
       character.  Otherwise, it shall return <i>&amp;s1</i>[<i>n</i>].

       The <i>strncpy</i>() function shall return <i>s1</i>.

       No return values are reserved to indicate an error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications must provide the space in <i>s1</i> for the <i>n</i> bytes to be
       transferred, as well as ensure that the <i>s2</i> and <i>s1</i> arrays do not
       overlap.

       Character movement is performed differently in different
       implementations. Thus, overlapping moves may yield surprises.

       If there is no NUL character byte in the first <i>n</i> bytes of the
       array pointed to by <i>s2</i>, the result is not null-terminated.
