</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These routines set options that change the style of output within
       <b>curses</b>.   All options are initially <b>FALSE</b>, unless otherwise stat‐
       ed.  It is not necessary to turn these options off before calling
       <b>endwin</b>(3X).

   <b>clearok</b>
       If <b>clearok </b>is called with <b>TRUE </b>as argument, the next call to <b>wre‐</b>
       <b>fresh </b>with this window will clear the screen completely  and  re‐
       draw  the  entire  screen  from scratch.  This is useful when the
       contents of the screen are uncertain, or in some cases for a more
       pleasing visual effect.  If the <i>win</i> argument to  <b>clearok  </b>is  the
       global variable <b>curscr</b>, the next call to <b>wrefresh </b>with any window
       causes the screen to be cleared and repainted from scratch.

   <b>idlok</b>
       If <b>idlok </b>is called with <b>TRUE </b>as second argument, <b>curses </b>considers
       using  the  hardware  insert/delete  line feature of terminals so
       equipped.  Calling <b>idlok </b>with <b>FALSE </b>as second  argument  disables
       use  of  line  insertion and deletion.  This option should be en‐
       abled only if the application needs insert/delete line, for exam‐
       ple, for a screen editor.  It is disabled by default because  in‐
       sert/delete  line  tends to be visually annoying when used in ap‐
       plications where it is not really needed.  If insert/delete  line
       cannot be used, <b>curses </b>redraws the changed portions of all lines.

   <b>idcok</b>
       If  <b>idcok  </b>is  called  with  <b>FALSE  </b>as second argument, <b>curses </b>no
       longer considers using the hardware insert/delete character  fea‐
       ture of terminals so equipped.  Use of character insert/delete is
       enabled  by  default.  Calling <b>idcok </b>with <b>TRUE </b>as second argument
       re-enables use of character insertion and deletion.

   <b>immedok</b>
       If <b>immedok </b>is called with <b>TRUE as argument</b>,  any  change  in  the
       window  image,  such  as  the  ones  caused by <b>waddch, wclrtobot,</b>
       <b>wscrl</b>, etc., automatically cause a call to <b>wrefresh</b>.  However, it
       may degrade performance considerably, due to  repeated  calls  to
       <b>wrefresh</b>.  It is disabled by default.

   <b>leaveok</b>
       Normally, the hardware cursor is left at the location of the win‐
       dow cursor being refreshed.  The <b>leaveok </b>option allows the cursor
       to be left wherever the update happens to leave it.  It is useful
       for  applications  where the cursor is not used, since it reduces
       the need for cursor motions.

   <b>scrollok</b>
       The <b>scrollok </b>option controls what happens when the  cursor  of  a
       window  is  moved off the edge of the window or scrolling region,
       either as a result of a newline action on  the  bottom  line,  or
       typing  the last character of the last line.  If disabled, (<i>bf</i> is
       <b>FALSE</b>), the cursor is left on the bottom line.  If  enabled,  (<i>bf</i>
       is  <b>TRUE</b>),  the  window is scrolled up one line (Note that to get
       the physical scrolling effect on the terminal, it is also  neces‐
       sary to call <b>idlok</b>).

   <b>setscrreg/wsetscrreg</b>
       The  <b>setscrreg </b>and <b>wsetscrreg </b>routines allow the application pro‐
       grammer to set a software scrolling region in a window.  The  <i>top</i>
       and  <i>bot</i>  parameters  are  the line numbers of the top and bottom
       margin of the scrolling region.  (Line 0 is the top line  of  the
       window.)   If this option and <b>scrollok </b>are enabled, an attempt to
       move off the bottom margin line causes all lines in the scrolling
       region to scroll one line in the direction  of  the  first  line.
       Only  the  text  of  the window is scrolled.  (Note that this has
       nothing to do with the use of a physical scrolling  region  capa‐
       bility  in the terminal, like that in the VT100.  If <b>idlok </b>is en‐
       abled and the terminal has  either  a  scrolling  region  or  in‐
       sert/delete  line  capability,  they will probably be used by the
       output routines.)
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The functions <b>setscrreg </b>and <b>wsetscrreg </b>return <b>OK </b>upon success and
       <b>ERR </b>upon failure.  All other routines that return an integer  al‐
       ways return <b>OK</b>.

       X/Open Curses does not define any error conditions.

       In this implementation,

       •   those functions that have a window pointer will return an er‐
           ror if the window pointer is null

       •   <b>wsetscrreg </b>returns an error if the scrolling region limits
           extend outside the window.

       X/Open does not define any error conditions.  This implementation
       returns an error if the window pointer is null.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue
       4.

       From the outset, ncurses used <b>nl</b>/<b>nonl </b>to control the conversion
       of newlines to carriage return/line-feed on output as well as in‐
       put.  XSI Curses documents only the use of these functions for
       input.  This difference arose from converting the <i>pcurses</i> source
       (which used <b>ioctl </b>calls with the <b>sgttyb </b>structure) to termios
       (i.e., the POSIX terminal interface).  In the former, both input
       and output were controlled via a single option <b>CRMOD</b>, while the
       latter separates these features.  Because that conversion inter‐
       feres with output optimization, <b>nl</b>/<b>nonl </b>were amended after ncurs‐
       es 6.2 to eliminate their effect on output.

       Some historic curses implementations had, as an undocumented fea‐
       ture, the ability to do the equivalent of <b>clearok(..., 1) </b>by say‐
       ing <b>touchwin(stdscr) </b>or <b>clear(stdscr)</b>.  This will not work under
       ncurses.

       Earlier System V curses implementations specified that with
       <b>scrollok </b>enabled, any window modification triggering a scroll al‐
       so forced a physical refresh.  XSI Curses does not require this,
       and <b>ncurses </b>avoids doing it to perform better vertical-motion op‐
       timization at <b>wrefresh </b>time.

       The XSI Curses standard does not mention that the cursor should
       be made invisible as a side-effect of <b>leaveok</b>.  SVr4 curses docu‐
       mentation does this, but the code does not.  Use <b>curs_set </b>to make
       the cursor invisible.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that <b>clearok</b>, <b>leaveok</b>, <b>scrollok</b>, <b>idcok</b>, and <b>setscrreg </b>may be
       macros.

       The <b>immedok </b>routine is useful for windows that are used as termi‐
       nal emulators.
