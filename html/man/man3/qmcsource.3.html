</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>QmcSource  </b>- manages contexts created by all groups
</pre> <h2>
C++ SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;QmcSource.h&gt;</b>

       <b>c++ ... -lpcp_qmc -lpcp</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>QmcSource </b>class maintains a unique list of all metric sources
       in use to minimize the creation of new contexts (see
       <a href="pmnewcontext.3.html">pmNewContext(3)</a>) when the context could have been duplicated (see
       <a href="pmdupcontext.3.html">pmDupContext(3)</a>).  This also reduces the duplication of
       descriptions of each source.

       In general, <b>QMC </b>users should only need to access <b>QmcSource</b>
       methods to obtain source descriptions for a <a href="qmccontext.3.html">QmcContext(3)</a> object.
       All context creation by the user should be handled through
       <a href="qmcgroup.3.html">QmcGroup(3)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
DESTRUCTOR </h2>
<pre>
       <b>~QmcSource();</b>
           Destructor.
</pre> <h2>
CONSTRUCTORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>static QmcSource* getSource(int type, const char* source,</b>
           <b>bool matchHosts)</b>

           This method will return a <b>QmcSource </b>object that represents a
           context of <i>type</i> to <i>source</i>.  The <b>QmcSource </b>object may be a new
           object if the <i>source</i> has not been previously requested.
           Memory management of the <b>QmcSource </b>objects is handled by
           <b>QmcSource</b>.  If all <a href="qmccontext.3.html">QmcContext(3)</a>s to the <b>QmcSource </b>have been
           deleted, the <b>QmcSource </b>object will also be deleted.

           The <i>matchHosts</i> flag controls the algorithm that is used to
           match hosts to archives.  If <i>matchHosts</i> is equal to <b>false</b>
           then no attempt will be made by this method to match a host
           context to an existing source context. A <b>QmcSource </b>object
           will always be returned in this case, although the
           <b>QmcSource::status </b>method may indicate that a context to
           <i>source</i> failed.

           If <i>matchHosts</i> is equal to <b>true</b>, host contexts will be matched
           to a predefined archive source collected from that <i>source</i>.
           If no archive sources for the <i>source</i> have been previous
           specified, <b>getSource </b>will return a NULL pointer.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       Error messages are generated using <a href="pmprintf.3.html">pmprintf(3)</a> but are not
       flushed. It is the responsibility of the user to call <a href="pmflush.3.html">pmflush(3)</a>
       to output any messages.

       Additional diagnostics may be activated by adding the option <b>pmc</b>
       to the global debugging specification, as described in
       <a href="pmsetdebug.3.html">pmSetDebug(3)</a>.
