PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dlsym — get the address of a symbol from a symbol table handle
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;

       void *dlsym(void *restrict <i>handle</i>, const char *restrict <i>name</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>dlsym</i>() function shall obtain the address of a symbol (a
       function identifier or a data object identifier) defined in the
       symbol table identified by the <i>handle</i> argument. The <i>handle</i>
       argument is a symbol table handle returned from a call to
       <i>dlopen</i>() (and which has not since been released by a call to
       <i>dlclose</i>()), and <i>name</i> is the symbol's name as a character string.
       The return value from <i>dlsym</i>(), cast to a pointer to the type of
       the named symbol, can be used to call (in the case of a function)
       or access the contents of (in the case of a data object) the
       named symbol.

       The <i>dlsym</i>() function shall search for the named symbol in the
       symbol table referenced by <i>handle</i>.  If the symbol table was
       created with lazy loading (see RTLD_LAZY in <i>dlopen</i>()), load
       ordering shall be used in <i>dlsym</i>() operations to relocate
       executable object files needed to resolve the symbol. The symbol
       resolution algorithm used shall be dependency order as described
       in <i>dlopen</i>().

       The RTLD_DEFAULT and RTLD_NEXT symbolic constants (which may be
       defined in <i>&lt;dlfcn.h&gt;</i>) are reserved for future use as special
       values that applications may be allowed to use for <i>handle</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, if <i>name</i> names a function identifier,
       <i>dlsym</i>() shall return the address of the function converted from
       type pointer to function to type pointer to <b>void</b>; otherwise,
       <i>dlsym</i>() shall return the address of the data object associated
       with the data object identifier named by <i>name</i> converted from a
       pointer to the type of the data object to a pointer to <b>void</b>.  If
       <i>handle</i> does not refer to a valid symbol table handle or if the
       symbol named by <i>name</i> cannot be found in the symbol table
       associated with <i>handle</i>, <i>dlsym</i>() shall return a null pointer.

       More detailed diagnostic information shall be available through
       <i>dlerror</i>().

ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following example shows how <i>dlopen</i>() and <i>dlsym</i>() can be used
       to access either a function or a data object. For simplicity,
       error checking has been omitted.

           void *handle;
           int (*fptr)(int), *iptr, result;
           /* open the needed symbol table */
           handle = dlopen("/usr/home/me/libfoo.so", RTLD_LOCAL | RTLD_LAZY);
           /* find the address of the function my_function */
           fptr = (int (*)(int))dlsym(handle, "my_function");
           /* find the address of the data object my_object */
           iptr = (int *)dlsym(handle, "my_OBJ");
           /* invoke my_function, passing the value of my_OBJ as the parameter */
           result = (*fptr)(*iptr);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The following special purpose values for <i>handle</i> are reserved for
       future use and have the indicated meanings:

       RTLD_DEFAULT
                   The identifier lookup happens in the normal global
                   scope; that is, a search for an identifier using
                   <i>handle</i> would find the same definition as a direct use
                   of this identifier in the program code.

       RTLD_NEXT   Specifies the next executable object file after this
                   one that defines <i>name</i>.  This one refers to the
                   executable object file containing the invocation of
                   <i>dlsym</i>().  The next executable object file is the one
                   found upon the application of a load order symbol
                   resolution algorithm (see <i>dlopen</i>()).  The next symbol
                   is either one of global scope (because it was
                   introduced as part of the original process image or
                   because it was added with a <i>dlopen</i>() operation
                   including the RTLD_GLOBAL flag), or is in an
                   executable object file that was included in the same
                   <i>dlopen</i>() operation that loaded this one.

       The RTLD_NEXT flag is useful to navigate an intentionally created
       hierarchy of multiply-defined symbols created through
       interposition. For example, if a program wished to create an
       implementation of <i>malloc</i>() that embedded some statistics
       gathering about memory allocations, such an implementation could
       use the real <i>malloc</i>() definition to perform the memory allocation
       — and itself only embed the necessary logic to implement the
       statistics gathering function.

       Note that conversion from a <b>void * </b>pointer to a function pointer
       as in:

           fptr = (int (*)(int))dlsym(handle, "my_function");

       is not defined by the ISO C standard. This standard requires this
       conversion to work correctly on conforming implementations.
