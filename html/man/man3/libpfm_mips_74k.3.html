NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_mips_74k - support for MIPS 74k processors
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: mips_74k</b>
       <b>PMU desc: MIPS 74k</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports MIPS 74k processors in big or little endian
       modes.
</pre> <h2>
ENCODINGS </h2>
<pre>
       On this processor, what is measured by an event depends on the
       event code and on the counter it is programmed on. Usually the
       meaning of the event code changes between odd and even indexed
       counters. For instance, event code <b>0x2 </b>means 'PREDICTED_JR31'
       when programmed on even-indexed counters and it means
       'JR_31_MISPREDICTIONS' when programmed on odd-indexed counters.
       To correctly measure an event, one needs both the event encoding
       and a list of possible counters.

       When pfm_get_os_event_encoding() is used with <b>PFM_OS_NONE </b>to
       return the raw PMU encoding, the library returns two values: the
       event encoding as per the architecture manual and a bitmask of
       valid counters to program it on. For instance, for
       'JR_31_MISPREDICTIONS' The library returns codes[0] = 0x4a,
       codes[1]= 0xa (supported on counter 1, 3).

       The encoding for a specific kernel interface may vary and is
       handled internally by the library.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on MIPS 74k.

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This
              is a boolean modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.
              This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>e      </b>Measure at exception level. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM2</b>.
              This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>s      </b>Measure at supervisor level. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM1</b>.
              This is a boolean modifier.

              It should be noted that those modifiers are available for
              encoding as raw mode with <b>PFM_OS_NONE </b>but they may not all
              be present with specific kernel interfaces.
