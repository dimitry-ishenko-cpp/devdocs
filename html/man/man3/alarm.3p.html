PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       alarm — schedule an alarm signal
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       unsigned alarm(unsigned <i>seconds</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>alarm</i>() function shall cause the system to generate a SIGALRM
       signal for the process after the number of realtime seconds
       specified by <i>seconds</i> have elapsed. Processor scheduling delays
       may prevent the process from handling the signal as soon as it is
       generated.

       If <i>seconds</i> is 0, a pending alarm request, if any, is canceled.

       Alarm requests are not stacked; only one SIGALRM generation can
       be scheduled in this manner. If the SIGALRM signal has not yet
       been generated, the call shall result in rescheduling the time at
       which the SIGALRM signal is generated.

       Interactions between <i>alarm</i>() and <i>setitimer</i>() are unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If there is a previous <i>alarm</i>() request with time remaining,
       <i>alarm</i>() shall return a non-zero value that is the number of
       seconds until the previous request would have generated a SIGALRM
       signal. Otherwise, <i>alarm</i>() shall return 0.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>alarm</i>() function is always successful, and no return value is
       reserved to indicate an error.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fork</i>() function clears pending alarms in the child process. A
       new process image created by one of the <i>exec</i> functions inherits
       the time left to an alarm signal in the image of the old process.

       Application developers should note that the type of the argument
       <i>seconds</i> and the return value of <i>alarm</i>() is <b>unsigned</b>.  That means
       that a Strictly Conforming POSIX System Interfaces Application
       cannot pass a value greater than the minimum guaranteed value for
       {UINT_MAX}, which the ISO C standard sets as 65535, and any
       application passing a larger value is restricting its
       portability. A different type was considered, but historical
       implementations, including those with a 16-bit <b>int </b>type,
       consistently use either <b>unsigned </b>or <b>int</b>.

       Application developers should be aware of possible interactions
       when the same process uses both the <i>alarm</i>() and <i>sleep</i>()
       functions.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Many historical implementations (including Version 7 and System
       V) allow an alarm to occur up to a second early.  Other
       implementations allow alarms up to half a second or one clock
       tick early or do not allow them to occur early at all. The latter
       is considered most appropriate, since it gives the most
       predictable behavior, especially since the signal can always be
       delayed for an indefinite amount of time due to scheduling.
       Applications can thus choose the <i>seconds</i> argument as the minimum
       amount of time they wish to have elapse before the signal.

       The term ``realtime'' here and elsewhere (<i>sleep</i>(), <i>times</i>()) is
       intended to mean ``wall clock'' time as common English usage, and
       has nothing to do with ``realtime operating systems''. It is in
       contrast to <i>virtual time</i>, which could be misinterpreted if just
       <i>time</i> were used.

       In some implementations, including 4.3 BSD, very large values of
       the <i>seconds</i> argument are silently rounded down to an
       implementation-specific maximum value. This maximum is large
       enough (to the order of several months) that the effect is not
       noticeable.

       There were two possible choices for alarm generation in multi-
       threaded applications: generation for the calling thread or
       generation for the process. The first option would not have been
       particularly useful since the alarm state is maintained on a per-
       process basis and the alarm that is established by the last
       invocation of <i>alarm</i>() is the only one that would be active.

       Furthermore, allowing generation of an asynchronous signal for a
       thread would have introduced an exception to the overall signal
       model. This requires a compelling reason in order to be
       justified.
