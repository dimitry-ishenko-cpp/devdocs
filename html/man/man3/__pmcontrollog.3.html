CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This  documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not  work,  or  may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>__pmControlLog </b>may be used to enable or disable the archiving for
       particular  performance metrics, as identified by the <i>request</i> pa‐
       rameter; see <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a> for an explanation of the <i>pmResult</i> struc‐
       ture.

       The application must have previously issued a  call  to  <b>__pmCon‐</b>
       <b>nectLogger</b>(3)  to  establish  a  control-port  connection  to the
       <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance to whom the control request is to be direct‐
       ed, and <i>fd</i> (the result from <a href="__pmconnectlogger.3.html">__pmConnectLogger(3)</a>) identifies this
       connection.

       Within <i>request</i>, only the details of the performance  metrics  and
       their  associated instances will be used, i.e.  the values of the
       metrics, if any, will be ignored.   <i>request</i>  would  typically  be
       constructed  as the result of an earlier call to <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a>.  For
       metrics with a singular  value  (having  an  instance  domain  of
       <b>PM_INDOM_NULL</b>) the corresponding <i>pmValueSet</i> should have the value
       one  in  the <i>numval</i> field and <b>PM_IN_NULL </b>as the <i>inst</i> field of the
       single <i>pmValue</i> supplied.  If multiple explicit instances  are  to
       be  logged, the <i>numval</i> field of the <i>pmValueSet</i> should contain the
       number of instances supplied and the <i>inst</i> fields of  the  <i>pmValue</i>
       structures  should  contain  specific instance identifiers (which
       may not have the reserved value <b>PM_IN_NULL</b>).

       If the <i>numval</i> field within any of the  <i>pmValueSet</i>  structures  in
       <i>request</i>  has a value of zero, it indicates that all available in‐
       stances of the metric should be used.   Enumeration  of  the  in‐
       stance  domain  is  deferred  until the logger fetches the metric
       prior to writing it to the archive, rather than  being  performed
       when  the <b>__pmControlLog </b>request is received.  This is useful for
       metrics with instance domains that change over time.   It  is  an
       error to specify <i>numval</i> equal to zero if the corresponding metric
       has a singular value (no instance domain).

       There  are  several  sorts  of  logging control available, namely
       mandatory or advisory, as defined by the  <i>control</i>  argument,  and
       on,  off or maybe as defined by the <i>state</i> argument. These differ‐
       ent types of control may be used to ensure that some  performance
       metrics can be guaranteed to always be in the archive, while oth‐
       ers  may  be dynamically enabled or disabled as determined by the
       level and type of system activity.

       The actual action to be performed is defined by  the  combination
       of  <i>control</i> and <i>state</i> as follows.  If <i>control</i> is <b>PM_LOG_MANDATORY</b>
       and <i>state</i> is <b>PM_LOG_ON</b>, then logging is enabled.  If  <i>control</i>  is
       <b>PM_LOG_MANDATORY  </b>and  <i>state</i>  is <b>PM_LOG_OFF</b>, then logging is dis‐
       abled.  If <i>control</i> is <b>PM_LOG_MANDATORY </b>and <i>state</i> is <b>PM_LOG_MAYBE</b>,
       then subsequent advisory controls will be honored.  If  the  log‐
       ging  state  prior  to the request was mandatory (on or off), the
       state is changed to advisory off.  If the logging state  was  al‐
       ready advisory (either on or off), it remains unchanged.  If <i>con‐</i>
       <i>trol</i>  is  <b>PM_LOG_ADVISORY  </b>and the last mandatory control for the
       metric was <b>PM_LOG_MAYBE</b>, then logging is enabled or  disabled  as
       specified  by  the <i>state</i> argument, i.e.  <b>PM_LOG_ON </b>or <b>PM_LOG_OFF</b>.
       When the arguments <i>state</i> and <i>control</i> specify a request to  change
       the  logging behavior, the argument <i>delta</i> defines the logging in‐
       terval in milliseconds to be applied to all metrics and instances
       identified in <i>request</i>.

       The result argument <i>status</i> returns the current logging state  for
       each of the nominated performance metrics.  There is a 1:1 corre‐
       spondence  between  the elements of <i>request</i> and <i>status.</i>  For met‐
       rics in <i>request</i> that have <i>pmValueSet</i>s with <i>numval</i> equal to  zero,
       the  corresponding  <i>pmValueSet</i> in <i>result</i> will contain a value for
       each available instance at the time of  the  call.   Each  metric
       value  in  <i>status</i>  will have the current logging state encoded in
       it.  The detailed outcome of the operation for each metric can be
       determined by comparing these values to that requested  via  <i>con‐</i>
       <i>trol</i>, <i>state</i> and <i>delta</i>.

       Macros  defined  in <b>libpcp.h </b>may be used to extract the state and
       logging interval from the returned  metric  values.   <b>PMLC_GET_ON</b>
       returns   true  if  logging  is  on,  or  false  if  it  is  off;
       <b>PMLC_GET_MAND </b>returns true if logging is mandatory, or  false  if
       it  is  advisory;  <b>PMLC_GET_INLOG  </b>returns true if the metric has
       been logged at least once, or false otherwise; <b>PMLC_GET_AVAIL </b>re‐
       turns true if the metric was available from its source  the  last
       time  it  was  supposed to be logged, or false if it was unavail‐
       able; and <b>PMLC_GET_DELTA </b>returns the current logging interval for
       the metric (in milliseconds).  <b>PMLC_MAX_DELTA </b>defines the  great‐
       est <i>delta</i> that can be returned in an encoded metric value.

       As  a  special  case,  when  <i>control</i> is <b>PM_LOG_ENQUIRE</b>, <i>state</i> and
       <i>delta</i> are ignored, and <i>status</i> returns the current  logging  state
       of  the  nominated  performance  metrics  (this  variant makes no
       changes to the logging state).

       If the value of the logging interval is 0, either for <i>delta</i> in  a
       request to change state to <b>PM_LOG_ON</b>, or encoded in the value re‐
       turned  from <b>PM_LOG_ENQUIRE</b>, then this corresponds to the special
       ``once only'' logging of metrics that appear once in the archive,
       and are never logged again.

       <b>__pmControlLog </b>returns zero on success.

NOTE </h2>
<pre>
       This routine is not thread-safe as there is no  serialization  on
       the  use  of the communication channel between the sending of the
       request and receiving the reply.  It is assumed that  the  caller
       is  single-threaded,  which  is true for the only current user of
       this routine, namely <a href="../man1/pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PM_ERR_TOOSMALL</b>
              The number of metrics in <i>request</i> is less than one.

       <b>PM_ERR_VALUE</b>
              One or more of the <i>pmValueSet</i>s in <i>request</i> had <i>numval</i> (the
              number of instances) less than one.

       <b>EINVAL </b>An invalid combination of <i>control</i> and <i>state</i> was specified,
              or <i>delta</i> was negative.
