NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_set_timeout - set the packet buffer timeout for a not-yet-
       activated capture handle
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pcap_set_timeout(pcap_t *p, int to_ms);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_set_timeout</b>() sets the packet buffer timeout that will be
       used on a capture handle when the handle is activated to <i>to_ms</i>,
       which is in units of milliseconds.  (See <b>pcap</b>(3PCAP) for an
       explanation of the packet buffer timeout.)

       The behavior, if the timeout isn't specified, is undefined, as is
       the behavior if the timeout is set to zero or to a negative
       value.  We recommend always setting the timeout to a non-zero
       value unless immediate mode is set, in which case the timeout has
       no effect.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_set_timeout</b>() returns <b>0 </b>on success or <b>PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED</b>
       if called on a capture handle that has been activated.
