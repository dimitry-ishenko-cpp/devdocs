PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       uname — get the name of the current system
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;

       int uname(struct utsname *<i>name</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>uname</i>() function shall store information identifying the
       current system in the structure pointed to by <i>name</i>.

       The <i>uname</i>() function uses the <b>utsname </b>structure defined in
       <i>&lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;</i>.

       The <i>uname</i>() function shall return a string naming the current
       system in the character array <i>sysname</i>.  Similarly, <i>nodename</i> shall
       contain the name of this node within an implementation-defined
       communications network. The arrays <i>release</i> and <i>version</i> shall
       further identify the operating system. The array <i>machine</i> shall
       contain a name that identifies the hardware that the system is
       running on.

       The format of each member is implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, a non-negative value shall be
       returned.  Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The inclusion of the <i>nodename</i> member in this structure does not
       imply that it is sufficient information for interfacing to
       communications networks.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The values of the structure members are not constrained to have
       any relation to the version of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       implemented in the operating system. An application should
       instead depend on _POSIX_VERSION and related constants defined in
       <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i>.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not define the sizes of the
       members of the structure and permits them to be of different
       sizes, although most implementations define them all to be the
       same size: eight bytes plus one byte for the string terminator.
       That size for <i>nodename</i> is not enough for use with many networks.

       The <i>uname</i>() function originated in System III, System V, and
       related implementations, and it does not exist in Version 7 or
       4.3 BSD. The values it returns are set at system compile time in
       those historical implementations.

       4.3 BSD has <i>gethostname</i>() and <i>gethostid</i>(), which return a
       symbolic name and a numeric value, respectively. There are
       related <i>sethostname</i>() and <i>sethostid</i>() functions that are used to
       set the values the other two functions return. The former
       functions are included in this specification, the latter are not.
