DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>form_driver</b>
       Once a form has been posted (displayed), you should funnel input
       events to it through <b>form_driver</b>.  This routine has three major
       input cases:

       •   The input is a form navigation request.  Navigation request
           codes are constants defined in <b>&lt;form.h&gt;</b>, which are distinct
           from the key- and character codes returned by <b>wgetch</b>(3X).

       •   The input is a printable character.  Printable characters
           (which must be positive, less than 256) are checked according
           to the program's locale settings.

       •   The input is the KEY_MOUSE special key associated with an
           mouse event.

   <b>form_driver_w</b>
       This extension simplifies the use of the forms library using wide
       characters.  The input is either a key code (a request) or a wide
       character returned by <b>get_wch</b>(3X).  The type must be passed as
       well, to enable the library to determine whether the parameter is
       a wide character or a request.

   <b>Form-driver requests</b>
       The form driver requests are as follows:

       REQ_UP_FIELD       Move up to a field.
       REQ_VALIDATION     Validate field.

       If the second argument is a printable character, the driver
       places it in the current position in the current field.  If it is
       one of the forms requests listed above, that request is executed.

   <b>Field validation</b>
       The form library makes updates to the window associated with form
       fields rather than directly to the field buffers.

       The form driver provides low-level control over updates to the
       form fields.  The form driver also provides for validating
       modified fields to ensure that the contents meet whatever
       constraints an application may attach using <b>set_field_type</b>.

       You can validate a field without making any changes to it using
       <b>REQ_VALIDATION</b>.  The form driver also validates a field in these
       cases:

       •   a call to <b>set_current_field </b>attempts to move to a different
           field.

       •   a call to <b>set_current_page </b>attempts to move to a different
           page of the form.

       •   a request attempts to move to a different field.

       •   a request attempts to move to a different page of the form.

       In each case, the move fails if the field is invalid.

       If the modified field is valid, the form driver copies the
       modified data from the window associated with the field to the
       field buffer.

   <b>Mouse handling</b>
       If the second argument is the KEY_MOUSE special key, the
       associated mouse event is translated into one of the above pre-
       defined requests.  Currently only clicks in the user window
       (e.g., inside the form display area or the decoration window) are
       handled.

       If you click above the display region of the form:

          a REQ_PREV_FIELD is generated for a single click,

          a REQ_PREV_PAGE is generated for a double-click and

          a REQ_FIRST_FIELD is generated for a triple-click.

       If you click below the display region of the form:

          a REQ_NEXT_FIELD is generated for a single click,

          a REQ_NEXT_PAGE is generated for a double-click and

          a REQ_LAST_FIELD is generated for a triple-click.

       If you click at an field inside the display area of the form:

          •   the form cursor is positioned to that field.

          •   If you double-click a field, the form cursor is positioned
              to that field and <b>E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND </b>is returned.  This
              return value makes sense, because a double click usually
              means that an field-specific action should be returned.
              It is exactly the purpose of this return value to signal
              that an application specific command should be executed.

          •   If a translation into a request was done, <b>form_driver</b>
              returns the result of this request.

       If you clicked outside the user window or the mouse event could
       not be translated into a form request an <b>E_REQUEST_DENIED </b>is
       returned.

   <b>Application-defined commands</b>
       If the second argument is neither printable nor one of the above
       pre-defined form requests, the driver assumes it is an
       application-specific command and returns <b>E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND</b>.
       Application-defined commands should be defined relative to
       <b>MAX_COMMAND</b>, the maximum value of these pre-defined requests.
