NAME </h2>
<pre>
       history - GNU History Library
</pre> <h2>
COPYRIGHT </h2>
<pre>
       The GNU History Library is Copyright (C) 1989-2020 by the Free
       Software Foundation, Inc.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Many programs read input from the user a line at a time.  The GNU
       History library is able to keep track of those lines, associate
       arbitrary data with each line, and utilize information from
       previous lines in composing new ones.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY EXPANSION </h2>
<pre>
       The history library supports a history expansion feature that is
       identical to the history expansion in <b>bash.  </b>This section
       describes what syntax features are available.

       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the
       input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the
       arguments to a previous command into the current input line, or
       fix errors in previous commands quickly.

       History expansion is usually performed immediately after a
       complete line is read.  It takes place in two parts.  The first
       is to determine which line from the history list to use during
       substitution.  The second is to select portions of that line for
       inclusion into the current one.  The line selected from the
       history is the <i>event</i>, and the portions of that line that are
       acted upon are <i>words</i>.  Various <i>modifiers</i> are available to
       manipulate the selected words.  The line is broken into words in
       the same fashion as <b>bash </b>does when reading input, so that several
       words that would otherwise be separated are considered one word
       when surrounded by quotes (see the description of
       <b>history_tokenize() </b>below).  History expansions are introduced by
       the appearance of the history expansion character, which is <b>! </b>by
       default.  Only backslash (<b>\</b>) and single quotes can quote the
       history expansion character.

   <b>Event Designators</b>
       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the
       history list.  Unless the reference is absolute, events are
       relative to the current position in the history list.

       <b>!      </b>Start a history substitution, except when followed by a
              <b>blank</b>, newline, = or (.
       <b>!</b><i>n</i>     Refer to command line <i>n</i>.
       <b>!-</b><i>n</i>    Refer to the current command minus <i>n</i>.
       <b>!!     </b>Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for
              `!-1'.
       <b>!</b><i>string</i>
              Refer to the most recent command preceding the current
              position in the history list starting with <i>string</i>.
       <b>!?</b><i>string</i><b>[?]</b>
              Refer to the most recent command preceding the current
              position in the history list containing <i>string</i>.  The
              trailing <b>? </b>may be omitted if <i>string</i> is followed
              immediately by a newline.  If <i>string</i> is missing, the
              string from the most recent search is used; it is an error
              if there is no previous search string.
       <b>^</b><i>string1</i><b>^</b><i>string2</i><b>^</b>
              Quick substitution.  Repeat the last command, replacing
              <i>string1</i> with <i>string2</i>.  Equivalent to
              ``!!:s^<i>string1</i>^<i>string2</i>^'' (see <b>Modifiers </b>below).
       <b>!#     </b>The entire command line typed so far.

   <b>Word Designators</b>
       Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.
       A <b>: </b>separates the event specification from the word designator.
       It may be omitted if the word designator begins with a <b>^</b>, <b>$</b>, <b>*</b>,
       <b>-</b>, or <b>%</b>.  Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with
       the first word being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted
       into the current line separated by single spaces.

       <b>0 (zero)</b>
              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
       <i>n</i>      The <i>n</i>th word.
       <b>^      </b>The first argument.  That is, word 1.
       <b>$      </b>The last word.  This is usually the last argument, but
              will expand to the zeroth word if there is only one word
              in the line.
       <b>%      </b>The first word matched by the most recent `?<i>string</i>?'
              search, if the search string begins with a character that
              is part of a word.
       <i>x</i><b>-</b><i>y</i>    A range of words; `-<i>y</i>' abbreviates `0-<i>y</i>'.
       <b>*      </b>All of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for
              `<i>1-$</i>'.  It is not an error to use <b>* </b>if there is just one
              word in the event; the empty string is returned in that
              case.
       <b>x*     </b>Abbreviates <i>x-$</i>.
       <b>x-     </b>Abbreviates <i>x-$</i> like <b>x*</b>, but omits the last word.  If <b>x </b>is
              missing, it defaults to 0.

       If a word designator is supplied without an event specification,
       the previous command is used as the event.

   <b>Modifiers</b>
       After the optional word designator, there may appear a sequence
       of one or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a
       `:'.  These modify, or edit, the word or words selected from the
       history event.

       <b>h      </b>Remove a trailing file name component, leaving only the
              head.
       <b>t      </b>Remove all leading file name components, leaving the tail.
       <b>r      </b>Remove a trailing suffix of the form <i>.xxx</i>, leaving the
              basename.
       <b>e      </b>Remove all but the trailing suffix.
       <b>p      </b>Print the new command but do not execute it.
       <b>q      </b>Quote the substituted words, escaping further
              substitutions.
       <b>x      </b>Quote the substituted words as with <b>q</b>, but break into
              words at <b>blanks </b>and newlines.  The <b>q </b>and <b>x </b>modifiers are
              mutually exclusive; the last one supplied is used.
       <b>s/</b><i>old</i><b>/</b><i>new</i><b>/</b>
              Substitute <i>new</i> for the first occurrence of <i>old</i> in the
              event line.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in
              place of /.  The final delimiter is optional if it is the
              last character of the event line.  The delimiter may be
              quoted in <i>old</i> and <i>new</i> with a single backslash.  If &amp;
              appears in <i>new</i>, it is replaced by <i>old</i>.  A single backslash
              will quote the &amp;.  If <i>old</i> is null, it is set to the last
              <i>old</i> substituted, or, if no previous history substitutions
              took place, the last <i>string</i> in a <b>!?</b><i>string</i><b>[?]  </b>search.  If
              <i>new</i> is null, each matching <i>old</i> is deleted.
       <b>&amp;      </b>Repeat the previous substitution.
       <b>g      </b>Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.
              This is used in conjunction with `<b>:s</b>' (e.g.,
              `<b>:gs/</b><i>old</i><b>/</b><i>new</i><b>/</b>') or `<b>:&amp;</b>'.  If used with `<b>:s</b>', any delimiter
              can be used in place of /, and the final delimiter is
              optional if it is the last character of the event line.
              An <b>a </b>may be used as a synonym for <b>g</b>.
       <b>G      </b>Apply the following `<b>s</b>' or `<b>&amp;</b>' modifier once to each word
              in the event line.

PROGRAMMING WITH HISTORY FUNCTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       This section describes how to use the History library in other
       programs.

   <b>Introduction to History</b>
       A programmer using the History library has available functions
       for remembering lines on a history list, associating arbitrary
       data with a line, removing lines from the list, searching through
       the list for a line containing an arbitrary text string, and
       referencing any line in the list directly.  In addition, a
       history <i>expansion</i> function is available which provides for a
       consistent user interface across different programs.

       The user using programs written with the History library has the
       benefit of a consistent user interface with a set of well-known
       commands for manipulating the text of previous lines and using
       that text in new commands.  The basic history manipulation
       commands are identical to the history substitution provided by
       <b>bash</b>.

       The programmer can also use the readline library, which includes
       some history manipulation by default, and has the added advantage
       of command line editing.

       Before declaring any functions using any functionality the
       History library provides in other code, an application writer
       should include the file <i>&lt;readline/history.h&gt;</i> in any file that
       uses the History library's features.  It supplies extern
       declarations for all of the library's public functions and
       variables, and declares all of the public data structures.

   <b>History Storage</b>
       The history list is an array of history entries.  A history entry
       is declared as follows:

       <i>typedef void *</i> <b>histdata_t;</b>

       typedef struct _hist_entry {
         char *line;
         char *timestamp;
         histdata_t data;
       } HIST_ENTRY;

       The history list itself might therefore be declared as

       <i>HIST_ENTRY **</i> <b>the_history_list;</b>

       The state of the History library is encapsulated into a single
       structure:

       /*
        * A structure used to pass around the current state of the history.
        */
       typedef struct _hist_state {
         HIST_ENTRY **entries; /* Pointer to the entries themselves. */
         int offset;           /* The location pointer within this array. */
         int length;           /* Number of elements within this array. */
         int size;             /* Number of slots allocated to this array. */
         int flags;
       } HISTORY_STATE;

       If the flags member includes <b>HS_STIFLED</b>, the history has been
       stifled.

History Functions </h2>
<pre>
       This section describes the calling sequence for the various
       functions exported by the GNU History library.

   <b>Initializing History and State Management</b>
       This section describes functions used to initialize and manage
       the state of the History library when you want to use the history
       functions in your program.

       <i>void</i> <b>using_history </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Begin a session in which the history functions might be used.
       This initializes the interactive variables.

       <i>HISTORY_STATE *</i> <b>history_get_history_state </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Return a structure describing the current state of the input
       history.

       <i>void</i> <b>history_set_history_state </b>(<i>HISTORY_STATE *state</i>)
       Set the state of the history list according to <i>state</i>.

   <b>History List Management</b>
       These functions manage individual entries on the history list, or
       set parameters managing the list itself.

       <i>void</i> <b>add_history </b>(<i>const char *string</i>)
       Place <i>string</i> at the end of the history list.  The associated data
       field (if any) is set to <b>NULL</b>.  If the maximum number of history
       entries has been set using <b>stifle_history()</b>, and the new number
       of history entries would exceed that maximum, the oldest history
       entry is removed.

       <i>void</i> <b>add_history_time </b>(<i>const char *string</i>)
       Change the time stamp associated with the most recent history
       entry to <i>string</i>.

       <i>HIST_ENTRY *</i> <b>remove_history </b>(<i>int which</i>)
       Remove history entry at offset <i>which</i> from the history.  The
       removed element is returned so you can free the line, data, and
       containing structure.

       <i>histdata_t</i> <b>free_history_entry </b>(<i>HIST_ENTRY *histent</i>)
       Free the history entry <i>histent</i> and any history library private
       data associated with it.  Returns the application-specific data
       so the caller can dispose of it.

       <i>HIST_ENTRY *</i> <b>replace_history_entry </b>(<i>int which, const char *line,</i>
       <i>histdata_t data</i>)
       Make the history entry at offset <i>which</i> have <i>line</i> and <i>data</i>.  This
       returns the old entry so the caller can dispose of any
       application-specific data.  In the case of an invalid <i>which</i>, a
       <b>NULL </b>pointer is returned.

       <i>void</i> <b>clear_history </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.

       <i>void</i> <b>stifle_history </b>(<i>int max</i>)
       Stifle the history list, remembering only the last <i>max</i> entries.
       The history list will contain only <i>max</i> entries at a time.

       <i>int</i> <b>unstifle_history </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Stop stifling the history.  This returns the previously-set
       maximum number of history entries (as set by <b>stifle_history()</b>).
       history was stifled.  The value is positive if the history was
       stifled, negative if it wasn't.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_is_stifled </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Returns non-zero if the history is stifled, zero if it is not.

   <b>Information About the History List</b>
       These functions return information about the entire history list
       or individual list entries.

       <i>HIST_ENTRY **</i> <b>history_list </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Return a <b>NULL </b>terminated array of <i>HIST_ENTRY *</i> which is the
       current input history.  Element 0 of this list is the beginning
       of time.  If there is no history, return <b>NULL</b>.

       <i>int</i> <b>where_history </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Returns the offset of the current history element.

       <i>HIST_ENTRY *</i> <b>current_history </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Return the history entry at the current position, as determined
       by <b>where_history()</b>.  If there is no entry there, return a <b>NULL</b>
       pointer.

       <i>HIST_ENTRY *</i> <b>history_get </b>(<i>int offset</i>)
       Return the history entry at position <i>offset</i>.  The range of valid
       values of <i>offset</i> starts at <b>history_base </b>and ends at
       <b>history_length </b>- 1.  If there is no entry there, or if <i>offset</i> is
       outside the valid range, return a <b>NULL </b>pointer.

       <i>time_t</i> <b>history_get_time </b>(<i>HIST_ENTRY *</i>)
       Return the time stamp associated with the history entry passed as
       the argument.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_total_bytes </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Return the number of bytes that the primary history entries are
       using.  This function returns the sum of the lengths of all the
       lines in the history.

   <b>Moving Around the History List</b>
       These functions allow the current index into the history list to
       be set or changed.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_set_pos </b>(<i>int pos</i>)
       Set the current history offset to <i>pos</i>, an absolute index into the
       list.  Returns 1 on success, 0 if <i>pos</i> is less than zero or
       greater than the number of history entries.

       <i>HIST_ENTRY *</i> <b>previous_history </b>(<i>void</i>)
       Back up the current history offset to the previous history entry,
       and return a pointer to that entry.  If there is no previous
       entry, return a <b>NULL </b>pointer.

       <i>HIST_ENTRY *</i> <b>next_history </b>(<i>void</i>)
       If the current history offset refers to a valid history entry,
       increment the current history offset.  If the possibly-
       incremented history offset refers to a valid history entry,
       return a pointer to that entry; otherwise, return a <b>NULL </b>pointer.

   <b>Searching the History List</b>
       These functions allow searching of the history list for entries
       containing a specific string.  Searching may be performed both
       forward and backward from the current history position.  The
       search may be <i>anchored</i>, meaning that the string must match at the
       beginning of the history entry.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_search </b>(<i>const char *string, int direction</i>)
       Search the history for <i>string</i>, starting at the current history
       offset.  If <i>direction</i> is less than 0, then the search is through
       previous entries, otherwise through subsequent entries.  If
       <i>string</i> is found, then the current history index is set to that
       history entry, and the value returned is the offset in the line
       of the entry where <i>string</i> was found.  Otherwise, nothing is
       changed, and a -1 is returned.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_search_prefix </b>(<i>const char *string, int direction</i>)
       Search the history for <i>string</i>, starting at the current history
       offset.  The search is anchored: matching lines must begin with
       <i>string</i>.  If <i>direction</i> is less than 0, then the search is through
       previous entries, otherwise through subsequent entries.  If
       <i>string</i> is found, then the current history index is set to that
       entry, and the return value is 0.  Otherwise, nothing is changed,
       and a -1 is returned.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_search_pos </b>(<i>const char *string, int direction, int</i>
       <i>pos</i>)
       Search for <i>string</i> in the history list, starting at <i>pos</i>, an
       absolute index into the list.  If <i>direction</i> is negative, the
       search proceeds backward from <i>pos</i>, otherwise forward.  Returns
       the absolute index of the history element where <i>string</i> was found,
       or -1 otherwise.

   <b>Managing the History File</b>
       The History library can read the history from and write it to a
       file.  This section documents the functions for managing a
       history file.

       <i>int</i> <b>read_history </b>(<i>const char *filename</i>)
       Add the contents of <i>filename</i> to the history list, a line at a
       time.  If <i>filename</i> is <b>NULL</b>, then read from <i>~/.history</i>.  Returns 0
       if successful, or <b>errno </b>if not.

       <i>int</i> <b>read_history_range </b>(<i>const char *filename, int from, int to</i>)
       Read a range of lines from <i>filename</i>, adding them to the history
       list.  Start reading at line <i>from</i> and end at <i>to</i>.  If <i>from</i> is
       zero, start at the beginning.  If <i>to</i> is less than <i>from</i>, then read
       until the end of the file.  If <i>filename</i> is <b>NULL</b>, then read from
       <i>~/.history</i>.  Returns 0 if successful, or <b>errno </b>if not.

       <i>int</i> <b>write_history </b>(<i>const char *filename</i>)
       Write the current history to <i>filename</i>, overwriting <i>filename</i> if
       necessary.  If <i>filename</i> is <b>NULL</b>, then write the history list to
       <i>~/.history</i>.  Returns 0 on success, or <b>errno </b>on a read or write
       error.

       <i>int</i> <b>append_history </b>(<i>int nelements, const char *filename</i>)
       Append the last <i>nelements</i> of the history list to <i>filename</i>.  If
       <i>filename</i> is <b>NULL</b>, then append to <i>~/.history</i>.  Returns 0 on
       success, or <b>errno </b>on a read or write error.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_truncate_file </b>(<i>const char *filename, int nlines</i>)
       Truncate the history file <i>filename</i>, leaving only the last <i>nlines</i>
       lines.  If <i>filename</i> is <b>NULL</b>, then <i>~/.history</i> is truncated.
       Returns 0 on success, or <b>errno </b>on failure.

   <b>History Expansion</b>
       These functions implement history expansion.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_expand </b>(<i>char *string, char **output</i>)
       Expand <i>string</i>, placing the result into <i>output</i>, a pointer to a
       string.  Returns:
              0      If no expansions took place (or, if the only change
                     in the text was the removal of escape characters
                     preceding the history expansion character);
              1      if expansions did take place;
              -1     if there was an error in expansion;
              2      if the returned line should be displayed, but not
                     executed, as with the <b>:p </b>modifier.
       If an error occurred in expansion, then <i>output</i> contains a
       descriptive error message.

       <i>char *</i> <b>get_history_event </b>(<i>const char *string, int *cindex, int</i>
       <i>qchar</i>)
       Returns the text of the history event beginning at <i>string</i> +
       <i>*cindex</i>.  <i>*cindex</i> is modified to point to after the event
       specifier.  At function entry, <i>cindex</i> points to the index into
       <i>string</i> where the history event specification begins.  <i>qchar</i> is a
       character that is allowed to end the event specification in
       addition to the ``normal'' terminating characters.

       <i>char **</i> <b>history_tokenize </b>(<i>const char *string</i>)
       Return an array of tokens parsed out of <i>string</i>, much as the shell
       might.  The tokens are split on the characters in the
       <b>history_word_delimiters </b>variable, and shell quoting conventions
       are obeyed.

       <i>char *</i> <b>history_arg_extract </b>(<i>int first, int last, const char</i>
       <i>*string</i>)
       Extract a string segment consisting of the <i>first</i> through <i>last</i>
       arguments present in <i>string</i>.  Arguments are split using
       <b>history_tokenize()</b>.

   <b>History Variables</b>
       This section describes the externally-visible variables exported
       by the GNU History Library.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_base</b>
       The logical offset of the first entry in the history list.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_length</b>
       The number of entries currently stored in the history list.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_max_entries</b>
       The maximum number of history entries.  This must be changed
       using <b>stifle_history()</b>.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_write_timestamps</b>
       If non-zero, timestamps are written to the history file, so they
       can be preserved between sessions.  The default value is 0,
       meaning that timestamps are not saved.  The current timestamp
       format uses the value of <i>history_comment_char</i> to delimit
       timestamp entries in the history file.  If that variable does not
       have a value (the default), timestamps will not be written.

       <i>char</i> <b>history_expansion_char</b>
       The character that introduces a history event.  The default is <b>!</b>.
       Setting this to 0 inhibits history expansion.

       <i>char</i> <b>history_subst_char</b>
       The character that invokes word substitution if found at the
       start of a line.  The default is <b>^</b>.

       <i>char</i> <b>history_comment_char</b>
       During tokenization, if this character is seen as the first
       character of a word, then it and all subsequent characters up to
       a newline are ignored, suppressing history expansion for the
       remainder of the line.  This is disabled by default.

       <i>char *</i> <b>history_word_delimiters</b>
       The characters that separate tokens for <b>history_tokenize()</b>.  The
       default value is <b>" \t\n()&lt;&gt;;&amp;|"</b>.

       <i>char *</i> <b>history_no_expand_chars</b>
       The list of characters which inhibit history expansion if found
       immediately following <b>history_expansion_char</b>.  The default is
       space, tab, newline, <b>\r</b>, and <b>=</b>.

       <i>char *</i> <b>history_search_delimiter_chars</b>
       The list of additional characters which can delimit a history
       search string, in addition to space, tab, <i>:</i> and <i>?</i> in the case of
       a substring search.  The default is empty.

       <i>int</i> <b>history_quotes_inhibit_expansion</b>
       If non-zero, double-quoted words are not scanned for the history
       expansion character or the history comment character.  The
       default value is 0.

       <i>rl_linebuf_func_t *</i> <b>history_inhibit_expansion_function</b>
       This should be set to the address of a function that takes two
       arguments: a <b>char * </b>(<i>string</i>) and an <b>int </b>index into that string
       (<i>i</i>).  It should return a non-zero value if the history expansion
       starting at <i>string[i]</i> should not be performed; zero if the
       expansion should be done.  It is intended for use by applications
       like <b>bash </b>that use the history expansion character for additional
       purposes.  By default, this variable is set to <b>NULL</b>.
