NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pam_setcred - establish / delete user credentials
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pam_setcred(pam_handle_t *</b><i>pamh</i><b>, int </b><i>flags</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pam_setcred </b>function is used to establish, maintain and
       delete the credentials of a user. It should be called to set the
       credentials after a user has been authenticated and before a
       session is opened for the user (with <a href="pam_open_session.3.html">pam_open_session(3)</a>). The
       credentials should be deleted after the session has been closed
       (with <a href="pam_close_session.3.html">pam_close_session(3)</a>).

       A credential is something that the user possesses. It is some
       property, such as a <i>Kerberos</i> ticket, or a supplementary group
       membership that make up the uniqueness of a given user. On a
       Linux system the user's <i>UID</i> and <i>GID</i>'s are credentials too.
       However, it has been decided that these properties (along with
       the default supplementary groups of which the user is a member)
       are credentials that should be set directly by the application
       and not by PAM. Such credentials should be established, by the
       application, prior to a call to this function. For example,
       <b>initgroups</b>(2) (or equivalent) should have been performed.

       Valid <i>flags</i>, any one of which, may be logically OR'd with
       <b>PAM_SILENT</b>, are:

       PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED
           Initialize the credentials for the user.

       PAM_DELETE_CRED
           Delete the user's credentials.

       PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED
           Fully reinitialize the user's credentials.

       PAM_REFRESH_CRED
           Extend the lifetime of the existing credentials.
