NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ldap_perror, ld_errno, ldap_result2error, ldap_errlist,
       ldap_err2string - LDAP protocol error handling routines
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;ldap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char *ldap_err2string( int </b><i>err</i> <b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>ldap_err2string() </b>routine provides short description of the
       various codes returned by routines in this library.  The returned
       string is a pointer to a static area that should not be modified.

       These codes are either negative, indicating an API error code;
       positive, indicating an LDAP resultCode other than ´success' (0),
       or - zero, indicating both successful use of the API and the LDAP
       resultCode ´success' (0).

       The code associated with an LDAP session is accessible using
       <a href="ldap_get_option.3.html">ldap_get_option(3)</a> and <a href="ldap_set_option.3.html">ldap_set_option(3)</a> with the
       <b>LDAP_OPT_RESULT_CODE </b>option (previously called
       <b>LDAP_OPT_ERROR_NUMBER</b>).
</pre> <h2>
PROTOCOL RESULT CODES </h2>
<pre>
       This section provides a partial list of protocol codes recognized
       by the library.  As LDAP is extensible, additional values may be
       returned.  A complete listing of <i>registered</i> LDAP result codes can
       be obtained from the <i>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</i>
       &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org">http://www.iana.org</a>&gt;.

              a userPassword attribute).

</pre> <h2>
API ERROR CODES </h2>
<pre>
       This section provides a complete list of API error codes
       recognized by the library.   Note that LDAP_SUCCESS indicates
       success of an API call in addition to representing the return of

              An ldap routine was called with a bad parameter.

       LDAP_NO_MEMORY
              An memory allocation (e.g., malloc(3) or other dynamic
              memory allocator) call failed in an ldap library routine.

       LDAP_USER_CANCELED
              Indicates the user cancelled the operation.

       LDAP_CONNECT_ERROR

              Indicates the referral limit has been exceeded.
</pre> <h2>
DEPRECATED </h2>
<pre>
       Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the library.  The macro
       LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value (e.g.,
       -DLDAP_DEPRECATED=1) when compiling program designed to use
       deprecated interfaces.  It is recommended that developers writing
       new programs, or updating old programs, avoid use of deprecated
       interfaces.  Over time, it is expected that documentation (and,
       eventually, support) for deprecated interfaces to be eliminated.
