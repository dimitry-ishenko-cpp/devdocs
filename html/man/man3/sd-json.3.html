NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sd-json - APIs for Dealing with JSON Objects
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;systemd/sd-json.h&gt;</b>

       <b>pkg-config --cflags --libs libsystemd</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       sd-json.h is part of <a href="libsystemd.3.html">libsystemd(3)</a> and provides APIs to parse,
       generate, format and otherwise operate with JSON objects.

       The API's central data structure is <b>JsonVariant </b>which
       encapsulates a JSON object, array, string, boolean, number or
       null value. These data structures are mostly considered immutable
       after construction (i.e. their contents won't change, but some
       meta-data might, such as reference counters).

       The APIs broadly fall into five categories:

       •   APIs to directly operate with <b>JsonVariant </b>objects, in the
           <b>sd_json_variant* </b>namespace.

       •   APIs to construct complex JSON objects, in the <b>sd_json_build*</b>
           namespace.

       •   APIs to map <b>JsonVariant </b>objects and their fields to matching
           fields in C structures, in the <b>sd_json_dispatch* </b>namespace.

       •   APIs to convert a string representation of a JSON object into
           a <b>JsonVariant </b>object, in the <b>sd_json_parse* </b>namespace.

       •   APIs to convert an <b>JsonVariant </b>object into its string
           representation, in the <b>sd_json_format* </b>namespace.

       This JSON library will internally encode JSON integer numbers in
       the range <b>INT64_MIN</b>...<b>UINT64_MAX </b>into native 64bit signed or
       unsigned integers, and will reproduce them without loss of
       precision. Non-integer numbers are stored in 64bit IEEE floating
       point numbers.

       If the functions return string arrays, these are generally <b>NULL</b>
       terminated and need to be freed by the caller with the libc
       <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a> call after use, including the strings referenced therein.
       Similarly, individual strings returned need to be freed, as well.

       As a special exception, instead of an empty string array <b>NULL </b>may
       be returned, which should be treated equivalent to an empty
       string array.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
