NAME </h2>

       <b>PCPIntro </b>- introduction to the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
       libraries
</pre> <h2>
INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a toolkit designed for monitoring
       and managing system-level performance.

       The PCP libraries support the APIs required to create new
       performance monitoring tools and new agents (or PMDAs) to export
       performance data.  The <b>libpcp </b>library is used in both cases.  The
       <b>libpcp_pmda </b>library is used only for PMDAs.

       Individual library routines are documented in their own manual
       page entries.

       Most routines return an integer value; greater than equal to zero
       for success and less than zero for an error.  The error codes
       have symbolic names defined in <b>&lt;pcp/pmapi.h&gt;</b>.  Other negative
       values are used to encode errors that can be mapped to the
       traditional <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> values defined in <b>&lt;errno.h&gt;</b>, with the value
       negated.  To translate all PCP error codes into useful messages
       use either <a href="../man1/pmerr.1.html">pmerr(1)</a> or <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>; the latter may also be used
       to decode the <i>-errno</i> cases.
</pre> <h2>
GENERAL ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These common errors may occur in various PCP interactions.

       <b>PM_ERR_TIMEOUT</b>
           <i>Timeout waiting for a response from PMCD</i>
           Many interactions between PCP applications involve
           synchronous message passing, and these are subject to timeout
           constraints.  These errors are most frequently encountered
           when using network connections with slow data rates or long
           latencies.

           For client-<b>pmcd </b>timeouts, refer to <a href="../man1/pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for
           environment variables that may be used to modify the timeout
           thresholds.  For <b>pmcd</b>-PMDA timeouts refer to the <b>-t </b>and <b>-q</b>
           options of <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and the PCP metric <b>pmcd.control.timeout</b>
           that can be dynamically changed with <a href="../man1/pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_APPVERSION</b>
           <i>Metric not supported by this version of monitored application</i>
           Some performance metrics are unavailable from specific
           versions of the associated PMDA, or may be unavailable
           because the underlying instrumentation has changed or is not
           installed or is not enabled.  This error is used in results
           from <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a> to indicate these situations.

       <b>PM_ERR_IPC</b>
           <i>IPC protocol failure</i>
           Generic protocol failure on a pipe or socket connecting two
           PCP applications, e.g. client-<b>pmcd</b>, or client-<b>pmtime</b>, or
           PMDA-<b>pmcd </b>or <b>pmlc</b>-<b>pmlogger</b>.

       <b>PM_ERR_TEXT</b>
           <i>One-line or help text is not available</i>
           Set by a PMDA, and passed back to a PCP client, to indicate
           that the PMDA is unable to supply the requested metric or
           instance domain help text.

       <b>PM_ERR_VALUE</b>
           <i>Missing metric value(s)</i>
           This error is used for a number of conditions in which the
           value of a performance metric is inappropriate for the
           context in which it is being used, e.g.

           (a) Bad value for the metric <b>pmcd.timezone </b>when trying to set
               the timezone via <a href="pmnewcontextzone.3.html">pmNewContextZone(3)</a> for a remote or
               archive context.

           (b) Attempting to interpolate values for a metric with non-
               numeric data type from a set of PCP archives.

           (c) A bad <i>result</i> data structure passed to <a href="pmstore.3.html">pmStore(3)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_NAME</b>
           <i>Unknown metric name</i>
           Just what the message says.

       <b>PM_ERR_PMID</b>
           <i>Unknown or illegal metric identifier</i>
           Just what the message says.

       <b>PM_ERR_INDOM</b>
           <i>Unknown or illegal instance domain identifier</i>
           A request nominates an instance domain that is unknown or
           <b>PM_INDOM_NULL</b>.  May occur as a consequence of the instance
           domain identifier passed by a PCP client to <a href="pmgetindom.3.html">pmGetInDom(3)</a>,
           <a href="pmlookupindom.3.html">pmLookupInDom(3)</a>, <a href="pmnameindom.3.html">pmNameInDom(3)</a>, <a href="pmgetindomarchive.3.html">pmGetInDomArchive(3)</a>,
           <a href="pmlookupindomarchive.3.html">pmLookupInDomArchive(3)</a>, <a href="pmnameindomarchive.3.html">pmNameInDomArchive(3)</a> or a request
           passed from <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to a PMDA.

       <b>PM_ERR_EOF</b>
           <i>IPC channel closed</i>
           End of file on a pipe or socket connecting two PCP
           applications, e.g. client-<b>pmcd</b>, or client-<b>pmtime </b>or
           PMDA-<b>pmcd.</b>

       <b>PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT</b>
           <i>Attempt to use an illegal context</i>
           Typically caused by a PCP client that tries to make calls
           before calling <a href="pmnewcontext.3.html">pmNewContext(3)</a> or after calling
           <a href="pmdestroycontext.3.html">pmDestroyContext(3)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_PERMISSION</b>
           <i>No permission to perform requested operation</i>
           PCP-specific access controls apply to <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and
           <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  Platform-specific permission errors are
           returned as <b>-EPERM</b>.

       <b>PM_ERR_CONV</b>
           <i>Impossible value or scale conversion</i>
           Some value conversion requests are illegal, e.g. bad debug
           flag symbolic name for <b>-D/--debug </b>option, or asking
           <a href="pmextractvalue.3.html">pmExtractValue(3)</a> to translate non-numeric data types to
           numbers and <i>vice versa</i>.

       <b>PM_ERR_TRUNC</b>
           <i>Truncation in value conversion</i>
           Some conversion requests to <a href="pmextractvalue.3.html">pmExtractValue(3)</a> cannot be
           performed based on the metric types and values involved, in
           this case conversion would result in loss of precision.

       <b>PM_ERR_SIGN</b>
           <i>Negative value in conversion to unsigned</i>
           Some conversion requests to <a href="pmextractvalue.3.html">pmExtractValue(3)</a> cannot be
           performed based on the metric types and values involved, in
           this case converting a negative value to an unsigned value.

       <b>PM_ERR_TYPE</b>
           <i>Unknown or illegal metric type</i>
           The metric type is held in the metric descriptor and
           sometimes encoded in the metric values returned from a call
           to <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a>.  Legal values for the metric type are defined
           by the <b>PM_TYPE_* </b>macros in <b>&lt;pcp/pmapi.h&gt;</b>.

       <b>PM_ERR_UNIT</b>
           <i>Illegal pmUnits specification</i>
           Some conversion requests to <a href="pmconvscale.3.html">pmConvScale(3)</a> cannot be
           performed due to illegal or incompatible specifications of
           the source and destination units.

       <b>PM_ERR_PROFILE</b>
           <i>Explicit instance identifier(s) required</i>
           Some PMDAs, especially the <b>proc </b>PMDA, will not return ``all
           instances'' for a <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a> request due to the cost.  The
           client must explicitly built an instance profile using
           <a href="pmaddprofile.3.html">pmAddProfile(3)</a> and/or <a href="pmdelprofile.3.html">pmDelProfile(3)</a> before calling
           <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a>.  See also the <b>-F/--fetchall </b>option to <a href="../man1/pminfo.1.html">pminfo(1)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_INST</b>
           <i>Unknown or illegal instance identifier</i>
           A request to a PMDA nominates an instance that is unknown.
           May occur as a consequence of the profile established prior
           to a <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a> call, or an explicit instance name or
           identifier to <a href="pmlookupindom.3.html">pmLookupInDom(3)</a> or <a href="pmnameindom.3.html">pmNameInDom(3)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_MODE</b>
           <i>Illegal mode specification</i>
           Illegal <i>mode</i> argument to <a href="pmsetmode.3.html">pmSetMode(3)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_PROFILESPEC</b>
           <i>NULL pmInDom with non-NULL instlist</i>
           Bad arguments passed from a PCP client to <a href="pmaddprofile.3.html">pmAddProfile(3)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_TOOSMALL</b>
           <i>Insufficient elements in list</i>
           Parameter passing error by caller specifying a list with less
           than one element to <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a>, <a href="pmlookupname.3.html">pmLookupName(3)</a> or
           <a href="pmstore.3.html">pmStore(3)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_FAULT</b>
           <i>QA fault injected</i>
           For testing, there is a ``fault injection'' version of <b>libpcp</b>
           and this error indicates a misuse of the fault injection
           infrastructure.

       <b>PM_ERR_THREAD</b>
           <i>Operation not supported for multi-threaded applications</i>
           As documented in <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> and elsewhere, some <b>libpcp </b>routines
           are intended solely for use from single-threaded
           applications.

       <b>PM_ERR_NOCONTAINER</b>
           <i>Container not found</i> The user supplied container name does not
           match any known container.

       <b>PM_ERR_BADSTORE</b>
           <i>Bad input to pmstore</i>
           The metric value provided for a <a href="pmstore.3.html">pmStore(3)</a> operation is in
           the wrong format, or of the wrong type or has the wrong
           number of values.

       <b>PM_ERR_TOOBIG</b>
           <i>Result size exceeded</i>
           Indicates a fatal error in the message (or PDU) passing
           protocol between two PCP applications.  This is an internal
           error, and other than an exotic networking failure, should
           not occur.

       <b>PM_ERR_RESET</b>
           <i>PMCD reset or configuration change</i>
           Not used.

           Refer to <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a> for an alternative mechanism that may be
           used to notify a PCP client when <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> has experienced one
           or more configuration changes since the last request from the
           client.  Usually these changes involve a change to the
           namespace exported via <b>pmcd </b>and/or changes to the PMDAs under
           <b>pmcd</b>'s control.

       <b>PM_ERR_FAULT</b>
           <i>QA fault injected</i>
           Used only for PCP Quality Assurance (QA) testing.

       <b>PM_ERR_NYI</b>
           <i>Functionality not yet implemented</i>
           Self explanatory and rarely used.

       <b>PM_ERR_GENERIC</b>
           <i>Generic error, already reported above</i>
           Rarely used, this error may be returned when the error
           condition is a consequent of some earlier returned error and
           a more precise characterization is not possible.

       <b>PM_ERR_BADDERIVE</b>
           <i>Derived metric definition failed</i>
           When registering a derived metric, the metric expression is
           either syntactically or semantically incorrect.

       <b>PM_ERR_NOLABELS</b>
           <i>No support for metric label metadata</i>
           Operation requires metric labels, but none are available.
</pre> <h2>
CLIENT-PMCD ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These errors may occur in the interactions between a PCP client
       and <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> providing real-time performance data.

       <b>PM_ERR_NOAGENT</b>
              <i>No PMCD agent for domain of request</i>
              A request sent to <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> requires information from an
              agent or PMDA that does not exist.  Usually this means the
              namespace being used by the client application contains
              metric names from a previously installed PMDA.

       <b>PM_ERR_CONNLIMIT</b>
              <i>PMCD connection limit for this host exceeded</i>
              The client connection limit for <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> is controlled by
              the optional <b>access </b>controls in <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i>.  By
              default there is no limit imposed by the PCP code, and
              this error would not be seen.

       <b>PM_ERR_AGAIN</b>
              <i>Try again. Information not currently available</i>
              Used to notify a PCP client that the PMDA responsible for
              delivering the information is temporarily unavailable.
              See also <b>PM_ERR_PMDANOTREADY</b>.

       <b>PM_ERR_NOPROFILE</b>
              <i>Missing profile - protocol botch</i>
              Internal error in the communication between a client
              application and <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> - should not occur.

       <b>PM_ERR_NEEDCLIENTCERT</b>
              <i>PMCD requires a client certificate</i> Authentication failure.

       <b>PM_ERR_PMDAFENCED</b>
              <i>PMDA is currently fenced and unable to respond to requests</i>
              A privileged user has decided to isolate a PMDA from
              <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> using a <a href="../man1/pmstore.1.html">pmStore(1)</a> operation on the
              <b>pmcd.agent.fenced </b>metric, which means all fetch-level
              requests to that PMDA are being blocked.
</pre> <h2>
CLIENT-ARCHIVE ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These errors may occur in the interactions between a PCP client
       and the library routines that provide historical performance data
       from PCP archives created by <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_LOGFILE</b>
              <i>Missing archive file</i>
              Each PCP archive consists of multiple physical files as
              described in <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  This error occurs when one of
              the physical files is missing or cannot be opened for
              reading.

       <b>PM_ERR_EOL</b>
              <i>End of PCP archive</i>
              An attempt is made to read past the end file of the last
              volume of a set of PCP archives, or past the end of the
              time window (as specified with a <b>-T/--finish </b>option) for a
              set of PCP archives.

       <b>PM_ERR_NOTHOST</b>
              <i>Operation requires context with host source of metrics</i>
              Calls to <a href="pmstore.3.html">pmStore(3)</a> require a host context and are not
              supported for PCP archives.

              For archives created with versions of PCP prior to 4.0,
              the <a href="pmlookuptext.3.html">pmLookupText(3)</a> and <a href="pmlookupindomtext.3.html">pmLookupInDomText(3)</a> calls will
              return this code for archive PMAPI contexts (help and one-
              line text was not previously recorded in archives).

       <b>PM_ERR_LOGREC</b>
              <i>Corrupted record in a PCP archive</i>
              PCP archives can become corrupted for a variety of
              reasons, but the most common is premature termination of
              <a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> without flushing its output buffers.

       <b>PM_ERR_LABEL</b>
              <i>Illegal label record at start of a PCP archive file</i>
              Each physical file in a PCP archive should begin with a
              common label record.  This is a special case of
              <b>PM_ERR_LOGREC </b>errors.

       <b>PM_ERR_NODATA</b>
              <i>Empty archive file</i>
              An empty physical file can never be part of a valid PCP
              archive (at least the label record should be present).
              This is a special case of <b>PM_ERR_LOGREC </b>errors.

       <b>PM_ERR_NOTARCHIVE</b>
              <i>Operation requires context with archive source of metrics</i>
              A call to one of the archive variant routines, i.e.
              <a href="pmfetcharchive.3.html">pmFetchArchive(3)</a>, <a href="pmgetindomarchive.3.html">pmGetInDomArchive(3)</a>,
              <a href="pmlookupindomarchive.3.html">pmLookupInDomArchive(3)</a> or <a href="pmnameindomarchive.3.html">pmNameInDomArchive(3)</a>, when the
              current context is not associated with a set of PCP
              archives.

       <b>PM_ERR_PMID_LOG</b>
              <i>Metric not defined in the PCP archive</i>
              A PCP client has requested information about a metric, and
              there is no corresponding information in the set of PCP
              archives.  This should not happen for well-behaved PCP
              clients.

       <b>PM_ERR_INDOM_LOG</b>
              <i>Instance domain identifier not defined in the PCP archive</i>
              A PCP client has requested information about an instance
              domain for one or more performance metrics, and there is
              no corresponding information in the set of PCP archives.
              If the client is using metric descriptors from the set of
              archives to identify the instance domain, this is less
              likely to happen.

              Because instance domains may vary over time, clients may
              need to use the variant routines <a href="pmgetindomarchive.3.html">pmGetInDomArchive(3)</a> or
              <a href="pmlookupindomarchive.3.html">pmLookupInDomArchive(3)</a> or <a href="pmnameindomarchive.3.html">pmNameInDomArchive(3)</a> to
              manipulate the union of the instances in an instance
              domain over the life of an archive.

       <b>PM_ERR_INST_LOG</b>
              <i>Instance identifier not defined in the PCP archive</i>
              A PCP client has requested information about a specific
              instance of a performance metric, and there is no
              corresponding information in the set of PCP archives.  If
              the client is using instance names from the instance
              domain in the set of archives (rather than hard-coded
              instance names) and instance identifiers from the results
              returned by <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a> or <a href="pmfetcharchive.3.html">pmFetchArchive(3)</a> this is less
              likely to happen.

              Because instance domains may vary over time, clients may
              need to use the variant routines <a href="pmlookupindomarchive.3.html">pmLookupInDomArchive(3)</a>
              or <a href="pmnameindomarchive.3.html">pmNameInDomArchive(3)</a> to manipulate the union of the
              instances in an instance domain over the life of an
              archive.

       <b>PM_ERR_LOGOVERLAP</b>
              <i>Archives overlap in time</i>
              When using a context associated with a set of archives,
              the archives in the set may not overlap in time.

       <b>PM_ERR_LOGHOST</b>
              <i>Archives differ by host</i>
              When using a context associated with a set of archives,
              the archives in the set must all have been generated on
              the same host.

       <b>PM_ERR_LOGCHANGETYPE</b>
              <i>The type of a metric differs among archives</i>
              When using a context associated with a set of archives,
              the type of each metric must be same in all of the
              archives.

       <b>PM_ERR_LOGCHANGESEM</b>
              <i>The semantics of a metric differs among archives</i>
              When using a context associated with a set of archives,
              the semantics of each metric must be same in all of the
              archives.

       <b>PM_ERR_LOGCHANGEINDOM</b>
              <i>The instance domain of a metric differs among archives</i>
              When using a context associated with a set of archives,
              the instance domain of each metric must be same in all of
              the archives.

       <b>PM_ERR_LOGCHANGEUNITS</b>

TIME CONTROL ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These errors may occur in the interactions between a GUI PCP
       client and the time control services provided by <a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_ISCONN</b>
              <i>Already Connected</i>
              A PCP client application called <a href="pmtimeconnect.3.html">pmTimeConnect(3)</a> when
              already connected to a <a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a> instance.

       <b>PM_ERR_NOTCONN</b>
              <i>Not Connected</i>
              A PCP client application called one of the time control
              routines <b>pmTime*</b>(3) when not currently connected to any
              <a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a> instance.

       <b>PM_ERR_NEEDPORT</b>
              <i>A non-null port name is required</i>
              If a shared <a href="../man1/pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a> instance is being created the <i>port</i>
              argument to <a href="pmtimeconnect.3.html">pmTimeConnect(3)</a> must not be invalid.
</pre> <h2>
NAMESPACE ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These errors may occur in the processing of PCP namespace
       operations.  A PCP namespace, see <a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>, provides the external
       names and the internal identifiers for the available performance
       metrics.

       <b>PM_ERR_NONLEAF</b>
              <i>Metric name is not a leaf in PMNS</i>
              The metric name passed to <a href="pmlookupname.3.html">pmLookupName(3)</a> names a non-
              terminal path in the namespace, i.e. a group of metrics
              rather than a single metric.

       <b>PM_ERR_DUPPMNS</b>
              <i>Attempt to reload the PMNS</i>
              When using an explicit local namespace, it is illegal to
              call either of <a href="pmloadnamespace.3.html">pmLoadNameSpace(3)</a> or
              <a href="pmloadasciinamespace.3.html">pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3)</a> more than once.

       <b>PM_ERR_PMNS</b>
              <i>Problems parsing PMNS definitions</i>
              Only occurs when an ASCII namespace is explicitly loaded.

       <b>PM_ERR_NOPMNS</b>
              <i>PMNS not accessible</i>
              Only occurs when an ASCII namespace is explicitly loaded.
</pre> <h2>
PMCD-PMDA ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These error codes are used in the interactions between <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
       and the PMDAs that provide the performance data.

       <b>PM_ERR_PMDANOTREADY</b>
              <i>PMDA is not yet ready to respond to requests</i>
              Some PMDAs have long initialization or reset times, and
              will respond to <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> with this error if they are busy
              at the moment.  This error translates to <b>PM_ERR_AGAIN </b>for
              the PCP client who made the request to <b>pmcd </b>which caused
              the initial request to the PMDA.  At some later time the
              PMDA will inform <b>pmcd </b>(see <b>PM_ERR_PMDAREADY</b>) that it is
              now ready to process requests, and client requests will
              begin to succeed.

       <b>PM_ERR_PMDAREADY</b>
              <i>PMDA is now responsive to requests</i>
              Used by PMDAs to asynchronously inform <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> that they
              are now willing to resume processing requests.  See also
              <b>PM_ERR_PMDANOTREADY</b>.

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.  Values for these variables may be obtained
       programmatically using the <a href="pmgetconfig.3.html">pmGetConfig(3)</a> function.
