NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_set_tstamp_type - set the time stamp type to be used by a
       capture device
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pcap_set_tstamp_type(pcap_t *p, int tstamp_type);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_set_tstamp_type</b>() sets the type of time stamp desired for
       packets captured on the pcap descriptor to the type specified by
       <i>tstamp_type</i>.  It must be called on a pcap descriptor created by
       <b>pcap_create</b>(3PCAP) that has not yet been activated by
       <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP).  <b>pcap_list_tstamp_types</b>(3PCAP) will give a
       list of the time stamp types supported by a given capture device.
       See <b>pcap-tstamp</b>(7) for a list of all the time stamp types.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_set_tstamp_type</b>() returns <b>0 </b>on success if the specified time
       stamp type is expected to be supported by the capture device,
       <b>PCAP_WARNING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP </b>if the specified time stamp type
       is not supported by the capture device, <b>PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED </b>if
       called on a capture handle that has been activated, and
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_CANTSET_TSTAMP_TYPE </b>if the capture device doesn't
       support setting the time stamp type (only older versions of
       libpcap will return that; newer versions will always allow the
       time stamp type to be set to the default type).
</pre> <h2>
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       This function became available in libpcap release 1.2.1.  In
       previous releases, the time stamp type cannot be set; only the
       default time stamp type offered by a capture source is available.
