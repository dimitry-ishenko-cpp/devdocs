NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmStore</b>, <b>pmStoreHighRes </b>- modify values of performance metrics
</pre> <h2>
C SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcp/pmapi.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pmStore(const pmResult *</b><i>result</i><b>);</b>
       <b>int pmStoreHighRes(const pmHighResResult *</b><i>result</i><b>);</b>

       <b>cc ... -lpcp</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       In some special cases it may be helpful to modify the current
       values of performance metrics, e.g. to reset a counter to zero,
       or to modify a ``metric'' which is a control variable for some
       agent collecting performance metrics.

       The routines <b>pmStore </b>and <b>pmStoreHighRes </b>are lightweight inverses
       of <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a> and <a href="pmfetchhighres.3.html">pmFetchHighRes(3)</a> respectively.

       The caller must build the <i>result</i> data structure (of course, this
       could have been returned from an earlier <a href="pmfetch.3.html">pmFetch(3)</a> or
       <a href="pmfetchhighres.3.html">pmFetchHighRes(3)</a> call).

       It is an error to pass a <i>result</i> to <b>pmStore </b>or <b>pmStoreHighRes </b>in
       which the <i>numval</i> field within any of the <b>pmValueSet </b>structures
       has a value less than one.

       The current Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface
       (PMAPI) context must be one with a host as the source of metrics,
       and the current value of the nominated metrics will be changed,
       i.e.  <b>pmStore </b>and <b>pmStoreHighRes </b>cannot be used to make
       retrospective changes to information in either the archives, or
       in the recent past for real-time sources of metrics.

       The return code from <b>pmStore </b>and <b>pmStoreHighRes </b>is zero for
       success.

DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PM_ERR_GENERIC</b>
              At least one of the modifications was rejected.  No other
              status is available from below the PMAPI (this is the
              lightweight part of the functionality!).  In cases where
              the outcome of storing into individual metrics is
              important, the caller should make one call to either
              <b>pmStore </b>or <b>pmStoreHighRes </b>for each metric.  On the other
              hand, a bulk modification can be performed in a single
              call for situations in which the outcome is not critical.

       <b>PM_ERR_NOTHOST</b>
              The current PMAPI context is an archive rather than a
              host, or it is a host that is not set to the current time,
              i.e. has been ``rewound'' to the recent past using
              <a href="pmsetmode.3.html">pmSetMode(3)</a> or <a href="pmsetmodehighres.3.html">pmSetModeHighRes(3)</a>.

       <b>PM_ERR_TOOSMALL</b>
              The number of metrics specified in <i>result</i> is less than
              one.

       <b>PM_ERR_VALUE</b>
              One or more of the <i>pmValueSet</i>s in <i>result</i> has a <i>numval</i>
              field with a value less than one.
