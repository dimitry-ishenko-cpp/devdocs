NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sd_bus_enqueue_for_read - Re-enqueue a bus message on a bus
       connection, for reading
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;systemd/sd-bus.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int sd_bus_enqueue_for_read(sd_bus *</b><i>bus</i><b>,</b>
                                   <b>sd_bus_message *</b><i>message</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_bus_enqueue_for_read() </b>may be used to re-enqueue an incoming
       bus message on the local read queue, so that it is processed and
       dispatched locally again, similarly to how an incoming message
       from the peer is processed. Takes a bus connection object and the
       message to enqueue. A reference is taken of the message and the
       caller's reference thus remains in possession of the caller. The
       message is enqueued at the end of the queue, thus will be
       dispatched after all other already queued messages are
       dispatched.

       This call is primarily useful for dealing with incoming method
       calls that may be processed only after an additional asynchronous
       operation completes. One example are PolicyKit authorization
       requests that are determined to be necessary to authorize a newly
       incoming method call: when the PolicyKit response is received the
       original method call may be re-enqueued to process it again, this
       time with the authorization result known.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, this function return 0 or a positive integer. On
       failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-ECHILD</b>
           The bus connection has been created in a different process,
           library or module instance.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
