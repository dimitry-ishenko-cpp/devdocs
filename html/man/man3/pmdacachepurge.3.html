DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The  <b>pmdaCache </b>family of routines provide services to support the
       maintenance of complex instance domains for Performance  Co-Pilot
       PMDAs.   There  is  potentially one cache of information for each
       instance domain, and for each instance the cache maintains:
       - external instance name (supplied by the PMDA)
       - internal instance identifier (assigned by <b>pmdaCacheStore </b>or
         calculated from a ``hint'' by <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey</b>)
       - state, where <b>active </b>instances are visible and part of the cur‐
         rent instance domain, and <b>inactive </b>instances are hidden, but
         not forgotten; <b>pmdaCacheStore </b>or <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey </b>may be used
         to change the state of an instance
       - an optional opaque pointer to data that is associated with the
         instance, but maintained by the PMDA
       - an optional opaque key that is used as a ``hint'' to <b>pmdaCache‐</b>
         <b>StoreKey </b>when guessing the initial internal instance identifier
       - the last time the cache was saved and the instance had been
         marked as <b>active </b>at some point since the previous cache load or
         save operation

       The semantics of a PCP instance domain require a number of rules
       to be followed, namely:
       1. Each internal instance identifier must be unique and in the
          range 0 to 2^31 - 1.  This rule is enforced by the <b>pmdaCache</b>
          family of routines.
       2. The external instance name must be unique.  When the instance
          name contains a space, it is further constrained such that the
          name to the left of the first space (the short name) must also
          be unique.  Refer to the INSTANCE NAME MATCHING section below.
          The PMDA must honor this rule, the <b>pmdaCache </b>family of rou‐
          tines will detect attempts to violate this rule.
       3. Where an external instance name corresponds to some object or
          entity, there is an expectation that the association between
          the name and the object is fixed, e.g. ``/dev/hda'' is always
          the name of the same disk on a particular system.  This rule
          is perhaps the responsibility of the PMDA, but is often a
          characteristic of the environment in which the PMDA runs.
       4. It is preferable, although not mandatory, for the association
          between an external instance name and an internal instance
          identifier to be persistent.  This rule is supported by the
          <b>pmdaCache </b>family of routines.
       5. When opaque keys are used, the values of the keys must be
          unique across all instances within an instance domain.  This
          rule is enforced by the <b>pmdaCache </b>family of routines.

       The visible interface to the cache is oriented towards the PMDA
       developer who is most concerned about the names of instances,
       while the details of how the rest of the PCP infrastructure ex‐
       pects the internal instance identifiers to be managed is not rel‐
       evant.

       Instances are updated in the cache for instance domain <i>indom</i> by
       calling <b>pmdaCacheStore </b>or <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey </b>with the external
       name of the instance passed via <i>name.</i>  The opaque pointer <i>private</i>
       may be used to associate additional data with the entry in the
       cache; if no such data is required, <i>private</i> should be NULL.  Any
       manipulation of the additional data (including allocation or
       freeing) is the responsibility of the PMDA caller, as the cache
       simply maintains the pointer to the data (passed via <i>private</i>).

       The upper bound for identifiers allocated for any given <i>indom</i>
       cache can be optionally reduced from the default (2^31 - 1) to
       some lesser <i>maximum</i>, using <b>pmdaCacheResize</b>.  This <i>maximum</i> will
       then be persisted and restored in the usual manner, and can thus
       be associated permanently with a cache once set.  This has appli‐
       cations when using these interfaces as general purpose identifier
       caches, and is less applicable when using them for instance do‐
       main caching.

       For cases where the PMDA developer wishes to influence the allo‐
       cation of internal instance identifiers, e.g. for instance do‐
       mains with more than one natural dimension, or where there is a
       desire to allocate the same instance identifier each time the PM‐
       DA is started, even on different hosts, <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey </b>may be
       used.  In this case, an initial ``hint'' for the instance identi‐
       fier is provided as an opaque key via the first <i>keylen</i> bytes in
       <i>key</i> (which could be any sort of data, including binary values)
       else if <i>keylen</i> is less than 1 or <i>key</i> is <b>NULL </b>then <i>name</i> is used as
       the ``hint''.  The ``hint'' is hashed to produce an initial in‐
       stance identifier in the range 0 to 2^31 - 1 (or lesser <i>maximum</i>,
       if set).  If this instance identifier is already allocated, then
       the value is rehashed.  This procedure is repeated until an unal‐
       located instance identifier is found, or <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey </b>gives
       up and returns <b>PM_ERR_GENERIC</b>.  For each instance domain, the
       ``hint'' must be unique across all instances, else <b>pmdaCache‐</b>
       <b>StoreKey </b>returns <b>PM_ERR_INST</b>.

       The <i>flags</i> argument controls how the instance should be processed
       in the cache as follows:

       PMDA_CACHE_ADD
              Insert the entry into the cache if it is not already there
              and mark it <b>active</b>.  If the entry is already in the cache
              mark it <b>active</b>.

       PMDA_CACHE_HIDE
              Mark the entry in the cache as <b>inactive</b>, but remember the
              details of the association between the external instance
              name and the internal instance identifier.  Entries that
              are <b>inactive </b>will be hidden from cache traversal via PM‐
              DA_CACHE_WALK_NEXT operations, but remain visible to <b>pmda‐</b>
              <b>CacheLookup</b>, <b>pmdaCacheLookupName </b>and <b>pmdaCacheLookupKey</b>
              requests.

       PMDA_CACHE_CULL
              Remove the entry from the cache.

       On success <b>pmdaCacheStore </b>or <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey </b>will return the
       internal instance identifier of the associated cache entry.
       Valid instance identifiers are guaranteed to be unique and non-
       negative.  Failure will be indicated by a negative value (suit‐
       able for decoding with <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>) and most likely PM_ERR_INST
       to indicate the requested instance is not in the cache, or -EIN‐
       VAL to indicate a potential violation of the short name unique‐
       ness property (see the INSTANCE NAME MATCHING section below).

       <b>pmdaCacheLookup </b>is used to search the entries in the cache based
       on the internal instance identifier <i>inst</i>.

       On success the return value will be PMDA_CACHE_ACTIVE or PM‐
       DA_CACHE_INACTIVE (depending on the <b>active </b>or <b>inactive </b>state of
       the cache entry), <i>name</i> (if not NULL) and <i>private</i> (if not NULL)
       will be set to the external instance name and the associate addi‐
       tional data area as provided when the instance was last activated
       via <b>pmdaCacheStore </b>or <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey</b>.

       <b>pmdaCacheLookup </b>failure is indicated by a negative return value
       suitable for decoding with <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>.

       The <b>pmdaCacheLookup </b>interface is required by the PMDA's fetch
       callback that is registered via <a href="pmdasetfetchcallback.3.html">pmdaSetFetchCallBack(3)</a>.  Here
       the internal instance identifier is passed to the fetch callback
       to identifier for which instance a value is required.  Typical
       usage is shown in the code fragment below.

         <b>static int</b>
         <b>foo_callback(pmdaMetric *mdesc, unsigned int inst, pmAtomValue *atom)</b>
         <b>{</b>
             <b>mydata   *mdp;</b>
             <b>char     *name;</b>
             <b>int      sts;</b>

             <b>sts = pmdaCacheLookup(mdesc-&gt;m_desc.indom, inst, &amp;name, (void **)&amp;mdp);</b>
             <b>/*</b>
              <b>* expect sts == PMDA_CACHE_ACTIVE except for cataclysmic events</b>
              <b>* use mdp as required, name may be useful for diagnostics</b>
              <b>*/</b>
             <b>...</b>

       <b>pmdaCacheLookupName </b>is used to search the entries in the cache
       based on the external instance name <i>name</i>.

       On success the return value will be PMDA_CACHE_ACTIVE or PM‐
       DA_CACHE_INACTIVE (depending on the <b>active </b>or <b>inactive </b>state of
       the cache entry), <i>inst</i> (if not NULL) and <i>private</i> (if not NULL)
       will be set to the internal instance identifier and the associate
       additional data area as provided when the instance was last acti‐
       vated via <b>pmdaCacheStore </b>or <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey</b>.

       <b>pmdaCacheLookupName </b>failure is indicated by a negative return
       value suitable for decoding with <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>.

       The <b>pmdaCacheLookupName </b>interface is useful for PMDAs wishing to
       update an instance domain based on the external instance names.

       <b>pmdaCacheLookupKey </b>is used to search the entries in the cache
       based on an opaque key (or ``hint'') previously used in a call to
       <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey</b>.  The ``hint'' is provided via the first <i>keylen</i>
       bytes in <i>key</i>.  For symmetry with <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey</b>, if <i>keylen</i> is
       less than 1 or <i>key</i> is <b>NULL </b>then <i>name</i> is used as the ``hint'' (al‐
       though the results will be the same as calling <b>pmdaCacheLookup‐</b>
       <b>Name </b>in this case).

       On success the return value will be PMDA_CACHE_ACTIVE or PM‐
       DA_CACHE_INACTIVE (depending on the <b>active </b>or <b>inactive </b>state of
       the cache entry), <i>oname</i> (if not NULL), <i>inst</i> (if not NULL) and
       <i>private</i> (if not NULL) will be set to the external instance name,
       the internal instance identifier and the associate additional da‐
       ta area as provided when the instance was last activated via <b>pm‐</b>
       <b>daCacheStore </b>or <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey</b>.

       <b>pmdaCacheLookupKey </b>failure is indicated by a negative return val‐
       ue suitable for decoding with <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>.

       To avoid a persistent cache growing without bound, <b>pmdaCachePurge</b>
       can be used to cull all entries that have <i>not</i> been <b>active </b>in the
       last <i>recent</i> seconds.  For performance reasons, the time account‐
       ing is imprecise and the entries are timestamped at the time of
       the next cache save operation <i>after</i> the entry has been added or
       marked <b>active </b>(refer to PMDA_CACHE_SAVE, PMDA_CACHE_WRITE and PM‐
       DA_CACHE_SYNC below).  On success <b>pmdaCachePurge </b>returns the num‐
       ber of culled entries, else in the case of an error the return
       value is negative (and suitable for decoding with <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>).

       The <b>pmdaCachePurgeCallback </b>function is similar to <b>pmdaCachePurge</b>
       except that a <i>callback</i> function will also be called with the <i>pri‐</i>
       <i>vate</i> data pointer associated with the cache entry to be culled.
       The callback is not made if <i>private is</i> <b>NULL</b>.  This would typical‐
       ly be used to free the private data when the associated entry is
       purged in PMDAs that do not separately maintain any references to
       the private data.

       <b>pmdaCacheOp </b>may be used to perform additional operations on the
       cache as follows:

       PMDA_CACHE_LOAD
              The cache can optionally be maintained as a persistent ex‐
              ternal file, so that the mapping of instance names to in‐
              stance identifiers is persistent across executions of a
              PMDA.  This operation loads the cache from the external
              file, and then all new cache entries are marked <b>inactive</b>,
              and the additional data pointer is set to NULL.  Entries
              loaded from the external file are checked against the cur‐
              rent cache contents and if the instance name and instance
              identifiers match then the state in the cache (<b>active </b>or
              <b>inactive</b>) is not changed. Should a mismatch be found (same
              instance name and different instance identifier, or same
              instance identifier and different instance name, or some
              but not all of the instance identifier, the instance name
              and the ``hint'' match) then the entry from the external
              file is ignored and a warning is issued on <i>stderr</i>.  Typi‐
              cally a PMDA would only perform this operation once per
              execution.

       PMDA_CACHE_SAVE
              If any instance has been added to, or deleted from, the
              instance domain since the last PMDA_CACHE_LOAD, PM‐
              DA_CACHE_SAVE, PMDA_CACHE_WRITE or PMDA_CACHE_SYNC opera‐
              tion, the <i>entire</i> cache is written to the external file as
              a bulk operation.  This operation is provided for PMDAs
              that are <i>not</i> interested in using <b>pmdaCachePurge </b>and simply
              want the external file to reflect the set of known in‐
              stances without accurate details of when they were last
              marked <b>active</b>.

              Returns the number of instances saved to the external
              file, else 0 if the external file was already up to date.

       PMDA_CACHE_WRITE
              A variant of PMDA_CACHE_SAVE where the <i>entire</i> cache is un‐
              conditionally written to the external file as a bulk oper‐
              ation, independent of any previous cache operations or the
              state of the cache.

       PMDA_CACHE_STRINGS
              Annotates this cache as being a special-purpose cache used
              for string de-duplication in PMDAs exporting large numbers
              of string valued metrics.  This can be used to reduce the
              memory footprint of the PMDA (duplicate strings hash to
              the same bucket, and are stored in memory once only).  Key
              comparisons are not terminated at the first space but
              rather the entire string is used for matching.  These are
              specialised caches not useful for general purpose instance
              domain handling.

       PMDA_CACHE_SYNC
              Within an instance domain, if any instance has been added
              to, or deleted from, or marked <b>active </b>since the last PM‐
              DA_CACHE_LOAD, PMDA_CACHE_SAVE, PMDA_CACHE_WRITE or PM‐
              DA_CACHE_SYNC operation, the <i>entire</i> cache is written to
              the external file as a bulk operation.  This operation is
              similar to PMDA_CACHE_SAVE, but will save the instance do‐
              main more frequently so the timestamps more accurately
              match the semantics expected by <b>pmdaCachePurge</b>.

              Returns the number of instances saved to the external
              file, else 0 if the external file was already synchro‐
              nized.

       PMDA_CACHE_CHECK
              Returns 1 if a cache exists for the specified instance do‐
              main, else 0.

       PMDA_CACHE_REUSE
              When a new instance is added to the cache, the default
              strategy is to assign instance identifiers in a monotonic
              increasing manner.  Once the maximum possible instance
              identifier value has been assigned, the strategy changes
              to one where starting from 0, the next available unused
              instance identifier will be used.  Calling <b>pmdaCacheOp</b>
              with PMDA_CACHE_REUSE forces an irreversible change to a
              second (reuse) strategy where the next unallocated in‐
              stance identifier will be used.  This may be useful in
              cases where there is a desire to restrict the allocated
              instance identifiers to smaller values.  The prevailing
              strategy will be saved and restored across PMDA_CACHE_SAVE
              and PMDA_CACHE_LOAD operations.  If <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey </b>is
              ever used, the associated instance domain will be changed
              to PMDA_CACHE_REUSE mode.

       PMDA_CACHE_REORG
              Reorganize the cache to allow faster retrieval of <b>active</b>
              entries, at the cost of slower retrieval for <b>inactive </b>en‐
              tries, and reclaim any culled entries.  The cache may be
              internally re-organized as entries are added, so this op‐
              eration is not required for most PMDAs.

       PMDA_CACHE_WALK_REWIND
              Prepares for a traversal of the cache in ascending in‐
              stance identifier sequence.

       PMDA_CACHE_WALK_NEXT
              Fetch the next <b>active </b>instance identifier from the cache.
              Requires a prior call using PMDA_CACHE_WALK_REWIND and
              will return -1 when all instances have been processed.

              Only one cache walk can be active at any given time, nest‐
              ing calls to PMDA_CACHE_WALK_NEXT and PM‐
              DA_CACHE_WALK_REWIND will interfere with each other.

       PMDA_CACHE_ACTIVE
              Changes <b>every inactive </b>entry in the cache to be marked <b>ac‐</b>
              <b>tive</b>.

       PMDA_CACHE_INACTIVE
              Changes <b>every active </b>entry in the cache to be marked <b>inac‐</b>
              <b>tive</b>.

       PMDA_CACHE_CULL
              Remove <b>every </b>entry from the cache.

       PMDA_CACHE_SIZE
              Return the number of entries in the cache (includes <b>ac‐</b>
              <b>tive</b>, <b>inactive </b>and any culled entries that have not yet
              been reclaimed).

       PMDA_CACHE_SIZE_ACTIVE
              Return the number of <b>active </b>entries in the cache.

       PMDA_CACHE_SIZE_INACTIVE
              Return the number of <b>inactive </b>entries in the cache.

       PMDA_CACHE_DUMP
              Dump the current state of the cache on <i>stderr</i>.

       PMDA_CACHE_DUMP_ALL
              Like PMDA_CACHE_DUMP, but also dump the internal hashing
              structures used to support lookup by instance name, lookup
              by instance identifier and the collision statistics for
              ``hint'' hashing from <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey</b>.

       <b>pmdaCacheOp </b>returns a non-negative value on success, and failure
       is indicated by a negative return value (suitable for decoding
       with <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>).
</pre> <h2>
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       When the <b>pmdaCache </b>routines are used for particular instance do‐
       main, <a href="pmdainstance.3.html">pmdaInstance(3)</a> and the instance domain enumeration behind
       <a href="pmdafetch.3.html">pmdaFetch(3)</a> will attempt to extract instance domain information
       from the cache, thereby avoiding reference to the <b>pmdaIndom </b>data
       structures that have historically been used to define instance
       domains and service instance requests.  A PMDA can adopt a hybrid
       approach and choose to implement some instance domains via the
       traditional <b>pmdaIndom </b>method, and others via the <b>pmdaCache </b>ap‐
       proach, however attempts to manage the <i>same</i> instance domain by
       both methods will result in the <b>pmdaCache </b>method silently pre‐
       vailing.

       If <b>all </b>instances in a PMDA are to be serviced from a <b>pmdaCache</b>
       then a <b>pmdaIndom </b>is not required, and the <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a> call be‐
       comes

             <b>pmdaInit(dp, NULL, 0, metrictab, nmetrics);</b>

       However, the PMDA will need to explicitly initialize the <b>indom</b>
       field of the <b>pmDesc </b>in the <i>metrictab</i> entries, as this cannot be
       done by <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a> if <i>indomtab</i> is missing entries for the in‐
       stance domains maintained in the cache.

       Independent of how the instance domain is being maintained, to
       refresh an instance domain prior to a fetch or an instance domain
       operation, the standard methods of a ``wrapper'' to the
       <a href="pmdainstance.3.html">pmdaInstance(3)</a> and <a href="pmdafetch.3.html">pmdaFetch(3)</a> methods should be used.

       Refer to the <b>simple </b>PMDA source code for an example use of the
       <b>pmdaCache </b>routines.

       When using <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey</b>, if there is a desire to ensure the
       given ``hint'' generates the same initial instance identifier
       across all platforms, then the caller should ensure the endian
       and word-size issues are considered, e.g. if the natural data
       structure used for the <i>key</i> is an array of 32-bit integers, then
       <a href="htonl.3.html">htonl(3)</a> should be used on each element of the array before call‐
       ing <b>pmdaCacheStoreKey </b>or <b>pmdaCacheLookupKey</b>.

       The following table summarizes the ``short name'' matching seman‐
       tics for an instance domain (caches other than PMDA_CACHE_STRINGS
       style).
