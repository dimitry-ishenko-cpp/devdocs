PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_spin_unlock — unlock a spin lock object
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_spin_unlock(pthread_spinlock_t *<i>lock</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_spin_unlock</i>() function shall release the spin lock
       referenced by <i>lock</i> which was locked via the <i>pthread_spin_lock</i>()
       or <i>pthread_spin_trylock</i>() functions.

       The results are undefined if the lock is not held by the calling
       thread.

       If there are threads spinning on the lock when
       <i>pthread_spin_unlock</i>() is called, the lock becomes available and
       an unspecified spinning thread shall acquire the lock.

       The results are undefined if this function is called with an
       uninitialized thread spin lock.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>pthread_spin_unlock</i>() function
       shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned
       to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       This function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>lock</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_spin_unlock</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized spin lock object, it is recommended that the function
       should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>lock</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_spin_unlock</i>() refers to a spin lock object
       for which the current thread does not hold the lock, it is
       recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EPERM]</b>
       error.
</pre> <h2>
