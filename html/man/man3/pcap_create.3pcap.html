NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_create - create a live capture handle
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];</b>

       <b>pcap_t *pcap_create(const char *source, char *errbuf);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_create</b>() is used to create a packet capture handle to look
       at packets on the network.  <i>source</i> is a string that specifies the
       network device to open; on Linux systems with 2.2 or later
       kernels, a <i>source</i> argument of "any" or <b>NULL </b>can be used to
       capture packets from all interfaces.  <i>errbuf</i> is a buffer large
       enough to hold at least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE </b>chars.

       The returned handle must be activated with <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP)
       before packets can be captured with it; options for the capture,
       such as promiscuous mode, can be set on the handle before
       activating it.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_create</b>() returns a <b>pcap_t * </b>on success and <b>NULL </b>on failure.
       If <b>NULL </b>is returned, <i>errbuf</i> is filled in with an appropriate
       error message.
