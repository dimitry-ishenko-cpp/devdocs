NAME </h2>
<pre>
       unlink, unlinkat — remove a directory entry
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int unlink(const char *<i>path</i>);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int unlinkat(int <i>fd</i>, const char *<i>path</i>, int <i>flag</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>unlink</i>() function shall remove a link to a file. If <i>path</i>
       names a symbolic link, <i>unlink</i>() shall remove the symbolic link
       named by <i>path</i> and shall not affect any file or directory named by
       the contents of the symbolic link. Otherwise, <i>unlink</i>() shall
       remove the link named by the pathname pointed to by <i>path</i> and
       shall decrement the link count of the file referenced by the
       link.

       When the file's link count becomes 0 and no process has the file
       open, the space occupied by the file shall be freed and the file
       shall no longer be accessible. If one or more processes have the
       file open when the last link is removed, the link shall be
       removed before <i>unlink</i>() returns, but the removal of the file
       contents shall be postponed until all references to the file are
       closed.

       The <i>path</i> argument shall not name a directory unless the process
       has appropriate privileges and the implementation supports using
       <i>unlink</i>() on directories.

       Upon successful completion, <i>unlink</i>() shall mark for update the
       last data modification and last file status change timestamps of
       the parent directory. Also, if the file's link count is not 0,
       the last file status change timestamp of the file shall be marked
       for update.

       The <i>unlinkat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>unlink</i>() or
       <i>rmdir</i>() function except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a
       relative path. In this case the directory entry to be removed is
       determined relative to the directory associated with the file
       descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the current working directory. If the
       access mode of the open file description associated with the file
       descriptor is not O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether
       directory searches are permitted using the current permissions of
       the directory underlying the file descriptor. If the access mode
       is O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.

       Values for <i>flag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of
       flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>:

       AT_REMOVEDIR
             Remove the directory entry specified by <i>fd</i> and <i>path</i> as a
             directory, not a normal file.

       If <i>unlinkat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to <i>unlink</i>() or <i>rmdir</i>()
       respectively, depending on whether or not the AT_REMOVEDIR bit is
       set in <i>flag</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
       Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error. If -1 is returned, the named file shall not
       be changed.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail and shall not unlink the file if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied for a component of the path
              prefix, or write permission is denied on the directory
              containing the directory entry to be removed.

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The file named by the <i>path</i> argument cannot be unlinked
              because it is being used by the system or another process
              and the implementation considers this an error.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The file named by <i>path</i> is a directory, and either the
              calling process does not have appropriate privileges, or
              the implementation prohibits using <i>unlink</i>() on
              directories.

       <b>EPERM </b>or <b>EACCES</b>
              The S_ISVTX flag is set on the directory containing the
              file referred to by the <i>path</i> argument and the process does
              not satisfy the criteria specified in the Base Definitions
              volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 4.3</i>, <i>Directory Protection</i>.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The directory entry to be unlinked is part of a read-only
              file system.

       The <i>unlinkat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd</i> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path</i> argument does not specify an absolute path and
              the <i>fd</i> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
              descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument is not an absolute path and <i>fd</i> is a file
              descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       <b>EEXIST </b>or <b>ENOTEMPTY</b>
              The <i>flag</i> parameter has the AT_REMOVEDIR bit set and the
              <i>path</i> argument names a directory that is not an empty
              directory, or there are hard links to the directory other
              than dot or a single entry in dot-dot.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>flag</i> parameter has the AT_REMOVEDIR bit set and <i>path</i>
              does not name a directory.

       These functions may fail and not unlink the file if:

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The file named by <i>path</i> is a named STREAM.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ETXTBSY</b>
              The entry to be unlinked is the last directory entry to a
              pure procedure (shared text) file that is being executed.

       The <i>unlinkat</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>flag</i> argument is not valid.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Removing a Link to a File</b>
       The following example shows how to remove a link to a file named
       <b>/home/cnd/mod1 </b>by removing the entry named <b>/modules/pass1</b>.

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

           char *path = "/modules/pass1";
           int   status;
           ...
           status = unlink(path);

   <b>Checking for an Error</b>
       The following example fragment creates a temporary password lock
       file named <b>LOCKFILE</b>, which is defined as <b>/etc/ptmp</b>, and gets a
       file descriptor for it. If the file cannot be opened for writing,
       <i>unlink</i>() is used to remove the link between the file descriptor
       and <b>LOCKFILE</b>.

           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
           #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

           #define LOCKFILE "/etc/ptmp"

           int pfd;  /* Integer for file descriptor returned by open call. */
           FILE *fpfd;  /* File pointer for use in putpwent(). */
           ...
           /* Open password Lock file. If it exists, this is an error. */
           if ((pfd = open(LOCKFILE, O_WRONLY| O_CREAT | O_EXCL, S_IRUSR
               | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH)) == -1)  {
               fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open /etc/ptmp. Try again later.\n");
               exit(1);
           }

           /* Lock file created; proceed with fdopen of lock file so that
              putpwent() can be used.
            */
           if ((fpfd = fdopen(pfd, "w")) == NULL) {
               close(pfd);
               unlink(LOCKFILE);
               exit(1);
           }

   <b>Replacing Files</b>
       The following example fragment uses <i>unlink</i>() to discard links to
       files, so that they can be replaced with new versions of the
       files. The first call removes the link to <b>LOCKFILE </b>if an error
       occurs. Successive calls remove the links to <b>SAVEFILE </b>and
       <b>PASSWDFILE </b>so that new links can be created, then removes the
       link to <b>LOCKFILE </b>when it is no longer needed.

           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
           #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

           #define LOCKFILE "/etc/ptmp"
           #define PASSWDFILE "/etc/passwd"
           #define SAVEFILE "/etc/opasswd"
           ...
           /* If no change was made, assume error and leave passwd unchanged. */
           if (!valid_change) {
               fprintf(stderr, "Could not change password for user %s\n", user);
               unlink(LOCKFILE);
               exit(1);
           }

           /* Change permissions on new password file. */
           chmod(LOCKFILE, S_IRUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH);

           /* Remove saved password file. */
           unlink(SAVEFILE);

           /* Save current password file. */
           link(PASSWDFILE, SAVEFILE);

           /* Remove current password file. */
           unlink(PASSWDFILE);

           /* Save new password file as current password file. */
           link(LOCKFILE,PASSWDFILE);

           /* Remove lock file. */
           unlink(LOCKFILE);

           exit(0);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications should use <i>rmdir</i>() to remove a directory.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Unlinking a directory is restricted to the superuser in many
       historical implementations for reasons given in <i>link</i>() (see also
       <i>rename</i>()).

       The meaning of <b>[EBUSY] </b>in historical implementations is ``mount
       point busy''. Since this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not cover
       the system administration concepts of mounting and unmounting,
       the description of the error was changed to ``resource busy''.
       (This meaning is used by some device drivers when a second
       process tries to open an exclusive use device.) The wording is
       also intended to allow implementations to refuse to remove a
       directory if it is the root or current working directory of any
       process.

       The standard developers reviewed TR 24715‐2006 and noted that
       LSB-conforming implementations may return <b>[EISDIR] </b>instead of
       <b>[EPERM] </b>when unlinking a directory. A change to permit this
       behavior by changing the requirement for <b>[EPERM] </b>to <b>[EPERM] </b>or
       <b>[EISDIR] </b>was considered, but decided against since it would break
       existing strictly conforming and conforming applications.
       Applications written for portability to both POSIX.1‐2008 and the
       LSB should be prepared to handle either error code.

       The purpose of the <i>unlinkat</i>() function is to remove directory
       entries in directories other than the current working directory
       without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a
       file could be changed in parallel to a call to <i>unlink</i>(),
       resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor
       for the target directory and using the <i>unlinkat</i>() function it can
       be guaranteed that the removed directory entry is located
       relative to the desired directory.
