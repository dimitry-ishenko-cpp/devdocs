PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       wcstok — split a wide-character string into tokens
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wchar_t *wcstok(wchar_t *restrict <i>ws1</i>, const wchar_t *restrict <i>ws2</i>,
           wchar_t **restrict <i>ptr</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       A sequence of calls to <i>wcstok</i>() shall break the wide-character
       string pointed to by <i>ws1</i> into a sequence of tokens, each of which
       shall be delimited by a wide-character code from the wide-
       character string pointed to by <i>ws2</i>.  The <i>ptr</i> argument points to a
       caller-provided <b>wchar_t </b>pointer into which the <i>wcstok</i>() function
       shall store information necessary for it to continue scanning the
       same wide-character string.

       The first call in the sequence has <i>ws1</i> as its first argument, and
       is followed by calls with a null pointer as their first argument.
       The separator string pointed to by <i>ws2</i> may be different from call
       to call.

       The first call in the sequence shall search the wide-character
       string pointed to by <i>ws1</i> for the first wide-character code that
       is <i>not</i> contained in the current separator string pointed to by
       <i>ws2</i>.  If no such wide-character code is found, then there are no
       tokens in the wide-character string pointed to by <i>ws1</i> and
       <i>wcstok</i>() shall return a null pointer. If such a wide-character
       code is found, it shall be the start of the first token.

       The <i>wcstok</i>() function shall then search from there for a wide-
       character code that <i>is</i> contained in the current separator string.
       If no such wide-character code is found, the current token
       extends to the end of the wide-character string pointed to by
       <i>ws1</i>, and subsequent searches for a token shall return a null
       pointer. If such a wide-character code is found, it shall be
       overwritten by a null wide character, which terminates the
       current token. The <i>wcstok</i>() function shall save a pointer to the
       following wide-character code, from which the next search for a
       token shall start.

       Each subsequent call, with a null pointer as the value of the
       first argument, shall start searching from the saved pointer and
       behave as described above.

       The implementation shall behave as if no function calls <i>wcstok</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>wcstok</i>() function shall return a
       pointer to the first wide-character code of a token. Otherwise,
       if there is no token, <i>wcstok</i>() shall return a null pointer.
