NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mkdtemp, mkstemp — create a unique directory or file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       char *mkdtemp(char *<i>template</i>);
       int mkstemp(char *<i>template</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mkdtemp</i>() function shall create a directory with a unique
       name derived from <i>template</i>.  The application shall ensure that
       the string provided in <i>template</i> is a pathname ending with at
       least six trailing <b>'X' </b>characters. The <i>mkdtemp</i>() function shall
       modify the contents of <i>template</i> by replacing six or more <b>'X'</b>
       characters at the end of the pathname with the same number of
       characters from the portable filename character set. The
       characters shall be chosen such that the resulting pathname does
       not duplicate the name of an existing file at the time of the
       call to <i>mkdtemp</i>().  The <i>mkdtemp</i>() function shall use the
       resulting pathname to create the new directory as if by a call
       to:

           mkdir(pathname, S_IRWXU)

       The <i>mkstemp</i>() function shall create a regular file with a unique
       name derived from <i>template</i> and return a file descriptor for the
       file open for reading and writing. The application shall ensure
       that the string provided in <i>template</i> is a pathname ending with at
       least six trailing <b>'X' </b>characters. The <i>mkstemp</i>() function shall
       modify the contents of <i>template</i> by replacing six or more <b>'X'</b>
       characters at the end of the pathname with the same number of
       characters from the portable filename character set. The
       characters shall be chosen such that the resulting pathname does
       not duplicate the name of an existing file at the time of the
       call to <i>mkstemp</i>().  The <i>mkstemp</i>() function shall use the
       resulting pathname to create the file, and obtain a file
       descriptor for it, as if by a call to:

           open(pathname, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR)

       By behaving as if the O_EXCL flag for <i>open</i>() is set, the function
       prevents any possible race condition between testing whether the
       file exists and opening it for use.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>mkdtemp</i>() function shall return
       the value of <i>template</i>.  Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer
       and shall set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>mkstemp</i>() function shall return
       an open file descriptor. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and shall
       set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mkdtemp</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix, or write permission is denied on the parent
              directory of the directory to be created.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The string pointed to by <i>template</i> does not end in
              <b>"XXXXXX"</b>.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the path of the directory to be created.

       <b>EMLINK </b>The link count of the parent directory would exceed
              {LINK_MAX}.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of the path prefix specified by the <i>template</i>
              argument does not name an existing directory.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The file system does not contain enough space to hold the
              contents of the new directory or to extend the parent
              directory of the new directory.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The parent directory resides on a read-only file system.

       The <i>mkdtemp</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the path of the directory to be
              created.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The error conditions for the <i>mkstemp</i>() function are defined in
       <a href="open.3p.html">open(3p)</a>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Generating a Pathname</b>
       The following example creates a file with a 10-character name
       beginning with the characters <b>"file" </b>and opens the file for
       reading and writing. The value returned as the value of <i>fd</i> is a
       file descriptor that identifies the file.

           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           ...
           char template[] = "/tmp/fileXXXXXX";
           int fd;

           fd = mkstemp(template);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       It is possible to run out of letters.

       Portable applications should pass exactly six trailing <b>'X'</b>s in
       the template and no more; implementations may treat any
       additional trailing <b>'X'</b>s as either a fixed or replaceable part of
       the template. To be sure of only passing six, a fixed string of
       at least one non-<b>'X' </b>character should precede the six <b>'X'</b>s.

       Since <b>'X' </b>is in the portable filename character set, some of the
       replacement characters can be <b>'X'</b>s, leaving part (or even all) of
       the template effectively unchanged.
