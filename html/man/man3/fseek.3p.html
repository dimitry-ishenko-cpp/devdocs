       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fseek, fseeko — reposition a file-position indicator in a stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int fseek(FILE *<i>stream</i>, long <i>offset</i>, int <i>whence</i>);
       int fseeko(FILE *<i>stream</i>, off_t <i>offset</i>, int <i>whence</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fseek</i>() function shall set the file-position indicator for
       the stream pointed to by <i>stream</i>.  If a read or write error
       occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set and
       <i>fseek</i>() fails.

       The new position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the
       file, shall be obtained by adding <i>offset</i> to the position
       specified by <i>whence</i>.  The specified point is the beginning of the
       file for SEEK_SET, the current value of the file-position
       indicator for SEEK_CUR, or end-of-file for SEEK_END.

       If the stream is to be used with wide-character input/output
       functions, the application shall ensure that <i>offset</i> is either 0
       or a value returned by an earlier call to <i>ftell</i>() on the same
       stream and <i>whence</i> is SEEK_SET.

       A successful call to <i>fseek</i>() shall clear the end-of-file
       indicator for the stream and undo any effects of <i>ungetc</i>() and
       <i>ungetwc</i>() on the same stream. After an <i>fseek</i>() call, the next
       operation on an update stream may be either input or output.

       If the most recent operation, other than <i>ftell</i>(), on a given
       stream is <i>fflush</i>(), the file offset in the underlying open file
       description shall be adjusted to reflect the location specified
       by <i>fseek</i>().

       The <i>fseek</i>() function shall allow the file-position indicator to
       be set beyond the end of existing data in the file. If data is
       later written at this point, subsequent reads of data in the gap
       shall return bytes with the value 0 until data is actually
       written into the gap.

       The behavior of <i>fseek</i>() on devices which are incapable of seeking
       is implementation-defined.  The value of the file offset
       associated with such a device is undefined.

       If the stream is writable and buffered data had not been written
       to the underlying file, <i>fseek</i>() shall cause the unwritten data to
       be written to the file and shall mark the last data modification
       and last file status change timestamps of the file for update.

       In a locale with state-dependent encoding, whether <i>fseek</i>()
       restores the stream's shift state is implementation-defined.

       The <i>fseeko</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>fseek</i>() function
       except that the <i>offset</i> argument is of type <b>off_t</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fseek</i>() and <i>fseeko</i>() functions shall return 0 if they
       succeed.

       Otherwise, they shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fseek</i>() and <i>fseeko</i>() functions shall fail if, either the
       <i>stream</i> is unbuffered or the <i>stream</i>'s buffer needed to be flushed,
       and the call to <i>fseek</i>() or <i>fseeko</i>() causes an underlying <i>lseek</i>()
       or <i>write</i>() to be invoked, and:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor and the
              thread would be delayed in the write operation.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The file descriptor underlying the stream file is not open
              for writing or the stream's buffer needed to be flushed
              and the file is not open.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the
              maximum file size.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the file
              size limit of the process.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to
              write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
              corresponding stream.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a
              signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>whence</i> argument is invalid. The resulting file-
              position indicator would be set to a negative value.

       <b>EIO    </b>A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is a
              member of a background process group attempting to perform
              a <i>write</i>() to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the
              calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, the process is not
              ignoring SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is
              orphaned.  This error may also be returned under
              implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>There was no free space remaining on the device containing
              the file.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              For <i>fseek</i>(), the resulting file offset would be a value
              which cannot be represented correctly in an object of type
              <b>long</b>.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              For <i>fseeko</i>(), the resulting file offset would be a value
              which cannot be represented correctly in an object of type
              <b>off_t</b>.

       <b>EPIPE  </b>An attempt was made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not
              open for reading by any process; a SIGPIPE signal shall
              also be sent to the thread.

       <b>ESPIPE </b>The file descriptor underlying <i>stream</i> is associated with a
              pipe, FIFO, or socket.

       The <i>fseek</i>() and <i>fseeko</i>() functions may fail if:

       <b>ENXIO  </b>A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request
              was outside the capabilities of the device.
