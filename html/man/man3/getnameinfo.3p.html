SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
       #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

       int getnameinfo(const struct sockaddr *restrict <i>sa</i>, socklen_t <i>salen</i>,
           char *restrict <i>node</i>, socklen_t <i>nodelen</i>, char *restrict <i>service</i>,
           socklen_t <i>servicelen</i>, int <i>flags</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getnameinfo</i>() function shall translate a socket address to a
       node name and service location, all of which are defined as in
       <a href="freeaddrinfo.3p.html">freeaddrinfo(3p)</a>.

       The <i>sa</i> argument points to a socket address structure to be
       translated. The <i>salen</i> argument contains the length of the address
       pointed to by <i>sa</i>.

       If the socket address structure contains an IPv4-mapped IPv6
       address or an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address, the implementation
       shall extract the embedded IPv4 address and lookup the node name
       for that IPv4 address.

       If the address is the IPv6 unspecified address (<b>"::"</b>), a lookup
       shall not be performed and the behavior shall be the same as when
       the node's name cannot be located.

       If the <i>node</i> argument is non-NULL and the <i>nodelen</i> argument is non-
       zero, then the <i>node</i> argument points to a buffer able to contain
       up to <i>nodelen</i> bytes that receives the node name as a null-
       terminated string. If the <i>node</i> argument is NULL or the <i>nodelen</i>
       argument is zero, the node name shall not be returned. If the
       node's name cannot be located, the numeric form of the address
       contained in the socket address structure pointed to by the <i>sa</i>
       argument is returned instead of its name.

       If the <i>service</i> argument is non-NULL and the <i>servicelen</i> argument
       is non-zero, then the <i>service</i> argument points to a buffer able to
       contain up to <i>servicelen</i> bytes that receives the service name as
       a null-terminated string.  If the <i>service</i> argument is NULL or the
       <i>servicelen</i> argument is zero, the service name shall not be
       returned. If the service's name cannot be located, the numeric
       form of the service address (for example, its port number) shall
       be returned instead of its name.

       The <i>flags</i> argument is a flag that changes the default actions of
       the function. By default the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)
       for the host shall be returned, but:

        *  If the flag bit NI_NOFQDN is set, only the node name portion
           of the FQDN shall be returned for local hosts.

        *  If the flag bit NI_NUMERICHOST is set, the numeric form of
           the address contained in the socket address structure pointed
           to by the <i>sa</i> argument shall be returned instead of its name.

        *  If the flag bit NI_NAMEREQD is set, an error shall be
           returned if the host's name cannot be located.

        *  If the flag bit NI_NUMERICSERV is set, the numeric form of
           the service address shall be returned (for example, its port
           number) instead of its name.

        *  If the flag bit NI_NUMERICSCOPE is set, the numeric form of
           the scope identifier shall be returned (for example,
           interface index) instead of its name. This flag shall be
           ignored if the <i>sa</i> argument is not an IPv6 address.

        *  If the flag bit NI_DGRAM is set, this indicates that the
           service is a datagram service (SOCK_DGRAM). The default
           behavior shall assume that the service is a stream service
           (SOCK_STREAM).

       <b>Notes:</b>

                  1. The two NI_NUMERICxxx flags are required to support
                     the <b>-n </b>flag that many commands provide.

                  2. The NI_DGRAM flag is required for the few AF_INET
                     and AF_INET6 port numbers (for example, [512,514])
                     that represent different services for UDP and TCP.

       The <i>getnameinfo</i>() function shall be thread-safe.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       A zero return value for <i>getnameinfo</i>() indicates successful
       completion; a non-zero return value indicates failure. The
       possible values for the failures are listed in the ERRORS
       section.

       Upon successful completion, <i>getnameinfo</i>() shall return the <i>node</i>
       and <i>service</i> names, if requested, in the buffers provided. The
       returned names are always null-terminated strings.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getnameinfo</i>() function shall fail and return the
       corresponding value if:

       [EAI_AGAIN] The name could not be resolved at this time. Future
                   attempts may succeed.

       [EAI_BADFLAGS]
                   The <i>flags</i> had an invalid value.

       [EAI_FAIL]  A non-recoverable error occurred.

       [EAI_FAMILY]
                   The address family was not recognized or the address
                   length was invalid for the specified family.

       [EAI_MEMORY]
                   There was a memory allocation failure.

       [EAI_NONAME]
                   The name does not resolve for the supplied
                   parameters.

                   NI_NAMEREQD is set and the host's name cannot be
                   located, or both <i>nodename</i> and <i>servname</i> were null.

       [EAI_OVERFLOW]
                   An argument buffer overflowed. The buffer pointed to
                   by the <i>node</i> argument or the <i>service</i> argument was too
                   small.

       [EAI_SYSTEM]
                   A system error occurred. The error code can be found
                   in <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the returned values are to be used as part of any further name
       resolution (for example, passed to <i>getaddrinfo</i>()), applications
       should provide buffers large enough to store any result possible
       on the system.

       Given the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address <b>"::ffff:1.2.3.4"</b>, the
       implementation performs a lookup as if the socket address
       structure contains the IPv4 address <b>"1.2.3.4"</b>.

       The IPv6 unspecified address (<b>"::"</b>) and the IPv6 loopback address
       (<b>"::1"</b>) are not IPv4-compatible addresses.
