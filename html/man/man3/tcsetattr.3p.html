NAME </h2>

       tcsetattr — set the parameters associated with the terminal
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;termios.h&gt;

       int tcsetattr(int <i>fildes</i>, int <i>optional_actions</i>,
           const struct termios *<i>termios_p</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tcsetattr</i>() function shall set the parameters associated with
       the terminal referred to by the open file descriptor <i>fildes</i> (an
       open file descriptor associated with a terminal) from the <b>termios</b>
       structure referenced by <i>termios_p</i> as follows:

        *  If <i>optional_actions</i> is TCSANOW, the change shall occur
           immediately.

        *  If <i>optional_actions</i> is TCSADRAIN, the change shall occur
           after all output written to <i>fildes</i> is transmitted. This
           function should be used when changing parameters that affect
           output.

        *  If <i>optional_actions</i> is TCSAFLUSH, the change shall occur
           after all output written to <i>fildes</i> is transmitted, and all
           input so far received but not read shall be discarded before
           the change is made.

       If the output baud rate stored in the <b>termios </b>structure pointed
       to by <i>termios_p</i> is the zero baud rate, B0, the modem control
       lines shall no longer be asserted. Normally, this shall
       disconnect the line.

       If the input baud rate stored in the <b>termios </b>structure pointed to
       by <i>termios_p</i> is 0, the input baud rate given to the hardware is
       the same as the output baud rate stored in the <b>termios </b>structure.

       The <i>tcsetattr</i>() function shall return successfully if it was able
       to perform any of the requested actions, even if some of the
       requested actions could not be performed. It shall set all the
       attributes that the implementation supports as requested and
       leave all the attributes not supported by the implementation
       unchanged. If no part of the request can be honored, it shall
       return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINVAL]</b>.  If the input and output
       baud rates differ and are a combination that is not supported,
       neither baud rate shall be changed. A subsequent call to
       <i>tcgetattr</i>() shall return the actual state of the terminal device
       (reflecting both the changes made and not made in the previous
       <i>tcsetattr</i>() call). The <i>tcsetattr</i>() function shall not change the
       values found in the <b>termios </b>structure under any circumstances.

       The effect of <i>tcsetattr</i>() is undefined if the value of the
       <b>termios </b>structure pointed to by <i>termios_p</i> was not derived from
       the result of a call to <i>tcgetattr</i>() on <i>fildes</i>; an application
       should modify only fields and flags defined by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 between the call to <i>tcgetattr</i>() and <i>tcsetattr</i>(),
       leaving all other fields and flags unmodified.

       No actions defined by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, other than a
       call to <i>tcsetattr</i>(), a close of the last file descriptor in the
       system associated with this terminal device, or an open of the
       first file descriptor in the system associated with this terminal
       device (using the O_TTY_INIT flag if it is non-zero and the
       device is not a pseudo-terminal), shall cause any of the terminal
       attributes defined by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to change.

       If <i>tcsetattr</i>() is called from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a <i>fildes</i> associated with its
       controlling terminal:

        *  If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the
           process is ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the operation completes
           normally and no signal is sent.

        *  Otherwise, a SIGTTOU signal shall be sent to the process
           group.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tcsetattr</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal interrupted <i>tcsetattr</i>().

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>optional_actions</i> argument is not a supported value, or
              an attempt was made to change an attribute represented in
              the <b>termios </b>structure to an unsupported value.

       <b>EIO    </b>The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the
              calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is
              not ignoring SIGTTOU.

       <b>ENOTTY </b>The file associated with <i>fildes</i> is not a terminal.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If trying to change baud rates, applications should call
       <i>tcsetattr</i>() then call <i>tcgetattr</i>() in order to determine what baud
       rates were actually selected.

       In general, there are two reasons for an application to change
       the parameters associated with a terminal device:

        1. The device already has working parameter settings but the
           application needs a different behavior, such as non-canonical
           mode instead of canonical mode. The application sets (or
           clears) only a few flags or <i>c_cc</i>[] values. Typically, the
           terminal device in this case is either the controlling
           terminal for the process or a pseudo-terminal.

        2. The device is a modem or similar piece of equipment connected
           by a serial line, and it was not open before the application
           opened it. In this case, the application needs to initialize
           all of the parameter settings ``from scratch''. However,
           since the <b>termios </b>structure may include both standard and
           non-standard parameters, the application cannot just
           initialize the whole structure in an arbitrary way (e.g.,
           using <i>memset</i>()) as this may cause some of the non-standard
           parameters to be set incorrectly, resulting in non-conforming
           behavior of the terminal device. Conversely, the application
           cannot just set the standard parameters, assuming that the
           non-standard parameters will already have suitable values, as
           the device might previously have been used with non-
           conforming parameter settings (and some implementations
           retain the settings from one use to the next). The solution
           is to open the terminal device using the O_TTY_INIT flag to
           initialize the terminal device to have conforming parameter
           settings, obtain those settings using <i>tcgetattr</i>(), and then
           set all of the standard parameters to the desired settings.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tcsetattr</i>() function can be interrupted in the following
       situations:

        *  It is interrupted while waiting for output to drain.

        *  It is called from a process in a background process group and
           SIGTTOU is caught.

       See also the RATIONALE section in <a href="tcgetattr.3p.html">tcgetattr(3p)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Using an input baud rate of 0 to set the input rate equal to the
       output rate may not necessarily be supported in a future version
       of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
