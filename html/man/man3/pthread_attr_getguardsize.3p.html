NAME </h2>

       pthread_attr_getguardsize, pthread_attr_setguardsize — get and
       set the thread guardsize attribute
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_attr_getguardsize(const pthread_attr_t *restrict <i>attr</i>,
           size_t *restrict <i>guardsize</i>);
       int pthread_attr_setguardsize(pthread_attr_t *<i>attr</i>,
           size_t <i>guardsize</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The  <i>pthread_attr_getguardsize</i>() function shall get the <i>guardsize</i>
       attribute in the <i>attr</i> object. This attribute shall be returned in
       the <i>guardsize</i> parameter.

       The <i>pthread_attr_setguardsize</i>() function shall set the  <i>guardsize</i>
       attribute  in  the  <i>attr</i>  object. The new value of this attribute
       shall be obtained from the <i>guardsize</i> parameter. If  <i>guardsize</i>  is
       zero, a guard area shall not be provided for threads created with
       <i>attr</i>.   If  <i>guardsize</i>  is  greater  than zero, a guard area of at
       least size <i>guardsize</i> bytes shall  be  provided  for  each  thread
       created with <i>attr</i>.

       The  <i>guardsize</i>  attribute controls the size of the guard area for
       the created thread's  stack.  The  <i>guardsize</i>  attribute  provides
       protection  against  overflow of the stack pointer. If a thread's
       stack  is  created  with  guard  protection,  the  implementation
       allocates  extra  memory  at  the  overflow end of the stack as a
       buffer against  stack  overflow  of  the  stack  pointer.  If  an
       application  overflows  into  this  buffer  an error shall result
       (possibly in a SIGSEGV signal being delivered to the thread).

       A conforming implementation may round up the value  contained  in
       <i>guardsize</i>  to  a  multiple  of  the  configurable system variable
       {PAGESIZE} (see <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i>).  If an  implementation  rounds  up
       the  value  of  <i>guardsize</i>  to a multiple of {PAGESIZE}, a call to
       <i>pthread_attr_getguardsize</i>() specifying <i>attr</i> shall  store  in  the
       <i>guardsize</i>  parameter  the  guard  size  specified by the previous
       <i>pthread_attr_setguardsize</i>() function call.

       The default value of the <i>guardsize</i> attribute  is  implementation-
       defined.

       If  the  <i>stackaddr</i> attribute has been set (that is, the caller is
       allocating and managing its own  thread  stacks),  the  <i>guardsize</i>
       attribute shall be ignored and no protection shall be provided by
       the  implementation.  It is the responsibility of the application
       to  manage  stack  overflow  along  with  stack  allocation   and
       management in this case.

       The  behavior  is  undefined  if  the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument        to         <i>pthread_attr_getguardsize</i>()         or
       <i>pthread_attr_setguardsize</i>()  does  not  refer  to  an initialized
       thread attributes object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If    successful,     the     <i>pthread_attr_getguardsize</i>()     and
       <i>pthread_attr_setguardsize</i>()    functions   shall   return   zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall  be  returned  to  indicate  the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The parameter <i>guardsize</i> is invalid.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Retrieving the guardsize Attribute</b>
       This example shows how to obtain the <i>guardsize</i> attribute of a
       thread attribute object.

           #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

           pthread_attr_t thread_attr;
           size_t  guardsize;
           int     rc;

           /* code initializing thread_attr */
           ...

           rc = pthread_attr_getguardsize (&amp;thread_attr, &amp;guardsize);
           if (rc != 0)  {
               /* handle error */
               ...
           }
           else {
               if (guardsize &gt; 0) {
               /* a guard area of at least guardsize bytes is provided */
               ...
               }
               else {
               /* no guard area provided */
               ...
               }
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>guardsize</i> attribute is provided to the application for two
       reasons:

        1. Overflow protection can potentially result in wasted system
           resources.  An application that creates a large number of
           threads, and which knows its threads never overflow their
           stack, can save system resources by turning off guard areas.

        2. When threads allocate large data structures on the stack,
           large guard areas may be needed to detect stack overflow.

       The default size of the guard area is left implementation-defined
       since on systems supporting very large page sizes, the overhead
       might be substantial if at least one guard page is required by
       default.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>attr</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_attr_getguardsize</i>() or
       <i>pthread_attr_setguardsize</i>() does not refer to an initialized
       thread attributes object, it is recommended that the function
       should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
