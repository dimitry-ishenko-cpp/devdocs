DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pcp_trace</i> library functions provide a mechanism for
       identifying sections of a program as transactions or events for
       use by the trace Performance Metrics Domain Agent (refer to
       <a href="../man1/pmdatrace.1.html">pmdatrace(1)</a> and <a href="pmda.3.html">PMDA(3)</a>).

       The monitoring of transactions using the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) infrastructure is initiated through a call to <b>pmtracebegin</b>.
       Time will be recorded from the end of each <b>pmtracebegin </b>call to
       the start of the following call to <b>pmtraceend</b>, where the same <i>tag</i>
       identifier is used in both calls.  Following from this, no
       visible recording will occur until at least one call to
       <b>pmtraceend </b>is made referencing a <i>tag</i> previously used in a call to
       <b>pmtracebegin</b>.

       A transaction which is currently in progress can be cancelled by
       calling <b>pmtraceabort</b>.  No transaction data gathered for that
       particular transaction will be exported, although data from
       previous and subsequent successful transactions with that <i>tag</i>
       name are still exported.  This is most useful when an error
       condition arises during transaction processing and the
       transaction does not run to completion.

       The <i>tag</i> argument to <b>pmtracebegin</b>, <b>pmtraceend </b>and <b>pmtraceabort </b>is
       used to uniquely identify each transaction within the <i>pcp_trace</i>
       library and later by the trace PMDA as the instance domain
       identifiers for the transaction performance metrics which it
       exports.  These routines are most useful when used around blocks
       of code which are likely to be executed a number of times over
       some relatively long time period (in a daemon process, for
       example).

       <b>pmtracebegin </b>has two distinct roles - firstly as the initiator of
       a new transaction, and secondly as a mechanism for setting a new
       start time.  Similarly, <b>pmtraceend </b>is used to register a new <i>tag</i>
       and its initial state with the trace PMDA, or alternatively to
       update the statistics which the PMDA currently associates with
       the given <i>tag</i>.

       A second form of program instrumentation can be obtained from
       <b>pmtracepoint</b>.  This is a simpler form of monitoring as it exports
       only the number of times that a particular point in a program has
       been passed.  This differs to the transaction monitoring offered
       by <b>pmtracebegin </b>and <b>pmtraceend</b>, which exports a running count of
       successful transaction completions as well as statistics on the
       time interval between the start and end points of each
       transaction.  This function is most useful when start and end
       points are not well defined.  Examples of this would be when the
       code branches in such a way that a transaction cannot be clearly
       identified, or when processing does not follow a transactional
       model, or the desired instrumentation is akin to event rates
       rather than event service times.

       The <b>pmtraceobs </b>and <b>pmtracecounter </b>functions have similar
       semantics to <b>pmtracepoint</b>, but also allow an arbitrary numeric
       <i>value</i> to be passed to the trace PMDA.  The most recent <i>value</i> for
       each <i>tag</i> is then immediately available from the PMDA.  The only
       difference between <b>pmtraceobs </b>and <b>pmtracecounter </b>is that the
       value exported via <b>pmtracecounter </b>is assumed to be a
       monotonically increasing counter value (e.g. the number of bytes
       read from a socket), whereas the value exported via <b>pmtraceobs</b>
       can be any value at all.

       <b>pmtracestate </b>allows the application to set state <i>flags</i> which are
       honoured by subsequent calls to the <i>pcp_trace</i> library routines.
       There are currently two types of flag - debugging flags and the
       asynchronous protocol flag.  A single call may specify a number
       of <i>flags</i> together, combined using a (bitwise) logical OR
       operation, and overrides the previous state setting.

       The debugging flags to <b>pmtracestate </b>cause <i>pcp_trace</i> to print
       diagnostic messages on the standard output stream at important
       processing points.  The default protocol used between the trace
       PMDA and individual <i>pcp_trace</i> client applications is a
       synchronous protocol, which allows for dropped connections to be
       reestablished at a later stage should this become possible.  An
       asynchronous protocol is also available which does not provide
       the reconnection capability, but which does away with much of the
       overhead inherent in synchronous communication.  This behaviour
       can be toggled using the <b>pmtracestate </b>call, but must be called
       before other calls to the library.  This differs to the debugging
       state behaviour, which can be altered at any time.  <b>pmtracestate</b>
       returns the previous state (setting prior to being called).

       The following table describes each of the <b>pmtracestate </b><i>flags</i> -
       examples of the use of these flags in each supported language are
       given in the demo applications (refer to the ``FILES'' section
       below).

       Should any of the <i>pcp_trace</i> library functions return a negative
       value, an error has occurred.  This can be diagnosed further
       using the <b>pmtraceerrstr </b>routine, which takes the negative return
       value as its <i>code</i> argument, and in the C-callable interface
       returns a pointer to the associated error message.  This points
       into a static error table, and should therefore not be passed to
       <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a>.  The Fortran-callable interface has a slightly different
       syntax, requiring the destination character array to be passed in
       as the second argument.  The Java-callable interface returns a
       UTF-8 string, created using the JNI (Java Native Interface)
       routine <b>NewStringUTF</b>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pcp_trace</i> Java class interface has been developed and
       verified using version 1.1 of the Java Native Interface (JNI)
       specification.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       Applications that use <a href="gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname(3)</a> should exercise caution
       because the static fields in <i>struct hostent</i> may not be preserved
       across some <i>pcp_trace</i> calls.  In particular, <b>pmtracebegin</b>,
       <b>pmtraceend</b>, <b>pmtracepoint</b>, <b>pmtracecounter</b>, and <b>pmtraceobs </b>may all
       call <a href="gethostbyname.3.html">gethostbyname(3)</a> internally.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       A negative return value from a <i>pcp_trace</i> function indicates that
       an error has occurred - if this is the case, the return value can
       be passed to <b>pmtraceerrstr </b>to obtain the associated error
       message.

       Success is indicated by a return value of zero.

       <b>pmtracestate </b>also returns an integer representing the state <i>flags</i>
       which were set prior to the call.

</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pcp_trace</i> routines communicate with the trace PMDA via a
       socket connection, which by default uses TCP/IP port number 4323.
       This can be over-ridden by setting <b>PCP_TRACE_PORT </b>to a different
       port number when the application is started.  The host where the
       trace PMDA is running is by default the localhost, but this can
       be changed using <b>PCP_TRACE_HOST</b>.  When attempting to connect to a
       remote trace PMDA, after some specified time interval has
       elapsed, the connection attempt will be aborted and an error
       status will be returned.  The default timeout interval is 3
       seconds, and this can be modified by setting <b>PCP_TRACE_TIMEOUT </b>in
       the environment to a real number of seconds for the desired
       timeout.  This is most useful in cases where the remote host is
       at the end of a slow network, requiring longer latencies to
       establish the connection correctly.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.  Values for these variables may be obtained
       programmatically using the <a href="pmgetconfig.3.html">pmGetConfig(3)</a> function.
