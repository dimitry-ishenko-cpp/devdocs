PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fputwc — put a wide-character code on a stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wint_t fputwc(wchar_t <i>wc</i>, FILE *<i>stream</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fputwc</i>() function shall write the character corresponding to
       the wide-character code <i>wc</i> to the output stream pointed to by
       <i>stream</i>, at the position indicated by the associated file-position
       indicator for the stream (if defined), and advances the indicator
       appropriately. If the file cannot support positioning requests,
       or if the stream was opened with append mode, the character is
       appended to the output stream. If an error occurs while writing
       the character, the shift state of the output file is left in an
       undefined state.

       The last data modification and last file status change timestamps
       of the file shall be marked for update between the successful
       execution of <i>fputwc</i>() and the next successful completion of a
       call to <i>fflush</i>() or <i>fclose</i>() on the same stream or a call to
       <i>exit</i>() or <i>abort</i>().

       The <i>fputwc</i>() function shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>fputwc</i>() shall return <i>wc</i>.  Otherwise,
       it shall return WEOF, the error indicator for the stream shall be
       set, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fputwc</i>() function shall fail if either the stream is
       unbuffered or data in the <i>stream</i>'s buffer needs to be written,
       and:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor
              underlying <i>stream</i> and the thread would be delayed in the
              write operation.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The file descriptor underlying <i>stream</i> is not a valid file
              descriptor open for writing.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write to a file that exceeds the
              maximum file size or the file size limit of the process.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to
              write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
              corresponding stream.

       <b>EILSEQ </b>The wide-character code <i>wc</i> does not correspond to a valid
              character.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a
              signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EIO    </b>A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is a
              member of a background process group attempting to write
              to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the calling
              thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, the process is not
              ignoring SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is
              orphaned.  This error may also be returned under
              implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>There was no free space remaining on the device containing
              the file.

       <b>EPIPE  </b>An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not
              open for reading by any process. A SIGPIPE signal shall
              also be sent to the thread.

       The <i>fputwc</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

       <b>ENXIO  </b>A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request
              was outside the capabilities of the device.
