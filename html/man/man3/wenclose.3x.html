DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These  functions provide an interface to mouse events from <b>ncurs‐</b>
       <b>es</b>(3X).  Mouse events are  represented  by  <b>KEY_MOUSE  </b>pseudo-key
       values in the <b>wgetch</b>(3X) input stream.

   <b>mousemask</b>
       To  make  mouse events visible, use the <b>mousemask </b>function.  This
       sets the mouse events to  be  reported.   By  default,  no  mouse
       events are reported.

       •   The function returns an updated copy of <i>newmask</i> to indicate
           which of the specified mouse events can be reported.

           If the screen has not been initialized, or if the terminal
           does not support mouse-events, this function returns 0.

       •   If <i>oldmask</i> is non-NULL, this function fills the indicated lo‐
           cation with the previous value of the current screen's mouse
           event mask.

       As a side effect, setting a zero mousemask may turn off the mouse
       pointer; setting a nonzero mask may turn it on.  Whether this
       happens is device-dependent.

   <b>Mouse events</b>
       Here are the mouse event type masks which may be defined:

       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   <b>getmouse</b>
       Once a class of mouse events has been made visible in a window,
       calling the <b>wgetch </b>function on that window may return <b>KEY_MOUSE</b>
       as an indicator that a mouse event has been queued.  To read the
       event data and pop the event off the queue, call <b>getmouse</b>.  This
       function will return <b>OK </b>if a mouse event is actually visible in
       the given window, <b>ERR </b>otherwise.  When <b>getmouse </b>returns <b>OK</b>, the
       data deposited as y and x in the event structure coordinates will
       be screen-relative character-cell coordinates.  The returned
       state mask will have exactly one bit set to indicate the event
       type.  The corresponding data in the queue is marked invalid.  A
       subsequent call to <b>getmouse </b>will retrieve the next older item
       from the queue.

   <b>ungetmouse</b>
       The <b>ungetmouse </b>function behaves analogously to <b>ungetch</b>.  It push‐
       es a <b>KEY_MOUSE </b>event onto the input queue, and associates with
       that event the given state data and screen-relative character-
       cell coordinates.

   <b>wenclose</b>
       The <b>wenclose </b>function tests whether a given pair of screen-rela‐
       tive character-cell coordinates is enclosed by a given window,
       returning <b>TRUE </b>if it is and <b>FALSE </b>otherwise.  It is useful for
       determining what subset of the screen windows enclose the loca‐
       tion of a mouse event.

   <b>wmouse_trafo</b>
       The <b>wmouse_trafo </b>function transforms a given pair of coordinates
       from stdscr-relative coordinates to coordinates relative to the
       given window or vice versa.  The resulting stdscr-relative coor‐
       dinates are not always identical to window-relative coordinates
       due to the mechanism to reserve lines on top or bottom of the
       screen for other purposes (see the <b>ripoffline </b>and <b>slk_init</b>(3X)
       calls, for example).

       •   If the parameter <i>to_screen</i> is <b>TRUE</b>, the pointers <i>pY, pX</i> must
           reference the coordinates of a location inside the window
           <i>win</i>.  They are converted to window-relative coordinates and
           returned through the pointers.  If the conversion was suc‐
           cessful, the function returns <b>TRUE</b>.

       •   If one of the parameters was NULL or the location is not in‐
           side the window, <b>FALSE </b>is returned.

       •   If <i>to_screen</i> is <b>FALSE</b>, the pointers <i>pY, pX</i> must reference
           window-relative coordinates.  They are converted to stdscr-
           relative coordinates if the window <i>win</i> encloses this point.
           In this case the function returns <b>TRUE</b>.

       •   If one of the parameters is NULL or the point is not inside
           the window, <b>FALSE </b>is returned.  The referenced coordinates
           are only replaced by the converted coordinates if the trans‐
           formation was successful.

   <b>mouse_trafo</b>
       The <b>mouse_trafo </b>function performs the same translation as
       <b>wmouse_trafo</b>, using stdscr for <i>win</i>.

   <b>mouseinterval</b>
       The <b>mouseinterval </b>function sets the maximum time (in thousands of
       a second) that can elapse between press and release events for
       them to be recognized as a click.  Use <b>mouseinterval</b>(0) to dis‐
       able click resolution.  This function returns the previous inter‐
       val value.  Use <b>mouseinterval(-1) </b>to obtain the interval without
       altering it.  The default is one sixth of a second.

   <b>has_mouse</b>
       The <b>has_mouse </b>function returns <b>TRUE </b>if the mouse driver has been
       successfully initialized.

       Note that mouse events will be ignored when input is in cooked
       mode, and will cause an error beep when cooked mode is being sim‐
       ulated in a window by a function such as <b>getstr </b>that expects a
       linefeed for input-loop termination.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>getmouse </b>and <b>ungetmouse </b>return the integer <b>ERR </b>upon failure or <b>OK</b>
       upon successful completion:

          <b>getmouse</b>
               returns an error.

          •   If no mouse driver was initialized, or if the mask parame‐
              ter is zero,

          •   It returns an error if a mouse event was detected which
              did not match the current <i>mousemask</i>.

          •   It also returns an error if no more events remain in the
              queue.

          <b>ungetmouse</b>
               returns an error if the FIFO is full.

       <b>mousemask </b>returns the mask of reportable events.

       <b>mouseinterval </b>returns the previous interval value, unless the
       terminal was not initialized.  In that case, it returns the maxi‐
       mum interval value (166).

       <b>wenclose </b>and <b>wmouse_trafo </b>are boolean functions returning <b>TRUE </b>or
       <b>FALSE </b>depending on their test result.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These calls were designed for <b>ncurses</b>(3X), and are not found in
       SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of
       curses.

       SVr4 curses had support for the mouse in a variant of <b>xterm</b>(1).
       It is mentioned in a few places, but with no supporting documen‐
       tation:

       •   the “libcurses” manual page lists functions for this feature
           which are prototyped in <b>curses.h</b>:

               extern int mouse_set(long int);
               extern int mouse_on(long int);
               extern int mouse_off(long int);
               extern int request_mouse_pos(void);
               extern int map_button(unsigned long);
               extern void wmouse_position(WINDOW *, int *, int *);
               extern unsigned long getmouse(void), getbmap(void);

       •   the “terminfo” manual page lists capabilities for the feature

               buttons           btns    BT       Number of buttons on the mouse
               get_mouse         getm    Gm       Curses should get button events
               key_mouse         kmous   Km       0631, Mouse event has occurred
               mouse_info        minfo   Mi       Mouse status information
               req_mouse_pos     reqmp   RQ       Request mouse position report

       •   the interface made assumptions (as does ncurses) about the
           escape sequences sent to and received from the terminal.

           For instance the SVr4 curses library used the <b>get_mouse </b>capa‐
           bility to tell the terminal which mouse button events it
           should send, passing the mouse-button bit-mask to the termi‐
           nal.  Also, it could ask the terminal where the mouse was us‐
           ing the <b>req_mouse_pos </b>capability.

           Those features required a terminal which had been modified to
           work with curses.  They were not part of the X Consortium's
           xterm.

       When developing the xterm mouse support for ncurses in September
       1995, Eric Raymond was uninterested in using the same interface
       due to its lack of documentation.  Later, in 1998, Mark Hesseling
       provided support in PDCurses 2.3 using the SVr4 interface.  PD‐
       Curses, however, does not use video terminals, making it unneces‐
       sary to be concerned about compatibility with the escape se‐
       quences.

       The feature macro <b>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION </b>is provided so the pre‐
       processor can be used to test whether these features are present.
       If the interface is changed, the value of <b>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION</b>
       will be incremented.  These values for <b>NCURSES_MOUSE_VERSION </b>may
       be specified when configuring ncurses:

          1  has definitions for reserved events.  The mask uses 28
             bits.

          2  adds definitions for button 5, removes the definitions for
             reserved events.  The mask uses 29 bits.

       The order of the <b>MEVENT </b>structure members is not guaranteed.  Ad‐
       ditional fields may be added to the structure in the future.

       Under <b>ncurses</b>(3X), these calls are implemented using either
       xterm's built-in mouse-tracking API or platform-specific drivers
       including

          •   Alessandro Rubini's gpm server

          •   FreeBSD sysmouse

          •   OS/2 EMX

       If you are using an unsupported configuration, mouse events will
       not be visible to <b>ncurses</b>(3X) (and the <b>mousemask </b>function will
       always return <b>0</b>).

       If the terminfo entry contains a <b>XM </b>string, this is used in the
       xterm mouse driver to control the way the terminal is initialized
       for mouse operation.  The default, if <b>XM </b>is not found, corre‐
       sponds to private mode 1000 of xterm:

          \E[?1000%?%p1%{1}%=%th%el%;

       The mouse driver also recognizes a newer xterm private mode 1006,
       e.g.,

          \E[?1006;1000%?%p1%{1}%=%th%el%;

       The <i>z</i> member in the event structure is not presently used.  It is
       intended for use with touch screens (which may be pressure-sensi‐
       tive) or with 3D-mice/trackballs/power gloves.

       The <b>ALL_MOUSE_EVENTS </b>class does not include <b>REPORT_MOUSE_POSI‐</b>
       <b>TION</b>.  They are distinct.  For example, in xterm, wheel/scrolling
       mice send position reports as a sequence of presses of buttons 4
       or 5 without matching button-releases.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Mouse events under xterm will not in fact be ignored during
       cooked mode, if they have been enabled by <b>mousemask</b>.  Instead,
       the xterm mouse report sequence will appear in the string read.

       Mouse events under xterm will not be detected correctly in a win‐
       dow with its keypad bit off, since they are interpreted as a va‐
       riety of function key.  Your terminfo description should have
       <b>kmous </b>set to “\E[M” (the beginning of the response from xterm for
       mouse clicks).  Other values for <b>kmous </b>are permitted, but under
       the same assumption, i.e., it is the beginning of the response.

       Because there are no standard terminal responses that would serve
       to identify terminals which support the xterm mouse protocol,
       <b>ncurses </b>assumes that if <b>kmous </b>is defined in the terminal descrip‐
       tion, or if the terminal description's primary name or aliases
       contain the string “xterm”, then the terminal may send mouse
       events.  The <b>kmous </b>capability is checked first, allowing the use
       of newer xterm mouse protocols such as xterm's private mode 1006.
