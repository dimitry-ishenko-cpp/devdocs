PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       munmap — unmap pages of memory
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int munmap(void *<i>addr</i>, size_t <i>len</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>munmap</i>() function shall remove any mappings for those entire
       pages containing any part of the address space of the process
       starting at <i>addr</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes. Further references
       to these pages shall result in the generation of a SIGSEGV signal
       to the process.  If there are no mappings in the specified
       address range, then <i>munmap</i>() has no effect.

       The implementation may require that <i>addr</i> be a multiple of the
       page size as returned by <i>sysconf</i>().

       If a mapping to be removed was private, any modifications made in
       this address range shall be discarded.

       Any memory locks (see <a href="mlock.3p.html">mlock(3p)</a> and <a href="mlockall.3p.html">mlockall(3p)</a>) associated with
       this address range shall be removed, as if by an appropriate call
       to <i>munlock</i>().

       If a mapping removed from a typed memory object causes the
       corresponding address range of the memory pool to be inaccessible
       by any process in the system except through allocatable mappings
       (that is, mappings of typed memory objects opened with the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE flag), then that range of the
       memory pool shall become deallocated and may become available to
       satisfy future typed memory allocation requests.

       A mapping removed from a typed memory object opened with the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_MAP_ALLOCATABLE flag shall not affect in any way
       the availability of that typed memory for allocation.

       The behavior of this function is unspecified if the mapping was
       not established by a call to <i>mmap</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>munmap</i>() shall return 0; otherwise,
       it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>munmap</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>Addresses in the range [<i>addr</i>,<i>addr</i>+<i>len</i>) are outside the
              valid range for the address space of a process.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>len</i> argument is 0.

       The <i>munmap</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>addr</i> argument is not a multiple of the page size as
              returned by <i>sysconf</i>().

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>munmap</i>() function corresponds to SVR4, just as the <i>mmap</i>()
       function does.

       It is possible that an application has applied process memory
       locking to a region that contains shared memory. If this has
       occurred, the <i>munmap</i>() call ignores those locks and, if
       necessary, causes those locks to be removed.

       Most implementations require that <i>addr</i> is a multiple of the page
       size as returned by <i>sysconf</i>().
