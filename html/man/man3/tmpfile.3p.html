PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       tmpfile — create a temporary file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       FILE *tmpfile(void);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>tmpfile</i>() function shall create a temporary file and open a
       corresponding stream. The file shall be automatically deleted
       when all references to the file are closed. The file shall be
       opened as in <i>fopen</i>() for update (<i>wb</i>+), except that
       implementations may restrict the permissions, either by clearing
       the file mode bits or setting them to the value S_IRUSR |
       S_IWUSR.

       In some implementations, a permanent file may be left behind if
       the process calling <i>tmpfile</i>() is killed while it is processing a
       call to <i>tmpfile</i>().

       An error message may be written to standard error if the stream
       cannot be opened.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>tmpfile</i>() shall return a pointer to
       the stream of the file that is created.  Otherwise, it shall
       return a null pointer and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tmpfile</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during <i>tmpfile</i>().

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>EMFILE </b>{STREAM_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in
              the system.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The directory or file system which would contain the new
              file cannot be expanded.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The file is a regular file and the size of the file cannot
              be represented correctly in an object of type <b>off_t</b>.

       The <i>tmpfile</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EMFILE </b>{FOPEN_MAX} streams are currently open in the calling
              process.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Creating a Temporary File</b>
       The following example creates a temporary file for update, and
       returns a pointer to a stream for the created file in the <i>fp</i>
       variable.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           ...
           FILE *fp;

           fp = tmpfile ();
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       It should be possible to open at least {TMP_MAX} temporary files
       during the lifetime of the program (this limit may be shared with
       <i>tmpnam</i>()) and there should be no limit on the number
       simultaneously open other than this limit and any limit on the
       number of open file descriptors or streams ({OPEN_MAX},
       {FOPEN_MAX}, {STREAM_MAX}).
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
