<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       getc_unlocked, getchar_unlocked, putc_unlocked, putchar_unlocked
       — stdio with explicit client locking
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int getc_unlocked(FILE *<i>stream</i>);
       int getchar_unlocked(void);
       int putc_unlocked(int <i>c</i>, FILE *<i>stream</i>);
       int putchar_unlocked(int <i>c</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Versions of the functions <i>getc</i>(), <i>getchar</i>(), <i>putc</i>(), and
       <i>putchar</i>() respectively named <i>getc_unlocked</i>(), <i>getchar_unlocked</i>(),
       <i>putc_unlocked</i>(), and <i>putchar_unlocked</i>() shall be provided which
       are functionally equivalent to the original versions, with the
       exception that they are not required to be implemented in a fully
       thread-safe manner. They shall be thread-safe when used within a
       scope protected by <i>flockfile</i>() (or <i>ftrylockfile</i>()) and
       <i>funlockfile</i>().  These functions can safely be used in a multi-
       threaded program if and only if they are called while the
       invoking thread owns the (<b>FILE *</b>) object, as is the case after a
       successful call to the <i>flockfile</i>() or <i>ftrylockfile</i>() functions.

       If <i>getc_unlocked</i>() or <i>putc_unlocked</i>() are implemented as macros
       they may evaluate <i>stream</i> more than once, so the <i>stream</i> argument
       should never be an expression with side-effects.

       See <a href="getc.3p.html">getc(3p)</a>, <a href="getchar.3p.html">getchar(3p)</a>, <a href="putc.3p.html">putc(3p)</a>, and <a href="putchar.3p.html">putchar(3p)</a>.

EXAMPLES </h2>

</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since they may be implemented as macros, <i>getc_unlocked</i>() and
       <i>putc_unlocked</i>() may treat incorrectly a <i>stream</i> argument with
       side-effects. In particular, <i>getc_unlocked</i>(*f++) and
       <i>putc_unlocked</i>(c,*f++) do not necessarily work as expected.
       Therefore, use of these functions in such situations should be
       preceded by the following statement as appropriate:

           #undef getc_unlocked
           #undef putc_unlocked
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Some I/O functions are typically implemented as macros for
       performance reasons (for example, <i>putc</i>() and <i>getc</i>()).  For
       safety, they need to be synchronized, but it is often too
       expensive to synchronize on every character. Nevertheless, it was
       felt that the safety concerns were more important; consequently,
       the <i>getc</i>(), <i>getchar</i>(), <i>putc</i>(), and <i>putchar</i>() functions are
       required to be thread-safe. However, unlocked versions are also
       provided with names that clearly indicate the unsafe nature of
       their operation but can be used to exploit their higher
       performance.  These unlocked versions can be safely used only
       within explicitly locked program regions, using exported locking
       primitives. In particular, a sequence such as:

           flockfile(fileptr);
           putc_unlocked('1', fileptr);
           putc_unlocked('\n', fileptr);
           fprintf(fileptr, "Line 2\n");
           funlockfile(fileptr);

       is permissible, and results in the text sequence:

           1
           Line 2

       being printed without being interspersed with output from other
       threads.

       It would be wrong to have the standard names such as <i>getc</i>(),
       <i>putc</i>(), and so on, map to the ``faster, but unsafe'' rather than
       the ``slower, but safe'' versions. In either case, you would
       still want to inspect all uses of <i>getc</i>(), <i>putc</i>(), and so on, by
       hand when converting existing code. Choosing the safe bindings as
       the default, at least, results in correct code and maintains the
       ``atomicity at the function'' invariant. To do otherwise would
       introduce gratuitous synchronization errors into converted code.
       Other routines that modify the <i>stdio</i> (<b>FILE *</b>) structures or
       buffers are also safely synchronized.

       Note that there is no need for functions of the form
       <i>getc_locked</i>(), <i>putc_locked</i>(), and so on, since this is the
       functionality of <i>getc</i>(), <i>putc</i>(), <i>et al</i>.  It would be
       inappropriate to use a feature test macro to switch a macro
       definition of <i>getc</i>() between <i>getc_locked</i>() and <i>getc_unlocked</i>(),
       since the ISO C standard requires an actual function to exist, a
       function whose behavior could not be changed by the feature test
       macro. Also, providing both the <i>xxx_locked</i>() and <i>xxx_unlocked</i>()
       forms leads to the confusion of whether the suffix describes the
       behavior of the function or the circumstances under which it
       should be used.

       Three additional routines, <i>flockfile</i>(), <i>ftrylockfile</i>(), and
       <i>funlockfile</i>() (which may be macros), are provided to allow the
       user to delineate a sequence of I/O statements that are executed
       synchronously.

       The <i>ungetc</i>() function is infrequently called relative to the
       other functions/macros so no unlocked variation is needed.
