SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;syslog.h&gt;

       void closelog(void);
       void openlog(const char *<i>ident</i>, int <i>logopt</i>, int <i>facility</i>);
       int setlogmask(int <i>maskpri</i>);
       void syslog(int <i>priority</i>, const char *<i>message</i>, ... /* <i>arguments</i> */);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>syslog</i>() function shall send a message to an implementation-
       defined logging facility, which may log it in an implementation-
       defined system log, write it to the system console, forward it to
       a list of users, or forward it to the logging facility on another
       host over the network.  The logged message shall include a
       message header and a message body.  The message header contains
       at least a timestamp and a tag string.

       The message body is generated from the <i>message</i> and following
       arguments in the same manner as if these were arguments to
       <i>printf</i>(), except that the additional conversion specification <b>%m</b>
       shall be recognized; it shall convert no arguments, shall cause
       the output of the error message string associated with the value
       of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> on entry to <i>syslog</i>(), and may be mixed with argument
       specifications of the "%<i>n</i>$" form. If a complete conversion
       specification with the <b>m </b>conversion specifier character is not
       just <b>%m</b>, the behavior is undefined. A trailing &lt;newline&gt; may be
       added if needed.

       Values of the <i>priority</i> argument are formed by OR'ing together a
       severity-level value and an optional facility value. If no
       facility value is specified, the current default facility value
       is used.

       Possible values of severity level include:

       LOG_EMERG   A panic condition.

       LOG_ALERT   A condition that should be corrected immediately,
                   such as a corrupted system database.

       LOG_CRIT    Critical conditions, such as hard device errors.

       LOG_ERR     Errors.

       LOG_WARNING
                   Warning messages.

       LOG_NOTICE  Conditions that are not error conditions, but that
                   may require special handling.

       LOG_INFO    Informational messages.

       LOG_DEBUG   Messages that contain information normally of use
                   only when debugging a program.

       The facility indicates the application or system component
       generating the message. Possible facility values include:

       LOG_USER    Messages generated by arbitrary processes. This is
                   the default facility identifier if none is specified.

       LOG_LOCAL0  Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL1  Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL2  Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL3  Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL4  Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL5  Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL6  Reserved for local use.

       LOG_LOCAL7  Reserved for local use.

       The <i>openlog</i>() function shall set process attributes that affect
       subsequent calls to <i>syslog</i>().  The <i>ident</i> argument is a string
       that is prepended to every message. The <i>logopt</i> argument indicates
       logging options. Values for <i>logopt</i> are constructed by a bitwise-
       inclusive OR of zero or more of the following:

       LOG_PID     Log the process ID with each message. This is useful
                   for identifying specific processes.

       LOG_CONS    Write messages to the system console if they cannot
                   be sent to the logging facility. The <i>syslog</i>()
                   function ensures that the process does not acquire
                   the console as a controlling terminal in the process
                   of writing the message.

       LOG_NDELAY  Open the connection to the logging facility
                   immediately. Normally the open is delayed until the
                   first message is logged. This is useful for programs
                   that need to manage the order in which file
                   descriptors are allocated.

       LOG_ODELAY  Delay open until <i>syslog</i>() is called.

       LOG_NOWAIT  Do not wait for child processes that may have been
                   created during the course of logging the message.
                   This option should be used by processes that enable
                   notification of child termination using SIGCHLD,
                   since <i>syslog</i>() may otherwise block waiting for a
                   child whose exit status has already been collected.

       The <i>facility</i> argument encodes a default facility to be assigned
       to all messages that do not have an explicit facility already
       encoded. The initial default facility is LOG_USER.

       The <i>openlog</i>() and <i>syslog</i>() functions may allocate a file
       descriptor. It is not necessary to call <i>openlog</i>() prior to
       calling <i>syslog</i>().

       The <i>closelog</i>() function shall close any open file descriptors
       allocated by previous calls to <i>openlog</i>() or <i>syslog</i>().

       The <i>setlogmask</i>() function shall set the log priority mask for the
       current process to <i>maskpri</i> and return the previous mask. If the
       <i>maskpri</i> argument is 0, the current log mask is not modified.
       Calls by the current process to <i>syslog</i>() with a priority not set
       in <i>maskpri</i> shall be rejected. The default log mask allows all
       priorities to be logged. A call to <i>openlog</i>() is not required
       prior to calling <i>setlogmask</i>().

       Symbolic constants for use as values of the <i>logopt</i>, <i>facility</i>,
       <i>priority</i>, and <i>maskpri</i> arguments are defined in the <i>&lt;syslog.h&gt;</i>
       header.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setlogmask</i>() function shall return the previous log priority
       mask. The <i>closelog</i>(), <i>openlog</i>(), and <i>syslog</i>() functions shall not
       return a value.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Using openlog()</b>
       The following example causes subsequent calls to <i>syslog</i>() to log
       the process ID with each message, and to write messages to the
       system console if they cannot be sent to the logging facility.

           #include &lt;syslog.h&gt;

           char *ident = "Process demo";
           int logopt = LOG_PID | LOG_CONS;
           int facility = LOG_USER;
           ...
           openlog(ident, logopt, facility);

   <b>Using setlogmask()</b>
       The following example causes subsequent calls to <i>syslog</i>() to
       accept error messages, and to reject all other messages.

           #include &lt;syslog.h&gt;

           int result;
           int mask = LOG_MASK (LOG_ERR);
           ...
           result = setlogmask(mask);

   <b>Using syslog</b>
       The following example sends the message <b>"This</b>is<b>a</b>message" to the
       default logging facility, marking the message as an error message
       generated by random processes.

           #include &lt;syslog.h&gt;

           char *message = "This is a message";
           int priority = LOG_ERR | LOG_USER;
           ...
           syslog(priority, message);
