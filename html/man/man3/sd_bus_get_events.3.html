NAME </h2>

SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;systemd/sd-bus.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int sd_bus_get_fd(sd_bus *</b><i>bus</i><b>);</b>

       <b>int sd_bus_get_events(sd_bus *</b><i>bus</i><b>);</b>

       <b>int sd_bus_get_timeout(sd_bus *</b><i>bus</i><b>, uint64_t *</b><i>timeout_usec</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_bus_get_fd() </b>returns the file descriptor used to communicate
       from a message bus object. This descriptor can be used with
       <b>poll</b>(3) or a similar function to wait for I/O events on the
       specified bus connection object. If the bus object was configured
       with the <b>sd_bus_set_fd() </b>function, then the <i>input_fd</i> file
       descriptor used in that call is returned.

       <b>sd_bus_get_events() </b>returns the I/O events to wait for, suitable
       for passing to <b>poll() </b>or a similar call. Returns a combination of
       <b>POLLIN</b>, <b>POLLOUT</b>, ... events, or negative on error.

       <b>sd_bus_get_timeout() </b>returns the <i>absolute</i> time-out in μs, from
       which the relative time-out to pass to <b>poll() </b>(or a similar call)
       can be derived, when waiting for events on the specified bus
       connection. The returned timeout may be zero, in which case a
       subsequent I/O polling call should be invoked in non-blocking
       mode. The returned timeout may be <b>UINT64_MAX </b>in which case the
       I/O polling call may block indefinitely, without any applied
       timeout. Note that the returned timeout should be considered only
       a maximum sleeping time. It is permissible (and even expected)
       that shorter timeouts are used by the calling program, in case
       other event sources are polled in the same event loop. Note that
       the returned time-value is absolute, based of <b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC </b>and
       specified in microseconds. When converting this value in order to
       pass it as third argument to <b>poll() </b>(which expects relative
       milliseconds), care should be taken to convert to a relative time
       and use a division that rounds up to ensure the I/O polling
       operation doesn't sleep for shorter than necessary, which might
       result in unintended busy looping (alternatively, use <a href="../man2/ppoll.2.html">ppoll(2)</a>
       instead of plain <b>poll()</b>, which understands timeouts with
       nano-second granularity).

       These three functions are useful to hook up a bus connection
       object with an external or manual event loop involving <b>poll() </b>or
       a similar I/O polling call. Before each invocation of the I/O
       polling call, all three functions should be invoked: the file
       descriptor returned by <b>sd_bus_get_fd() </b>should be polled for the
       events indicated by <b>sd_bus_get_events()</b>, and the I/O call should
       block for that up to the timeout returned by
       <b>sd_bus_get_timeout()</b>. After each I/O polling call the bus
       connection needs to process incoming or outgoing data, by
       invoking <a href="sd_bus_process.3.html">sd_bus_process(3)</a>.

       Note that these functions are only one of three supported ways to
       implement I/O event handling for bus connections. Alternatively
       use <a href="sd_bus_attach_event.3.html">sd_bus_attach_event(3)</a> to attach a bus connection to an
       <a href="sd-event.3.html">sd-event(3)</a> event loop. Or use <a href="sd_bus_wait.3.html">sd_bus_wait(3)</a> as a simple
       synchronous, blocking I/O waiting call.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>sd_bus_get_fd() </b>returns the file descriptor used for
       communication. On failure, it returns a negative errno-style
       error code.

       On success, <b>sd_bus_get_events() </b>returns the I/O event mask to use
       for I/O event watching. On failure, it returns a negative
       errno-style error code.

       On success, <b>sd_bus_get_timeout() </b>returns a non-negative integer.
       On failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
           An invalid bus object was passed.

       <b>-ECHILD</b>
           The bus connection was allocated in a parent process and is
           being reused in a child process after <b>fork()</b>.

       <b>-ENOTCONN</b>
           The bus connection has been terminated.

       <b>-EPERM</b>
           Two distinct file descriptors were passed for input and
           output using <b>sd_bus_set_fd()</b>, which <b>sd_bus_get_fd() </b>cannot
           return.

       <b>-ENOPKG</b>
           The bus cannot be resolved.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.

       <b>sd_bus_get_fd()</b>, <b>sd_bus_get_events()</b>, and <b>sd_bus_get_timeout()</b>
       were added in version 221.
