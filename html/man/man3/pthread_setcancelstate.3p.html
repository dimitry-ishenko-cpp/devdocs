PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_setcancelstate, pthread_setcanceltype, pthread_testcancel
       — set cancelability state
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_setcancelstate(int <i>state</i>, int *<i>oldstate</i>);
       int pthread_setcanceltype(int <i>type</i>, int *<i>oldtype</i>);
       void pthread_testcancel(void);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_setcancelstate</i>() function shall atomically both set
       the calling thread's cancelability state to the indicated <i>state</i>
       and return the previous cancelability state at the location
       referenced by <i>oldstate</i>.  Legal values for <i>state</i> are
       PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE.

       The <i>pthread_setcanceltype</i>() function shall atomically both set
       the calling thread's cancelability type to the indicated <i>type</i> and
       return the previous cancelability type at the location referenced
       by <i>oldtype</i>.  Legal values for <i>type</i> are PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED
       and PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.

       The cancelability state and type of any newly created threads,
       including the thread in which <i>main</i>() was first invoked, shall be
       PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED respectively.

       The <i>pthread_testcancel</i>() function shall create a cancellation
       point in the calling thread. The <i>pthread_testcancel</i>() function
       shall have no effect if cancelability is disabled.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_setcancelstate</i>() and
       <i>pthread_setcanceltype</i>() functions shall return zero; otherwise,
       an error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_setcancelstate</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The specified state is not PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE or
              PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE.

       The <i>pthread_setcanceltype</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The specified type is not PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED or
              PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

EXAMPLES </h2>

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       In order to write a signal handler for an asynchronous signal
       which can run safely in a cancellable thread,
       <i>pthread_setcancelstate</i>() must be used to disable cancellation for
       the duration of any calls that the signal handler makes which are
       cancellation points. However, the standard does not permit
       strictly conforming applications to call <i>pthread_setcancelstate</i>()
       from a signal handler since it is not currently required to be
       async-signal-safe. On implementations where
       <i>pthread_setcancelstate</i>() is not async-signal-safe, alternatives
       are to ensure either that the corresponding signals are blocked
       during execution of functions that are not async-cancel-safe or
       that cancellation is disabled during times when those signals
       could be delivered. Implementations are strongly encouraged to
       make <i>pthread_setcancelstate</i>() async-signal-safe.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_setcancelstate</i>() and <i>pthread_setcanceltype</i>()
       functions control the points at which a thread may be
       asynchronously canceled. For cancellation control to be usable in
       modular fashion, some rules need to be followed.

       An object can be considered to be a generalization of a
       procedure. It is a set of procedures and global variables written
       as a unit and called by clients not known by the object. Objects
       may depend on other objects.

       First, cancelability should only be disabled on entry to an
       object, never explicitly enabled. On exit from an object, the
       cancelability state should always be restored to its value on
       entry to the object.

       This follows from a modularity argument: if the client of an
       object (or the client of an object that uses that object) has
       disabled cancelability, it is because the client does not want to
       be concerned about cleaning up if the thread is canceled while
       executing some sequence of actions. If an object is called in
       such a state and it enables cancelability and a cancellation
       request is pending for that thread, then the thread is canceled,
       contrary to the wish of the client that disabled.

       Second, the cancelability type may be explicitly set to either
       <i>deferred</i> or <i>asynchronous</i> upon entry to an object. But as with the
       cancelability state, on exit from an object the cancelability
       type should always be restored to its value on entry to the
       object.

       Finally, only functions that are cancel-safe may be called from a
       thread that is asynchronously cancelable.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_setcancelstate</i>() function may be added to the table
       of async-signal-safe functions in <i>Section 2.4.3</i>, <i>Signal Actions</i>.
