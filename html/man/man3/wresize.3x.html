NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>wresize </b>- resize a curses window
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;curses.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int wresize(WINDOW *</b><i>win</i><b>, int </b><i>lines</i><b>, int </b><i>columns</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It reallocates
       storage for an <b>ncurses </b>window to adjust its dimensions to the
       specified values.  If either dimension is larger than the current
       values, the window's data is filled with blanks that have the
       current background rendition (as set by <b>wbkgdset</b>) merged into
       them.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The function returns the integer <b>ERR </b>upon failure and <b>OK </b>on
       success.  It will fail if either of the dimensions less than or
       equal to zero, or if an error occurs while (re)allocating memory
       for the window.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The only restriction placed on the dimensions is that they be
       greater than zero.  The dimensions are not compared to <b>curses</b>
       screen dimensions to simplify the logic of <b>resizeterm</b>.  The
       caller must ensure that the window's dimensions fit within the
       actual screen dimensions.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       It is not possible to resize windows with SVr4 curses.

       This extension of ncurses was introduced in mid-1995.  It was
       adopted in NetBSD curses (2001) and PDCurses (2003).

       BSD curses).
