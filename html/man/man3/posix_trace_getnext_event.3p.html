DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_getnext_event</i>() function shall report a recorded
       trace event either from an active trace stream without log or a
       pre-recorded trace stream identified by the <i>trid</i> argument.  The
       <i>posix_trace_trygetnext_event</i>() function shall report a recorded
       trace event from an active trace stream without log identified by
       the <i>trid</i> argument.

       The trace event information associated with the recorded trace
       event shall be copied by the function into the structure pointed
       to by the argument <i>event</i> and the data associated with the trace
       event shall be copied into the buffer pointed to by the <i>data</i>
       argument.

       The <i>posix_trace_getnext_event</i>() function shall block if the <i>trid</i>
       argument identifies an active trace stream and there is currently
       no trace event ready to be retrieved. When returning, if a
       recorded trace event was reported, the variable pointed to by the
       <i>unavailable</i> argument shall be set to zero. Otherwise, the
       variable pointed to by the <i>unavailable</i> argument shall be set to a
       value different from zero.

       The <i>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</i>() function shall attempt to
       get another trace event from an active trace stream without log,
       as in the <i>posix_trace_getnext_event</i>() function. However, if no
       trace event is available from the trace stream, the implied wait
       shall be terminated when the timeout specified by the argument
       <i>abstime</i> expires, and the function shall return the error
       <b>[ETIMEDOUT]</b>.

       The timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by
       <i>abstime</i> passes, as measured by the clock upon which timeouts are
       based (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds
       <i>abstime</i>), or if the absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i> has
       already passed at the time of the call.

       The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.  The
       resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of the clock on
       which it is based. The <b>timespec </b>data type is defined in the
       <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i> header.

       Under no circumstance shall the function fail with a timeout if a
       trace event is immediately available from the trace stream. The
       validity of the <i>abstime</i> argument need not be checked if a trace
       event is immediately available from the trace stream.

       The behavior of this function for a pre-recorded trace stream is
       unspecified.

       The <i>posix_trace_trygetnext_event</i>() function shall not block.
       This function shall return an error if the <i>trid</i> argument
       identifies a pre-recorded trace stream.  If a recorded trace
       event was reported, the variable pointed to by the <i>unavailable</i>
       argument shall be set to zero. Otherwise, if no trace event was
       reported, the variable pointed to by the <i>unavailable</i> argument
       shall be set to a value different from zero.

       The argument <i>num_bytes</i> shall be the size of the buffer pointed to
       by the <i>data</i> argument. The argument <i>data_len</i> reports to the
       application the length in bytes of the data record just
       transferred. If <i>num_bytes</i> is greater than or equal to the size of
       the data associated with the trace event pointed to by the <i>event</i>
       argument, all the recorded data shall be transferred. In this
       case, the <i>truncation-status</i> member of the trace event structure
       shall be either POSIX_TRACE_NOT_TRUNCATED, if the trace event
       data was recorded without truncation while tracing, or
       POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_RECORD, if the trace event data was
       truncated when it was recorded. If the <i>num_bytes</i> argument is less
       than the length of recorded trace event data, the data
       transferred shall be truncated to a length of <i>num_bytes</i>, the
       value stored in the variable pointed to by <i>data_len</i> shall be
       equal to <i>num_bytes</i>, and the <i>truncation-status</i> member of the <i>event</i>
       structure argument shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_READ
       (see the <b>posix_trace_event_info </b>structure defined in <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i>).

       The report of a trace event shall be sequential starting from the
       oldest recorded trace event. Trace events shall be reported in
       the order in which they were generated, up to an implementation-
       defined time resolution that causes the ordering of trace events
       occurring very close to each other to be unknown. Once reported,
       a trace event cannot be reported again from an active trace
       stream. Once a trace event is reported from an active trace
       stream without log, the trace stream shall make the resources
       associated with that trace event available to record future
       generated trace events.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value
       of zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error
       number.

       If successful, these functions store:

        *  The recorded trace event in the object pointed to by <i>event</i>

        *  The trace event information associated with the recorded
           trace event in the object pointed to by <i>data</i>

        *  The length of this trace event information in the object
           pointed to by <i>data_len</i>

        *  The value of zero in the object pointed to by <i>unavailable</i>
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The trace stream identifier argument <i>trid</i> is invalid.

       The <i>posix_trace_getnext_event</i>() and
       <i>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</i>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINTR  </b>The operation was interrupted by a signal, and so the call
              had no effect.

       The <i>posix_trace_trygetnext_event</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The trace stream identifier argument <i>trid</i> does not
              correspond to an active trace stream.

       The <i>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>There is no trace event immediately available from the
              trace stream, and the <i>timeout</i> argument is invalid.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              No trace event was available from the trace stream before
              the specified timeout <i>timeout</i> expired.
