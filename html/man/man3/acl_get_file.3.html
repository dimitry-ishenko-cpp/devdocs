</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>acl_get_file </b>— get an ACL by filename
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;<i>sys/types.h</i>&gt; &lt;<i>sys/acl.h</i>&gt; <i>acl_t</i> <b>acl_get_file</b>(<i>const char *path_p</i>,
       <i>acl_type_t type</i>)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>acl_get_file</b>() function retrieves the access ACL associated
       with a file or directory, or the default ACL associated with a
       directory. The pathname for the file or directory is pointed to
       by the argument <i>path_p</i>.  The ACL is placed into working storage
       and <b>acl_get_file</b>() returns a pointer to that storage.

       In order to read an ACL from an object, a process must have read
       access to the object's attributes.

       The value of the argument <i>type</i> is used to indicate whether the
       access ACL or the default ACL associated with <i>path_p</i> is returned.
       If <i>type</i> is ACL_TYPE_ACCESS, the access ACL of <i>path_p</i> is returned.
       If <i>type</i> is ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT, the default ACL of <i>path_p</i> is
       returned. If <i>type</i> is ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT and no default ACL is
       associated with the directory <i>path_p</i>, then an ACL containing zero
       ACL entries is returned. If <i>type</i> specifies a type of ACL that
       cannot be associated with <i>path_p</i>, then the function fails.

       This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller
       should free any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer
       required, by calling <i>acl_free</i>(3) with the <i>(void*)acl_t</i> returned
       by <b>acl_get_file</b>() as an argument.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, this function returns a pointer to the working
       storage.  On error, a value of <b>(acl_t)NULL </b>is returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       is set appropriately.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If any of the following conditions occur, the <b>acl_get_file</b>()
       function returns a value of <b>(acl_t)NULL </b>and sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the
       corresponding value:

       [EACCES]           Search permission is denied for a component of
                          the path prefix or the object exists and the
                          process does not have appropriate access
                          rights.

                          Argument <i>type</i> specifies a type of ACL that
                          cannot be associated with <i>path_p</i>.

       [EINVAL]           The argument <i>type</i> is not ACL_TYPE_ACCESS or
                          ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT.

       [ENAMETOOLONG]     The length of the argument <i>path_p</i> is too long.

       [ENOENT]           The named object does not exist or the
                          argument <i>path_p</i> points to an empty string.

       [ENOMEM]           The ACL working storage requires more memory
                          than is allowed by the hardware or system-
                          imposed memory management constraints.

       [ENOTDIR]          A component of the path prefix is not a
                          directory.

       [ENOTSUP]          The file system on which the file identified
                          by <i>path_p</i> is located does not support ACLs, or
                          ACLs are disabled.
