PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ctermid — generate a pathname for the controlling terminal
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       char *ctermid(char *<i>s</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ctermid</i>() function shall generate a string that, when used as
       a pathname, refers to the current controlling terminal for the
       current process. If <i>ctermid</i>() returns a pathname, access to the
       file is not guaranteed.

       The <i>ctermid</i>() function need not be thread-safe if called with a
       NULL parameter.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>s</i> is a null pointer, the string shall be generated in an area
       that may be static, the address of which shall be returned. The
       application shall not modify the string returned. The returned
       pointer might be invalidated or the string content might be
       overwritten by a subsequent call to <i>ctermid</i>().  The returned
       pointer might also be invalidated if the calling thread is
       terminated.  If <i>s</i> is not a null pointer, <i>s</i> is assumed to point to
       a character array of at least L_ctermid bytes; the string is
       placed in this array and the value of <i>s</i> shall be returned. The
       symbolic constant L_ctermid is defined in <i>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</i>, and shall
       have a value greater than 0.

       The <i>ctermid</i>() function shall return an empty string if the
       pathname that would refer to the controlling terminal cannot be
       determined, or if the function is unsuccessful.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Determining the Controlling Terminal for the Current Process</b>
       The following example returns a pointer to a string that
       identifies the controlling terminal for the current process. The
       pathname for the terminal is stored in the array pointed to by
       the <i>ptr</i> argument, which has a size of L_ctermid bytes, as
       indicated by the <i>term</i> argument.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           ...
           char term[L_ctermid];
           char *ptr;

           ptr = ctermid(term);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The difference between <i>ctermid</i>() and <i>ttyname</i>() is that <i>ttyname</i>()
       must be handed a file descriptor and return a path of the
       terminal associated with that file descriptor, while <i>ctermid</i>()
       returns a string (such as <b>"/dev/tty"</b>) that refers to the current
       controlling terminal if used as a pathname.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       L_ctermid must be defined appropriately for a given
       implementation and must be greater than zero so that array
       declarations using it are accepted by the compiler. The value
       includes the terminating null byte.

       Conforming applications that use multiple threads cannot call
       <i>ctermid</i>() with NULL as the parameter. If <i>s</i> is not NULL, the
       <i>ctermid</i>() function generates a string that, when used as a
       pathname, refers to the current controlling terminal for the
       current process. If <i>s</i> is NULL, the return value of <i>ctermid</i>() is
       undefined.

       There is no additional burden on the programmer—changing to use a
       hypothetical thread-safe version of <i>ctermid</i>() along with
       allocating a buffer is more of a burden than merely allocating a
       buffer. Application code should not assume that the returned
       string is short, as some implementations have more than two
       pathname components before reaching a logical device name.
