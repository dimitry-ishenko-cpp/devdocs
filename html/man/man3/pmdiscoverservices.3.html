CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Given a PCP service name, as identified by <i>service</i>, and using the
       type of discovery optionally specified in <i>mechanism</i>,
       <b>pmDiscoverServices </b>returns, via <i>urls</i>, a list of URLs representing
       the services discovered on the network.

       The internal function <b>__pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions </b>performs
       the same function and adds arguments for global options and a
       mechanism for interrupting the discovery process.

       The <a href="../man1/pmfind.1.html">pmfind(1)</a> utility provides command line access to both of
       these interfaces.

       Calling

       pmDiscoverServices(<i>service</i>, <i>mechanism</i>, <i>urls</i>)

       is equivalent to calling

       __pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions(<i>service</i>, <i>mechanism</i>, NULL, NULL,
       <i>urls</i>);

       <i>service</i> specifies the PCP service to be discovered.  Currently
       supported services are <b>PM_SERVER_SERVICE_SPEC </b>and
       <b>PM_SERVER_PROXY_SPEC </b>which search for <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, and <a href="../man1/pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a>
       servers respectively.

       <i>mechanism</i> specifies the style of discovery to be used.

       The currently supported mechanisms are:

       <b>avahi  </b>This searches for services which are broadcasting using
              mDNS via <b>avahi-daemon</b>(8).  An optional suffix <b>",timeout=N"</b>
              may be added to specify the discovery timeout in floating-
              point multiples of one second.  The default timeout is 0.5
              seconds, which may be overridden by the
              <b>AVAHI_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT </b>environment variable, also
              specified in floating-point multiples of one second.  If
              both are specified, then the value specified in the
              environment variable takes precedence.

       <b>probe=&lt;net-address&gt;/&lt;mask-bits&gt;</b>
              Actively probes the given subnet for the requested PCP
              service(s).  &lt;net-address&gt; is an inet or ipv6 network
              address and &lt;mask-bits&gt; is the number of bits used to
              define the subnet.  For example, 192.168.1.0/24 defines an
              8 bit subnet consisting of the addresses 192.168.1.0
              through 192.168.1.255.  An optional suffix <b>",maxThreads=N"</b>
              may be added to limit the number of threads used while
              probing.  The default is the value of __FD_SETSIZE (which
              is typically 1024) or the number of addresses in the
              subnet, whichever is less.  An optional suffix
              <b>",timeout=N" </b>may be added to specify the timeout for each
              connection attempt in floating-point multiples of one
              second.  The default is 0.02 seconds (20 milliseconds).

       <b>shell  </b>Probes the list of addresses provided by scripts for
              requested PCP service(s).  Several optional, comma-
              separated parameters can also be provided.  Firstly, the
              <b>"path=DIR" </b>option specifies the directory where commands
              like <a href="../man1/pcp-kube-pods.1.html">pcp-kube-pods(1)</a> are located (defaults to
              <i>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover/</i>).  This setting can be further
              restricted to an individual command using the <b>command=CMD</b>
              option, but the default is to use all available commands
              from the <b>path</b>.  The <b>"maxThreads=N" </b>option limits the
              number of threads used while probing.  The default is the
              value of __FD_SETSIZE (which is typically 1024) or the
              number of addresses returned by the scripts, whichever is
              less.  The <b>"timeout=N" </b>option may be added to limit the
              amount of time spent waiting for each connection attempt.
              N is a floating point number specifying the number of
              seconds to wait.  The default is 0.02 seconds (20
              milliseconds).

       <i>mechanism</i> may also be NULL, which means to use all available
       discovery mechanisms.

       For <b>__pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions, </b><i>optionsString</i> specifies
       global options to be applied to the discovery process.  Options
       are comma-separated and may be one or more of the following:

       <b>resolve</b>
              This requests that DNS name resolution be attempted for
              the addresses of any discovered services.

       <b>timeout=N</b>
              This specifies a timeout period after which the discovery
              process will be interrupted.  N is a floating point number
              representing the number of seconds before timing out.

       <i>optionsString</i> may also be NULL, which means that no global
       options are specified.

       For <b>__pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions, </b><i>flags</i> specifies a pointer to
       an object of type <i>unsigned</i> which is a bit mask of options/status
       flags for the discovery process.  The supported flags are:

       <b>PM_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_RESOLVE</b>
              Specifying this flag is equivalent to specifying <i>resolve</i>
              in the <i>optionsString</i>

       <b>PM_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_INTERRUPTED</b>
              This flag must be unset when calling
              <b>__pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions </b>but may be set
              asynchronously (by an interrupt handler, for example) in
              order to interrupt the service discovery process.

       <i>flags</i> may also be NULL, which indicates that no flags are set.

       <b>pmDiscoverServices </b>and <b>__pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions </b>will
       return the number of services discovered, else a value less than
       zero for an error.  The value zero indicates that no services
       were discovered.

       The resulting list of pointers, <i>urls</i>, <b>and </b>the values (the URLs)
       that the pointers reference will have been allocated by
       <b>pmDiscoverServices </b>or <b>__pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions </b>with a
       single call to <a href="malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>, and it is the responsibility of the
       <b>pmDiscoverServices </b>or <b>__pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions </b>caller to
       <b>free</b>(<i>urls</i>) to release the space when it is no longer required.

       When an error occurs, or no services are discovered, <i>urls</i> is
       undefined (no space will have been allocated, and so calling
       <a href="free.3.html">free(3)</a> is a singularly bad idea).
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.  Values for these variables may be obtained
       programmatically using the <a href="pmgetconfig.3.html">pmGetConfig(3)</a> function.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-EINVAL</b>
              An invalid argument has been specified.

       <b>-ENOMEM</b>
              Unable to allocate memory required to process the request.

       <b>-EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The specified <i>mechanism</i> is not supported.
