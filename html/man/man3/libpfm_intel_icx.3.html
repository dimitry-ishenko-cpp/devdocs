NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_icx - support for Intel IceLakeX core PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: icx</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel IceLakeX</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel IceLakeX core PMU. It should be
       noted that this PMU model only covers each core's PMU and not the
       socket level PMU.

       On IceLake, the number of generic counters depends on the
       Hyperthreading (HT) mode.

       The <b>pfm_get_pmu_info() </b>function returns the maximum number of
       generic counters in <b>num_cntrs.</b>
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel IceLakeX
       processors:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a counter mask modifier (m) with a value greater or equal
              to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       <b>ldlat  </b>Pass a latency threshold to the
              MEM_TRANS_RETIRED:LOAD_LATENCY event.  This is an integer
              attribute that must be in the range [1:65535]. It is
              required for this event.  Note that the event must be used
              with precise sampling (PEBS).

       <b>intx   </b>Monitor the event only when executing inside a
              transactional memory region (in tx). Event does not count
              otherwise. This is a boolean modifiers. Default value is
              0.

       <b>intxcp </b>Do not count occurrences of the event when they are inside
              an aborted transactional memory region. This is a boolean
              modifier. Default value is 0.

       <b>fe_thres</b>
              This modifier is for the FRONTEND_RETIRED event only. It
              defines the period in core cycles after which the
              IDQ_*_BUBBLES umask counts. It acts as a threshold, i.e.,
              at least a period of N core cycles where the frontend did
              not deliver X uops. It can only be used with the
              IDQ_*_BUBBLES umasks. If not specified, the default
              threshold value is 1 cycle. the valid values are in
              [1-4095].
</pre> <h2>
OFFCORE_RESPONSE events </h2>
<pre>
       Intel IceLakeX supports two encodings for offcore_response
       events. In the library, these are called OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0 and
       OFFCORE_RESPONSE_1.

       Those events need special treatment in the performance monitoring
       infrastructure because each event uses an extra register to store
       some settings. Thus, in case multiple offcore_response events are
       monitored simultaneously, the operating system needs to manage
       the sharing of that extra register.

       The offcore_response events are exposed as a normal events by the
       library. The extra settings are exposed as regular umasks. The
       library takes care of encoding the events according to the
       underlying kernel interface.

       On Intel IceLakeX unlike older processors, the event is treated
       as a regular event with a flat set of umasks to choose from.  It
       is not possible to combine the various requests, supplier, snoop
       bits anymore. Therefore the library offers the list of validated
       combinations as per Intel's official event list.
