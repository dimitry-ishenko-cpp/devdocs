       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mq_receive, mq_timedreceive — receive a message from a message
       queue (<b>REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;

       ssize_t mq_receive(mqd_t <i>mqdes</i>, char *<i>msg_ptr</i>, size_t <i>msg_len</i>,
           unsigned *<i>msg_prio</i>);

       #include &lt;mqueue.h&gt;
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       ssize_t mq_timedreceive(mqd_t <i>mqdes</i>, char *restrict <i>msg_ptr</i>,
           size_t <i>msg_len</i>, unsigned *restrict <i>msg_prio</i>,
           const struct timespec *restrict <i>abstime</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mq_receive</i>() function shall receive the oldest of the highest
       priority message(s) from the message queue specified by <i>mqdes</i>.
       If the size of the buffer in bytes, specified by the <i>msg_len</i>
       argument, is less than the <i>mq_msgsize</i> attribute of the message
       queue, the function shall fail and return an error. Otherwise,
       the selected message shall be removed from the queue and copied
       to the buffer pointed to by the <i>msg_ptr</i> argument.

       If the value of <i>msg_len</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result
       is implementation-defined.

       If the argument <i>msg_prio</i> is not NULL, the priority of the
       selected message shall be stored in the location referenced by
       <i>msg_prio</i>.

       If the specified message queue is empty and O_NONBLOCK is not set
       in the message queue description associated with <i>mqdes</i>,
       <i>mq_receive</i>() shall block until a message is enqueued on the
       message queue or until <i>mq_receive</i>() is interrupted by a signal.
       If more than one thread is waiting to receive a message when a
       message arrives at an empty queue and the Priority Scheduling
       option is supported, then the thread of highest priority that has
       been waiting the longest shall be selected to receive the
       message. Otherwise, it is unspecified which waiting thread
       receives the message. If the specified message queue is empty and
       O_NONBLOCK is set in the message queue description associated
       with <i>mqdes</i>, no message shall be removed from the queue, and
       <i>mq_receive</i>() shall return an error.

       The <i>mq_timedreceive</i>() function shall receive the oldest of the
       highest priority messages from the message queue specified by
       <i>mqdes</i> as described for the <i>mq_receive</i>() function. However, if
       O_NONBLOCK was not specified when the message queue was opened
       via the <i>mq_open</i>() function, and no message exists on the queue to
       satisfy the receive, the wait for such a message shall be
       terminated when the specified timeout expires. If O_NONBLOCK is
       set, this function is equivalent to <i>mq_receive</i>().

       The timeout expires when the absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i>
       passes, as measured by the clock on which timeouts are based
       (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds
       <i>abstime</i>), or if the absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i> has
       already been passed at the time of the call.

       The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.  The
       resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of the clock on
       which it is based. The <i>timespec</i> argument is defined in the
       <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i> header.

       Under no circumstance shall the operation fail with a timeout if
       a message can be removed from the message queue immediately. The
       validity of the <i>abstime</i> parameter need not be checked if a
       message can be removed from the message queue immediately.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>mq_receive</i>() and
       <i>mq_timedreceive</i>() functions shall return the length of the
       selected message in bytes and the message shall be removed from
       the queue. Otherwise, no message shall be removed from the queue,
       the functions shall return a value of -1, and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>O_NONBLOCK was set in the message description associated
              with <i>mqdes</i>, and the specified message queue is empty.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>mqdes</i> argument is not a valid message queue descriptor
              open for reading.

       <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              The specified message buffer size, <i>msg_len</i>, is less than
              the message size attribute of the message queue.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>mq_receive</i>() or <i>mq_timedreceive</i>() operation was
              interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The process or thread would have blocked, and the <i>abstime</i>
              parameter specified a nanoseconds field value less than
              zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The O_NONBLOCK flag was not set when the message queue was
              opened, but no message arrived on the queue before the
              specified timeout expired.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EBADMSG</b>
              The implementation has detected a data corruption problem
              with the message.
