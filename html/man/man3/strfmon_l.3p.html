NAME </h2>
<pre>
       strfmon, strfmon_l — convert monetary value to a string
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;monetary.h&gt;

       ssize_t strfmon(char *restrict <i>s</i>, size_t <i>maxsize</i>,
           const char *restrict <i>format</i>, ...);
       ssize_t strfmon_l(char *restrict <i>s</i>, size_t <i>maxsize</i>,
           locale_t <i>locale</i>, const char *restrict <i>format</i>, ...);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>strfmon</i>() function shall place characters into the array
       pointed to by <i>s</i> as controlled by the string pointed to by <i>format</i>.
       No more than <i>maxsize</i> bytes are placed into the array.

       The format is a character string, beginning and ending in its
       initial state, if any, that contains two types of objects: <i>plain</i>
       <i>characters</i>, which are simply copied to the output stream, and
       <i>conversion specifications</i>, each of which shall result in the
       fetching of zero or more arguments which are converted and
       formatted. The results are undefined if there are insufficient
       arguments for the format. If the format is exhausted while
       arguments remain, the excess arguments are simply ignored.

       The application shall ensure that a conversion specification
       consists of the following sequence:

        *  A <b>'%' </b>character

        *  Optional flags

        *  Optional field width

        *  Optional left precision

        *  Optional right precision

        *  A required conversion specifier character that determines the
           conversion to be performed

       The <i>strfmon_l</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>strfmon</i>()
       function, except that the locale data used is from the locale
       represented by <i>locale</i>.

   <b>Flags</b>
       One or more of the following optional flags can be specified to
       control the conversion:

       =<i>f</i>      An <b>'=' </b>followed by a single character <i>f</i> which is used as
               the numeric fill character. In order to work with
               precision or width counts, the fill character shall be a
               single byte character; if not, the behavior is undefined.
               The default numeric fill character is the &lt;space&gt;.  This
               flag does not affect field width filling which always
               uses the &lt;space&gt;.  This flag is ignored unless a left
               precision (see below) is specified.

       ^       Do not format the currency amount with grouping
               characters. The default is to insert the grouping
               characters if defined for the current locale.

       + or (  Specify the style of representing positive and negative
               currency amounts. Only one of <b>'+' </b>or <b>'(' </b>may be
               specified. If <b>'+' </b>is specified, the locale's equivalent
               of <b>'+' </b>and <b>'-' </b>are used (for example, in many locales,
               the empty string if positive and <b>'-' </b>if negative). If <b>'('</b>
               is specified, negative amounts are enclosed within
               parentheses. If neither flag is specified, the <b>'+' </b>style
               is used.

       !       Suppress the currency symbol from the output conversion.

       -       Specify the alignment. If this flag is present the result
               of the conversion is left-justified (padded to the right)
               rather than right-justified. This flag shall be ignored
               unless a field width (see below) is specified.

   <b>Field Width</b>
       <i>w</i>       A decimal digit string <i>w</i> specifying a minimum field width
               in bytes in which the result of the conversion is right-
               justified (or left-justified if the flag <b>'-' </b>is
               specified). The default is 0.

   <b>Left Precision</b>
       #<i>n</i>      A <b>'#' </b>followed by a decimal digit string <i>n</i> specifying a
               maximum number of digits expected to be formatted to the
               left of the radix character. This option can be used to
               keep the formatted output from multiple calls to the
               <i>strfmon</i>() function aligned in the same columns. It can
               also be used to fill unused positions with a special
               character as in <b>"$***123.45"</b>.  This option causes an
               amount to be formatted as if it has the number of digits
               specified by <i>n</i>.  If more than <i>n</i> digit positions are
               required, this conversion specification is ignored.
               Digit positions in excess of those actually required are
               filled with the numeric fill character (see the =<i>f</i> flag
               above).

               If grouping has not been suppressed with the <b>'^' </b>flag,
               and it is defined for the current locale, grouping
               separators are inserted before the fill characters (if
               any) are added. Grouping separators are not applied to
               fill characters even if the fill character is a digit.

               To ensure alignment, any characters appearing before or
               after the number in the formatted output such as currency
               or sign symbols are padded as necessary with &lt;space&gt;
               characters to make their positive and negative formats an
               equal length.

   <b>Right Precision</b>
       .<i>p</i>      A &lt;period&gt; followed by a decimal digit string <i>p</i>
               specifying the number of digits after the radix
               character. If the value of the right precision <i>p</i> is 0, no
               radix character appears. If a right precision is not
               included, a default specified by the current locale is
               used. The amount being formatted is rounded to the
               specified number of digits prior to formatting.

   <b>Conversion Specifier Characters</b>
       The conversion specifier characters and their meanings are:

       i       The <b>double </b>argument is formatted according to the
               locale's international currency format (for example, in
               the US: USD 1,234.56). If the argument is ±Inf or NaN,
               the result of the conversion is unspecified.

       n       The <b>double </b>argument is formatted according to the
               locale's national currency format (for example, in the
               US: $1,234.56). If the argument is ±Inf or NaN, the
               result of the conversion is unspecified.

       %       Convert to a <b>'%'</b>; no argument is converted. The entire
               conversion specification shall be <b>%%</b>.

   <b>Locale Information</b>
       The <i>LC_MONETARY</i> category of the current locale affects the
       behavior of this function including the monetary radix character
       (which may be different from the numeric radix character affected
       by the <i>LC_NUMERIC</i> category), the grouping separator, the currency
       symbols, and formats.  The international currency symbol should
       be conformant with the ISO 4217:2001 standard.

       If the value of <i>maxsize</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result
       is implementation-defined.

       The behavior is undefined if the <i>locale</i> argument to <i>strfmon_l</i>()
       is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid
       locale object handle.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the total number of resulting bytes including the terminating
       null byte is not more than <i>maxsize</i>, these functions shall return
       the number of bytes placed into the array pointed to by <i>s</i>, not
       including the terminating NUL character. Otherwise, -1 shall be
       returned, the contents of the array are unspecified, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       shall be set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>E2BIG  </b>Conversion stopped due to lack of space in the buffer.
