</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tdelete</i>(), <i>tfind</i>(), <i>tsearch</i>(), and <i>twalk</i>() functions
       manipulate binary search trees. Comparisons are made with a user-
       supplied routine, the address of which is passed as the <i>compar</i>
       argument. This routine is called with two arguments, which are
       the pointers to the elements being compared. The application
       shall ensure that the user-supplied routine returns an integer
       less than, equal to, or greater than 0, according to whether the
       first argument is to be considered less than, equal to, or
       greater than the second argument.  The comparison function need
       not compare every byte, so arbitrary data may be contained in the
       elements in addition to the values being compared.

       The <i>tsearch</i>() function shall build and access the tree. The <i>key</i>
       argument is a pointer to an element to be accessed or stored. If
       there is a node in the tree whose element is equal to the value
       pointed to by <i>key</i>, a pointer to this found node shall be
       returned. Otherwise, the value pointed to by <i>key</i> shall be
       inserted (that is, a new node is created and the value of <i>key</i> is
       copied to this node), and a pointer to this node returned. Only
       pointers are copied, so the application shall ensure that the
       calling routine stores the data. The <i>rootp</i> argument points to a
       variable that points to the root node of the tree. A null pointer
       value for the variable pointed to by <i>rootp</i> denotes an empty tree;
       in this case, the variable shall be set to point to the node
       which shall be at the root of the new tree.

       Like <i>tsearch</i>(), <i>tfind</i>() shall search for a node in the tree,
       returning a pointer to it if found.  However, if it is not found,
       <i>tfind</i>() shall return a null pointer. The arguments for <i>tfind</i>()
       are the same as for <i>tsearch</i>().

       The <i>tdelete</i>() function shall delete a node from a binary search
       tree. The arguments are the same as for <i>tsearch</i>().  The variable
       pointed to by <i>rootp</i> shall be changed if the deleted node was the
       root of the tree.  If the deleted node was the root of the tree
       and had no children, the variable pointed to by <i>rootp</i> shall be
       set to a null pointer. The <i>tdelete</i>() function shall return a
       pointer to the parent of the deleted node, or an unspecified non-
       null pointer if the deleted node was the root node, or a null
       pointer if the node is not found.

       If <i>tsearch</i>() adds an element to a tree, or <i>tdelete</i>() successfully
       deletes an element from a tree, the concurrent use of that tree
       in another thread, or use of pointers produced by a previous call
       to <i>tfind</i>() or <i>tsearch</i>(), produces undefined results.

       The <i>twalk</i>() function shall traverse a binary search tree. The
       <i>root</i> argument is a pointer to the root node of the tree to be
       traversed.  (Any node in a tree may be used as the root for a
       walk below that node.) The argument <i>action</i> is the name of a
       routine to be invoked at each node. This routine is, in turn,
       called with three arguments. The first argument shall be the
       address of the node being visited. The structure pointed to by
       this argument is unspecified and shall not be modified by the
       application, but it shall be possible to cast a pointer-to-node
       into a pointer-to-pointer-to-element to access the element stored
       in the node.  The second argument shall be a value from an
       enumeration data type:

           typedef enum { preorder, postorder, endorder, leaf } VISIT;

       (defined in <i>&lt;search.h&gt;</i>), depending on whether this is the first,
       second, or third time that the node is visited (during a depth-
       first, left-to-right traversal of the tree), or whether the node
       is a leaf. The third argument shall be the level of the node in
       the tree, with the root being level 0.

       If the calling function alters the pointer to the root, the
       result is undefined.

       If the functions pointed to by <i>action</i> or <i>compar</i> (for any of these
       binary search functions) change the tree, the results are
       undefined.

       These functions are thread-safe only as long as multiple threads
       do not access the same tree.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the node is found, both <i>tsearch</i>() and <i>tfind</i>() shall return a
       pointer to it. If not, <i>tfind</i>() shall return a null pointer, and
       <i>tsearch</i>() shall return a pointer to the inserted item.

       A null pointer shall be returned by <i>tsearch</i>() if there is not
       enough space available to create a new node.

       A null pointer shall be returned by <i>tdelete</i>(), <i>tfind</i>(), and
       <i>tsearch</i>() if <i>rootp</i> is a null pointer on entry.

       The <i>tdelete</i>() function shall return a pointer to the parent of
       the deleted node, or an unspecified non-null pointer if the
       deleted node was the root node, or a null pointer if the node is
       not found.

       The <i>twalk</i>() function shall not return a value.

</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>root</i> argument to <i>twalk</i>() is one level of indirection less
       than the <i>rootp</i> arguments to <i>tdelete</i>() and <i>tsearch</i>().

       There are two nomenclatures used to refer to the order in which
       tree nodes are visited. The <i>twalk</i>() function uses <b>preorder</b>,
       <b>postorder</b>, and <b>endorder </b>to refer respectively to visiting a node
       before any of its children, after its left child and before its
       right, and after both its children. The alternative nomenclature
       uses <b>preorder</b>, <b>inorder</b>, and <b>postorder </b>to refer to the same
       visits, which could result in some confusion over the meaning of
       <b>postorder</b>.

       Since the return value of <i>tdelete</i>() is an unspecified non-null
       pointer in the case that the root of the tree has been deleted,
       applications should only use the return value of <i>tdelete</i>() as
       indication of success or failure and should not assume it can be
       dereferenced. Some implementations in this case will return a
       pointer to the new root of the tree (or to an empty tree if the
       deleted root node was the only node in the tree); other
       implementations return arbitrary non-null pointers.
