<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mlockall, munlockall — lock/unlock the address space of a process
       (<b>REALTIME</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int mlockall(int <i>flags</i>);
       int munlockall(void);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mlockall</i>() function shall cause all of the pages mapped by
       the address space of a process to be memory-resident until
       unlocked or until the process exits or <i>exec</i>s another process
       image. The <i>flags</i> argument determines whether the pages to be
       locked are those currently mapped by the address space of the
       process, those that are mapped in the future, or both. The <i>flags</i>
       argument is constructed from the bitwise-inclusive OR of one or
       more of the following symbolic constants, defined in
       <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i>:

       MCL_CURRENT Lock all of the pages currently mapped into the
                   address space of the process.

       MCL_FUTURE  Lock all of the pages that become mapped into the
                   address space of the process in the future, when
                   those mappings are established.

       If MCL_FUTURE is specified, and the automatic locking of future
       mappings eventually causes the amount of locked memory to exceed
       the amount of available physical memory or any other
       implementation-defined limit, the behavior is implementation-
       defined. The manner in which the implementation informs the
       application of these situations is also implementation-defined.

       The <i>munlockall</i>() function shall unlock all currently mapped pages
       of the address space of the process. Any pages that become mapped
       into the address space of the process after a call to
       <i>munlockall</i>() shall not be locked, unless there is an intervening
       call to <i>mlockall</i>() specifying MCL_FUTURE or a subsequent call to
       <i>mlockall</i>() specifying MCL_CURRENT. If pages mapped into the
       address space of the process are also mapped into the address
       spaces of other processes and are locked by those processes, the
       locks established by the other processes shall be unaffected by a
       call by this process to <i>munlockall</i>().

       Upon successful return from the <i>mlockall</i>() function that
       specifies MCL_CURRENT, all currently mapped pages of the address
       space of the process shall be memory-resident and locked.  Upon
       return from the <i>munlockall</i>() function, all currently mapped pages
       of the address space of the process shall be unlocked with
       respect to the address space of the process.  The memory
       residency of unlocked pages is unspecified.

       Appropriate privileges are required to lock process memory with
       <i>mlockall</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>mlockall</i>() function shall return
       a value of zero. Otherwise, no additional memory shall be locked,
       and the function shall return a value of -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error. The effect of failure of <i>mlockall</i>() on
       previously existing locks in the address space is unspecified.

       If it is supported by the implementation, the <i>munlockall</i>()
       function shall always return a value of zero. Otherwise, the
       function shall return a value of -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mlockall</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>Some or all of the memory identified by the operation
              could not be locked when the call was made.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>flags</i> argument is zero, or includes unimplemented
              flags.

       The <i>mlockall</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Locking all of the pages currently mapped into the address
              space of the process would exceed an implementation-
              defined limit on the amount of memory that the process may
              lock.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The calling process does not have appropriate privileges
              to perform the requested operation.
