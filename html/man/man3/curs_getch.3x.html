DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Reading characters</b>
       The  <b>getch</b>, <b>wgetch</b>, <b>mvgetch </b>and <b>mvwgetch</b>, routines read a charac‐
       ter from the window.  In no-delay mode, if no input  is  waiting,
       the  value <b>ERR </b>is returned.  In delay mode, the program waits un‐
       til the system passes text through to the program.  Depending  on
       the setting of <b>cbreak</b>, this is after one character (cbreak mode),
       or  after the first newline (nocbreak mode).  In half-delay mode,
       the program waits until a character is  typed  or  the  specified
       timeout has been reached.

       If <b>echo </b>is enabled, and the window is not a pad, then the charac‐
       ter  will  also be echoed into the designated window according to
       the following rules:

       •   If the character is the current erase character, left arrow,
           or backspace, the cursor is moved one space to the left and
           that screen position is erased as if <b>delch </b>had been called.

       •   If the character value is any other <b>KEY_ </b>define, the user is
           alerted with a <b>beep </b>call.

       •   If the character is a carriage-return, and if <b>nl </b>is enabled,
           it is translated to a line-feed after echoing.

       •   Otherwise the character is simply output to the screen.

       If the window is not a pad, and it has been moved or modified
       since the last call to <b>wrefresh</b>, <b>wrefresh </b>will be called before
       another character is read.

   <b>Keypad mode</b>
       If <b>keypad </b>is <b>TRUE</b>, and a function key is pressed, the token for
       that function key is returned instead of the raw characters:

       •   The predefined function keys are listed in <b>&lt;curses.h&gt; </b>as
           macros with values outside the range of 8-bit characters.
           Their names begin with <b>KEY_</b>.

       •   Other (user-defined) function keys which may be defined using
           <b>define_key</b>(3X) have no names, but also are expected to have
           values outside the range of 8-bit characters.

       Thus, a variable intended to hold the return value of a function
       key must be of short size or larger.

       When a character that could be the beginning of a function key is
       received (which, on modern terminals, means an escape character),
       <b>curses </b>sets a timer.  If the remainder of the sequence does not
       come in within the designated time, the character is passed
       through; otherwise, the function key value is returned.  For this
       reason, many terminals experience a delay between the time a user
       presses the escape key and the escape is returned to the program.

       In <b>ncurses</b>, the timer normally expires after the value in <b>ESCDE‐</b>
       <b>LAY </b>(see <b>curs_variables</b>(3X)).  If <b>notimeout </b>is <b>TRUE</b>, the timer
       does not expire; it is an infinite (or very large) value.  Be‐
       cause function keys usually begin with an escape character, the
       terminal may appear to hang in notimeout mode after pressing the
       escape key until another key is pressed.

   <b>Ungetting characters</b>
       The <b>ungetch </b>routine places <i>ch</i> back onto the input queue to be re‐
       turned by the next call to <b>wgetch</b>.  There is just one input queue
       for all windows.

   <b>Predefined key-codes</b>
       The following special keys are defined in <b>&lt;curses.h&gt;</b>.

       •   Except for the special case <b>KEY_RESIZE</b>, it is necessary to
           enable <b>keypad </b>for <b>getch </b>to return these codes.

       •   Not all of these are necessarily supported on any particular
           terminal.

       •   The naming convention may seem obscure, with some apparent
           misspellings (such as “RSUME” for “resume”).  The names cor‐
           respond to the long terminfo capability names for the keys,
           and were defined long ago, in the 1980s.

       Keypad is arranged like this:
                           ┌──────┬──────┬───────┐
                           │  <b>A1  </b>│  <b>up  </b>│  <b>A3   </b>│
                           ├──────┼──────┼───────┤
                           │ <b>left </b>│  <b>B2  </b>│ <b>right </b>│
                           ├──────┼──────┼───────┤
                           │  <b>C1  </b>│ <b>down </b>│  <b>C3   </b>│
                           └──────┴──────┴───────┘

       A few of these predefined values do <i>not</i> correspond to a real key:

       •   <b>KEY_RESIZE </b>is returned when the <b>SIGWINCH </b>signal has been de‐
           tected (see <b>initscr</b>(3X) and <b>resizeterm</b>(3X)).  This code is
           returned whether or not <b>keypad </b>has been enabled.

       •   <b>KEY_MOUSE </b>is returned for mouse-events (see <b>curs_mouse</b>(3X)).
           This code relies upon whether or not <b>keypad</b>(3X) has been en‐
           abled, because (e.g., with <b>xterm</b>(1) mouse prototocol) ncurses
           must read escape sequences, just like a function key.

   <b>Testing key-codes</b>
       The <b>has_key </b>routine takes a key-code value from the above list,
       and returns <b>TRUE </b>or <b>FALSE </b>according to whether the current termi‐
       nal type recognizes a key with that value.

       The library also supports these extensions:

          <b>define_key</b>
               defines a key-code for a given string (see <b>de‐</b>
               <b>fine_key</b>(3X)).

          <b>key_defined</b>
               checks if there is a key-code defined for a given string
               (see <b>key_defined</b>(3X)).
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       All routines return the integer <b>ERR </b>upon failure and an integer
       value other than <b>ERR </b>(<b>OK </b>in the case of <b>ungetch</b>) upon successful
       completion.

          <b>ungetch</b>
               returns <b>ERR </b>if there is no more room in the FIFO.

          <b>wgetch</b>
               returns <b>ERR </b>if the window pointer is null, or if its
               timeout expires without having any data, or if the execu‐
               tion was interrupted by a signal (<b>errno </b>will be set to
               <b>EINTR</b>).

       Functions with a “mv” prefix first perform a cursor movement us‐
       ing <b>wmove</b>, and return an error if the position is outside the
       window, or if the window pointer is null.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Use of the escape key by a programmer for a single character
       function is discouraged, as it will cause a delay of up to one
       second while the keypad code looks for a following function-key
       sequence.

       Some keys may be the same as commonly used control keys, e.g.,
       <b>KEY_ENTER </b>versus control/M, <b>KEY_BACKSPACE </b>versus control/H.  Some
       curses implementations may differ according to whether they treat
       these control keys specially (and ignore the terminfo), or use
       the terminfo definitions.  <b>Ncurses </b>uses the terminfo definition.
       If it says that <b>KEY_ENTER </b>is control/M, <b>getch </b>will return <b>KEY_EN‐</b>
       <b>TER </b>when you press control/M.

       Generally, <b>KEY_ENTER </b>denotes the character(s) sent by the <i>Enter</i>
       key on the numeric keypad:

       •   the terminal description lists the most useful keys,

       •   the <i>Enter</i> key on the regular keyboard is already handled by
           the standard ASCII characters for carriage-return and line-
           feed,

       •   depending on whether <b>nl </b>or <b>nonl </b>was called, pressing “Enter”
           on the regular keyboard may return either a carriage-return
           or line-feed, and finally

       •   “Enter or send” is the standard description for this key.

       When using <b>getch</b>, <b>wgetch</b>, <b>mvgetch</b>, or <b>mvwgetch</b>, nocbreak mode
       (<b>nocbreak</b>) and echo mode (<b>echo</b>) should not be used at the same
       time.  Depending on the state of the tty driver when each charac‐
       ter is typed, the program may produce undesirable results.

       Note that <b>getch</b>, <b>mvgetch</b>, and <b>mvwgetch </b>may be macros.

       Historically, the set of keypad macros was largely defined by the
       extremely function-key-rich keyboard of the AT&amp;T 7300, aka 3B1,
       aka Safari 4.  Modern personal computers usually have only a
       small subset of these.  IBM PC-style consoles typically support
       little more than <b>KEY_UP</b>, <b>KEY_DOWN</b>, <b>KEY_LEFT</b>, <b>KEY_RIGHT</b>, <b>KEY_HOME</b>,
       <b>KEY_END</b>, <b>KEY_NPAGE</b>, <b>KEY_PPAGE</b>, and function keys 1 through 12.
       The Ins key is usually mapped to <b>KEY_IC</b>.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       The *get* functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Is‐
       sue 4.  They read single-byte characters only.  The standard
       specifies that they return <b>ERR </b>on failure, but specifies no error
       conditions.

       The echo behavior of these functions on input of <b>KEY_ </b>or back‐
       space characters was not specified in the SVr4 documentation.
       This description is adopted from the XSI Curses standard.

       The behavior of <b>getch </b>and friends in the presence of handled sig‐
       nals is unspecified in the SVr4 and XSI Curses documentation.
       Under historical curses implementations, it varied depending on
       whether the operating system's implementation of handled signal
       receipt interrupts a <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> call in progress or not, and also
       (in some implementations) depending on whether an input timeout
       or non-blocking mode has been set.

       <b>KEY_MOUSE </b>is mentioned in XSI Curses, along with a few related
       terminfo capabilities, but no higher-level functions use the fea‐
       ture.  The implementation in ncurses is an extension.

       <b>KEY_RESIZE </b>is an extension first implemented for ncurses.  NetBSD
       curses later added this extension.

       Programmers concerned about portability should be prepared for
       either of two cases: (a) signal receipt does not interrupt <b>getch</b>;
       (b) signal receipt interrupts <b>getch </b>and causes it to return <b>ERR</b>
       with <b>errno </b>set to <b>EINTR</b>.

       The <b>has_key </b>function is unique to <b>ncurses</b>.  We recommend that any
       code using it be conditionalized on the <b>NCURSES_VERSION </b>feature
       macro.
