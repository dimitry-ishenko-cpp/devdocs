NAME </h2>
<pre>
       keyctl_search - search a keyring for a key
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;keyutils.h&gt;</b>

       <b>long keyctl_search(key_serial_t </b><i>keyring</i><b>, const char *</b><i>type</i><b>,</b>
       <b>const char *</b><i>description</i><b>, key_serial_t </b><i>destination</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>keyctl_search</b>() recursively searches the <i>keyring</i> for a key of the
       specified <i>type</i> and <i>description</i>.

       If found, the key will be attached to the <i>destination</i> keyring (if
       given), and its serial number will be returned.

       The source keyring must grant <b>search </b>permission to the caller,
       and for a key to be found, it must also grant <b>search </b>permission
       to the caller.  Child keyrings will be only be recursively
       searched if they grant <b>search </b>permission to the caller as well.

       If the destination keyring is <b>zero</b>, no attempt will be made to
       forge a link to the key, and just the serial number will be
       returned.

       If the destination keyring is given, then the link may only be
       formed if the found key grants the caller <b>link </b>permission and the
       destination keyring grants the caller <b>write </b>permission.

       If the search is successful, and if the destination keyring
       already contains a link to a key that matches the specified <i>type</i>
       and <i>description</i>, then that link will be replaced by a link to the
       found key.

       The source keyring and destination keyring serial numbers may be
       those of valid keyrings to which the caller has appropriate
       permission, or they may be special keyring IDs:

       <b>KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING</b>
              This specifies the caller's thread-specific keyring.

       <b>KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING</b>
              This specifies the caller's process-specific keyring.

       <b>KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING</b>
              This specifies the caller's session-specific keyring.

       <b>KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING</b>
              This specifies the caller's UID-specific keyring.

       <b>KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING</b>
              This specifies the caller's UID-session keyring.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success <b>keyctl_search</b>() returns the serial number of the key
       it found.  On error, the value <b>-1 </b>will be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> will
       have been set to an appropriate error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ENOKEY </b>One of the keyrings doesn't exist, no key was found by the
              search, or the only key found by the search was a negative
              key.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              One of the keyrings is a valid key that isn't a keyring.

       <b>EKEYEXPIRED</b>
              One of the keyrings has expired, or the only key found was
              expired.

       <b>EKEYREVOKED</b>
              One of the keyrings has been revoked, or the only key
              found was revoked.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory to expand the destination keyring.

       <b>EDQUOT </b>The key quota for this user would be exceeded by creating
              a link to the found key in the destination keyring.

       <b>EACCES </b>The source keyring didn't grant <b>search </b>permission, the
              destination keyring didn't grant <b>write </b>permission or the
              found key didn't grant <b>link </b>permission to the caller.
</pre> <h2>
LINKING </h2>
<pre>
       Although this is a Linux system call, it is not present in <i>libc</i>
       but can be found rather in <i>libkeyutils</i>.  When linking, <b>-lkeyutils</b>
       should be specified to the linker.
