NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_snbep_unc_pcu - support for Intel Sandy Bridge-EP
       Power Controller Unit (PCU) uncore PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: snbep_unc_pcu</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Sandy Bridge-EP PCU uncore PMU</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Sandy Bridge Power Controller Unit
       uncore PMU.  This PMU model only exists on Sandy Bridge model 45.
       There is only one PCU PMU per processor socket.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Sandy Bridge C-Box
       uncore PMU:

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count HA cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This
              is a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a threshold modifier (t) with a value greater or equal to
              one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t      </b>Set the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the
              counter counts the number of HA cycles in which the number
              of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to the
              threshold.  This is an integer modifier with values in the
              range [0:15].

       <b>ff     </b>Enable frequency band filtering. This modifier applies
              only to the UNC_P_FREQ_BANDx_CYCLES events, where x is
              [0-3].  The modifiers expects an integer in the range
              [0-255]. The value is interpreted as a frequency value to
              be multiplied by 100Mhz. Thus if the value is 32, then all
              cycles where the processor is running at 3.2GHz and more
              are counted.
</pre> <h2>
Frequency band filtering </h2>
<pre>
       There are 3 events which support frequency band filtering,
       namely, UNC_P_FREQ_BAND0_CYCLES, UNC_P_FREQ_BAND1_CYCLES,
       UNC_P_FREQ_BAND2_CYCLES, UNC_P_FREQ_BAND3_CYCLES. The frequency
       filter (available via the ff modifier) is stored into a PMU
       shared register which hold all 4 possible frequency bands, one
       per event. However, the library generate the encoding for each
       event individually because it processes events one at a time. The
       caller or the underlying kernel interface may have to merge the
       band filter settings to program the filter register properly.
