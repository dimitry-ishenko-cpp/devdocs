DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>newwin</b>
       Calling <b>newwin </b>creates and returns a pointer to a new window with
       the  given number of lines and columns.  The upper left-hand cor‐
       ner of the window is at
              line <i>begin</i>_<i>y</i>,
              column <i>begin</i>_<i>x</i>

       If either <i>nlines</i> or <i>ncols</i> is zero, they default to
              <b>LINES - </b><i>begin</i>_<i>y</i> and
              <b>COLS - </b><i>begin</i>_<i>x</i>.

       A new full-screen window is created by calling <b>newwin(0,0,0,0)</b>.

       Regardless of the function used for creating a new window  (e.g.,
       <b>newwin</b>,  <b>subwin</b>,  <b>derwin</b>,  <b>newpad</b>), rather than a duplicate (with
       <b>dupwin</b>), all of the window modes are initialized to  the  default
       values.   These functions set window modes after a window is cre‐
       ated:

              idcok, idlok, immedok, keypad, leaveok, nodelay, scrollok,
              setscrreg, syncok, wbkgdset, wbkgrndset, and wtimeout

   <b>delwin</b>
       Calling <b>delwin </b>deletes the named window, freeing all memory asso‐
       ciated with it (it does not actually erase  the  window's  screen
       image).  Subwindows must be deleted before the main window can be
       deleted.

   <b>mvwin</b>
       Calling <b>mvwin </b>moves the window so that the upper left-hand corner
       is  at position (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>).  If the move would cause the window to be
       off the screen, it is an error and the window is not moved.  Mov‐
       ing subwindows is allowed, but should be avoided.

   <b>subwin</b>
       Calling <b>subwin </b>creates and returns a pointer to a new window with
       the given number of lines, <i>nlines</i>, and columns, <i>ncols</i>.  The  win‐
       dow is at position (<i>begin</i>_<i>y</i>, <i>begin</i>_<i>x</i>) on the screen.  The subwin‐
       dow  shares  memory with the window <i>orig</i>, so that changes made to
       one window will affect both windows.  When using this routine, it
       is necessary to call <b>touchwin </b>or <b>touchline </b>on <i>orig</i> before calling
       <b>wrefresh </b>on the subwindow.

   <b>derwin</b>
       Calling <b>derwin </b>is the same as calling <b>subwin, </b>except that <i>begin</i>_<i>y</i>
       and <i>begin</i>_<i>x</i> are relative to the origin of the window <i>orig</i>  rather
       than  the  screen.  There is no difference between the subwindows
       and the derived windows.

       Calling <b>mvderwin </b>moves a derived window (or subwindow) inside its
       parent window.  The screen-relative parameters of the window  are
       not  changed.  This routine is used to display different parts of
       the parent window at the same physical position on the screen.

   <b>dupwin</b>
       Calling <b>dupwin </b>creates an exact duplicate of the window <i>win</i>.

   <b>wsyncup</b>
       Calling <b>wsyncup </b>touches all locations in ancestors  of  <i>win</i>  that
       are  changed  in  <i>win</i>.   If <b>syncok </b>is called with second argument
       <b>TRUE </b>then <b>wsyncup </b>is called automatically  whenever  there  is  a
       change in the window.

   <b>wsyncdown</b>
       The  <b>wsyncdown </b>routine touches each location in <i>win</i> that has been
       touched in any of its ancestor windows.  This routine  is  called
       by  <b>wrefresh</b>,  so  it should almost never be necessary to call it
       manually.

   <b>wcursyncup</b>
       The routine <b>wcursyncup </b>updates the current cursor position of all
       the ancestors of the window to reflect the current  cursor  posi‐
       tion of the window.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Routines that return an integer return the integer <b>ERR </b>upon fail‐
       ure  and  <b>OK  </b>(SVr4  only  specifies "an integer value other than
       <b>ERR</b>") upon successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return <b>NULL </b>on error.

       X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation

       <b>delwin</b>
            returns an error if the window pointer is null, or if the
            window is the parent of another window.

       <b>derwin</b>
            returns an error if the parent window pointer is null, or if
            any of its ordinates or dimensions is negative, or if the
            resulting window does not fit inside the parent window.

       <b>dupwin</b>
            returns an error if the window pointer is null.

            This implementation also maintains a list of windows, and
            checks that the pointer passed to <b>delwin </b>is one that it cre‐
            ated, returning an error if it was not..

       <b>mvderwin</b>
            returns an error if the window pointer is null, or if some
            part of the window would be placed off-screen.

       <b>mvwin</b>
            returns an error if the window pointer is null, or if the
            window is really a pad, or if some part of the window would
            be placed off-screen.

       <b>newwin</b>
            will fail if either of its beginning ordinates is negative,
            or if either the number of lines or columns is negative.

       <b>syncok</b>
            returns an error if the window pointer is null.

       <b>subwin</b>
            returns an error if the parent window pointer is null, or if
            any of its ordinates or dimensions is negative, or if the
            resulting window does not fit inside the parent window.

       The functions which return a window pointer may also fail if
       there is insufficient memory for its data structures.  Any of
       these functions will fail if the screen has not been initialized,
       i.e., with <b>initscr </b>or <b>newterm</b>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       If many small changes are made to the window, the <b>wsyncup </b>option
       could degrade performance.

       Note that <b>syncok </b>may be a macro.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The subwindow functions (<b>subwin</b>, <b>derwin</b>, <b>mvderwin</b>, <b>wsyncup</b>,
       <b>wsyncdown</b>, <b>wcursyncup</b>, <b>syncok</b>) are flaky, incompletely implement‐
       ed, and not well tested.

       The System V curses documentation is very unclear about what
       <b>wsyncup </b>and <b>wsyncdown </b>actually do.  It seems to imply that they
       are only supposed to touch exactly those lines that are affected
       by ancestor changes.  The language here, and the behavior of the
       <b>curses </b>implementation, is patterned on the XPG4 curses standard.
       The weaker XPG4 spec may result in slower updates.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.

       X/Open Curses states regarding <b>delwin</b>:

       •   It must delete subwindows before deleting their parent.

       •   If <b>delwin </b>is asked to delete a parent window, it can only
           succeed if the curses library keeps a list of the subwindows.
           SVr4 curses kept a count of the number of subwindows rather
           than a list.  It simply returned <b>ERR </b>when asked to delete a
           subwindow.  Solaris X/Open curses does not even make that
           check, and will delete a parent window which still has sub‐
           windows.

       •   Since release 4.0 (1996), ncurses maintains a list of windows
           for each screen, to ensure that a window has no subwindows
           before allowing deletion.

       •   NetBSD copied this feature of ncurses in 2003.
           PDCurses follows the scheme used in Solaris X/Open curses.
