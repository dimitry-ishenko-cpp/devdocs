PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       atol, atoll — convert a string to a long integer
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       long atol(const char *<i>nptr</i>);
       long long atoll(const char *<i>nptr</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       Except as noted below, the call <i>atol</i>(<i>nptr</i>) shall be equivalent
       to:

           strtol(nptr, (char **)NULL, 10)

       Except as noted below, the call to <i>atoll</i>(<i>nptr</i>) shall be
       equivalent to:

           strtoll(nptr, (char **)NULL, 10)

       The handling of errors may differ. If the value cannot be
       represented, the behavior is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall return the converted value if the value can
       be represented.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the number is not known to be in range, <i>strtol</i>() or <i>strtoll</i>()
       should be used because <i>atol</i>() and <i>atoll</i>() are not required to
       perform any error checking.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
