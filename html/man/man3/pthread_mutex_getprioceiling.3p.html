<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_mutex_getprioceiling, pthread_mutex_setprioceiling — get
       and set the priority ceiling of a mutex (<b>REALTIME THREADS</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_mutex_getprioceiling(const pthread_mutex_t *restrict <i>mutex</i>,
           int *restrict <i>prioceiling</i>);
       int pthread_mutex_setprioceiling(pthread_mutex_t *restrict <i>mutex</i>,
           int <i>prioceiling</i>, int *restrict <i>old_ceiling</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_mutex_getprioceiling</i>() function shall return the
       current priority ceiling of the mutex.

       The <i>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</i>() function shall attempt to lock
       the mutex as if by a call to <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>(), except that
       the process of locking the mutex need not adhere to the priority
       protect protocol. On acquiring the mutex it shall change the
       mutex's priority ceiling and then release the mutex as if by a
       call to <i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>().  When the change is successful,
       the previous value of the priority ceiling shall be returned in
       <i>old_ceiling</i>.

       If the <i>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</i>() function fails, the mutex
       priority ceiling shall not be changed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_mutex_getprioceiling</i>() and
       <i>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</i>() functions shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The protocol attribute of <i>mutex</i> is PTHREAD_PRIO_NONE.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The implementation requires appropriate privileges to
              perform the operation and the caller does not have
              appropriate privileges.

       The <i>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The mutex could not be acquired because the maximum number
              of recursive locks for <i>mutex</i> has been exceeded.

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              The mutex type is PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK and the current
              thread already owns the mutex.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The mutex was created with the protocol attribute having
              the value PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT and the calling thread's
              priority is higher than the mutex's current priority
              ceiling, and the implementation adheres to the priority
              protect protocol in the process of locking the mutex.

       <b>ENOTRECOVERABLE</b>
              The mutex is a robust mutex and the state protected by the
              mutex is not recoverable.

       <b>EOWNERDEAD</b>
              The mutex is a robust mutex and the process containing the
              previous owning thread terminated while holding the mutex
              lock. The mutex lock shall be acquired by the calling
              thread and it is up to the new owner to make the state
              consistent (see <a href="pthread_mutex_lock.3p.html">pthread_mutex_lock(3p)</a>).

       The <i>pthread_mutex_setprioceiling</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock condition was detected.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The priority requested by <i>prioceiling</i> is out of range.

       <b>EOWNERDEAD</b>
              The mutex is a robust mutex and the previous owning thread
              terminated while holding the mutex lock. The mutex lock
              shall be acquired by the calling thread and it is up to
              the new owner to make the state consistent (see
              <a href="pthread_mutex_lock.3p.html">pthread_mutex_lock(3p)</a>).

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.
