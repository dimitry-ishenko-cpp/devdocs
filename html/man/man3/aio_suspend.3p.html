PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       aio_suspend — wait for an asynchronous I/O request
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;aio.h&gt;

       int aio_suspend(const struct aiocb *const <i>list</i>[], int <i>nent</i>,
           const struct timespec *<i>timeout</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_suspend</i>() function shall suspend the calling thread until
       at least one of the asynchronous I/O operations referenced by the
       <i>list</i> argument has completed, until a signal interrupts the
       function, or, if <i>timeout</i> is not NULL, until the time interval
       specified by <i>timeout</i> has passed. If any of the <b>aiocb </b>structures
       in the list correspond to completed asynchronous I/O operations
       (that is, the error status for the operation is not equal to
       <b>[EINPROGRESS]</b>) at the time of the call, the function shall return
       without suspending the calling thread. The <i>list</i> argument is an
       array of pointers to asynchronous I/O control blocks.  The <i>nent</i>
       argument indicates the number of elements in the array. Each
       <b>aiocb </b>structure pointed to has been used in initiating an
       asynchronous I/O request via <i>aio_read</i>(), <i>aio_write</i>(), or
       <i>lio_listio</i>().  This array may contain null pointers, which are
       ignored. If this array contains pointers that refer to <b>aiocb</b>
       structures that have not been used in submitting asynchronous
       I/O, the effect is undefined.

       If the time interval indicated in the <b>timespec </b>structure pointed
       to by <i>timeout</i> passes before any of the I/O operations referenced
       by <i>list</i> are completed, then <i>aio_suspend</i>() shall return with an
       error.  If the Monotonic Clock option is supported, the clock
       that shall be used to measure this time interval shall be the
       CLOCK_MONOTONIC clock.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the <i>aio_suspend</i>() function returns after one or more
       asynchronous I/O operations have completed, the function shall
       return zero. Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1
       and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.

       The application may determine which asynchronous I/O completed by
       scanning the associated error and return status using <i>aio_error</i>()
       and <i>aio_return</i>(), respectively.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_suspend</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>No asynchronous I/O indicated in the list referenced by
              <i>list</i> completed in the time interval indicated by <i>timeout</i>.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal interrupted the <i>aio_suspend</i>() function. Note
              that, since each asynchronous I/O operation may possibly
              provoke a signal when it completes, this error return may
              be caused by the completion of one (or more) of the very
              I/O operations being awaited.
