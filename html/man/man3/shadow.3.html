NAME </h2>

       shadow, getspnam - encrypted password file routines

SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
       <i>#include &lt;shadow.h&gt;</i>

       <i>struct spwd *getspent();</i>

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>shadow</i> manipulates the contents of the shadow password file,
       /etc/shadow. The structure in the <i>#include</i> file is:

           struct spwd {
                 char      *sp_namp; /* user login name */
                 char      *sp_pwdp; /* encrypted password */
                 long int       sp_lstchg; /* last password change */
                 long int       sp_min; /* days until change allowed. */
                 long int       sp_max; /* days before change required */
                 long int       sp_warn; /* days warning for expiration */
                 long int       sp_inact; /* days before account inactive */
                 long int       sp_expire; /* date when account expires */
                 unsigned long int   sp_flag; /* reserved for future use */
           }

       The meanings of each field are:

       •   sp_namp - pointer to null-terminated user name

       •   sp_pwdp - pointer to null-terminated password

       •   sp_lstchg - days since Jan 1, 1970 password was last changed

       •   sp_min - days before which password may not be changed

       •   sp_max - days after which password must be changed

       •   sp_warn - days before password is to expire that user is
           warned of pending password expiration

       •   sp_inact - days after password expires that account is
           considered inactive and disabled

       •   sp_expire - days since Jan 1, 1970 when account will be
           disabled

       •   sp_flag - reserved for future use
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>getspent</i>, <i>getspname</i>, <i>fgetspent</i>, and <i>sgetspent</i> each return a
       pointer to a <i>struct spwd</i>.  <i>getspent</i> returns the next entry from
       the file, and <i>fgetspent</i> returns the next entry from the given
       stream, which is assumed to be a file of the proper format.
       <i>sgetspent</i> returns a pointer to a <i>struct spwd</i> using the provided
       string as input.  <i>getspnam</i> searches from the current position in
       the file for an entry matching <i>name</i>.

       <i>setspent</i> and <i>endspent</i> may be used to begin and end, respectively,
       access to the shadow password file.

       The <i>lckpwdf</i> and <i>ulckpwdf</i> routines should be used to insure
       exclusive access to the /etc/shadow file.  <i>lckpwdf</i> attempts to
       acquire a lock using <i>pw_lock</i> for up to 15 seconds. It continues
       by attempting to acquire a second lock using <i>spw_lock</i> for the
       remainder of the initial 15 seconds. Should either attempt fail
       after a total of 15 seconds, <i>lckpwdf</i> returns -1. When both locks
       are acquired 0 is returned.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       Routines return NULL if no more entries are available or if an
       error occurs during processing. Routines which have <i>int</i> as the
       return value return 0 for success and -1 for failure.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       These routines may only be used by the superuser as access to the
       shadow password file is restricted.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/shadow
           Secure user account information.
