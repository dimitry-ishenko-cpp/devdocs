NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mkdir, mkdirat — make a directory
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

       int mkdir(const char *<i>path</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int mkdirat(int <i>fd</i>, const char *<i>path</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mkdir</i>() function shall create a new directory with name <i>path</i>.
       The file permission bits of the new directory shall be
       initialized from <i>mode</i>.  These file permission bits of the <i>mode</i>
       argument shall be modified by the process' file creation mask.

       When bits in <i>mode</i> other than the file permission bits are set,
       the meaning of these additional bits is implementation-defined.

       The directory's user ID shall be set to the process' effective
       user ID.  The directory's group ID shall be set to the group ID
       of the parent directory or to the effective group ID of the
       process. Implementations shall provide a way to initialize the
       directory's group ID to the group ID of the parent directory.
       Implementations may, but need not, provide an implementation-
       defined way to initialize the directory's group ID to the
       effective group ID of the calling process.

       The newly created directory shall be an empty directory.

       If <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, <i>mkdir</i>() shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       to <b>[EEXIST]</b>.

       Upon successful completion, <i>mkdir</i>() shall mark for update the
       last data access, last data modification, and last file status
       change timestamps of the directory. Also, the last data
       modification and last file status change timestamps of the
       directory that contains the new entry shall be marked for update.

       The <i>mkdirat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>mkdir</i>()
       function except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a relative path.
       In this case the newly created directory is created relative to
       the directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of
       the current working directory. If the access mode of the open
       file description associated with the file descriptor is not
       O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory searches are
       permitted using the current permissions of the directory
       underlying the file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH,
       the function shall not perform the check.

       If <i>mkdirat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to <i>mkdir</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
       Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error. If -1 is returned, no directory shall be
       created.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix, or write permission is denied on the parent
              directory of the directory to be created.

       <b>EEXIST </b>The named file exists.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>EMLINK </b>The link count of the parent directory would exceed
              {LINK_MAX}.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of the path prefix specified by <i>path</i> does not
              name an existing directory or <i>path</i> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The file system does not contain enough space to hold the
              contents of the new directory or to extend the parent
              directory of the new directory.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The parent directory resides on a read-only file system.

       In addition, the <i>mkdirat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd</i> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path</i> argument does not specify an absolute path and
              the <i>fd</i> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
              descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument is not an absolute path and <i>fd</i> is a file
              descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Creating a Directory</b>
       The following example shows how to create a directory named
       <b>/home/cnd/mod1</b>, with read/write/search permissions for owner and
       group, and with read/search permissions for others.

           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

           int status;
           ...
           status = mkdir("/home/cnd/mod1", S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IROTH | S_IXOTH);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mkdir</i>() function originated in 4.2 BSD and was added to
       System V in Release 3.0.

       4.3 BSD detects <b>[ENAMETOOLONG]</b>.

       The POSIX.1‐1990 standard required that the group ID of a newly
       created directory be set to the group ID of its parent directory
       or to the effective group ID of the creating process. FIPS 151‐2
       required that implementations provide a way to have the group ID
       be set to the group ID of the containing directory, but did not
       prohibit implementations also supporting a way to set the group
       ID to the effective group ID of the creating process.  Conforming
       applications should not assume which group ID will be used. If it
       matters, an application can use <i>chown</i>() to set the group ID after
       the directory is created, or determine under what conditions the
       implementation will set the desired group ID.

       The purpose of the <i>mkdirat</i>() function is to create a directory in
       directories other than the current working directory without
       exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could
       be changed in parallel to the call to <i>mkdir</i>(), resulting in
       unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for the target
       directory and using the <i>mkdirat</i>() function it can be guaranteed
       that the newly created directory is located relative to the
       desired directory.
