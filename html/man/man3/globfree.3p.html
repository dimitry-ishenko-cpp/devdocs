SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;glob.h&gt;

       int glob(const char *restrict <i>pattern</i>, int <i>flags</i>,
           int(*<i>errfunc</i>)(const char *<i>epath</i>, int <i>eerrno</i>),

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>glob</i>() function is a pathname generator that shall implement
       the rules defined in the Shell and Utilities volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Pattern Matching Notation</i>, with
       optional support for rule 3 in the Shell and Utilities volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.13.3</i>, <i>Patterns Used for Filename</i>
       <i>Expansion</i>.

       The structure type <b>glob_t </b>is defined in <i>&lt;glob.h&gt;</i> and includes at
       least the following members:
  ┌───────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ <b>Member Type   </b>│ <b>Member Name  </b>│               <b>Description               </b>│
  ├───────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ <b>size_t        </b>│<i>gl_pathc</i>      │ Count of paths matched by <i>pattern</i>.      │
  │ <b>char **       </b>│<i>gl_pathv</i>      │ Pointer to a list of matched pathnames. │
  │ <b>size_t        </b>│<i>gl_offs</i>       │ Slots to reserve at the beginning of    │
  │               │              │ <i>gl_pathv</i>.                               │
  └───────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────┘

       The argument <i>pattern</i> is a pointer to a pathname pattern to be
       expanded. The <i>glob</i>() function shall match all accessible
       pathnames against this pattern and develop a list of all
       pathnames that match. In order to have access to a pathname,
       <i>glob</i>() requires search permission on every component of a path
       except the last, and read permission on each directory of any
       filename component of <i>pattern</i> that contains any of the following
       special characters: <b>'*'</b>, <b>'?'</b>, and <b>'['</b>.

       The <i>glob</i>() function shall store the number of matched pathnames
       into <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathc</i> and a pointer to a list of pointers to
       pathnames into <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathv</i>. The pathnames shall be in sort
       order as defined by the current setting of the <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
       category; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       <i>Section 7.3.2</i>, <i>LC_COLLATE</i>.  The first pointer after the last
       pathname shall be a null pointer. If the pattern does not match
       any pathnames, the returned number of matched paths is set to 0,
       and the contents of <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathv</i> are implementation-defined.

       It is the caller's responsibility to create the structure pointed
       to by <i>pglob</i>.  The <i>glob</i>() function shall allocate other space as
       needed, including the memory pointed to by <i>gl_pathv</i>.  The
       <i>globfree</i>() function shall free any space associated with <i>pglob</i>
       from a previous call to <i>glob</i>().

       The <i>flags</i> argument is used to control the behavior of <i>glob</i>().
       The value of <i>flags</i> is a bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of
       the following constants, which are defined in <i>&lt;glob.h&gt;</i>:

       GLOB_APPEND   Append pathnames generated to the ones from a
                     previous call to <i>glob</i>().

       GLOB_DOOFFS   Make use of <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_offs</i>. If this flag is set,
                     <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_offs</i> is used to specify how many null
                     pointers to add to the beginning of
                     <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathv</i>. In other words, <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathv</i>
                     shall point to <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_offs</i> null pointers,
                     followed by <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathc</i> pathname pointers,
                     followed by a null pointer.

       GLOB_ERR      Cause <i>glob</i>() to return when it encounters a
                     directory that it cannot open or read.  Ordinarily,
                     <i>glob</i>() continues to find matches.

       GLOB_MARK     Each pathname that is a directory that matches
                     <i>pattern</i> shall have a &lt;slash&gt; appended.

       GLOB_NOCHECK  Supports rule 3 in the Shell and Utilities volume
                     of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 2.13.3</i>, <i>Patterns Used for</i>
                     <i>Filename Expansion</i>.  If <i>pattern</i> does not match any
                     pathname, then <i>glob</i>() shall return a list
                     consisting of only <i>pattern</i>, and the number of
                     matched pathnames is 1.

       GLOB_NOESCAPE Disable backslash escaping.

       GLOB_NOSORT   Ordinarily, <i>glob</i>() sorts the matching pathnames
                     according to the current setting of the <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                     category; see the Base Definitions volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 7.3.2</i>, <i>LC_COLLATE</i>.  When this
                     flag is used, the order of pathnames returned is
                     unspecified.

       The GLOB_APPEND flag can be used to append a new set of pathnames
       to those found in a previous call to <i>glob</i>().  The following rules
       apply to applications when two or more calls to <i>glob</i>() are made
       with the same value of <i>pglob</i> and without intervening calls to
       <i>globfree</i>():

        1. The first such call shall not set GLOB_APPEND. All subsequent
           calls shall set it.

        2. All the calls shall set GLOB_DOOFFS, or all shall not set it.

        3. After the second call, <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathv</i> points to a list
           containing the following:

            a. Zero or more null pointers, as specified by GLOB_DOOFFS
               and <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_offs</i>.

            b. Pointers to the pathnames that were in the
               <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathv</i> list before the call, in the same order
               as before.

            c. Pointers to the new pathnames generated by the second
               call, in the specified order.

        4. The count returned in <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathc</i> shall be the total
           number of pathnames from the two calls.

        5. The application can change any of the fields after a call to
           <i>glob</i>().  If it does, the application shall reset them to the
           original value before a subsequent call, using the same <i>pglob</i>
           value, to <i>globfree</i>() or <i>glob</i>() with the GLOB_APPEND flag.

       If, during the search, a directory is encountered that cannot be
       opened or read and <i>errfunc</i> is not a null pointer, <i>glob</i>() calls
       <i>(</i>()*errfunc ) with two arguments:

        1. The <i>epath</i> argument is a pointer to the path that failed.

        2. The <i>eerrno</i> argument is the value of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> from the failure,
           as set by <i>opendir</i>(), <i>readdir</i>(), or <i>stat</i>().  (Other values may
           be used to report other errors not explicitly documented for
           those functions.)

       If <i>(</i>()*errfunc ) is called and returns non-zero, or if the
       GLOB_ERR flag is set in <i>flags</i>, <i>glob</i>() shall stop the scan and
       return GLOB_ABORTED after setting <i>gl_pathc</i> and <i>gl_pathv</i> in <i>pglob</i>
       to reflect the paths already scanned. If GLOB_ERR is not set and
       either <i>errfunc</i> is a null pointer or <i>(</i>()*errfunc ) returns 0, the
       error shall be ignored.

       The <i>glob</i>() function shall not fail because of large files.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>glob</i>() shall return 0. The argument
       <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathc</i> shall return the number of matched pathnames and
       the argument <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathv</i> shall contain a pointer to a null-
       terminated list of matched and sorted pathnames. However, if
       <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathc</i> is 0, the content of <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathv</i> is
       undefined.

       The <i>globfree</i>() function shall not return a value.

       If <i>glob</i>() terminates due to an error, it shall return one of the
       non-zero constants defined in <i>&lt;glob.h&gt;</i>.  The arguments
       <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathc</i> and <i>pglob</i>-&gt;<i>gl_pathv</i> are still set as defined
       above.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>glob</i>() function shall fail and return the corresponding value
       if:

       GLOB_ABORTED  The scan was stopped because GLOB_ERR was set or
                     <i>(</i>()*errfunc ) returned non-zero.

       GLOB_NOMATCH  The pattern does not match any existing pathname,
                     and GLOB_NOCHECK was not set in flags.

       GLOB_NOSPACE  An attempt to allocate memory failed.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       One use of the GLOB_DOOFFS flag is by applications that build an
       argument list for use with <i>execv</i>(), <i>execve</i>(), or <i>execvp</i>().
       Suppose, for example, that an application wants to do the
       equivalent of:

           ls -l *.c

       but for some reason:

           system("ls -l *.c")

       is not acceptable. The application could obtain approximately the
       same result using the sequence:

           globbuf.gl_offs = 2;
           glob("*.c", GLOB_DOOFFS, NULL, &amp;globbuf);
           globbuf.gl_pathv[0] = "ls";
           globbuf.gl_pathv[1] = "-l";
           execvp("ls", &amp;globbuf.gl_pathv[0]);

       Using the same example:

           ls -l *.c *.h

       could be approximately simulated using GLOB_APPEND as follows:

           globbuf.gl_offs = 2;
           glob("*.c", GLOB_DOOFFS, NULL, &amp;globbuf);
           glob("*.h", GLOB_DOOFFS|GLOB_APPEND, NULL, &amp;globbuf);
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       This function is not provided for the purpose of enabling
       utilities to perform pathname expansion on their arguments, as
       this operation is performed by the shell, and utilities are
       explicitly not expected to redo this. Instead, it is provided for
       applications that need to do pathname expansion on strings
       obtained from other sources, such as a pattern typed by a user or
       read from a file.

       If a utility needs to see if a pathname matches a given pattern,
       it can use <i>fnmatch</i>().

       Note that <i>gl_pathc</i> and <i>gl_pathv</i> have meaning even if <i>glob</i>()
       fails. This allows <i>glob</i>() to report partial results in the event
       of an error. However, if <i>gl_pathc</i> is 0, <i>gl_pathv</i> is unspecified
       even if <i>glob</i>() did not return an error.

       The GLOB_NOCHECK option could be used when an application wants
       to expand a pathname if wildcards are specified, but wants to
       treat the pattern as just a string otherwise. The <i>sh</i> utility
       might use this for option-arguments, for example.

       The new pathnames generated by a subsequent call with GLOB_APPEND
       are not sorted together with the previous pathnames. This mirrors
       the way that the shell handles pathname expansion when multiple
       expansions are done on a command line.

       Applications that need tilde and parameter expansion should use
       <i>wordexp</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       It was claimed that the GLOB_DOOFFS flag is unnecessary because
       it could be simulated using:

           new = (char **)malloc((n + pglob-&gt;gl_pathc + 1)
                  * sizeof(char *));
           (void) memcpy(new+n, pglob-&gt;gl_pathv,
                  pglob-&gt;gl_pathc * sizeof(char *));
           (void) memset(new, 0, n * sizeof(char *));
           free(pglob-&gt;gl_pathv);
           pglob-&gt;gl_pathv = new;

       However, this assumes that the memory pointed to by <i>gl_pathv</i> is a
       block that was separately created using <i>malloc</i>().  This is not
       necessarily the case. An application should make no assumptions
       about how the memory referenced by fields in <i>pglob</i> was allocated.
       It might have been obtained from <i>malloc</i>() in a large chunk and
       then carved up within <i>glob</i>(), or it might have been created using
       a different memory allocator. It is not the intent of the
       standard developers to specify or imply how the memory used by
       <i>glob</i>() is managed.

       The GLOB_APPEND flag would be used when an application wants to
       expand several different patterns into a single list.
