DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A launcher provides a mechanism for code to execute a callback
       function and/or a program executable in an environment with a
       modified security context. Essentially it provides a mechanism
       for a program to <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> a new context from that of the main
       program manipulate capability and other privileged state in that
       <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>d process before (optionally) <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>ing a new program.
       When the application links to <i>-lpsx</i> this support is needed to
       robustly execute the launched code without modifying the privilge
       of the whole (POSIX semantics honoring) main application.

       A launcher is defined by one of these two functions:
       <b>cap_new_launcher</b>() or <b>cap_func_launcher</b>().  The return value
       being of opaque type <b>cap_launch_t </b>a return value of NULL implies
       an error has occurred.

       Once defined, a <b>cap_launch_t </b>value can be used with <b>cap_launch</b>()
       to execute that <i>launcher</i>. In such cases, a non-negative return
       value indicates success: zero meaning success without a program
       being invoked; non-zero being equal to the process ID (<b>pid_t</b>) of
       the newly launched program.

       A <b>cap_launch_t </b>occupies allocated memory and should be freed with
       <a href="cap_free.3.html">cap_free(3)</a>.  Before being <a href="cap_free.3.html">cap_free(3)</a>d a <b>cap_value_t </b>value may
       be reused for multiple independent launches. The <i>detail</i> argument
       to <b>cap_launch</b>(), in conjunction with the launcher's callback
       function, can be used to customize the invocation of the launch.
       Care must be taken to leverage custom shared memory (see <a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a>)
       or some other IPC to return values to the main program via <i>detail</i>
       since the callback and any subsequent program execution will
       occur outside the main process of the calling application. An
       example of this would be to allocate detail as follows:

          const char *args[] = { "echo", "hello", NULL };
          cap_launch_t cmd = cap_new_launcher("/usr/bin/echo", args, NULL);
          int *detail = mmap(NULL, sizeof(int), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                             MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
          cap_launcher_callback(cmd, &amp;answer_detail_fn);
          *detail = 41;
          pid_t pid = cap_launch(cmd, detail);
          printf("launcher callback set detail to %d\n", *detail);
          munmap(detail, sizeof(int));

       Unless modified by the callback function, the launched code will
       execute with the capability and other security context of the
       application.

       If the callback function returns anything other than zero, a
       <b>cap_launch</b>() will be aborted. If detail of the failure is
       important to the caller, it should be communicated via the <i>detail</i>
       argument.

       The following functions can be used to instruct the launcher to
       modify the security state of the invoked program without altering
       the state of the calling program. Such modifications must be
       performed prior to calling <b>cap_launch</b>() if they are to have the
       desired effect. Further, they are only invoked after any
       installed callback has completed. For example, one can drop or
       modify capabilities, <i>just</i> for executing a file.

       The following functions instruct the launcher to do some common
       tasks of this sort (note some require permitted capability bits
       to succeed):

       <b>cap_launcher_callback</b>() can be used to install or replace the
       currently installed callback function of the launcher.

       <b>cap_launcher_set_mode</b>() can be used to ensure that the libcap-
       mode of the launched program is the desired one.

       <b>cap_launcher_set_iab</b>() This function returns the <b>cap_iab_t</b>
       previously associated with the launcher. Calling this function
       with an IAB value of NULL will configure the launcher to not set
       an IAB value (the default).  See <a href="cap_iab.3.html">cap_iab(3)</a> for details on the
       IAB set. Note, the launcher is associated directly with the
       supplied <i>iab</i> value, and does not make a copy of it. This iab
       value is locked to the laucher and cannot be modified while
       associated with the launcher. Set with NULL to regain control
       over the memory associated with that IAB value, otherwise the IAB
       value will be <b>cap_free</b><i>()</i><b>'d when the launcher is.</b>

       <b>cap_launcher_set_chroot</b>() This function causes the launched
       program executable to be invoked inside a chroot <i>root</i> directory.

       <b>cap_launcher_setuid</b>() This function causes the launched program
       executable to be invoked with the specified user identifier
       (<i>uid_t</i>).

       <b>cap_launcher_setgroups</b>() This function causes the launched
       program executable to be invoked with the specified primary and
       supplementary group IDs.

       Note, if any of the launcher enhancements made by the above
       functions should fail to take effect (typically for a lack of
       sufficient privilege), the launch will fail and return -1.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       A return of NULL for a <b>cap_launch_t </b>should be considered an
       error.

       <b>cap_launch</b>() returns -1 in the case of an error.

       In all such cases a return value of 0 implies success. In other
       cases, consult <a href="errno.3.html">errno(3)</a> for further details.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>cap_launch</b>() family of functions were introduced in libcap
       2.33. It primarily addresses a complexity with <i>-lpsx</i> linked
       pthreads(7) applications that use capabilities but also honor
       POSIX semantics.

       Using <i>-lcap</i> and <i>-lpthread</i> together without the POSIX semantics
       support from <i>-lpsx</i> introduces a subtle class of exposure to
       privilege escalation. (See
       <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable/who-ordered-libpsx">https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable/who-ordered-libpsx</a> for
       an explanation.)
