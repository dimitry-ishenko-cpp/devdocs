</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_activate - activate a capture handle
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pcap_activate(pcap_t *p);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_activate</b>() is used to activate a packet capture handle to
       look at packets on the network, with the options that were set on
       the handle being in effect.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_activate</b>() returns <b>0 </b>on success without warnings, a non-zero
       positive value on success with warnings, and a negative value on
       error.  A non-zero return value indicates what warning or error
       condition occurred.

       The possible warning values are:

       <b>PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP</b>
              Promiscuous mode was requested, but the capture source
              doesn't support promiscuous mode.

       <b>PCAP_WARNING_TSTAMP_TYPE_NOTSUP</b>
              The time stamp type specified in a previous
              <b>pcap_set_tstamp_type</b>(3PCAP) call isn't supported by the
              capture source (the time stamp type is left as the
              default),

       <b>PCAP_WARNING</b>
              Another warning condition occurred; <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or
              <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP) may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to
              fetch or display a message describing the warning
              condition.

       The possible error values are:

       <b>PCAP_ERROR_ACTIVATED</b>
              The handle has already been activated.

       <b>PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE</b>
              The capture source specified when the handle was created
              doesn't exist.

       <b>PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED</b>
              The process doesn't have permission to open the capture
              source.

       <b>PCAP_ERROR_PROMISC_PERM_DENIED</b>
              The process has permission to open the capture source but
              doesn't have permission to put it into promiscuous mode.

       <b>PCAP_ERROR_RFMON_NOTSUP</b>
              Monitor mode was specified but the capture source doesn't
              support monitor mode.

       <b>PCAP_ERROR_IFACE_NOT_UP</b>
              The capture source device is not up.

       <b>PCAP_ERROR_CAPTURE_NOTSUP</b>
              Packet capture is not supported on the capture source.

       <b>PCAP_ERROR</b>
              Another error occurred.  <b>pcap_geterr</b>() or <b>pcap_perror</b>()
              may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch or display a
              message describing the error.

       If <b>PCAP_WARNING_PROMISC_NOTSUP</b>, <b>PCAP_ERROR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE</b>,
       <b>PCAP_ERROR_PERM_DENIED</b>, or <b>PCAP_ERROR_CAPTURE_NOTSUP </b>is returned,
       <b>pcap_geterr</b>() or <b>pcap_perror</b>() may be called with <i>p</i> as an
       argument to fetch or display an message giving additional details
       about the problem that might be useful for debugging the problem
       if it's unexpected.

       Additional warning and error codes may be added in the future; a
       program should check for positive, negative, and zero return
       codes, and treat all positive return codes as warnings and all
       negative return codes as errors.  <b>pcap_statustostr</b>(3PCAP) can be
       called, with a warning or error code as an argument, to fetch a
       message describing the warning or error code.

       If <b>pcap_activate</b>() fails, the <b>pcap_t * </b>is not closed and freed;
       it should be closed using <b>pcap_close</b>(3PCAP).
