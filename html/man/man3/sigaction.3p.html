SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigaction</i>() function allows the calling process to examine
       and/or specify the action to be associated with a specific
       signal. The argument <i>sig</i> specifies the signal; acceptable values
       are defined in <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>.

       The structure <b>sigaction</b>, used to describe an action to be taken,
       is defined in the <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> header to include at least the
       following members:

       The  storage occupied by <i>sa_handler</i> and <i>sa_sigaction</i> may overlap,
       and a conforming application shall not use both simultaneously.

       If the argument <i>act</i> is  not  a  null  pointer,  it  points  to  a
       structure  specifying  the  action  to  be  associated  with  the
       specified signal. If the argument <i>oact</i> is not a null pointer, the
       action previously associated with the signal  is  stored  in  the
       location pointed to by the argument <i>oact</i>.  If the argument <i>act</i> is
       a  null pointer, signal handling is unchanged; thus, the call can
       be used to enquire about the current handling of a given  signal.
       The  SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals shall not be added to the signal
       mask using this mechanism; this restriction shall be enforced  by
       the system without causing an error to be indicated.

       If  the  SA_SIGINFO  flag  (see below) is cleared in the <i>sa_flags</i>
       field of the <b>sigaction </b>structure, the <i>sa_handler</i> field identifies
       the action to be associated with the specified  signal.   If  the
       SA_SIGINFO  flag  is  set in the <i>sa_flags</i> field, the <i>sa_sigaction</i>
       field specifies a signal-catching function.

       The <i>sa_flags</i> field can be used to  modify  the  behavior  of  the
       specified signal.

       The following flags, defined in the <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> header, can be set
       in <i>sa_flags</i>:

       SA_NOCLDSTOP  Do not generate SIGCHLD when children stop or
                     stopped children continue.

                     If <i>sig</i> is SIGCHLD and the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag is not
                     set in <i>sa_flags</i>, and the implementation supports
                     the SIGCHLD signal, then a SIGCHLD signal shall be
                     generated for the calling process whenever any of
                     its child processes stop and a SIGCHLD signal may
                     be generated for the calling process whenever any
                     of its stopped child processes are continued.  If
                     <i>sig</i> is SIGCHLD and the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag is set in
                     <i>sa_flags</i>, then the implementation shall not
                     generate a SIGCHLD signal in this way.

       SA_ONSTACK    If set and an alternate signal stack has been
                     declared with <i>sigaltstack</i>(), the signal shall be
                     delivered to the calling process on that stack.
                     Otherwise, the signal shall be delivered on the
                     current stack.

       SA_RESETHAND  If set, the disposition of the signal shall be
                     reset to SIG_DFL and the SA_SIGINFO flag shall be
                     cleared on entry to the signal handler.

                     <b>Note:  </b>SIGILL and SIGTRAP cannot be automatically
                            reset when delivered; the system silently
                            enforces this restriction.

                     Otherwise, the disposition of the signal shall not
                     be modified on entry to the signal handler.

                     In addition, if this flag is set, <i>sigaction</i>() may
                     behave as if the SA_NODEFER flag were also set.

       SA_RESTART    This flag affects the behavior of interruptible
                     functions; that is, those specified to fail with
                     <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b>.  If set, and a function
                     specified as interruptible is interrupted by this
                     signal, the function shall restart and shall not
                     fail with <b>[EINTR] </b>unless otherwise specified. If an
                     interruptible function which uses a timeout is
                     restarted, the duration of the timeout following
                     the restart is set to an unspecified value that
                     does not exceed the original timeout value. If the
                     flag is not set, interruptible functions
                     interrupted by this signal shall fail with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
                     set to <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       SA_SIGINFO    If cleared and the signal is caught, the signal-
                     catching function shall be entered as:

                         void func(int <i>signo</i>);

                     where <i>signo</i> is the only argument to the signal-
                     catching function. In this case, the application
                     shall use the <i>sa_handler</i> member to describe the
                     signal-catching function and the application shall
                     not modify the <i>sa_sigaction</i> member.

                     If SA_SIGINFO is set and the signal is caught, the
                     signal-catching function shall be entered as:

                         void func(int <i>signo</i>, siginfo_t *<i>info</i>, void *<i>context</i>);

                     where two additional arguments are passed to the
                     signal-catching function. The second argument shall
                     point to an object of type <b>siginfo_t </b>explaining the
                     reason why the signal was generated; the third
                     argument can be cast to a pointer to an object of
                     type <b>ucontext_t </b>to refer to the receiving thread's
                     context that was interrupted when the signal was
                     delivered. In this case, the application shall use
                     the <i>sa_sigaction</i> member to describe the signal-
                     catching function and the application shall not
                     modify the <i>sa_handler</i> member.

                     The <i>si_signo</i> member contains the system-generated
                     signal number.

                     The <i>si_errno</i> member may contain implementation-
                     defined additional error information; if non-zero,
                     it contains an error number identifying the
                     condition that caused the signal to be generated.

                     The <i>si_code</i> member contains a code identifying the
                     cause of the signal, as described in <i>Section 2.4.3</i>,
                     <i>Signal Actions</i>.

       SA_NOCLDWAIT  If <i>sig</i> does not equal SIGCHLD, the behavior is
                     unspecified. Otherwise, the behavior of the
                     SA_NOCLDWAIT flag is as specified in <i>Consequences</i>
                     <i>of Process Termination</i>.

       SA_NODEFER    If set and <i>sig</i> is caught, <i>sig</i> shall not be added to
                     the thread's signal mask on entry to the signal
                     handler unless it is included in <i>sa_mask</i>.
                     Otherwise, <i>sig</i> shall always be added to the
                     thread's signal mask on entry to the signal
                     handler.

       When a signal is caught by a signal-catching function installed
       by <i>sigaction</i>(), a new signal mask is calculated and installed for
       the duration of the signal-catching function (or until a call to
       either <i>sigprocmask</i>() or <i>sigsuspend</i>() is made). This mask is
       formed by taking the union of the current signal mask and the
       value of the <i>sa_mask</i> for the signal being delivered, and unless
       SA_NODEFER or SA_RESETHAND is set, then including the signal
       being delivered. If and when the user's signal handler returns
       normally, the original signal mask is restored.

       Once an action is installed for a specific signal, it shall
       remain installed until another action is explicitly requested (by
       another call to <i>sigaction</i>()), until the SA_RESETHAND flag causes
       resetting of the handler, or until one of the <i>exec</i> functions is
       called.

       If the previous action for <i>sig</i> had been established by <i>signal</i>(),
       the values of the fields returned in the structure pointed to by
       <i>oact</i> are unspecified, and in particular <i>oact</i>-&gt;<i>sa_handler</i> is not
       necessarily the same value passed to <i>signal</i>().  However, if a
       pointer to the same structure or a copy thereof is passed to a
       subsequent call to <i>sigaction</i>() via the <i>act</i> argument, handling of
       the signal shall be as if the original call to <i>signal</i>() were
       repeated.

       If <i>sigaction</i>() fails, no new signal handler is installed.

       It is unspecified whether an attempt to set the action for a
       signal that cannot be caught or ignored to SIG_DFL is ignored or
       causes an error to be returned with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EINVAL]</b>.

       If SA_SIGINFO is not set in <i>sa_flags</i>, then the disposition of
       subsequent occurrences of <i>sig</i> when it is already pending is
       implementation-defined; the signal-catching function shall be
       invoked with a single argument.  If SA_SIGINFO is set in
       <i>sa_flags</i>, then subsequent occurrences of <i>sig</i> generated by
       <i>sigqueue</i>() or as a result of any signal-generating function that
       supports the specification of an application-defined value (when
       <i>sig</i> is already pending) shall be queued in FIFO order until
       delivered or accepted; the signal-catching function shall be
       invoked with three arguments. The application specified value is
       passed to the signal-catching function as the <i>si_value</i> member of
       the <b>siginfo_t </b>structure.

       The result of the use of <i>sigaction</i>() and a <i>sigwait</i>() function
       concurrently within a process on the same signal is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>sigaction</i>() shall return 0;
       otherwise, -1 shall be returned, <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate
       the error, and no new signal-catching function shall be
       installed.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigaction</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>sig</i> argument is not a valid signal number or an
              attempt is made to catch a signal that cannot be caught or
              ignore a signal that cannot be ignored.

       The <i>sigaction</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>An attempt was made to set the action to SIG_DFL for a
              signal that cannot be caught or ignored (or both).

       In addition, on systems that do not support the XSI option, the
       <i>sigaction</i>() function may fail if the SA_SIGINFO flag is set in
       the <i>sa_flags</i> field of the <b>sigaction </b>structure for a signal not in
       the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Establishing a Signal Handler</b>
       The following example demonstrates the use of <i>sigaction</i>() to
       establish a handler for the SIGINT signal.

           #include &lt;signal.h&gt;

           static void handler(int signum)
           {
               /* Take appropriate actions for signal delivery */
           }

           int main()
           {
               struct sigaction sa;

               sa.sa_handler = handler;
               sigemptyset(&amp;sa.sa_mask);
               sa.sa_flags = SA_RESTART; /* Restart functions if
                                            interrupted by handler */
               if (sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;sa, NULL) == -1)
                   /* Handle error */;

               /* Further code */
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sigaction</i>() function supersedes the <i>signal</i>() function, and
       should be used in preference. In particular, <i>sigaction</i>() and
       <i>signal</i>() should not be used in the same process to control the
       same signal.  The behavior of async-signal-safe functions, as
       defined in their respective DESCRIPTION sections, is as specified
       by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, regardless of invocation from a
       signal-catching function. This is the only intended meaning of
       the statement that async-signal-safe functions may be used in
       signal-catching functions without restrictions. Applications must
       still consider all effects of such functions on such things as
       data structures, files, and process state. In particular,
       application developers need to consider the restrictions on
       interactions when interrupting <i>sleep</i>() and interactions among
       multiple handles for a file description. The fact that any
       specific function is listed as async-signal-safe does not
       necessarily mean that invocation of that function from a signal-
       catching function is recommended.

       In order to prevent errors arising from interrupting non-async-
       signal-safe function calls, applications should protect calls to
       these functions either by blocking the appropriate signals or
       through the use of some programmatic semaphore (see <a href="semget.3p.html">semget(3p)</a>,
       <a href="sem_init.3p.html">sem_init(3p)</a>, <a href="sem_open.3p.html">sem_open(3p)</a>, and so on). Note in particular that
       even the ``safe'' functions may modify <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>; the signal-catching
       function, if not executing as an independent thread, should save
       and restore its value in order to avoid the possibility that
       delivery of a signal in between an error return from a function
       that sets <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> and the subsequent examination of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> could
       result in the signal-catching function changing the value of
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.  Naturally, the same principles apply to the async-signal-
       safety of application routines and asynchronous data access. Note
       that <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>siglongjmp</i>() are not in the list of async-
       signal-safe functions. This is because the code executing after
       <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>siglongjmp</i>() can call any unsafe functions with the
       same danger as calling those unsafe functions directly from the
       signal handler. Applications that use <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>siglongjmp</i>()
       from within signal handlers require rigorous protection in order
       to be portable. Many of the other functions that are excluded
       from the list are traditionally implemented using either <i>malloc</i>()
       or <i>free</i>() functions or the standard I/O library, both of which
       traditionally use data structures in a non-async-signal-safe
       manner. Since any combination of different functions using a
       common data structure can cause async-signal-safety problems,
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not define the behavior when any
       unsafe function is called in a signal handler that interrupts an
       unsafe function.

       Usually, the signal is executed on the stack that was in effect
       before the signal was delivered. An alternate stack may be
       specified to receive a subset of the signals being caught.

       When the signal handler returns, the receiving thread resumes
       execution at the point it was interrupted unless the signal
       handler makes other arrangements. If <i>longjmp</i>() or <i>_longjmp</i>() is
       used to leave the signal handler, then the signal mask must be
       explicitly restored.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defines the third argument of a
       signal handling function when SA_SIGINFO is set as a <b>void *</b>
       instead of a <b>ucontext_t *</b>, but without requiring type checking.
       New applications should explicitly cast the third argument of the
       signal handling function to <b>ucontext_t *</b>.

       The BSD optional four argument signal handling function is not
       supported by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. The BSD declaration
       would be:

           void handler(int <i>sig</i>, int <i>code</i>, struct sigcontext *<i>scp</i>,
               char *<i>addr</i>);

       where <i>sig</i> is the signal number, <i>code</i> is additional information on
       certain signals, <i>scp</i> is a pointer to the <b>sigcontext </b>structure,
       and <i>addr</i> is additional address information. Much the same
       information is available in the objects pointed to by the second
       argument of the signal handler specified when SA_SIGINFO is set.

       Since the <i>sigaction</i>() function is allowed but not required to set
       SA_NODEFER when the application sets the SA_RESETHAND flag,
       applications which depend on the SA_RESETHAND functionality for
       the newly installed signal handler must always explicitly set
       SA_NODEFER when they set SA_RESETHAND in order to be portable.

       See also the rationale for Realtime Signal Generation and
       Delivery in the Rationale (Informative) volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       <i>Section B.2.4.2</i>, <i>Signal Generation and Delivery</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Although this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that signals that
       cannot be ignored shall not be added to the signal mask when a
       signal-catching function is entered, there is no explicit
       requirement that subsequent calls to <i>sigaction</i>() reflect this in
       the information returned in the <i>oact</i> argument. In other words, if
       SIGKILL is included in the <i>sa_mask</i> field of <i>act</i>, it is
       unspecified whether or not a subsequent call to <i>sigaction</i>()
       returns with SIGKILL included in the <i>sa_mask</i> field of <i>oact</i>.

       The SA_NOCLDSTOP flag, when supplied in the <i>act</i>-&gt;<i>sa_flags</i>
       parameter, allows overloading SIGCHLD with the System V semantics
       that each SIGCLD signal indicates a single terminated child. Most
       conforming applications that catch SIGCHLD are expected to
       install signal-catching functions that repeatedly call the
       <i>waitpid</i>() function with the WNOHANG flag set, acting on each
       child for which status is returned, until <i>waitpid</i>() returns zero.
       If stopped children are not of interest, the use of the
       SA_NOCLDSTOP flag can prevent the overhead from invoking the
       signal-catching routine when they stop.

       Some historical implementations also define other mechanisms for
       stopping processes, such as the <i>ptrace</i>() function. These
       implementations usually do not generate a SIGCHLD signal when
       processes stop due to this mechanism; however, that is beyond the
       scope of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that calls to <i>sigaction</i>()
       that supply a NULL <i>act</i> argument succeed, even in the case of
       signals that cannot be caught or ignored (that is, SIGKILL or
       SIGSTOP).  The System V <i>signal</i>() and BSD <i>sigvec</i>() functions
       return <b>[EINVAL] </b>in these cases and, in this respect, their
       behavior varies from <i>sigaction</i>().

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that <i>sigaction</i>() properly
       save and restore a signal action set up by the ISO C standard
       <i>signal</i>() function. However, there is no guarantee that the
       reverse is true, nor could there be given the greater amount of
       information conveyed by the <b>sigaction </b>structure. Because of this,
       applications should avoid using both functions for the same
       signal in the same process. Since this cannot always be avoided
       in case of general-purpose library routines, they should always
       be implemented with <i>sigaction</i>().

       It was intended that the <i>signal</i>() function should be
       implementable as a library routine using <i>sigaction</i>().

       The POSIX Realtime Extension extends the <i>sigaction</i>() function as
       specified by the POSIX.1‐1990 standard to allow the application
       to request on a per-signal basis via an additional signal action
       flag that the extra parameters, including the application-defined
       signal value, if any, be passed to the signal-catching function.
