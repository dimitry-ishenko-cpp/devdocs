NAME </h2>
<pre>
       setuid — set user ID
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int setuid(uid_t <i>uid</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If the process has appropriate privileges, <i>setuid</i>() shall set the
       real user ID, effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of the
       calling process to <i>uid</i>.

       If the process does not have appropriate privileges, but <i>uid</i> is
       equal to the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID, <i>setuid</i>()
       shall set the effective user ID to <i>uid</i>; the real user ID and
       saved set-user-ID shall remain unchanged.

       The <i>setuid</i>() function shall not affect the supplementary group
       list in any way.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>setuid</i>() function shall fail, return -1, and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to the
       corresponding value if one or more of the following are true:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>uid</i> argument is invalid and not supported
              by the implementation.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The process does not have appropriate privileges and <i>uid</i>
              does not match the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The various behaviors of the <i>setuid</i>() and <i>setgid</i>() functions when
       called by non-privileged processes reflect the behavior of
       different historical implementations. For portability, it is
       recommended that new non-privileged applications use the
       <i>seteuid</i>() and <i>setegid</i>() functions instead.

       The saved set-user-ID capability allows a program to regain the
       effective user ID established at the last <i>exec</i> call. Similarly,
       the saved set-group-ID capability allows a program to regain the
       effective group ID established at the last <i>exec</i> call. These
       capabilities are derived from System V. Without them, a program
       might have to run as superuser in order to perform the same
       functions, because superuser can write on the user's files. This
       is a problem because such a program can write on any user's
       files, and so must be carefully written to emulate the
       permissions of the calling process properly. In System V, these
       capabilities have traditionally been implemented only via the
       <i>setuid</i>() and <i>setgid</i>() functions for non-privileged processes. The
       fact that the behavior of those functions was different for
       privileged processes made them difficult to use. The POSIX.1‐1990
       standard defined the <i>setuid</i>() function to behave differently for
       privileged and unprivileged users.  When the caller had
       appropriate privileges, the function set the real user ID,
       effective user ID, and saved set-user ID of the calling process
       on implementations that supported it. When the caller did not
       have appropriate privileges, the function set only the effective
       user ID, subject to permission checks. The former use is
       generally needed for utilities like <i>login</i> and <i>su</i>, which are not
       conforming applications and thus outside the scope of
       POSIX.1‐2008. These utilities wish to change the user ID
       irrevocably to a new value, generally that of an unprivileged
       user. The latter use is needed for conforming applications that
       are installed with the set-user-ID bit and need to perform
       operations using the real user ID.

       POSIX.1‐2008 augments the latter functionality with a mandatory
       feature named _POSIX_SAVED_IDS. This feature permits a set-user-
       ID application to switch its effective user ID back and forth
       between the values of its <i>exec</i>-time real user ID and effective
       user ID. Unfortunately, the POSIX.1‐1990 standard did not permit
       a conforming application using this feature to work properly when
       it happened to be executed with (implementation-defined)
       appropriate privileges. Furthermore, the application did not even
       have a means to tell whether it had this privilege. Since the
       saved set-user-ID feature is quite desirable for applications, as
       evidenced by the fact that NIST required it in FIPS 151‐2, it has
       been mandated by POSIX.1‐2008. However, there are implementors
       who have been reluctant to support it given the limitation
       described above.

       The 4.3BSD system handles the problem by supporting separate
       functions: <i>setuid</i>() (which always sets both the real and
       effective user IDs, like <i>setuid</i>() in POSIX.1‐2008 for privileged
       users), and <i>seteuid</i>() (which always sets just the effective user
       ID, like <i>setuid</i>() in POSIX.1‐2008 for non-privileged users). This
       separation of functionality into distinct functions seems
       desirable. 4.3BSD does not support the saved set-user-ID feature.
       It supports similar functionality of switching the effective user
       ID back and forth via <i>setreuid</i>(), which permits reversing the
       real and effective user IDs. This model seems less desirable than
       the saved set-user-ID because the real user ID changes as a side-
       effect. The current 4.4BSD includes saved effective IDs and uses
       them for <i>seteuid</i>() and <i>setegid</i>() as described above. The
       <i>setreuid</i>() and <i>setregid</i>() functions will be deprecated or
       removed.

       The solution here is:

        *  Require that all implementations support the functionality of
           the saved set-user-ID, which is set by the <i>exec</i> functions and
           by privileged calls to <i>setuid</i>().

        *  Add the <i>seteuid</i>() and <i>setegid</i>() functions as portable
           alternatives to <i>setuid</i>() and <i>setgid</i>() for non-privileged and
           privileged processes.

       Historical systems have provided two mechanisms for a set-user-ID
       process to change its effective user ID to be the same as its
       real user ID in such a way that it could return to the original
       effective user ID: the use of the <i>setuid</i>() function in the
       presence of a saved set-user-ID, or the use of the BSD <i>setreuid</i>()
       function, which was able to swap the real and effective user IDs.
       The changes included in POSIX.1‐2008 provide a new mechanism
       using <i>seteuid</i>() in conjunction with a saved set-user-ID. Thus,
       all implementations with the new <i>seteuid</i>() mechanism will have a
       saved set-user-ID for each process, and most of the behavior
       controlled by _POSIX_SAVED_IDS has been changed to agree with the
       case where the option was defined. The <i>kill</i>() function is an
       exception. Implementors of the new <i>seteuid</i>() mechanism will
       generally be required to maintain compatibility with the older
       mechanisms previously supported by their systems. However,
       compatibility with this use of <i>setreuid</i>() and with the
       _POSIX_SAVED_IDS behavior of <i>kill</i>() is unfortunately complicated.
       If an implementation with a saved set-user-ID allows a process to
       use <i>setreuid</i>() to swap its real and effective user IDs, but were
       to leave the saved set-user-ID unmodified, the process would then
       have an effective user ID equal to the original real user ID, and
       both real and saved set-user-ID would be equal to the original
       effective user ID. In that state, the real user would be unable
       to kill the process, even though the effective user ID of the
       process matches that of the real user, if the <i>kill</i>() behavior of
       _POSIX_SAVED_IDS was used. This is obviously not acceptable. The
       alternative choice, which is used in at least one implementation,
       is to change the saved set-user-ID to the effective user ID
       during most calls to <i>setreuid</i>().  The standard developers
       considered that alternative to be less correct than the retention
       of the old behavior of <i>kill</i>() in such systems. Current conforming
       applications shall accommodate either behavior from <i>kill</i>(), and
       there appears to be no strong reason for <i>kill</i>() to check the
       saved set-user-ID rather than the effective user ID.
