PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_spin_lock, pthread_spin_trylock — lock a spin lock object
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_spin_lock(pthread_spinlock_t *<i>lock</i>);
       int pthread_spin_trylock(pthread_spinlock_t *<i>lock</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_spin_lock</i>() function shall lock the spin lock
       referenced by <i>lock</i>.  The calling thread shall acquire the lock if
       it is not held by another thread. Otherwise, the thread shall
       spin (that is, shall not return from the <i>pthread_spin_lock</i>()
       call) until the lock becomes available. The results are undefined
       if the calling thread holds the lock at the time the call is
       made. The <i>pthread_spin_trylock</i>() function shall lock the spin
       lock referenced by <i>lock</i> if it is not held by any thread.
       Otherwise, the function shall fail.

       The results are undefined if any of these functions is called
       with an uninitialized spin lock.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return zero;
       otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_spin_lock</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock condition was detected.

       The <i>pthread_spin_trylock</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBUSY  </b>A thread currently holds the lock.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications using this function may be subject to priority
       inversion, as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.291</i>, <i>Priority Inversion</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>lock</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_spin_lock</i>() or <i>pthread_spin_trylock</i>() does
       not refer to an initialized spin lock object, it is recommended
       that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>lock</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_spin_lock</i>() refers to a spin lock object for
       which the calling thread already holds the lock, it is
       recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EDEADLK]</b>
       error.
