PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       atexit — register a function to run at process termination
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       int atexit(void (*<i>func</i>)(void));
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>atexit</i>() function shall register the function pointed to by
       <i>func</i>, to be called without arguments at normal program
       termination. At normal program termination, all functions
       registered by the <i>atexit</i>() function shall be called, in the
       reverse order of their registration, except that a function is
       called after any previously registered functions that had already
       been called at the time it was registered.  Normal termination
       occurs either by a call to <i>exit</i>() or a return from <i>main</i>().

       At least 32 functions can be registered with <i>atexit</i>().

       After a successful call to any of the <i>exec</i> functions, any
       functions previously registered by <i>atexit</i>() shall no longer be
       registered.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>atexit</i>() shall return 0; otherwise,
       it shall return a non-zero value.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The functions registered by a call to <i>atexit</i>() must return to
       ensure that all registered functions are called.

       The application should call <i>sysconf</i>() to obtain the value of
       {ATEXIT_MAX}, the number of functions that can be registered.
       There is no way for an application to tell how many functions
       have already been registered with <i>atexit</i>().

       Since the behavior is undefined if the <i>exit</i>() function is called
       more than once, portable applications calling <i>atexit</i>() must
       ensure that the <i>exit</i>() function is not called at normal process
       termination when all functions registered by the <i>atexit</i>()
       function are called.

       All functions registered by the <i>atexit</i>() function are called at
       normal process termination, which occurs by a call to the <i>exit</i>()
       function or a return from <i>main</i>() or on the last thread
       termination, when the behavior is as if the implementation called
       <i>exit</i>() with a zero argument at thread termination time.

       If, at normal process termination, a function registered by the
       <i>atexit</i>() function is called and a portable application needs to
       stop further <i>exit</i>() processing, it must call the <i>_exit</i>() function
       or the <i>_Exit</i>() function or one of the functions which cause
       abnormal process termination.
