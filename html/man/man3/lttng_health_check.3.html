       lttng_health_check - Monitor health of the session daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;lttng/lttng.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int lttng_health_check(enum lttng_health_component c);</b>

       Link with -llttng-ctl.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>lttng_health_check</b>() is used to check the session daemon
       health for either a specific component <b>c </b>or for all of them. Each
       component represent a subsystem of the session daemon.  Those
       components are set with health counters that are atomically
       incremented once reached. An even value indicates progress in the
       execution of the component. An odd value means that the code has
       entered a blocking state which is not a poll(7) wait period.

       A bad health is defined by a fatal error code path reached or any
       IPC used in the session daemon that was blocked for more than 20
       seconds (default timeout).  The condition for this bad health to
       be detected is that one or many of the counters are odd.

       The health check mechanism of the session daemon can only be
       reached through the health socket which is a different one from
       the command and the application socket. An isolated thread serves
       this socket and only computes the health counters across the code
       when asked by the lttng control library (using this call). This
       subsystem is highly unlikely to fail due to its simplicity.

       The <b>c </b>argument can be one of the following values:

       <b>LTTNG_HEALTH_CMD</b>
              Command subsystem which handles user commands coming from
              the liblttng-ctl or the <a href="../man1/lttng.1.html">lttng(1)</a> command line interface.

       <b>LTTNG_HEALTH_APP_MANAGE</b>
              The session daemon manages application socket in order to
              route client command and check if they get closed which
              indicates the application shutdown.

       <b>LTTNG_HEALTH_APP_REG</b>
              The application registration mechanism is an important and
              vital part of for user space tracing. Upon startup,
              applications instrumented with <a href="lttng-ust.3.html">lttng-ust(3)</a> try to
              register to the session daemon through this subsystem.

       <b>LTTNG_HEALTH_KERNEL</b>
              Monitor the Kernel tracer streams and main channel of
              communication (/proc/lttng). If this component
              malfunction, the Kernel tracer is not usable anymore by
              lttng-tools.

       <b>LTTNG_HEALTH_CONSUMER</b>
              The session daemon can spawn up to <b>three </b>consumer daemon
              for kernel, user space 32 and 64 bit. This subsystem
              monitors the consumer daemon(s). A bad health state means
              that the consumer(s) are not usable anymore hence likely
              making tracing not usable.

       <b>LTTNG_HEALTH_ALL</b>
              Check all components. If only one of them is in a bad
              state, a health check error is returned.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Return 0 if the health is OK, or 1 is it's in a bad state. A
       return code of -1 indicates that the control library was not able
       to connect to the session daemon health socket.
</pre> <h2>
LIMITATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       For the LTTNG_HEALTH_CONSUMER, you can not know which consumer
       daemon has failed but only that either the consumer subsystem has
       failed or that a lttng-consumerd died.
