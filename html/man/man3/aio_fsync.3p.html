NAME </h2>
<pre>
       aio_fsync — asynchronous file synchronization
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;aio.h&gt;

       int aio_fsync(int <i>op</i>, struct aiocb *<i>aiocbp</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_fsync</i>() function shall asynchronously perform a file
       synchronization operation, as specified by the <i>op</i> argument, for
       I/O operations associated with the file indicated by the file
       descriptor <i>aio_fildes</i> member of the <b>aiocb </b>structure referenced by
       the <i>aiocbp</i> argument and queued at the time of the call to
       <i>aio_fsync</i>().  The function call shall return when the
       synchronization request has been initiated or queued to the file
       or device (even when the data cannot be synchronized
       immediately).

       If <i>op</i> is O_DSYNC, all currently queued I/O operations shall be
       completed as if by a call to <i>fdatasync</i>(); that is, as defined for
       synchronized I/O data integrity completion.

       If <i>op</i> is O_SYNC, all currently queued I/O operations shall be
       completed as if by a call to <i>fsync</i>(); that is, as defined for
       synchronized I/O file integrity completion.  If the <i>aio_fsync</i>()
       function fails, or if the operation queued by <i>aio_fsync</i>() fails,
       then outstanding I/O operations are not guaranteed to have been
       completed.

       If <i>aio_fsync</i>() succeeds, then it is only the I/O that was queued
       at the time of the call to <i>aio_fsync</i>() that is guaranteed to be
       forced to the relevant completion state. The completion of
       subsequent I/O on the file descriptor is not guaranteed to be
       completed in a synchronized fashion.

       The <i>aiocbp</i> argument refers to an asynchronous I/O control block.
       The <i>aiocbp</i> value may be used as an argument to <i>aio_error</i>() and
       <i>aio_return</i>() in order to determine the error status and return
       status, respectively, of the asynchronous operation while it is
       proceeding. When the request is queued, the error status for the
       operation is <b>[EINPROGRESS]</b>.  When all data has been successfully
       transferred, the error status shall be reset to reflect the
       success or failure of the operation. If the operation does not
       complete successfully, the error status for the operation shall
       be set to indicate the error. The <i>aio_sigevent</i> member determines
       the asynchronous notification to occur as specified in <i>Section</i>
       <i>2.4.1</i>, <i>Signal Generation and Delivery</i> when all operations have
       achieved synchronized I/O completion. All other members of the
       structure referenced by <i>aiocbp</i> are ignored. If the control block
       referenced by <i>aiocbp</i> becomes an illegal address prior to
       asynchronous I/O completion, then the behavior is undefined.

       If the <i>aio_fsync</i>() function fails or <i>aiocbp</i> indicates an error
       condition, data is not guaranteed to have been successfully
       transferred.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_fsync</i>() function shall return the value 0 if the I/O
       operation is successfully queued; otherwise, the function shall
       return the value -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>aio_fsync</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The requested asynchronous operation was not queued due to
              temporary resource limitations.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>aio_fildes</i> member of the <b>aiocb </b>structure referenced by
              the <i>aiocbp</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EINVAL </b>This implementation does not support synchronized I/O for
              this file.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>aio_fildes</i> member of the <b>aiocb </b>structure refers to a
              file on which an <i>fsync</i>() operation is not possible.

       <b>EINVAL </b>A value of <i>op</i> other than O_DSYNC or O_SYNC was specified,
              or O_DSYNC was specified and the implementation does not
              provide runtime support for the Synchronized Input and
              Output option, or O_SYNC was specified and the
              implementation does not provide runtime support for the
              File Synchronization option.

       In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail,
       <i>aio_fsync</i>() shall return the error condition defined for <i>read</i>()
       and <i>write</i>().  The error is returned in the error status for the
       asynchronous operation, which can be retrieved using <i>aio_error</i>().

       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Note that even if the file descriptor is not open for writing, if
       there are any pending write requests on the underlying file, then
       that I/O will be completed prior to the return of a call to
       <i>aio_error</i>() or <i>aio_return</i>() indicating that the operation has
       completed.
