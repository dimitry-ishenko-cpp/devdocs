DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>

       PCRE2 provides a feature called "callout", which is a means of
       temporarily passing control to the caller of PCRE2 in the middle
       of pattern matching. The caller of PCRE2 provides an external
       function by putting its entry point in a match context (see
       <b>pcre2_set_callout() </b>in the <b>pcre2api </b>documentation).

       When using the <b>pcre2_substitute() </b>function, an additional callout
       feature is available. This does a callout after each change to
       the subject string and is described in the <b>pcre2api</b>
       documentation; the rest of this document is concerned with
       callouts during pattern matching.

       Within a regular expression, (?C&lt;arg&gt;) indicates a point at which
       the external function is to be called. Different callout points
       can be identified by putting a number less than 256 after the
       letter C. The default value is zero.  Alternatively, the argument
       may be a delimited string. The starting delimiter must be one of
       ` ' " ^ % # $ { and the ending delimiter is the same as the
       start, except for {, where the ending delimiter is }. If the
       ending delimiter is needed within the string, it must be doubled.
       For example, this pattern has two callout points:

         (?C1)abc(?C"some ""arbitrary"" text")def

       If the PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT option bit is set when a pattern is
       compiled, PCRE2 automatically inserts callouts, all with number
       255, before each item in the pattern except for immediately
       before or after an explicit callout. For example, if
       PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT is used with the pattern

         A(?C3)B

       it is processed as if it were

         (?C255)A(?C3)B(?C255)

       Here is a more complicated example:

         A(\d{2}|--)

       With PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT, this pattern is processed as if it were

         (?C255)A(?C255)((?C255)\d{2}(?C255)|(?C255)-(?C255)-(?C255))(?C255)

       Notice that there is a callout before and after each parenthesis
       and alternation bar. If the pattern contains a conditional group
       whose condition is an assertion, an automatic callout is inserted
       immediately before the condition. Such a callout may also be
       inserted explicitly, for example:

         (?(?C9)(?=a)ab|de)  (?(?C%text%)(?!=d)ab|de)

       This applies only to assertion conditions (because they are
       themselves independent groups).

       Callouts can be useful for tracking the progress of pattern
       matching. The <b>pcre2test </b>program has a pattern qualifier
       (/auto_callout) that sets automatic callouts.  When any callouts
       are present, the output from <b>pcre2test </b>indicates how the pattern
       is being matched. This is useful information when you are trying
       to optimize the performance of a particular pattern.
</pre> <h2>
MISSING CALLOUTS </h2>
<pre>

       You should be aware that, because of optimizations in the way
       PCRE2 compiles and matches patterns, callouts sometimes do not
       happen exactly as you might expect.

   <b>Auto-possessification</b>

       At compile time, PCRE2 "auto-possessifies" repeated items when it
       knows that what follows cannot be part of the repeat. For
       example, a+[bc] is compiled as if it were a++[bc]. The <b>pcre2test</b>
       output when this pattern is compiled with PCRE2_ANCHORED and
       PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT and then applied to the string "aaaa" is:

         ---&gt;aaaa
          +0 ^        a+
          +2 ^   ^    [bc]
         No match

       This indicates that when matching [bc] fails, there is no
       backtracking into a+ (because it is being treated as a++) and
       therefore the callouts that would be taken for the backtracks do
       not occur. You can disable the auto-possessify feature by passing
       PCRE2_NO_AUTO_POSSESS to <b>pcre2_compile()</b>, or starting the pattern
       with (*NO_AUTO_POSSESS). In this case, the output changes to
       this:

         ---&gt;aaaa
          +0 ^        a+
          +2 ^   ^    [bc]
          +2 ^  ^     [bc]
          +2 ^ ^      [bc]
          +2 ^^       [bc]
         No match

       This time, when matching [bc] fails, the matcher backtracks into
       a+ and tries again, repeatedly, until a+ itself fails.

   <b>Automatic .* anchoring</b>

       By default, an optimization is applied when .* is the first
       significant item in a pattern. If PCRE2_DOTALL is set, so that
       the dot can match any character, the pattern is automatically
       anchored. If PCRE2_DOTALL is not set, a match can start only
       after an internal newline or at the beginning of the subject, and
       <b>pcre2_compile() </b>remembers this. If a pattern has more than one
       top-level branch, automatic anchoring occurs if all branches are
       anchorable.

       This optimization is disabled, however, if .* is in an atomic
       group or if there is a backreference to the capture group in
       which it appears. It is also disabled if the pattern contains
       (*PRUNE) or (*SKIP). However, the presence of callouts does not
       affect it.

       For example, if the pattern .*\d is compiled with
       PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT and applied to the string "aa", the <b>pcre2test</b>
       output is:

         ---&gt;aa
          +0 ^      .*
          +2 ^ ^    \d
          +2 ^^     \d
          +2 ^      \d
         No match

       This shows that all match attempts start at the beginning of the
       subject. In other words, the pattern is anchored. You can disable
       this optimization by passing PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR to
       <b>pcre2_compile()</b>, or starting the pattern with
       (*NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR). In this case, the output changes to:

         ---&gt;aa
          +0 ^      .*
          +2 ^ ^    \d
          +2 ^^     \d
          +2 ^      \d
          +0  ^     .*
          +2  ^^    \d
          +2  ^     \d
         No match

       This shows more match attempts, starting at the second subject
       character.  Another optimization, described in the next section,
       means that there is no subsequent attempt to match with an empty
       subject.

   <b>Other optimizations</b>

       Other optimizations that provide fast "no match" results also
       affect callouts.  For example, if the pattern is

         ab(?C4)cd

       PCRE2 knows that any matching string must contain the letter "d".
       If the subject string is "abyz", the lack of "d" means that
       matching doesn't ever start, and the callout is never reached.
       However, with "abyd", though the result is still no match, the
       callout is obeyed.

       For most patterns PCRE2 also knows the minimum length of a
       matching string, and will immediately give a "no match" return
       without actually running a match if the subject is not long
       enough, or, for unanchored patterns, if it has been scanned far
       enough.

       You can disable these optimizations by passing the
       PCRE2_NO_START_OPTIMIZE option to <b>pcre2_compile()</b>, or by starting
       the pattern with (*NO_START_OPT). This slows down the matching
       process, but does ensure that callouts such as the example above
       are obeyed.
</pre> <h2>
THE CALLOUT INTERFACE </h2>
<pre>

       During matching, when PCRE2 reaches a callout point, if an
       external function is provided in the match context, it is called.
       This applies to both normal, DFA, and JIT matching. The first
       argument to the callout function is a pointer to a <b>pcre2_callout</b>
       block. The second argument is the void * callout data that was
       supplied when the callout was set up by calling
       <b>pcre2_set_callout() </b>(see the <b>pcre2api </b>documentation). The callout
       block structure contains the following fields, not necessarily in
       this order:

         uint32_t      <i>version</i>;
         uint32_t      <i>callout_number</i>;
         uint32_t      <i>capture_top</i>;
         uint32_t      <i>capture_last</i>;
         uint32_t      <i>callout_flags</i>;
         PCRE2_SIZE   *<i>offset_vector</i>;
         PCRE2_SPTR    <i>mark</i>;
         PCRE2_SPTR    <i>subject</i>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <i>subject_length</i>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <i>start_match</i>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <i>current_position</i>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <i>pattern_position</i>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <i>next_item_length</i>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <i>callout_string_offset</i>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <i>callout_string_length</i>;
         PCRE2_SPTR    <i>callout_string</i>;

       The <i>version</i> field contains the version number of the block
       format. The current version is 2; the three callout string fields
       were added for version 1, and the <i>callout_flags</i> field for version
       2. If you are writing an application that might use an earlier
       release of PCRE2, you should check the version number before
       accessing any of these fields. The version number will increase
       in future if more fields are added, but the intention is never to
       remove any of the existing fields.

   <b>Fields for numerical callouts</b>

       For a numerical callout, <i>callout_string</i> is NULL, and
       <i>callout_number</i> contains the number of the callout, in the range
       0-255. This is the number that follows (?C for callouts that part
       of the pattern; it is 255 for automatically generated callouts.

   <b>Fields for string callouts</b>

       For callouts with string arguments, <i>callout_number</i> is always
       zero, and <i>callout_string</i> points to the string that is contained
       within the compiled pattern. Its length is given by
       <i>callout_string_length</i>. Duplicated ending delimiters that were
       present in the original pattern string have been turned into
       single characters, but there is no other processing of the
       callout string argument. An additional code unit containing
       binary zero is present after the string, but is not included in
       the length. The delimiter that was used to start the string is
       also stored within the pattern, immediately before the string
       itself. You can access this delimiter as <i>callout_string</i>[-1] if
       you need it.

       The <i>callout_string_offset</i> field is the code unit offset to the
       start of the callout argument string within the original pattern
       string. This is provided for the benefit of applications such as
       script languages that might need to report errors in the callout
       string within the pattern.

   <b>Fields for all callouts</b>

       The remaining fields in the callout block are the same for both
       kinds of callout.

       The <i>offset_vector</i> field is a pointer to a vector of capturing
       offsets (the "ovector"). You may read the elements in this
       vector, but you must not change any of them.

       For calls to <b>pcre2_match()</b>, the <i>offset_vector</i> field is not (since
       release 10.30) a pointer to the actual ovector that was passed to
       the matching function in the match data block. Instead it points
       to an internal ovector of a size large enough to hold all
       possible captured substrings in the pattern. Note that whenever a
       recursion or subroutine call within a pattern completes, the
       capturing state is reset to what it was before.

       The <i>capture_last</i> field contains the number of the most recently
       captured substring, and the <i>capture_top</i> field contains one more
       than the number of the highest numbered captured substring so
       far. If no substrings have yet been captured, the value of
       <i>capture_last</i> is 0 and the value of <i>capture_top</i> is 1. The values
       of these fields do not always differ by one; for example, when
       the callout in the pattern ((a)(b))(?C2) is taken, <i>capture_last</i>
       is 1 but <i>capture_top</i> is 4.

       The contents of ovector[2] to ovector[&lt;capture_top&gt;*2-1] can be
       inspected in order to extract substrings that have been matched
       so far, in the same way as extracting substrings after a match
       has completed. The values in ovector[0] and ovector[1] are always
       PCRE2_UNSET because the match is by definition not complete.
       Substrings that have not been captured but whose numbers are less
       than <i>capture_top</i> also have both of their ovector slots set to
       PCRE2_UNSET.

       For DFA matching, the <i>offset_vector</i> field points to the ovector
       that was passed to the matching function in the match data block
       for callouts at the top level, but to an internal ovector during
       the processing of pattern recursions, lookarounds, and atomic
       groups. However, these ovectors hold no useful information
       because <b>pcre2_dfa_match() </b>does not support substring capturing.
       The value of <i>capture_top</i> is always 1 and the value of
       <i>capture_last</i> is always 0 for DFA matching.

       The <i>subject</i> and <i>subject_length</i> fields contain copies of the
       values that were passed to the matching function.

       The <i>start_match</i> field normally contains the offset within the
       subject at which the current match attempt started. However, if
       the escape sequence \K has been encountered, this value is
       changed to reflect the modified starting point. If the pattern is
       not anchored, the callout function may be called several times
       from the same point in the pattern for different starting points
       in the subject.

       The <i>current_position</i> field contains the offset within the subject
       of the current match pointer.

       The <i>pattern_position</i> field contains the offset in the pattern
       string to the next item to be matched.

       The <i>next_item_length</i> field contains the length of the next item
       to be processed in the pattern string. When the callout is at the
       end of the pattern, the length is zero. When the callout precedes
       an opening parenthesis, the length includes meta characters that
       follow the parenthesis. For example, in a callout before an
       assertion such as (?=ab) the length is 3. For an alternation bar
       or a closing parenthesis, the length is one, unless a closing
       parenthesis is followed by a quantifier, in which case its length
       is included. (This changed in release 10.23. In earlier releases,
       before an opening parenthesis the length was that of the entire
       group, and before an alternation bar or a closing parenthesis the
       length was zero.)

       The <i>pattern_position</i> and <i>next_item_length</i> fields are intended to
       help in distinguishing between different automatic callouts,
       which all have the same callout number. However, they are set for
       all callouts, and are used by <b>pcre2test </b>to show the next item to
       be matched when displaying callout information.

       In callouts from <b>pcre2_match() </b>the <i>mark</i> field contains a pointer
       to the zero-terminated name of the most recently passed (*MARK),
       (*PRUNE), or (*THEN) item in the match, or NULL if no such items
       have been passed. Instances of (*PRUNE) or (*THEN) without a name
       do not obliterate a previous (*MARK). In callouts from the DFA
       matching function this field always contains NULL.

       The <i>callout_flags</i> field is always zero in callouts from
       <b>pcre2_dfa_match() </b>or when JIT is being used. When <b>pcre2_match()</b>
       without JIT is used, the following bits may be set:

         PCRE2_CALLOUT_STARTMATCH

       This is set for the first callout after the start of matching for
       each new starting position in the subject.

         PCRE2_CALLOUT_BACKTRACK

       This is set if there has been a matching backtrack since the
       previous callout, or since the start of matching if this is the
       first callout from a <b>pcre2_match() </b>run.

       Both bits are set when a backtrack has caused a "bumpalong" to a
       new starting position in the subject. Output from <b>pcre2test </b>does
       not indicate the presence of these bits unless the <b>callout_extra</b>
       modifier is set.

       The information in the <b>callout_flags </b>field is provided so that
       applications can track and tell their users how matching with
       backtracking is done. This can be useful when trying to optimize
       patterns, or just to understand how PCRE2 works. There is no
       support in <b>pcre2_dfa_match() </b>because there is no backtracking in
       DFA matching, and there is no support in JIT because JIT is all
       about maximimizing matching performance. In both these cases the
       <b>callout_flags </b>field is always zero.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES FROM CALLOUTS </h2>
<pre>

       The external callout function returns an integer to PCRE2. If the
       value is zero, matching proceeds as normal. If the value is
       greater than zero, matching fails at the current point, but the
       testing of other matching possibilities goes ahead, just as if a
       lookahead assertion had failed. If the value is less than zero,
       the match is abandoned, and the matching function returns the
       negative value.

       Negative values should normally be chosen from the set of
       PCRE2_ERROR_xxx values. In particular, PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH forces
       a standard "no match" failure. The error number
       PCRE2_ERROR_CALLOUT is reserved for use by callout functions; it
       will never be used by PCRE2 itself.
</pre> <h2>
CALLOUT ENUMERATION </h2>
<pre>

       <b>int pcre2_callout_enumerate(const pcre2_code *</b><i>code</i><b>,</b>
         <b>int (*</b><i>callback</i><b>)(pcre2_callout_enumerate_block *, void *),</b>
         <b>void *</b><i>user_data</i><b>);</b>

       A script language that supports the use of string arguments in
       callouts might like to scan all the callouts in a pattern before
       running the match. This can be done by calling
       <b>pcre2_callout_enumerate()</b>. The first argument is a pointer to a
       compiled pattern, the second points to a callback function, and
       the third is arbitrary user data. The callback function is called
       for every callout in the pattern in the order in which they
       appear. Its first argument is a pointer to a callout enumeration
       block, and its second argument is the <i>user_data</i> value that was
       passed to <b>pcre2_callout_enumerate()</b>. The data block contains the
       following fields:

         <i>version</i>                Block version number
         <i>pattern_position</i>       Offset to next item in pattern
         <i>next_item_length</i>       Length of next item in pattern
         <i>callout_number</i>         Number for numbered callouts
         <i>callout_string_offset</i>  Offset to string within pattern
         <i>callout_string_length</i>  Length of callout string
         <i>callout_string</i>         Points to callout string or is NULL

       The version number is currently 0. It will increase if new fields
       are ever added to the block. The remaining fields are the same as
       their namesakes in the <b>pcre2_callout </b>block that is used for
       callouts during matching, as described above.

       Note that the value of <i>pattern_position</i> is unique for each
       callout.  However, if a callout occurs inside a group that is
       quantified with a non-zero minimum or a fixed maximum, the group
       is replicated inside the compiled pattern. For example, a pattern
       such as /(a){2}/ is compiled as if it were /(a)(a)/. This means
       that the callout will be enumerated more than once, but with the
       same value for <i>pattern_position</i> in each case.

       The callback function should normally return zero. If it returns
       a non-zero value, scanning the pattern stops, and that value is
       returned from <b>pcre2_callout_enumerate()</b>.
