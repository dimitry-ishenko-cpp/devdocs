DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>posix_spawn</b>() and <b>posix_spawnp</b>() functions are used to create
       a new child process that executes a specified file.  These
       functions were specified by POSIX to provide a standardized
       method of creating new processes on machines that lack the
       capability to support the <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> system call.  These machines
       are generally small, embedded systems lacking MMU support.

       The <b>posix_spawn</b>() and <b>posix_spawnp</b>() functions provide the
       functionality of a combined <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and <a href="exec.3.html">exec(3)</a>, with some
       optional housekeeping steps in the child process before the
       <a href="exec.3.html">exec(3)</a>.  These functions are not meant to replace the <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>
       and <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a> system calls.  In fact, they provide only a subset
       of the functionality that can be achieved by using the system
       calls.

       The only difference between <b>posix_spawn</b>() and <b>posix_spawnp</b>() is
       the manner in which they specify the file to be executed by the
       child process.  With <b>posix_spawn</b>(), the executable file is
       specified as a pathname (which can be absolute or relative).
       With <b>posix_spawnp</b>(), the executable file is specified as a simple
       filename; the system searches for this file in the list of
       directories specified by <b>PATH </b>(in the same way as for <a href="execvp.3.html">execvp(3)</a>).
       For the remainder of this page, the discussion is phrased in
       terms of <b>posix_spawn</b>(), with the understanding that
       <b>posix_spawnp</b>() differs only on the point just described.

       The remaining arguments to these two functions are as follows:

       <i>pid</i>    points to a buffer that is used to return the process ID
              of the new child process.

       <i>file_actions</i>
              points to a <i>spawn file actions object</i> that specifies file-
              related actions to be performed in the child between the
              <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and <a href="exec.3.html">exec(3)</a> steps.  This object is initialized and
              populated before the <b>posix_spawn</b>() call using
              <b>posix_spawn_file_actions_init</b>(3) and the
              <b>posix_spawn_file_actions_*</b>() functions.

       <i>attrp</i>  points to an <i>attributes objects</i> that specifies various
              attributes of the created child process.  This object is
              initialized and populated before the <b>posix_spawn</b>() call
              using <b>posix_spawnattr_init</b>(3) and the <b>posix_spawnattr_*</b>()
              functions.

       <i>argv</i>
       <i>envp</i>   specify the argument list and environment for the program
              that is executed in the child process, as for <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       Below, the functions are described in terms of a three-step
       process: the <b>fork</b>() step, the pre-<b>exec</b>() step (executed in the
       child), and the <b>exec</b>() step (executed in the child).

   <b>fork() step</b>
       Since glibc 2.24, the <b>posix_spawn</b>() function commences by calling
       <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> with <b>CLONE_VM </b>and <b>CLONE_VFORK </b>flags.  Older
       implementations use <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, or possibly <a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork(2)</a> (see below).

       The PID of the new child process is placed in <i>*pid</i>.  The
       <b>posix_spawn</b>() function then returns control to the parent
       process.

       Subsequently, the parent can use one of the system calls
       described in <a href="../man2/wait.2.html">wait(2)</a> to check the status of the child process.
       If the child fails in any of the housekeeping steps described
       below, or fails to execute the desired file, it exits with a
       status of 127.

       Before glibc 2.24, the child process is created using <a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork(2)</a>
       instead of <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> when either of the following is true:

       •  the <i>spawn-flags</i> element of the attributes object pointed to by
          <i>attrp</i> contains the GNU-specific flag <b>POSIX_SPAWN_USEVFORK</b>; or

       •  <i>file_actions</i> is NULL and the <i>spawn-flags</i> element of the
          attributes object pointed to by <i>attrp</i> does <i>not</i> contain
          <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK</b>, <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF</b>,
          <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM</b>, <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER</b>,
          <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP</b>, or <b>POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS</b>.

       In other words, <a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork(2)</a> is used if the caller requests it, or if
       there is no cleanup expected in the child before it <a href="exec.3.html">exec(3)</a>s the
       requested file.

   <b>pre-exec() step: housekeeping</b>
       In between the <b>fork() </b>and the <b>exec() </b>steps, a child process may
       need to perform a set of housekeeping actions.  The <b>posix_spawn</b>()
       and <b>posix_spawnp</b>() functions support a small, well-defined set of
       system tasks that the child process can accomplish before it
       executes the executable file.  These operations are controlled by
       the attributes object pointed to by <i>attrp</i> and the file actions
       object pointed to by <i>file_actions</i>.  In the child, processing is
       done in the following sequence:

       (1)  Process attribute actions: signal mask, signal default
            handlers, scheduling algorithm and parameters, process
            group, and effective user and group IDs are changed as
            specified by the attributes object pointed to by <i>attrp</i>.

       (2)  File actions, as specified in the <i>file_actions</i> argument, are
            performed in the order that they were specified using calls
            to the <b>posix_spawn_file_actions_add*</b>() functions.

       (3)  File descriptors with the <b>FD_CLOEXEC </b>flag set are closed.

       All process attributes in the child, other than those affected by
       attributes specified in the object pointed to by <i>attrp</i> and the
       file actions in the object pointed to by <i>file_actions</i>, will be
       affected as though the child was created with <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and it
       executed the program with <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       The process attributes actions are defined by the attributes
       object pointed to by <i>attrp</i>.  The <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute (set using
       <b>posix_spawnattr_setflags</b>(3)) controls the general actions that
       occur, and other attributes in the object specify values to be
       used during those actions.

       The effects of the flags that may be specified in <i>spawn-flags</i> are
       as follows:

       <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK</b>
              Set the signal mask to the signal set specified in the
              <i>spawn-sigmask</i> attribute of the object pointed to by <i>attrp</i>.
              If the <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK </b>flag is not set, then the
              child inherits the parent's signal mask.

       <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF</b>
              Reset the disposition of all signals in the set specified
              in the <i>spawn-sigdefault</i> attribute of the object pointed to
              by <i>attrp</i> to the default.  For the treatment of the
              dispositions of signals not specified in the <i>spawn-</i>
              <i>sigdefault</i> attribute, or the treatment when
              <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF </b>is not specified, see <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.

       <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM</b>
              If this flag is set, and the <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER </b>flag
              is not set, then set the scheduling parameters to the
              parameters specified in the <i>spawn-schedparam</i> attribute of
              the object pointed to by <i>attrp</i>.

       <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER</b>
              Set the scheduling policy algorithm and parameters of the
              child, as follows:

              •  The scheduling policy is set to the value specified in
                 the <i>spawn-schedpolicy</i> attribute of the object pointed
                 to by <i>attrp</i>.

              •  The scheduling parameters are set to the value
                 specified in the <i>spawn-schedparam</i> attribute of the
                 object pointed to by <i>attrp</i> (but see BUGS).

              If the <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM </b>and
              <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPOLICY </b>flags are not specified, the
              child inherits the corresponding scheduling attributes
              from the parent.

       <b>POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS</b>
              If this flag is set, reset the effective UID and GID to
              the real UID and GID of the parent process.  If this flag
              is not set, then the child retains the effective UID and
              GID of the parent.  In either case, if the set-user-ID and
              set-group-ID permission bits are enabled on the executable
              file, their effect will override the setting of the
              effective UID and GID (se <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>).

       <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP</b>
              Set the process group to the value specified in the <i>spawn-</i>
              <i>pgroup</i> attribute of the object pointed to by <i>attrp</i>.  If
              the <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute has the value 0, the child's
              process group ID is made the same as its process ID.  If
              the <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP </b>flag is not set, the child
              inherits the parent's process group ID.

       <b>POSIX_SPAWN_USEVFORK</b>
              Since glibc 2.24, this flag has no effect.  On older
              implementations, setting this flag forces the <b>fork() </b>step
              to use <a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork(2)</a> instead of <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.  The <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>
              feature test macro must be defined to obtain the
              definition of this constant.

       <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID </b>(since glibc 2.26)
              If this flag is set, the child process shall create a new
              session and become the session leader.  The child process
              shall also become the process group leader of the new
              process group in the session (see <a href="../man2/setsid.2.html">setsid(2)</a>).  The
              <b>_GNU_SOURCE </b>feature test macro must be defined to obtain
              the definition of this constant.

       If <i>attrp</i> is NULL, then the default behaviors described above for
       each flag apply.

       The <i>file_actions</i> argument specifies a sequence of file operations
       that are performed in the child process after the general
       processing described above, and before it performs the <a href="exec.3.html">exec(3)</a>.
       If <i>file_actions</i> is NULL, then no special action is taken, and
       standard <a href="exec.3.html">exec(3)</a> semantics apply—file descriptors open before the
       exec remain open in the new process, except those for which the
       <b>FD_CLOEXEC </b>flag has been set.  File locks remain in place.

       If <i>file_actions</i> is not NULL, then it contains an ordered set of
       requests to <a href="../man2/open.2.html">open(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/close.2.html">close(2)</a>, and <a href="../man2/dup2.2.html">dup2(2)</a> files.  These requests
       are added to the <i>file_actions</i> by
       <b>posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen</b>(3),
       <b>posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose</b>(3), and
       <b>posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2</b>(3).  The requested operations
       are performed in the order they were added to <i>file_actions</i>.

       If any of the housekeeping actions fails (due to bogus values
       being passed or other reasons why signal handling, process
       scheduling, process group ID functions, and file descriptor
       operations might fail), the child process exits with exit value
       127.

   <b>exec() step</b>
       Once the child has successfully forked and performed all
       requested pre-exec steps, the child runs the requested
       executable.

       The child process takes its environment from the <i>envp</i> argument,
       which is interpreted as if it had been passed to <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.  The
       arguments to the created process come from the <i>argv</i> argument,
       which is processed as for <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <b>posix_spawn</b>() and <b>posix_spawnp</b>()
       place the PID of the child process in <i>pid</i>, and return 0.  If
       there is an error during the <b>fork() </b>step, then no child is
       created, the contents of <i>*pid</i> are unspecified, and these
       functions return an error number as described below.

       Even when these functions return a success status, the child
       process may still fail for a plethora of reasons related to its
       pre-<b>exec</b>() initialization.  In addition, the <a href="exec.3.html">exec(3)</a> may fail.
       In all of these cases, the child process will exit with the exit
       value of 127.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>posix_spawn</b>() and <b>posix_spawnp</b>() functions fail only in the
       case where the underlying <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork(2)</a>, or <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a> call
       fails;  in these cases, these functions return an error number,
       which will be one of the errors described for <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>, <a href="../man2/vfork.2.html">vfork(2)</a>,
       or <a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone(2)</a>.

       In addition, these functions fail if:

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>

</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The housekeeping activities in the child are controlled by the
       objects pointed to by <i>attrp</i> (for non-file actions) and
       <i>file_actions</i> In POSIX parlance, the <i>posix_spawnattr_t</i> and
       <i>posix_spawn_file_actions_t</i> data types are referred to as objects,
       and their elements are not specified by name.  Portable programs
       should initialize these objects using only the POSIX-specified
       functions.  (In other words, although these objects may be
       implemented as structures containing fields, portable programs
       must avoid dependence on such implementation details.)

       According to POSIX, it is unspecified whether fork handlers
       established with <a href="pthread_atfork.3.html">pthread_atfork(3)</a> are called when <b>posix_spawn</b>()
       is invoked.  Since glibc 2.24, the fork handlers are not executed
       in any case.  On older implementations, fork handlers are called
       only if the child is created using <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a>.

       There is no "posix_fspawn" function (i.e., a function that is to
       <b>posix_spawn</b>() as <a href="fexecve.3.html">fexecve(3)</a> is to <a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve(2)</a>).  However, this
       functionality can be obtained by specifying the <i>path</i> argument as
       one of the files in the caller's <i>/proc/self/fd</i> directory.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.1 says that when <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER </b>is specified in
       <i>spawn-flags</i>, then the <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM </b>(if present) is
       ignored.  However, before glibc 2.14, calls to <b>posix_spawn</b>()
       failed with an error if <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER </b>was specified
       without also specifying <b>POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM</b>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The program below demonstrates the use of various functions in
       the POSIX spawn API.  The program accepts command-line attributes
       that can be used to create file actions and attributes objects.
       The remaining command-line arguments are used as the executable
       name and command-line arguments of the program that is executed
       in the child.

       In the first run, the <a href="../man1/date.1.html">date(1)</a> command is executed in the child,
       and the <b>posix_spawn</b>() call employs no file actions or attributes
       objects.

           $ <b>./a.out date</b>
           PID of child: 7634
           Tue Feb  1 19:47:50 CEST 2011
           Child status: exited, status=0

       In the next run, the <i>-c</i> command-line option is used to create a
       file actions object that closes standard output in the child.
       Consequently, <a href="../man1/date.1.html">date(1)</a> fails when trying to perform output and
       exits with a status of 1.

           $ <b>./a.out -c date</b>
           PID of child: 7636
           date: write error: Bad file descriptor
           Child status: exited, status=1

       In the next run, the <i>-s</i> command-line option is used to create an
       attributes object that specifies that all (blockable) signals in
       the child should be blocked.  Consequently, trying to kill child
       with the default signal sent by <a href="../man1/kill.1.html">kill(1)</a> (i.e., <b>SIGTERM</b>) fails,
       because that signal is blocked.  Therefore, to kill the child,
       <b>SIGKILL </b>is necessary (<b>SIGKILL </b>can't be blocked).

           $ <b>./a.out -s sleep 60 &amp;</b>
           [1] 7637
           $ PID of child: 7638

       $ <b>kill 7638</b>
       $ <b>kill -KILL 7638</b>
       $ Child status: killed by signal 9
       [1]+  Done                    ./a.out -s sleep 60

       When we try to execute a nonexistent command in the child, the
       <a href="exec.3.html">exec(3)</a> fails and the child exits with a status of 127.

           $ <b>./a.out xxxxx</b>
           <b>PID of child: 10190</b>
           <b>Child status: exited, status=127</b>
