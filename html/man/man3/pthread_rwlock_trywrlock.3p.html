PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_rwlock_trywrlock, pthread_rwlock_wrlock — lock a read-
       write lock object for writing
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *<i>rwlock</i>);
       int pthread_rwlock_wrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *<i>rwlock</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</i>() function shall apply a write lock
       like the <i>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</i>() function, with the exception
       that the function shall fail if any thread currently holds <i>rwlock</i>
       (for reading or writing).

       The <i>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</i>() function shall apply a write lock to
       the read-write lock referenced by <i>rwlock</i>.  The calling thread
       shall acquire the write lock if no thread (reader or writer)
       holds the read-write lock <i>rwlock</i>.  Otherwise, if another thread
       holds the read-write lock <i>rwlock</i>, the calling thread shall block
       until it can acquire the lock.  If a deadlock condition occurs or
       the calling thread already owns the read-write lock for writing
       or reading, the call shall either deadlock or return <b>[EDEADLK]</b>.

       Results are undefined if any of these functions are called with
       an uninitialized read-write lock.

       If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a read-write
       lock for writing, upon return from the signal handler the thread
       resumes waiting for the read-write lock for writing as if it was
       not interrupted.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</i>() function shall return zero if the
       lock for writing on the read-write lock object referenced by
       <i>rwlock</i> is acquired. Otherwise, an error number shall be returned
       to indicate the error.

       If successful, the <i>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</i>() function shall return
       zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
       the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBUSY  </b>The read-write lock could not be acquired for writing
              because it was already locked for reading or writing.

       The <i>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EDEADLK</b>
              A deadlock condition was detected or the current thread
              already owns the read-write lock for writing or reading.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications using these functions may be subject to priority
       inversion, as discussed in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.291</i>, <i>Priority Inversion</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>rwlock</i> argument to <i>pthread_rwlock_trywrlock</i>() or
       <i>pthread_rwlock_wrlock</i>() does not refer to an initialized read-
       write lock object, it is recommended that the function should
       fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
