CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Within the libraries and applications of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) these routines are provide a convenient and safe
       alternative to <a href="system.3.html">system(3)</a> for executing commands in a separate
       process.

       Use <b>__pmProcessAddArg </b>to register the executable and command
       arguments in order.  <i>handle</i> should be set to <b>NULL </b>before the
       first call to <b>__pmProcessAddArg </b>for a particular command
       execution and it will be set to an opaque pointer to data
       structures that are manipulated in <b>__pmProcessAddArg</b>,
       <b>__pmProcessExec </b>and the related <a href="__pmprocesspipe.3.html">__pmProcessPipe(3)</a> routines.

       When called with <i>handle</i> set to <b>NULL </b><i>arg</i> is treated as the name of
       the command to be executed and subsequent calls (if any) are for
       the arguments to that command.  The name of the command can be a
       full pathname, or the name of an executable that can be found on
       the current <b>$PATH </b>as per the rules of <b>execvp</b>(2) that is used by
       <b>__pmProcessExec</b>.

       <b>__pmProcessUnpickArgs </b>is a convenience wrapper to assist
       conversion of code that assumes the <i>command</i> is a shell command
       that has been prepared for use with <a href="system.3.html">system(3)</a> or <a href="popen.3.html">popen(3)</a> in
       existing code.  The arguments in <i>command</i> are picked off one-by-
       one and used to call <b>__pmProcessAddArg</b>.  The parser is simple, as
       the routine is designed for simple shell command syntax, where
       arguments are separated by one or more spaces but embedded spaces
       within an argument are allowed if the argument is enclosed in
       single or double quotes.  More advanced shell syntax like escape
       characters and input-output redirection are not recognized.

       Once all the command name and arguments have been registered
       calling <b>__pmProcessExec </b>uses a <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and <b>execvp</b>(2) sequence to
       execute the command.

       The argument <i>toss</i> may be used to assign some or all of the
       standard I/O streams for the command to <i>/dev/null</i> - specifically
       <i>toss</i> is either <b>PM_EXEC_TOSS_NONE </b>to keep all I/O streams the same
       as the parent process, else the bit-wise or of <b>PM_EXEC_TOSS_STDIN</b>
       and/or <b>PM_EXEC_TOSS_STDOUT </b>and/or <b>PM_EXEC_TOSS_STDERR </b>to reassign
       <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout </b>and <b>stderr </b>respectively.  <b>PM_EXEC_TOSS_ALL </b>is a
       convenience macro equivalent to <b>PM_EXEC_TOSS_STDIN |</b>
       <b>PM_EXEC_TOSS_STDOUT | PM_EXEC_TOSS_STDERR</b>.

       The <i>wait</i> argument should be <b>PM_EXEC_WAIT </b>if <b>__pmProcessExec</b>
       should wait for completion of the command and harvest the exit
       status, else <b>PM_EXEC_NOWAIT </b>in which case <b>__pmProcessExec </b>returns
       immediately (effectively running the command in the background).

       Nested calling of <b>__pmProcessExec </b>and/or <a href="__pmprocesspipe.3.html">__pmProcessPipe(3)</a> is
       not allowed.  Once <b>__pmProcessAddArg </b>is called with <i>handle</i> set to
       <b>NULL </b>to start the registration and execution sequence any attempt
       to start a second registration sequence will be blocked until the
       first one is completed by calling <b>__pmProcessExec </b>or
       <a href="__pmprocesspipe.3.html">__pmProcessPipe(3)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       If successful <b>__pmProcessAddArg </b>returns 0.  Other conditions are
       rare (e.g. memory allocation failure) and are indicated by a
       return value that can be decoded using <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>.  When an
       error does occur <b>__pmProcessAddArg </b>cleans up any allocations made
       in the current call and uses <i>handle</i> to clean up any allocations
       made by previous calls so there is no need for the caller to
       worry about memory leaks, and then (re)sets <i>handle</i> to <b>NULL </b>before
       returning.

       <b>__pmProcessUnpickArgs </b>returns 0 on success.  In the case of an
       unterminated string, a message is generated and <b>PM_ERR_GENERIC </b>is
       returned.  Other return values less than 0 indicate a more
       serious error and the value can be decoded using <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>.
       When an error does occur the clean up is similar to
       <b>__pmProcessAddArg </b>so there is no need for the caller to worry
       about memory leaks.

       The return status from <b>__pmProcessExec </b>is more complicated.  If
       either <b>PM_EXEC_NOWAIT </b>is specified, or the command completes with
       an exit status of 0, the return value is 0.  Return values less
       than 0 indicate a more serious error and the value can be decoded
       using <a href="pmerrstr.3.html">pmErrStr(3)</a>.  If the command was executed, but did not exit
       with status of 0 then the return value is an encoding of the
       <a href="../man2/waitpid.2.html">waitpid(2)</a> status as follows: 2000 if something unknown went
       wrong, else if 1000 + signal number of the command was killed or
       stopped by a signal, else the exit status of the command.
