PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lchown — change the owner and group of a symbolic link
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int lchown(const char *<i>path</i>, uid_t <i>owner</i>, gid_t <i>group</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>lchown</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>chown</i>(), except in
       the case where the named file is a symbolic link. In this case,
       <i>lchown</i>() shall change the ownership of the symbolic link file
       itself, while <i>chown</i>() changes the ownership of the file or
       directory to which the symbolic link refers.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>lchown</i>() shall return 0. Otherwise,
       it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate an error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>lchown</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied on a component of the path
              prefix of <i>path</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The owner or group ID is not a value supported by the
              implementation.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
              or the <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The effective user ID does not match the owner of the file
              and the process does not have appropriate privileges.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The file resides on a read-only file system.

       The <i>lchown</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading or writing to the file
              system.

       <b>EINTR  </b>A signal was caught during execution of the function.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Changing the Current Owner of a File</b>
       The following example shows how to change the ownership of the
       symbolic link named <b>/modules/pass1 </b>to the user ID associated with
       ``jones'' and the group ID associated with ``cnd''.

       The numeric value for the user ID is obtained by using the
       <i>getpwnam</i>() function. The numeric value for the group ID is
       obtained by using the <i>getgrnam</i>() function.

           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;
           #include &lt;grp.h&gt;

           struct passwd *pwd;
           struct group  *grp;
           char          *path = "/modules/pass1";
           ...
           pwd = getpwnam("jones");
           grp = getgrnam("cnd");
           lchown(path, pwd-&gt;pw_uid, grp-&gt;gr_gid);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       On implementations which support symbolic links as directory
       entries rather than files, <i>lchown</i>() may fail.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
