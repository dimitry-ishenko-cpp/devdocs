PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fflush — flush a stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

       int fflush(FILE *<i>stream</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       If <i>stream</i> points to an output stream or an update stream in which
       the most recent operation was not input, <i>fflush</i>() shall cause any
       unwritten data for that stream to be written to the file, and the
       last data modification and last file status change timestamps of
       the underlying file shall be marked for update.

       For a stream open for reading with an underlying file
       description, if the file is not already at EOF, and the file is
       one capable of seeking, the file offset of the underlying open
       file description shall be set to the file position of the stream,
       and any characters pushed back onto the stream by <i>ungetc</i>() or
       <i>ungetwc</i>() that have not subsequently been read from the stream
       shall be discarded (without further changing the file offset).

       If <i>stream</i> is a null pointer, <i>fflush</i>() shall perform this flushing
       action on all streams for which the behavior is defined above.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>fflush</i>() shall return 0; otherwise,
       it shall set the error indicator for the stream, return EOF, and
       set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fflush</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor
              underlying <i>stream</i> and the thread would be delayed in the
              write operation.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The file descriptor underlying <i>stream</i> is not valid.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the
              maximum file size.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the file
              size limit of the process.

       <b>EFBIG  </b>The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to
              write at or beyond the offset maximum associated with the
              corresponding stream.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>fflush</i>() function was interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EIO    </b>The process is a member of a background process group
              attempting to write to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is
              set, the calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, the
              process is not ignoring SIGTTOU, and the process group of
              the process is orphaned.  This error may also be returned
              under implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>The underlying stream was created by <i>open_memstream</i>() or
              <i>open_wmemstream</i>() and insufficient memory is available.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>There was no free space remaining on the device containing
              the file or in the buffer used by the <i>fmemopen</i>() function.

       <b>EPIPE  </b>An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not
              open for reading by any process. A SIGPIPE signal shall
              also be sent to the thread.

       The <i>fflush</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENXIO  </b>A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request
              was outside the capabilities of the device.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Sending Prompts to Standard Output</b>
       The following example uses <i>printf</i>() calls to print a series of
       prompts for information the user must enter from standard input.
       The <i>fflush</i>() calls force the output to standard output. The
       <i>fflush</i>() function is used because standard output is usually
       buffered and the prompt may not immediately be printed on the
       output or terminal. The <i>getline</i>() function calls read strings
       from standard input and place the results in variables, for use
       later in the program.

           char *user;
           char *oldpasswd;
           char *newpasswd;
           ssize_t llen;
           size_t blen;
           struct termios term;
           tcflag_t saveflag;

           printf("User name: ");
           fflush(stdout);
           blen = 0;
           llen = getline(&amp;user, &amp;blen, stdin);
           user[llen-1] = 0;
           tcgetattr(fileno(stdin), &amp;term);
           saveflag = term.c_lflag;
           term.c_lflag &amp;= ~ECHO;
           tcsetattr(fileno(stdin), TCSANOW, &amp;term);
           printf("Old password: ");
           fflush(stdout);
           blen = 0;
           llen = getline(&amp;oldpasswd, &amp;blen, stdin);
           oldpasswd[llen-1] = 0;

           printf("\nNew password: ");
           fflush(stdout);
           blen = 0;
           llen = getline(&amp;newpasswd, &amp;blen, stdin);
           newpasswd[llen-1] = 0;
           term.c_lflag = saveflag;
           tcsetattr(fileno(stdin), TCSANOW, &amp;term);
           free(user);
           free(oldpasswd);
           free(newpasswd);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Data buffered by the system may make determining the validity of
       the position of the current file descriptor impractical. Thus,
       enforcing the repositioning of the file descriptor after <i>fflush</i>()
       on streams open for <i>read</i>() is not mandated by POSIX.1‐2008.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
