       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pipe — create an interprocess channel
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int pipe(int <i>fildes</i>[2]);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pipe</i>() function shall create a pipe and place two file
       descriptors, one each into the arguments <i>fildes</i>[0] and <i>fildes</i>[1],
       that refer to the open file descriptions for the read and write
       ends of the pipe. The file descriptors shall be allocated as
       described in <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>File Descriptor Allocation</i>.  The
       O_NONBLOCK and FD_CLOEXEC flags shall be clear on both file
       descriptors. (The <i>fcntl</i>() function can be used to set both these
       flags.)

       Data can be written to the file descriptor <i>fildes</i>[1] and read
       from the file descriptor <i>fildes</i>[0].  A read on the file
       descriptor <i>fildes</i>[0] shall access data written to the file
       descriptor <i>fildes</i>[1] on a first-in-first-out basis. It is
       unspecified whether <i>fildes</i>[0] is also open for writing and
       whether <i>fildes</i>[1] is also open for reading.

       A process has the pipe open for reading (correspondingly writing)
       if it has a file descriptor open that refers to the read end,
       <i>fildes</i>[0] (write end, <i>fildes</i>[1]).

       The pipe's user ID shall be set to the effective user ID of the
       calling process.

       The pipe's group ID shall be set to the effective group ID of the
       calling process.

       Upon successful completion, <i>pipe</i>() shall mark for update the last
       data access, last data modification, and last file status change
       timestamps of the pipe.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned; otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error, no file
       descriptors shall be allocated and the contents of <i>fildes</i> shall
       be left unmodified.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pipe</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EMFILE </b>All, or all but one, of the file descriptors available to
              the process are currently open.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The number of simultaneously open files in the system
              would exceed a system-imposed limit.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Using a Pipe to Pass Data Between a Parent Process and a Child</b>
       <b>Process</b>
       The following example demonstrates the use of a pipe to transfer
       data between a parent process and a child process. Error handling
       is excluded, but otherwise this code demonstrates good practice
       when using pipes: after the <i>fork</i>() the two processes close the
       unused ends of the pipe before they commence transferring data.

           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           ...

           int fildes[2];
           const int BSIZE = 100;
           char buf[BSIZE];
           ssize_t nbytes;
           int status;

           status = pipe(fildes);
           if (status == -1 ) {
               /* an error occurred */
               ...
           }

           switch (fork()) {
           case -1: /* Handle error */
               break;

           case 0:  /* Child - reads from pipe */
               close(fildes[1]);                       /* Write end is unused */
               nbytes = read(fildes[0], buf, BSIZE);   /* Get data from pipe */
               /* At this point, a further read would see end-of-file ... */
               close(fildes[0]);                       /* Finished with pipe */
               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);

           default:  /* Parent - writes to pipe */
               close(fildes[0]);                       /* Read end is unused */
               write(fildes[1], "Hello world\n", 12);  /* Write data on pipe */
               close(fildes[1]);                       /* Child will see EOF */
               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The wording carefully avoids using the verb ``to open'' in order
       to avoid any implication of use of <i>open</i>(); see also <i>write</i>().
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
