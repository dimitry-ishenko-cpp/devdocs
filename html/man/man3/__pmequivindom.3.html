CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and at some point in the future
       they may not work or may provide different semantics.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Within the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) each instance domain is
       assigned a unique Instance Domain Identifier (pmInDom).
       Internally a pmInDom is constructed from 2 fields: the domain
       number (of the associated Performance Metrics Domain Agent, or
       PMDA) and the serial number (assigned by the PMDA).

       In some unusual circumstances different PMDAs may support
       independent Instance Domains that are semantically equivalent,
       e.g. per CPU or per process identifier.  <b>__pmEquivInDom </b>provides
       a mechanism to determine if Instance Domain <i>a</i> is equivalent to
       Instance Domain <i>b</i>.

       The ``equivalence'' of Instance Domains is defined by an external
       configuration file, identified by the environment variable
       <b>$PCP_INDOM_CONFIG </b>or <b>$PCP_ETC_DIR/pcp/indom.config </b>by default.
       The format for the configuration file is defined in the
       CONFIGURATION FILE section below.

       If <b>$PCP_INDOM_CONFIG </b>is an empty string, no equivalence mapping
       is loaded.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE </h2>
<pre>
       An Instance Domain equivalence mapping file conforms to the
       following syntax:
       1.  Lines beginning with optional white space, followed by ``#''
           are considered comments.
       2.  Blank lines are ignored.
       3.  Each remaining line defines one `equivalence map'' with a
           list of white-space separated instance domains, each
           consisting of a number (the domain number), a period ``.''
           and a number (the serial number).  As a special case to
           ``match all serial numbers'', the serial number part can be
           ``*''.

       The format of a <i>pmInDom</i> demands that a domain number is in the
       range 0 to 511, and a numeric serial number is in the range 0 to
       4194303.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS AND RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       The return value is 1 if the Instance Domains are equivalent,
       else 0 if they are not.  In rare cases a return value of -1 is
       used to indicate some problem (reported on standard error) in
       opening or parsing the configuration file.
