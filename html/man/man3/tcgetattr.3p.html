<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       tcgetattr — get the parameters associated with the terminal
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;termios.h&gt;

       int tcgetattr(int <i>fildes</i>, struct termios *<i>termios_p</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tcgetattr</i>() function shall get the parameters associated with
       the terminal referred to by <i>fildes</i> and store them in the <b>termios</b>
       structure referenced by <i>termios_p</i>.  The <i>fildes</i> argument is an
       open file descriptor associated with a terminal.

       The <i>termios_p</i> argument is a pointer to a <b>termios </b>structure.

       The <i>tcgetattr</i>() operation is allowed from any process.

       If the terminal device supports different input and output baud
       rates, the baud rates stored in the <b>termios </b>structure returned by
       <i>tcgetattr</i>() shall reflect the actual baud rates, even if they are
       equal. If differing baud rates are not supported, the rate
       returned as the output baud rate shall be the actual baud rate.
       If the terminal device does not support split baud rates, the
       input baud rate stored in the <b>termios </b>structure shall be the
       output rate (as one of the symbolic values).
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tcgetattr</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ENOTTY </b>The file associated with <i>fildes</i> is not a terminal.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Care must be taken when changing the terminal attributes.
       Applications should always do a <i>tcgetattr</i>(), save the <b>termios</b>
       structure values returned, and then do a <i>tcsetattr</i>(), changing
       only the necessary fields. The application should use the values
       saved from the <i>tcgetattr</i>() to reset the terminal state whenever
       it is done with the terminal.  This is necessary because terminal
       attributes apply to the underlying port and not to each
       individual open instance; that is, all processes that have used
       the terminal see the latest attribute changes.

       A program that uses these functions should be written to catch
       all signals and take other appropriate actions to ensure that
       when the program terminates, whether planned or not, the terminal
       device's state is restored to its original state.

       Existing practice dealing with error returns when only part of a
       request can be honored is based on calls to the <i>ioctl</i>() function.
       In historical BSD and System V implementations, the corresponding
       <i>ioctl</i>() returns zero if the requested actions were semantically
       correct, even if some of the requested changes could not be made.
       Many existing applications assume this behavior and would no
       longer work correctly if the return value were changed from zero
       to -1 in this case.

       Note that either specification has a problem. When zero is
       returned, it implies everything succeeded even if some of the
       changes were not made. When -1 is returned, it implies everything
       failed even though some of the changes were made.

       Applications that need all of the requested changes made to work
       properly should follow <i>tcsetattr</i>() with a call to <i>tcgetattr</i>() and
       compare the appropriate field values.
