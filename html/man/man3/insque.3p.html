PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       insque, remque — insert or remove an element in a queue
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;search.h&gt;

       void insque(void *<i>element</i>, void *<i>pred</i>);
       void remque(void *<i>element</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>insque</i>() and <i>remque</i>() functions shall manipulate queues built
       from doubly-linked lists.  The queue can be either circular or
       linear. An application using <i>insque</i>() or <i>remque</i>() shall ensure it
       defines a structure in which the first two members of the
       structure are pointers to the same type of structure, and any
       further members are application-specific. The first member of the
       structure is a forward pointer to the next entry in the queue.
       The second member is a backward pointer to the previous entry in
       the queue.  If the queue is linear, the queue is terminated with
       null pointers. The names of the structure and of the pointer
       members are not subject to any special restriction.

       The <i>insque</i>() function shall insert the element pointed to by
       <i>element</i> into a queue immediately after the element pointed to by
       <i>pred</i>.

       The <i>remque</i>() function shall remove the element pointed to by
       <i>element</i> from a queue.

       If the queue is to be used as a linear list, invoking
       <i>insque</i>(&amp;<i>element</i>, NULL), where <i>element</i> is the initial element of
       the queue, shall initialize the forward and backward pointers of
       <i>element</i> to null pointers.

       If the queue is to be used as a circular list, the application
       shall ensure it initializes the forward pointer and the backward
       pointer of the initial element of the queue to the element's own
       address.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Creating a Linear Linked List</b>
       The following example creates a linear linked list.

           #include &lt;search.h&gt;
           ...
           struct myque element1;
           struct myque element2;

           char *data1 = "DATA1";
           char *data2 = "DATA2";
           ...
           element1.data = data1;
           element2.data = data2;

           insque (&amp;element1, NULL);
           insque (&amp;element2, &amp;element1);

   <b>Creating a Circular Linked List</b>
       The following example creates a circular linked list.

           #include &lt;search.h&gt;
           ...
           struct myque element1;
           struct myque element2;

           char *data1 = "DATA1";
           char *data2 = "DATA2";
           ...
           element1.data = data1;
           element2.data = data2;

           element1.fwd = &amp;element1;
           element1.bck = &amp;element1;

           insque (&amp;element2, &amp;element1);

   <b>Removing an Element</b>
       The following example removes the element pointed to by <i>element1</i>.

           #include &lt;search.h&gt;
           ...
           struct myque element1;
           ...
           remque (&amp;element1);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The historical implementations of these functions described the
       arguments as being of type <b>struct qelem * </b>rather than as being of
       type <b>void * </b>as defined here. In those implementations, <b>struct</b>
       <b>qelem </b>was commonly defined in <i>&lt;search.h&gt;</i> as:

           struct qelem {
               struct qelem  *q_forw;
               struct qelem  *q_back;
           };

       Applications using these functions, however, were never able to
       use this structure directly since it provided no room for the
       actual data contained in the elements. Most applications defined
       structures that contained the two pointers as the initial
       elements and also provided space for, or pointers to, the
       object's data. Applications that used these functions to update
       more than one type of table also had the problem of specifying
       two or more different structures with the same name, if they
       literally used <b>struct qelem </b>as specified.

       As described here, the implementations were actually expecting a
       structure type where the first two members were forward and
       backward pointers to structures. With C compilers that didn't
       provide function prototypes, applications used structures as
       specified in the DESCRIPTION above and the compiler did what the
       application expected.

       If this method had been carried forward with an ISO C standard
       compiler and the historical function prototype, most applications
       would have to be modified to cast pointers to the structures
       actually used to be pointers to <b>struct qelem </b>to avoid compilation
       warnings. By specifying <b>void * </b>as the argument type, applications
       do not need to change (unless they specifically referenced <b>struct</b>
       <b>qelem </b>and depended on it being defined in <i>&lt;search.h&gt;</i>).
