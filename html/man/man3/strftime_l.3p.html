DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For <i>strftime</i>(): The functionality described on this reference
       page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is
       unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C
       standard.

       The <i>strftime</i>() function shall place bytes into the array pointed
       to by <i>s</i> as controlled by the string pointed to by <i>format</i>.  The
       format is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial
       shift state, if any. The format string consists of zero or more
       conversion specifications and ordinary characters.

       Each conversion specification is introduced by the <b>'%' </b>character
       after which the following appear in sequence:

        *  An optional flag:

           0     The zero character (<b>'0'</b>), which specifies that the
                 character used as the padding character is <b>'0'</b>,

           +     The &lt;plus-sign&gt; character (<b>'+'</b>), which specifies that
                 the character used as the padding character is <b>'0'</b>, and
                 that if and only if the field being produced consumes
                 more than four bytes to represent a year (for <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>,
                 or <b>%Y</b>) or more than two bytes to represent the year
                 divided by 100 (for <b>%C</b>) then a leading &lt;plus-sign&gt;
                 character shall be included if the year being processed
                 is greater than or equal to zero or a leading &lt;hyphen-
                 minus&gt; character (<b>'-'</b>) shall be included if the year is
                 less than zero.

           The default padding character is unspecified.

        *  An optional minimum field width. If the converted value,
           including any leading <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-' </b>sign, has fewer bytes than
           the minimum field width and the padding character is not the
           NUL character, the output shall be padded on the left (after
           any leading <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-' </b>sign) with the padding character.

        *  An optional <b>E </b>or <b>O </b>modifier.

        *  A terminating conversion specifier character that indicates
           the type of conversion to be applied.

       The results are unspecified if more than one flag character is
       specified, a flag character is specified without a minimum field
       width; a minimum field width is specified without a flag
       character; a modifier is specified with a flag or with a minimum
       field width; or if a minimum field width is specified for any
       conversion specifier other than <b>C</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>G</b>, or <b>Y</b>.

       All ordinary characters (including the terminating NUL character)
       are copied unchanged into the array. If copying takes place
       between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. No more
       than maxsize bytes are placed into the array. Each conversion
       specifier is replaced by appropriate characters as described in
       the following list. The appropriate characters are determined
       using the <i>LC_TIME</i> category of the current locale and by the
       values of zero or more members of the broken-down time structure
       pointed to by <i>timeptr</i>, as specified in brackets in the
       description. If any of the specified values are outside the
       normal range, the characters stored are unspecified.

       The <i>strftime_l</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>strftime</i>()
       function, except that the locale data used is from the locale
       represented by <i>locale</i>.

       Local timezone information is used as though <i>strftime</i>() called
       <i>tzset</i>().

       The following conversion specifiers shall be supported:

       a       Replaced by the locale's abbreviated weekday name.
               [<i>tm_wday</i>]

       A       Replaced by the locale's full weekday name. [<i>tm_wday</i>]

       b       Replaced by the locale's abbreviated month name. [<i>tm_mon</i>]

       B       Replaced by the locale's full month name. [<i>tm_mon</i>]

       c       Replaced by the locale's appropriate date and time
               representation.  (See the Base Definitions volume of
               POSIX.1‐2017, <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.)

       C       Replaced by the year divided by 100 and truncated to an
               integer, as a decimal number. [<i>tm_year</i>]

               If a minimum field width is not specified, the number of
               characters placed into the array pointed to by <i>s</i> will be
               the number of digits in the year divided by 100 or two,
               whichever is greater.  If a minimum field width is
               specified, the number of characters placed into the array
               pointed to by <i>s</i> will be the number of digits in the year
               divided by 100 or the minimum field width, whichever is
               greater.

       d       Replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number
               [01,31]. [<i>tm_mday</i>]

       D       Equivalent to <b>%m</b>/<b>%d</b>/<b>%y</b>.  [<i>tm_mon</i>, <i>tm_mday</i>, <i>tm_year</i>]

       e       Replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number
               [1,31]; a single digit is preceded by a space. [<i>tm_mday</i>]

       F       Equivalent to %+4Y-%m-%d if no flag and no minimum field
               width are specified. [<i>tm_year</i>, <i>tm_mon</i>, <i>tm_mday</i>]

               If a minimum field width of <i>x</i> is specified, the year
               shall be output as if by the <b>Y </b>specifier (described
               below) with whatever flag was given and a minimum field
               width of <i>x</i>-6.  If <i>x</i> is less than 6, the behavior shall be
               as if <i>x</i> equalled 6.

               If the minimum field width is specified to be 10, and the
               year is four digits long, then the output string produced
               will match the ISO 8601:2004 standard subclause 4.1.2.2
               complete representation, extended format date
               representation of a specific day. If a + flag is
               specified, a minimum field width of <i>x</i> is specified, and
               <i>x</i>-7 bytes are sufficient to hold the digits of the year
               (not including any needed sign character), then the
               output will match the ISO 8601:2004 standard subclause
               4.1.2.4 complete representation, expanded format date
               representation of a specific day.

       g       Replaced by the last 2 digits of the week-based year (see
               below) as a decimal number [00,99]. [<i>tm_year</i>, <i>tm_wday</i>,
               <i>tm_yday</i>]

       G       Replaced by the week-based year (see below) as a decimal
               number (for example, 1977). [<i>tm_year</i>, <i>tm_wday</i>, <i>tm_yday</i>]

               If a minimum field width is specified, the number of
               characters placed into the array pointed to by <i>s</i> will be
               the number of digits and leading sign characters (if any)
               in the year, or the minimum field width, whichever is
               greater.

       h       Equivalent to <b>%b</b>.  [<i>tm_mon</i>]

       H       Replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number
               [00,23]. [<i>tm_hour</i>]

       I       Replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number
               [01,12]. [<i>tm_hour</i>]

       j       Replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number
               [001,366]. [<i>tm_yday</i>]

       m       Replaced by the month as a decimal number [01,12].
               [<i>tm_mon</i>]

       M       Replaced by the minute as a decimal number [00,59].
               [<i>tm_min</i>]

       n       Replaced by a &lt;newline&gt;.

       p       Replaced by the locale's equivalent of either a.m. or
               p.m. [<i>tm_hour</i>]

       r       Replaced by the time in a.m. and p.m. notation; in the
               POSIX locale this shall be equivalent to <b>%I</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S %p</b>.
               [<i>tm_hour</i>, <i>tm_min</i>, <i>tm_sec</i>]

       R       Replaced by the time in 24-hour notation (<b>%H</b>:<b>%M</b>).
               [<i>tm_hour</i>, <i>tm_min</i>]

       S       Replaced by the second as a decimal number [00,60].
               [<i>tm_sec</i>]

       t       Replaced by a &lt;tab&gt;.

       T       Replaced by the time (<b>%H</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S</b>).  [<i>tm_hour</i>, <i>tm_min</i>,
               <i>tm_sec</i>]

       u       Replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [1,7], with 1
               representing Monday. [<i>tm_wday</i>]

       U       Replaced by the week number of the year as a decimal
               number [00,53].  The first Sunday of January is the first
               day of week 1; days in the new year before this are in
               week 0. [<i>tm_year</i>, <i>tm_wday</i>, <i>tm_yday</i>]

       V       Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the
               first day of the week) as a decimal number [01,53]. If
               the week containing 1 January has four or more days in
               the new year, then it is considered week 1.  Otherwise,
               it is the last week of the previous year, and the next
               week is week 1. Both January 4th and the first Thursday
               of January are always in week 1. [<i>tm_year</i>, <i>tm_wday</i>,
               <i>tm_yday</i>]

       w       Replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [0,6], with 0
               representing Sunday. [<i>tm_wday</i>]

       W       Replaced by the week number of the year as a decimal
               number [00,53].  The first Monday of January is the first
               day of week 1; days in the new year before this are in
               week 0. [<i>tm_year</i>, <i>tm_wday</i>, <i>tm_yday</i>]

       x       Replaced by the locale's appropriate date representation.
               (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
               <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.)

       X       Replaced by the locale's appropriate time representation.
               (See the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
               <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.)

       y       Replaced by the last two digits of the year as a decimal
               number [00,99]. [<i>tm_year</i>]

       Y       Replaced by the year as a decimal number (for example,
               1997). [<i>tm_year</i>]

               If a minimum field width is specified, the number of
               characters placed into the array pointed to by <i>s</i> will be
               the number of digits and leading sign characters (if any)
               in the year, or the minimum field width, whichever is
               greater.

       z       Replaced by the offset from UTC in the ISO 8601:2004
               standard format (<b>+hhmm </b>or <b>-hhmm</b>), or by no characters if
               no timezone is determinable. For example, <b>"-0430" </b>means 4
               hours 30 minutes behind UTC (west of Greenwich).  If
               <i>tm_isdst</i> is zero, the standard time offset is used. If
               <i>tm_isdst</i> is greater than zero, the daylight savings time
               offset is used. If <i>tm_isdst</i> is negative, no characters
               are returned.  [<i>tm_isdst</i>]

       Z       Replaced by the timezone name or abbreviation, or by no
               bytes if no timezone information exists. [<i>tm_isdst</i>]

       %       Replaced by <b>%</b>.

       If a conversion specification does not correspond to any of the
       above, the behavior is undefined.

       If a <b>struct tm </b>broken-down time structure is created by
       <i>localtime</i>() or <i>localtime_r</i>(), or modified by <i>mktime</i>(), and the
       value of <i>TZ</i> is subsequently modified, the results of the <b>%Z </b>and
       <b>%z </b><i>strftime</i>() conversion specifiers are undefined, when
       <i>strftime</i>() is called with such a broken-down time structure.

       If a <b>struct tm </b>broken-down time structure is created or modified
       by <i>gmtime</i>() or <i>gmtime_r</i>(), it is unspecified whether the result
       of the <b>%Z </b>and <b>%z </b>conversion specifiers shall refer to UTC or the
       current local timezone, when <i>strftime</i>() is called with such a
       broken-down time structure.

   <b>Modified Conversion Specifiers</b>
       Some conversion specifiers can be modified by the <b>E </b>or <b>O </b>modifier
       characters to indicate that an alternative format or
       specification should be used rather than the one normally used by
       the unmodified conversion specifier. If the alternative format or
       specification does not exist for the current locale (see ERA in
       the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 7.3.5</i>,
       <i>LC_TIME</i>), the behavior shall be as if the unmodified conversion
       specification were used.

       %Ec     Replaced by the locale's alternative appropriate date and
               time representation.

       %EC     Replaced by the name of the base year (period) in the
               locale's alternative representation.

       %Ex     Replaced by the locale's alternative date representation.

       %EX     Replaced by the locale's alternative time representation.

       %Ey     Replaced by the offset from <b>%EC </b>(year only) in the
               locale's alternative representation.

       %EY     Replaced by the full alternative year representation.

       %Od     Replaced by the day of the month, using the locale's
               alternative numeric symbols, filled as needed with
               leading zeros if there is any alternative symbol for
               zero; otherwise, with leading &lt;space&gt; characters.

       %Oe     Replaced by the day of the month, using the locale's
               alternative numeric symbols, filled as needed with
               leading &lt;space&gt; characters.

       %OH     Replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) using the locale's
               alternative numeric symbols.

       %OI     Replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) using the locale's
               alternative numeric symbols.

       %Om     Replaced by the month using the locale's alternative
               numeric symbols.

       %OM     Replaced by the minutes using the locale's alternative
               numeric symbols.

       %OS     Replaced by the seconds using the locale's alternative
               numeric symbols.

       %Ou     Replaced by the weekday as a number in the locale's
               alternative representation (Monday=1).

       %OU     Replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the
               first day of the week, rules corresponding to <b>%U</b>) using
               the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OV     Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the
               first day of the week, rules corresponding to <b>%V</b>) using
               the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %Ow     Replaced by the number of the weekday (Sunday=0) using
               the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OW     Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the
               first day of the week) using the locale's alternative
               numeric symbols.

       %Oy     Replaced by the year (offset from <b>%C</b>) using the locale's
               alternative numeric symbols.

       <b>%g</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%V </b>give values according to the ISO 8601:2004
       standard week-based year. In this system, weeks begin on a Monday
       and week 1 of the year is the week that includes January 4th,
       which is also the week that includes the first Thursday of the
       year, and is also the first week that contains at least four days
       in the year. If the first Monday of January is the 2nd, 3rd, or
       4th, the preceding days are part of the last week of the
       preceding year; thus, for Saturday 2nd January 1999, <b>%G </b>is
       replaced by 1998 and <b>%V </b>is replaced by 53. If December 29th,
       30th, or 31st is a Monday, it and any following days are part of
       week 1 of the following year. Thus, for Tuesday 30th December
       1997, <b>%G </b>is replaced by 1998 and <b>%V </b>is replaced by 01.

       If a conversion specifier is not one of the above, the behavior
       is undefined.

       The behavior is undefined if the <i>locale</i> argument to <i>strftime_l</i>()
       is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid
       locale object handle.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the total number of resulting bytes including the terminating
       null byte is not more than <i>maxsize</i>, these functions shall return
       the number of bytes placed into the array pointed to by <i>s</i>, not
       including the terminating NUL character. Otherwise, 0 shall be
       returned and the contents of the array are unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Getting a Localized Date String</b>
       The following example first sets the locale to the user's
       default. The locale information will be used in the <i>nl_langinfo</i>()
       and <i>strftime</i>() functions. The <i>nl_langinfo</i>() function returns the
       localized date string which specifies how the date is laid out.
       The <i>strftime</i>() function takes this information and, using the <b>tm</b>
       structure for values, places the date and time information into
       <i>datestring</i>.

           #include &lt;time.h&gt;
           #include &lt;locale.h&gt;
           #include &lt;langinfo.h&gt;
           ...
           struct tm *tm;
           char datestring[256];
           ...
           setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
           ...
           strftime (datestring, sizeof(datestring), nl_langinfo (D_T_FMT), tm);
           ...
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The range of values for <b>%S </b>is [00,60] rather than [00,59] to
       allow for the occasional leap second.

       Some of the conversion specifications are duplicates of others.
       They are included for compatibility with <i>nl_cxtime</i>() and
       <i>nl_ascxtime</i>(), which were published in Issue 2.

       The <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y </b>format specifiers in <i>strftime</i>() always
       print full values, but the <i>strptime</i>() <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, and <b>%Y </b>format
       specifiers only scan two digits (assumed to be the first two
       digits of a four-digit year) for <b>%C </b>and four digits (assumed to
       be the entire (four-digit) year) for <b>%F </b>and <b>%Y</b>.  This mimics the
       behavior of <i>printf</i>() and <i>scanf</i>(); that is:

           printf("%2d", x = 1000);

       prints <b>"1000"</b>, but:

           scanf(%2d", &amp;x);

       when given <b>"1000" </b>as input will only store 10 in <i>x</i>).
       Applications using extended ranges of years must be sure that the
       number of digits specified for scanning years with <i>strptime</i>()
       matches the number of digits that will actually be present in the
       input stream. Historic implementations of the <b>%Y </b>conversion
       specification (with no flags and no minimum field width) produced
       different output formats. Some always produced at least four
       digits (with 0 fill for years from 0 through 999) while others
       only produced the number of digits present in the year (with no
       fill and no padding). These two forms can be produced with the
       <b>'0' </b>flag and a minimum field width options using the conversions
       specifications <b>%04Y </b>and <b>%01Y</b>, respectively.

       In the past, the C and POSIX standards specified that <b>%F </b>produced
       an ISO 8601:2004 standard date format, but didn't specify which
       one. For years in the range [0001,9999], POSIX.1‐2008 requires
       that the output produced match the ISO 8601:2004 standard
       complete representation extended format (YYYY-MM-DD) and for
       years outside of this range produce output that matches the
       ISO 8601:2004 standard expanded representation extended format
       (&lt;+/-&gt;&lt;Underline&gt;Y&lt;/Underline&gt;YYYY-MM-DD). To fully meet
       ISO 8601:2004 standard requirements, the producer and consumer
       must agree on a date format that has a specific number of bytes
       reserved to hold the characters used to represent the years that
       is sufficiently large to hold all values that will be shared. For
       example, the <b>%+13F </b>conversion specification will produce output
       matching the format <b>"&lt;+/-&gt;YYYYYY-MM-DD" </b>(a leading <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-'</b>
       sign; a six-digit, 0-filled year; a <b>'-'</b>; a two-digit, leading
       0-filled month; another <b>'-'</b>; and the two-digit, leading 0-filled
       day within the month).

       Note that if the year being printed is greater than 9999, the
       resulting string from the unadorned <b>%F </b>conversion specifications
       will not conform to the ISO 8601:2004 standard extended format,
       complete representation for a date and will instead be an
       extended format, expanded representation (presumably without the
       required agreement between the date's producer and consumer).

       In the C or POSIX locale, the <b>E </b>and <b>O </b>modifiers are ignored and
       the replacement strings for the following specifiers are:

       %a      The first three characters of <b>%A</b>.

       %A      One of Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday.

       %b      The first three characters of <b>%B</b>.

       %B      One of January, February, ..., December.

       %c      Equivalent to <b>%a %b %e %T %Y</b>.

       %p      One of AM or PM.

       %r      Equivalent to <b>%I</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S %p</b>.

       %x      Equivalent to <b>%m</b>/<b>%d</b>/<b>%y</b>.

       %X      Equivalent to <b>%T</b>.

       %Z      Implementation-defined.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>%Y </b>conversion specification to <i>strftime</i>() was frequently
       assumed to be a four-digit year, but the ISO C standard does not
       specify that <b>%Y </b>is restricted to any subset of allowed values
       from the <i>tm_year</i> field. Similarly, the <b>%C </b>conversion
       specification was assumed to be a two-digit field and the first
       part of the output from the <b>%F </b>conversion specification was
       assumed to be a four-digit field. With <i>tm_year</i> being a signed 32
       or more-bit <b>int </b>and with many current implementations supporting
       64-bit <b>time_t </b>types in one or more programming environments,
       these assumptions are clearly wrong.

       POSIX.1‐2008 now allows the format specifications <b>%0xC</b>, <b>%0xF</b>,
       <b>%0xG</b>, and <b>%0xY </b>(where <b>'x' </b>is a string of decimal digits used to
       specify printing and scanning of a string of <i>x</i> decimal digits)
       with leading zero fill characters. Allowing applications to set
       the field width enables them to agree on the number of digits to
       be printed and scanned in the ISO 8601:2004 standard expanded
       representation of a year (for <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y</b>) or all but the last
       two digits of the year (for <b>%C</b>).  This is based on a feature in
       some versions of GNU <b>libc</b>'s <i>strftime</i>().  The GNU version allows
       specifying space, zero, or no-fill characters in <i>strftime</i>()
       format strings, but does not allow any flags to be specified in
       <i>strptime</i>() format strings. These implementations also allow these
       flags to be specified for any numeric field. POSIX.1‐2008 only
       requires the zero fill flag (<b>'0'</b>) and only requires that it be
       recognized when processing <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y </b>specifications when
       a minimum field width is also specified. The <b>'0' </b>flag is the only
       flag needed to produce and scan the ISO 8601:2004 standard year
       fields using the extended format forms. POSIX.1‐2008 also allows
       applications to specify the same flag and field width specifiers
       to be used in both <i>strftime</i>() and <i>strptime</i>() format strings for
       symmetry. Systems may provide other flag characters and may
       accept flags in conjunction with conversion specifiers other than
       <b>%C</b>, <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y</b>; but portable applications cannot depend on
       such extensions.

       POSIX.1‐2008 now also allows the format specifications <b>%+xC</b>,
       <b>%+xF</b>, <b>%+xG</b>, and <b>%+xY </b>(where <b>'x' </b>is a string of decimal digits
       used to specify printing and scanning of a string of <b>'x' </b>decimal
       digits) with leading zero fill characters and a leading <b>'+' </b>sign
       character if the year being converted is more than four digits or
       a minimum field width is specified that allows room for more than
       four digits for the year. This allows date providers and
       consumers to agree on a specific number of digits to represent a
       year as required by the ISO 8601:2004 standard expanded
       representation formats. The expanded representation formats all
       require the year to begin with a leading <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-' </b>sign.  (All
       of these specifiers can also provide a leading <b>'-' </b>sign for
       negative years. Since negative years and the year 0 don't fit
       well with the Gregorian or Julian calendars, the normal ranges of
       dates start with year 1. The ISO C standard allows <i>tm_year</i> to
       assume values corresponding to years before year 1, but the use
       of such years provided unspecified results.)

       Some earlier version of this standard specified that applications
       wanting to use <i>strptime</i>() to scan dates and times printed by
       <i>strftime</i>() should provide non-digit characters between fields to
       separate years from months and days. It also supported <b>%F </b>to
       print and scan the ISO 8601:2004 standard extended format,
       complete representation date for years 1 through 9999 (i.e.,
       YYYY-MM-DD). However, many applications were written to print
       (using <i>strftime</i>()) and scan (using <i>strptime</i>()) dates written
       using the basic format complete representation (four-digit years)
       and truncated representation (two-digit years) specified by the
       ISO 8601:2004 standard representation of dates and times which do
       not have any separation characters between fields. The
       ISO 8601:2004 standard also specifies basic format expanded
       representation where the creator and consumer of these fields
       agree beforehand to represent years as leading zero-filled
       strings of an agreed length of more than four digits to represent
       a year (again with no separation characters when year, month, and
       day are all displayed). Applications producing and consuming
       expanded representations are encouraged to use the <b>'+' </b>flag and
       an appropriate maximum field width to scan the year including the
       leading sign. Note that even without the <b>'+' </b>flag, years less
       than zero may be represented with a leading &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; for
       <b>%F</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%Y </b>conversion specifications. Using negative years
       results in unspecified behavior.

       If a format specification <b>%+xF </b>with the field width <i>x</i> greater
       than 11 is specified and the width is large enough to display the
       full year, the output string produced will match the
       ISO 8601:2004 standard subclause 4.1.2.4 expanded representation,
       extended format date representation for a specific day. (For
       years in the range [1,99999], <b>%+12F </b>is sufficient for an agreed
       five-digit year with a leading sign using the ISO 8601:2004
       standard expanded representation, extended format for a specific
       day <b>"&lt;+/-&gt;YYYYY-MM-DD"</b>.)  Note also that years less than 0 may
       produce a leading &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character (<b>'-'</b>) when using <b>%Y </b>or
       <b>%C </b>whether or not the <b>'0' </b>or <b>'+' </b>flags are used.

       The difference between the <b>'0' </b>flag and the <b>'+' </b>flag is whether
       the leading <b>'+' </b>character will be provided for years &gt;9999 as
       required for the ISO 8601:2004 standard extended representation
       format containing a year. For example:

       In the cases above marked with a * in the <i>strptime</i>() scan back
       field, the implied or specified number of characters scanned by
       <i>strptime</i>() was less than the number of characters output by
       <i>strftime</i>() using the same format; so the remaining digits of the
       year were dropped when the output date produced by <i>strftime</i>() was
       scanned back in by <i>strptime</i>().
