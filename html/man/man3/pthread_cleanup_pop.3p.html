NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_cleanup_pop, pthread_cleanup_push — establish
       cancellation handlers
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       void pthread_cleanup_pop(int <i>execute</i>);
       void pthread_cleanup_push(void (*<i>routine</i>)(void*), void *<i>arg</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_cleanup_pop</i>() function shall remove the routine at
       the top of the calling thread's cancellation cleanup stack and
       optionally invoke it (if <i>execute</i> is non-zero).

       The <i>pthread_cleanup_push</i>() function shall push the specified
       cancellation cleanup handler <i>routine</i> onto the calling thread's
       cancellation cleanup stack. The cancellation cleanup handler
       shall be popped from the cancellation cleanup stack and invoked
       with the argument <i>arg</i> when:

        *  The thread exits (that is, calls <i>pthread_exit</i>()).

        *  The thread acts upon a cancellation request.

        *  The thread calls <i>pthread_cleanup_pop</i>() with a non-zero
           <i>execute</i> argument.

       It is unspecified whether <i>pthread_cleanup_push</i>() and
       <i>pthread_cleanup_pop</i>() are macros or functions. If a macro
       definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function,
       or a program defines an external identifier with any of these
       names, the behavior is undefined.  The application shall ensure
       that they appear as statements, and in pairs within the same
       lexical scope (that is, the <i>pthread_cleanup_push</i>() macro may be
       thought to expand to a token list whose first token is <b>'{' </b>with
       <i>pthread_cleanup_pop</i>() expanding to a token list whose last token
       is the corresponding <b>'}'</b>).

       The effect of calling <i>longjmp</i>() or <i>siglongjmp</i>() is undefined if
       there have been any calls to <i>pthread_cleanup_push</i>() or
       <i>pthread_cleanup_pop</i>() made without the matching call since the
       jump buffer was filled. The effect of calling <i>longjmp</i>() or
       <i>siglongjmp</i>() from inside a cancellation cleanup handler is also
       undefined unless the jump buffer was also filled in the
       cancellation cleanup handler.

       The effect of the use of <b>return</b>, <b>break</b>, <b>continue</b>, and <b>goto </b>to
       prematurely leave a code block described by a pair of
       <i>pthread_cleanup_push</i>() and <i>pthread_cleanup_pop</i>() functions calls
       is undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_cleanup_push</i>() and <i>pthread_cleanup_pop</i>() functions
       shall not return a value.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following is an example using thread primitives to implement
       a cancelable, writers-priority read-write lock:

               int lock_count; /* &lt; 0 .. Held by writer. */
                               /* &gt; 0 .. Held by lock_count readers. */
                               /* = 0 .. Held by nobody. */
               int waiting_writers; /* Count of waiting writers. */
           } rwlock;

</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The two routines that push and pop cancellation cleanup handlers,
       <i>pthread_cleanup_push</i>() and <i>pthread_cleanup_pop</i>(), can be thought
       of as left and right-parentheses. They always need to be matched.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The restriction that the two routines that push and pop
       cancellation cleanup handlers, <i>pthread_cleanup_push</i>() and
       <i>pthread_cleanup_pop</i>(), have to appear in the same lexical scope
       allows for efficient macro or compiler implementations and
       efficient storage management. A sample implementation of these
       routines as macros might look like this:

           #define pthread_cleanup_push(rtn,arg) { \
               struct _pthread_handler_rec __cleanup_handler, **__head; \
               __cleanup_handler.rtn = rtn; \
               __cleanup_handler.arg = arg; \
               (void) pthread_getspecific(_pthread_handler_key, &amp;__head); \
               __cleanup_handler.next = *__head; \
               *__head = &amp;__cleanup_handler;

           #define pthread_cleanup_pop(ex) \
               *__head = __cleanup_handler.next; \
               if (ex) (*__cleanup_handler.rtn)(__cleanup_handler.arg); \
           }

       A more ambitious implementation of these routines might do even
       better by allowing the compiler to note that the cancellation
       cleanup handler is a constant and can be expanded inline.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 currently leaves unspecified the
       effect of calling <i>longjmp</i>() from a signal handler executing in a
       POSIX System Interfaces function.  If an implementation wants to
       allow this and give the programmer reasonable behavior, the
       <i>longjmp</i>() function has to call all cancellation cleanup handlers
       that have been pushed but not popped since the time <i>setjmp</i>() was
       called.

       Consider a multi-threaded function called by a thread that uses
       signals. If a signal were delivered to a signal handler during
       the operation of <i>qsort</i>() and that handler were to call <i>longjmp</i>()
       (which, in turn, did <i>not</i> call the cancellation cleanup handlers)
       the helper threads created by the <i>qsort</i>() function would not be
       canceled. Instead, they would continue to execute and write into
       the argument array even though the array might have been popped
       off the stack.

       Note that the specified cleanup handling mechanism is especially
       tied to the C language and, while the requirement for a uniform
       mechanism for expressing cleanup is language-independent, the
       mechanism used in other languages may be quite different. In
       addition, this mechanism is really only necessary due to the lack
       of a real exception mechanism in the C language, which would be
       the ideal solution.

       There is no notion of a cancellation cleanup-safe function. If an
       application has no cancellation points in its signal handlers,
       blocks any signal whose handler may have cancellation points
       while calling async-unsafe functions, or disables cancellation
       while calling async-unsafe functions, all functions may be safely
       called from cancellation cleanup routines.
