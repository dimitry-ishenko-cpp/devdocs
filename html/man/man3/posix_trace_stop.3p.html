PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_trace_start, posix_trace_stop — trace start and stop
       (<b>TRACING</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;trace.h&gt;

       int posix_trace_start(trace_id_t <i>trid</i>);
       int posix_trace_stop (trace_id_t <i>trid</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_trace_start</i>() and <i>posix_trace_stop</i>() functions,
       respectively, shall start and stop the trace stream identified by
       the argument <i>trid</i>.

       The effect of calling the <i>posix_trace_start</i>() function shall be
       recorded in the trace stream as the POSIX_TRACE_START system
       trace event and the status of the trace stream shall become
       POSIX_TRACE_RUNNING.  If the trace stream is in progress when
       this function is called, the POSIX_TRACE_START system trace event
       shall not be recorded and the trace stream shall continue to run.
       If the trace stream is full, the POSIX_TRACE_START system trace
       event shall not be recorded and the status of the trace stream
       shall not be changed.

       The effect of calling the <i>posix_trace_stop</i>() function shall be
       recorded in the trace stream as the POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace
       event and the status of the trace stream shall become
       POSIX_TRACE_SUSPENDED.  If the trace stream is suspended when
       this function is called, the POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event
       shall not be recorded and the trace stream shall remain
       suspended. If the trace stream is full, the POSIX_TRACE_STOP
       system trace event shall not be recorded and the status of the
       trace stream shall not be changed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a value
       of zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error
       number.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the argument <i>trid</i> does not correspond to an
              active trace stream and thus no trace stream was started
              or stopped.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The operation was interrupted by a signal and thus the
              trace stream was not necessarily started or stopped.
