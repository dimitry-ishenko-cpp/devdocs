SIZE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS </h2>
<pre>

       There are some size limitations in PCRE2 but it is hoped that
       they will never in practice be relevant.

       The maximum size of a compiled pattern is approximately 64
       thousand code units for the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries if PCRE2
       is compiled with the default internal linkage size, which is 2
       bytes for these libraries. If you want to process regular
       expressions that are truly enormous, you can compile PCRE2 with
       an internal linkage size of 3 or 4 (when building the 16-bit
       library, 3 is rounded up to 4). See the <b>README </b>file in the source
       distribution and the <b>pcre2build </b>documentation for details. In
       these cases the limit is substantially larger.  However, the
       speed of execution is slower. In the 32-bit library, the internal
       linkage size is always 4.

       The maximum length of a source pattern string is essentially
       unlimited; it is the largest number a PCRE2_SIZE variable can
       hold. However, the program that calls <b>pcre2_compile() </b>can specify
       a smaller limit.

       The maximum length (in code units) of a subject string is one
       less than the largest number a PCRE2_SIZE variable can hold.
       PCRE2_SIZE is an unsigned integer type, usually defined as
       size_t. Its maximum value (that is ~(PCRE2_SIZE)0) is reserved as
       a special indicator for zero-terminated strings and unset
       offsets.

       All values in repeating quantifiers must be less than 65536.

       There are two different limits that apply to branches of
       lookbehind assertions.  If every branch in such an assertion
       matches a fixed number of characters, the maximum length of any
       branch is 65535 characters. If any branch matches a variable
       number of characters, then the maximum matching length for every
       branch is limited. The default limit is set at compile time,
       defaulting to 255, but can be changed by the calling program.

       There is no limit to the number of parenthesized groups, but
       there can be no more than 65535 capture groups, and there is a
       limit to the depth of nesting of parenthesized subpatterns of all
       kinds. This is imposed in order to limit the amount of system
       stack used at compile time. The default limit can be specified
       when PCRE2 is built; if not, the default is set to 250. An
       application can change this limit by calling
       pcre2_set_parens_nest_limit() to set the limit in a compile
       context.

       The maximum length of name for a named capture group is 32 code
       units, and the maximum number of such groups is 10000.

       The maximum length of a name in a (*MARK), (*PRUNE), (*SKIP), or
       (*THEN) verb is 255 code units for the 8-bit library and 65535
       code units for the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries.

       The maximum length of a string argument to a callout is the
       largest number a 32-bit unsigned integer can hold.

       The maximum amount of heap memory used for matching is controlled
       by the heap limit, which can be set in a pattern or in a match
       context. The default is a very large number, effectively
       unlimited.
