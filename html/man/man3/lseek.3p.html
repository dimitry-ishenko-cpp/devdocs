<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lseek — move the read/write file offset
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       off_t lseek(int <i>fildes</i>, off_t <i>offset</i>, int <i>whence</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>lseek</i>() function shall set the file offset for the open file
       description associated with the file descriptor <i>fildes,</i> as
       follows:

        *  If <i>whence</i> is SEEK_SET, the file offset shall be set to <i>offset</i>
           bytes.

        *  If <i>whence</i> is SEEK_CUR, the file offset shall be set to its
           current location plus <i>offset</i>.

        *  If <i>whence</i> is SEEK_END, the file offset shall be set to the
           size of the file plus <i>offset</i>.

       The symbolic constants SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END are
       defined in <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i>.

       The behavior of <i>lseek</i>() on devices which are incapable of seeking
       is implementation-defined.  The value of the file offset
       associated with such a device is undefined.

       The <i>lseek</i>() function shall allow the file offset to be set beyond
       the end of the existing data in the file. If data is later
       written at this point, subsequent reads of data in the gap shall
       return bytes with the value 0 until data is actually written into
       the gap.

       The <i>lseek</i>() function shall not, by itself, extend the size of a
       file.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory object, the result of the
       <i>lseek</i>() function is unspecified.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of the
       <i>lseek</i>() function is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the resulting offset, as measured in
       bytes from the beginning of the file, shall be returned.
       Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall be set to indicate
       the error, and the file offset shall remain unchanged.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>lseek</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not an open file descriptor.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>whence</i> argument is not a proper value, or the
              resulting file offset would be negative for a regular
              file, block special file, or directory.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The resulting file offset would be a value which cannot be
              represented correctly in an object of type <b>off_t</b>.

       <b>ESPIPE </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is associated with a pipe, FIFO, or
              socket.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The ISO C standard includes the functions <i>fgetpos</i>() and
       <i>fsetpos</i>(), which work on very large files by use of a special
       positioning type.

       Although <i>lseek</i>() may position the file offset beyond the end of
       the file, this function does not itself extend the size of the
       file. While the only function in POSIX.1‐2008 that may directly
       extend the size of the file is <i>write</i>(), <i>truncate</i>(), and
       <i>ftruncate</i>(), several functions originally derived from the ISO C
       standard, such as <i>fwrite</i>(), <i>fprintf</i>(), and so on, may do so (by
       causing calls on <i>write</i>()).

       An invalid file offset that would cause <b>[EINVAL] </b>to be returned
       may be both implementation-defined and device-dependent (for
       example, memory may have few invalid values). A negative file
       offset may be valid for some devices in some implementations.

       The POSIX.1‐1990 standard did not specifically prohibit <i>lseek</i>()
       from returning a negative offset. Therefore, an application was
       required to clear <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> prior to the call and check <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> upon
       return to determine whether a return value of (<b>off_t</b>)-1 is a
       negative offset or an indication of an error condition. The
       standard developers did not wish to require this action on the
       part of a conforming application, and chose to require that <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       be set to <b>[EINVAL] </b>when the resulting file offset would be
       negative for a regular file, block special file, or directory.
