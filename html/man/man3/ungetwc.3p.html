PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ungetwc — push wide-character code back into the input stream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       wint_t ungetwc(wint_t <i>wc</i>, FILE *<i>stream</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>ungetwc</i>() function shall push the character corresponding to
       the wide-character code specified by <i>wc</i> back onto the input
       stream pointed to by <i>stream</i>.  The pushed-back characters shall be
       returned by subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse order
       of their pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream
       pointed to by <i>stream</i>) to a file-positioning function (<i>fseek</i>(),
       <i>fseeko</i>(), <i>fsetpos</i>(), or <i>rewind</i>()) or <i>fflush</i>() shall discard any
       pushed-back characters for the stream. The external storage
       corresponding to the stream is unchanged.

       At least one character of push-back shall be provided. If
       <i>ungetwc</i>() is called too many times on the same stream without an
       intervening read or file-positioning operation on that stream,
       the operation may fail.

       If the value of <i>wc</i> equals that of the macro WEOF, the operation
       shall fail and the input stream shall be left unchanged.

       A successful call to <i>ungetwc</i>() shall clear the end-of-file
       indicator for the stream. The value of the file-position
       indicator for the stream after all pushed-back characters have
       been read, or discarded by calling <i>fseek</i>(), <i>fseeko</i>(), <i>fsetpos</i>(),
       or <i>rewind</i>() (but not <i>fflush</i>()), shall be the same as it was
       before the characters were pushed back. The file-position
       indicator is decremented (by one or more) by each successful call
       to <i>ungetwc</i>(); if its value was 0 before a call, its value is
       unspecified after the call.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>ungetwc</i>() shall return the wide-
       character code corresponding to the pushed-back character.
       Otherwise, it shall return WEOF.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ungetwc</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ </b>An invalid character sequence is detected, or a wide-
              character code does not correspond to a valid character.
