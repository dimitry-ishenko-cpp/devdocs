SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int link(const char *<i>path1</i>, const char *<i>path2</i>);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int linkat(int <i>fd1</i>, const char *<i>path1</i>, int <i>fd2</i>,
           const char *<i>path2</i>, int <i>flag</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>link</i>() function shall create a new link (directory entry) for
       the existing file, <i>path1</i>.

       The <i>path1</i> argument points to a pathname naming an existing file.
       The <i>path2</i> argument points to a pathname naming the new directory
       entry to be created. The <i>link</i>() function shall atomically create
       a new link for the existing file and the link count of the file
       shall be incremented by one.

       If <i>path1</i> names a directory, <i>link</i>() shall fail unless the process
       has appropriate privileges and the implementation supports using
       <i>link</i>() on directories.

       If <i>path1</i> names a symbolic link, it is implementation-defined
       whether <i>link</i>() follows the symbolic link, or creates a new link
       to the symbolic link itself.

       Upon successful completion, <i>link</i>() shall mark for update the last
       file status change timestamp of the file. Also, the last data
       modification and last file status change timestamps of the
       directory that contains the new entry shall be marked for update.

       If <i>link</i>() fails, no link shall be created and the link count of
       the file shall remain unchanged.

       The implementation may require that the calling process has
       permission to access the existing file.

       The <i>linkat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>link</i>() function
       except that symbolic links shall be handled as specified by the
       value of <i>flag</i> (see below) and except in the case where either
       <i>path1</i> or <i>path2</i> or both are relative paths. In this case a
       relative path <i>path1</i> is interpreted relative to the directory
       associated with the file descriptor <i>fd1</i> instead of the current
       working directory and similarly for <i>path2</i> and the file descriptor
       <i>fd2</i>.  If the access mode of the open file description associated
       with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH, the function shall
       check whether directory searches are permitted using the current
       permissions of the directory underlying the file descriptor. If
       the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the
       check.

       Values for <i>flag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of
       flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>:

       AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW
             If <i>path1</i> names a symbolic link, a new link for the target
             of the symbolic link is created.

       If <i>linkat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd1</i> or
       <i>fd2</i> parameter, the current working directory shall be used for
       the respective <i>path</i> argument. If both <i>fd1</i> and <i>fd2</i> have value
       AT_FDCWD, the behavior shall be identical to a call to <i>link</i>(),
       except that symbolic links shall be handled as specified by the
       value of <i>flag</i>.

       If the AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW flag is clear in the <i>flag</i> argument and
       the <i>path1</i> argument names a symbolic link, a new link is created
       for the symbolic link <i>path1</i> and not its target.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
       Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>A component of either path prefix denies search
              permission, or the requested link requires writing in a
              directory that denies write permission, or the calling
              process does not have permission to access the existing
              file and this is required by the implementation.

       <b>EEXIST </b>The <i>path2</i> argument resolves to an existing directory entry
              or refers to a symbolic link.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path1</i> or <i>path2</i> argument.

       <b>EMLINK </b>The number of links to the file named by <i>path1</i> would
              exceed {LINK_MAX}.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of either path prefix does not exist; the file
              named by <i>path1</i> does not exist; or <i>path1</i> or <i>path2</i> points to
              an empty string.

       <b>ENOENT </b>or <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path1</i> argument names an existing non-directory file,
              and the <i>path2</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters. If <i>path2</i> without the trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters would name an existing file, an <b>[ENOENT] </b>error
              shall not occur.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The directory to contain the link cannot be extended.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of either path prefix names an existing file
              that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a
              directory, or the <i>path1</i> argument contains at least one
              non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends with one or more trailing
              &lt;slash&gt; characters and the last pathname component names
              an existing file that is neither a directory nor a
              symbolic link to a directory, or the <i>path1</i> argument names
              an existing non-directory file and the <i>path2</i> argument
              names a nonexistent file, contains at least one
              non-&lt;slash&gt; character, and ends with one or more trailing
              &lt;slash&gt; characters.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The file named by <i>path1</i> is a directory and either the
              calling process does not have appropriate privileges or
              the implementation prohibits using <i>link</i>() on directories.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The requested link requires writing in a directory on a
              read-only file system.

       <b>EXDEV  </b>The link named by <i>path2</i> and the file named by <i>path1</i> are on
              different file systems and the implementation does not
              support links between file systems.

       <b>EXDEV  </b><i>path1</i> refers to a named STREAM.

       The <i>linkat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd1</i> or <i>fd2</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd1</i> or <i>fd2</i>, respectively, do not
              permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path1</i> or <i>path2</i> argument does not specify an absolute
              path and the <i>fd1</i> or <i>fd2</i> argument, respectively, is neither
              AT_FDCWD nor a valid file descriptor open for reading or
              searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path1</i> or <i>path2</i> argument is not an absolute path and
              <i>fd1</i> or <i>fd2</i>, respectively, is a file descriptor associated
              with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path1</i> or <i>path2</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       The <i>linkat</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of the <i>flag</i> argument is not valid.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Creating a Link to a File</b>
       The following example shows how to create a link to a file named
       <b>/home/cnd/mod1 </b>by creating a new directory entry named
       <b>/modules/pass1</b>.

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

           char *path1 = "/home/cnd/mod1";
           char *path2 = "/modules/pass1";
           int   status;
           ...
           status = link (path1, path2);

   <b>Creating a Link to a File Within a Program</b>
       In the following program example, the <i>link</i>() function links the
       <b>/etc/passwd </b>file (defined as <b>PASSWDFILE</b>) to a file named
       <b>/etc/opasswd </b>(defined as <b>SAVEFILE</b>), which is used to save the
       current password file. Then, after removing the current password
       file (defined as <b>PASSWDFILE</b>), the new password file is saved as
       the current password file using the <i>link</i>() function again.

           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

           #define LOCKFILE "/etc/ptmp"
           #define PASSWDFILE "/etc/passwd"
           #define SAVEFILE "/etc/opasswd"
           ...
           /* Save current password file */
           link (PASSWDFILE, SAVEFILE);

           /* Remove current password file. */
           unlink (PASSWDFILE);

           /* Save new password file as current password file. */
           link (LOCKFILE,PASSWDFILE);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Some implementations do allow links between file systems.

       If <i>path1</i> refers to a symbolic link, application developers should
       use <i>linkat</i>() with appropriate flags to select whether or not the
       symbolic link should be resolved.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Linking to a directory is restricted to the superuser in most
       historical implementations because this capability may produce
       loops in the file hierarchy or otherwise corrupt the file system.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 continues that philosophy by
       prohibiting <i>link</i>() and <i>unlink</i>() from doing this. Other functions
       could do it if the implementor designed such an extension.

       Some historical implementations allow linking of files on
       different file systems. Wording was added to explicitly allow
       this optional behavior.

       The exception for cross-file system links is intended to apply
       only to links that are programmatically indistinguishable from
       ``hard'' links.

       The purpose of the <i>linkat</i>() function is to link files in
       directories other than the current working directory without
       exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could
       be changed in parallel to a call to <i>link</i>(), resulting in
       unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for the
       directory of both the existing file and the target location and
       using the <i>linkat</i>() function it can be guaranteed that the both
       filenames are in the desired directories.

       The AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW flag allows for implementing both common
       behaviors of the <i>link</i>() function. The POSIX specification
       requires that if <i>path1</i> is a symbolic link, a new link for the
       target of the symbolic link is created. Many systems by default
       or as an alternative provide a mechanism to avoid the implicit
       symbolic link lookup and create a new link for the symbolic link
       itself.

       Earlier versions of this standard specified only the <i>link</i>()
       function, and required it to behave like <i>linkat</i>() with the
       AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW flag. However, historical practice from SVR4
       and Linux kernels had <i>link</i>() behaving like <i>linkat</i>() with no
       flags, and many systems that attempted to provide a conforming
       <i>link</i>() function did so in a way that was rarely used, and when it
       was used did not conform to the standard (e.g., by not being
       atomic, or by dereferencing the symbolic link incorrectly). Since
       applications could not rely on <i>link</i>() following links in
       practice, the <i>linkat</i>() function was added taking a flag to
       specify the desired behavior for the application.
