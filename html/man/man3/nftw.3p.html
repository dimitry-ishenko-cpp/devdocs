SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;ftw.h&gt;

       int nftw(const char *<i>path</i>, int (*<i>fn</i>)(const char *,
           const struct stat *, int, struct FTW *), int <i>fd_limit</i>, int <i>flags</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>nftw</i>() function shall recursively descend the directory
       hierarchy rooted in <i>path</i>.  The <i>nftw</i>() function has a similar
       effect to <i>ftw</i>() except that it takes an additional argument
       <i>flags</i>, which is a bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the
       following flags:

       FTW_CHDIR   If set, <i>nftw</i>() shall change the current working
                   directory to each directory as it reports files in
                   that directory. If clear, <i>nftw</i>() shall not change the
                   current working directory.

       FTW_DEPTH   If set, <i>nftw</i>() shall report all files in a directory
                   before reporting the directory itself. If clear,
                   <i>nftw</i>() shall report any directory before reporting
                   the files in that directory.

       FTW_MOUNT   If set, <i>nftw</i>() shall only report files in the same
                   file system as <i>path</i>.  If clear, <i>nftw</i>() shall report
                   all files encountered during the walk.

       FTW_PHYS    If set, <i>nftw</i>() shall perform a physical walk and
                   shall not follow symbolic links.

       If FTW_PHYS is clear and FTW_DEPTH is set, <i>nftw</i>() shall follow
       links instead of reporting them, but shall not report any
       directory that would be a descendant of itself. If FTW_PHYS is
       clear and FTW_DEPTH is clear, <i>nftw</i>() shall follow links instead
       of reporting them, but shall not report the contents of any
       directory that would be a descendant of itself.

       At each file it encounters, <i>nftw</i>() shall call the user-supplied
       function <i>fn</i> with four arguments:

        *  The first argument is the pathname of the object.

        *  The second argument is a pointer to the <b>stat </b>buffer
           containing information on the object, filled in as if
           <i>fstatat</i>(), <i>stat</i>(), or <i>lstat</i>() had been called to retrieve the
           information.

        *  The third argument is an integer giving additional
           information. Its value is one of the following:

           FTW_D     The object is a directory.

           FTW_DNR   The object is a directory that cannot be read. The
                     <i>fn</i> function shall not be called for any of its
                     descendants.

           FTW_DP    The object is a directory and subdirectories have
                     been visited. (This condition shall only occur if
                     the FTW_DEPTH flag is included in <i>flags</i>.)

           FTW_F     The object is a non-directory file.

           FTW_NS    The <i>stat</i>() function failed on the object because of
                     lack of appropriate permission. The <b>stat </b>buffer
                     passed to <i>fn</i> is undefined. Failure of <i>stat</i>() for
                     any other reason is considered an error and <i>nftw</i>()
                     shall return -1.

           FTW_SL    The object is a symbolic link. (This condition
                     shall only occur if the FTW_PHYS flag is included
                     in <i>flags</i>.)

           FTW_SLN   The object is a symbolic link that does not name an
                     existing file.  (This condition shall only occur if
                     the FTW_PHYS flag is not included in <i>flags</i>.)

        *  The fourth argument is a pointer to an <b>FTW </b>structure.  The
           value of <b>base </b>is the offset of the object's filename in the
           pathname passed as the first argument to <i>fn</i>.  The value of
           <b>level </b>indicates depth relative to the root of the walk, where
           the root level is 0.

       The results are unspecified if the application-supplied <i>fn</i>
       function does not preserve the current working directory.

       The argument <i>fd_limit</i> sets the maximum number of file descriptors
       that shall be used by <i>nftw</i>() while traversing the file tree. At
       most one file descriptor shall be used for each directory level.

       The <i>nftw</i>() function need not be thread-safe.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>nftw</i>() function shall continue until the first of the
       following conditions occurs:

        *  An invocation of <i>fn</i> shall return a non-zero value, in which
           case <i>nftw</i>() shall return that value.

        *  The <i>nftw</i>() function detects an error other than <b>[EACCES] </b>(see
           FTW_DNR and FTW_NS above), in which case <i>nftw</i>() shall return
           -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.

        *  The tree is exhausted, in which case <i>nftw</i>() shall return 0.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>nftw</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission is denied for any component of <i>path</i> or
              read permission is denied for <i>path</i>, or <i>fn</i> returns -1 and
              does not reset <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of <i>path</i> does not name an existing file or <i>path</i>
              is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of <i>path</i> names an existing file that is neither
              a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              A field in the <b>stat </b>structure cannot be represented
              correctly in the current programming environment for one
              or more files found in the file hierarchy.

       The <i>nftw</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENFILE </b>Too many files are currently open in the system.

       In addition, <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> may be set if the function pointed to by <i>fn</i>
       causes <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to be set.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following program traverses the directory tree under the path
       named in its first command-line argument, or under the current
       directory if no argument is supplied. It displays various
       information about each file. The second command-line argument can
       be used to specify characters that control the value assigned to
       the <i>flags</i> argument when calling <i>nftw</i>().

</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>nftw</i>() function may allocate dynamic storage during its
       operation. If <i>nftw</i>() is forcibly terminated, such as by <i>longjmp</i>()
       or <i>siglongjmp</i>() being executed by the function pointed to by <i>fn</i>
       or an interrupt routine, <i>nftw</i>() does not have a chance to free
       that storage, so it remains permanently allocated. A safe way to
       handle interrupts is to store the fact that an interrupt has
       occurred, and arrange to have the function pointed to by <i>fn</i>
       return a non-zero value at its next invocation.
