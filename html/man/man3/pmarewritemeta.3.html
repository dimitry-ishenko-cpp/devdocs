CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A physical metadata record from the input archive identified by
       <i>inlcp</i> is passed in via <i>rbuf</i> and this is reformatted if required
       to produce the equivalent metadata record for the output archive
       identified by <i>outlcp</i>.

       Combined with the input and output archive versions, the type of
       the metadata record (as extracted from <i>rbuf</i>) is used to decide
       if; for some record types and version changes no rewriting is
       required.

       <b>pmaRewriteMeta </b>is intended to be used in cases where the archive
       version of <i>inlcp</i> and <i>outlcp</i> are different.  The only sane choice
       of archive versions today is <b>PM_LOG_VERS02 </b>for <i>inlcp</i> and
       <b>PM_LOG_VERS03 </b>for <i>outlcp</i>, which would be requesting a rewrite
       from archive version 2 format to archive version 3 format (as
       only versions 2 and 3 are currently supported).

       If rewriting takes place the old <i>rbuf</i> will have been free'd and a
       new <i>rbuf</i> allocated with <a href="malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>.  It is the caller's
       responsibility to make sure this potential free-and-allocate will
       be safe, e.g. no dangling references into the contents of <i>rbuf</i>,
       or pass in a copy of the record if it is precious.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS AND RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       In several places, fatal errors will trigger an error message and
       force the application to exit.

       If there is no defined translation for the versions of <i>inlcp</i> and
       <i>outlcp</i> then <b>pmaRewriteMeta </b>returns <b>PM_ERR_APPVERSION </b>(a slight
       perversion of this error code).

       If no rewrite is performed, the return value is 0, otherwise a
       return value of 1 indicates a rewrite has taken place and <i>rbuf</i>
       has been reallocated.
