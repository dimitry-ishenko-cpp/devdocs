PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       bsearch — binary search a sorted table
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       void *bsearch(const void *<i>key</i>, const void *<i>base</i>, size_t <i>nel</i>,
           size_t <i>width</i>, int (*<i>compar</i>)(const void *, const void *));
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>bsearch</i>() function shall search an array of <i>nel</i> objects, the
       initial element of which is pointed to by <i>base</i>, for an element
       that matches the object pointed to by <i>key</i>.  The size of each
       element in the array is specified by <i>width</i>.  If the <i>nel</i> argument
       has the value zero, the comparison function pointed to by <i>compar</i>
       shall not be called and no match shall be found.

       The comparison function pointed to by <i>compar</i> shall be called with
       two arguments that point to the <i>key</i> object and to an array
       element, in that order.

       The application shall ensure that the comparison function pointed
       to by <i>compar</i> does not alter the contents of the array. The
       implementation may reorder elements of the array between calls to
       the comparison function, but shall not alter the contents of any
       individual element.

       The implementation shall ensure that the first argument is always
       a pointer to the key.

       When the same objects (consisting of width bytes, irrespective of
       their current positions in the array) are passed more than once
       to the comparison function, the results shall be consistent with
       one another.  That is, the same object shall always compare the
       same way with the key.

       The application shall ensure that the function returns an integer
       less than, equal to, or greater than 0 if the <i>key</i> object is
       considered, respectively, to be less than, to match, or to be
       greater than the array element. The application shall ensure that
       the array consists of all the elements that compare less than,
       all the elements that compare equal to, and all the elements that
       compare greater than the <i>key</i> object, in that order.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>bsearch</i>() function shall return a pointer to a matching
       member of the array, or a null pointer if no match is found. If
       two or more members compare equal, which member is returned is
       unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The example below searches a table containing pointers to nodes
       consisting of a string and its length. The table is ordered
       alphabetically on the string in the node pointed to by each
       entry.

       The code fragment below reads in strings and either finds the
       corresponding node and prints out the string and its length, or
       prints an error message.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           #include &lt;string.h&gt;

           #define TABSIZE    1000

           struct node {                  /* These are stored in the table. */
               char *string;
               int length;
           };
           struct node table[TABSIZE];    /* Table to be searched. */
               .
               .
               .
           {
               struct node *node_ptr, node;
               /* Routine to compare 2 nodes. */
               int node_compare(const void *, const void *);
               .
               .
               .
               while (scanf("%ms", &amp;node.string) != EOF) {
                   node_ptr = (struct node *)bsearch((void *)(&amp;node),
                          (void *)table, TABSIZE,
                          sizeof(struct node), node_compare);
                   if (node_ptr != NULL) {
                       (void)printf("string = %20s, length = %d\n",
                           node_ptr-&gt;string, node_ptr-&gt;length);
                   } else {
                       (void)printf("not found: %s\n", node.string);
                   }
                   free(node.string);
               }
           }
           /*
               This routine compares two nodes based on an
               alphabetical ordering of the string field.
           */
           int
           node_compare(const void *node1, const void *node2)
           {
               return strcoll(((const struct node *)node1)-&gt;string,
                   ((const struct node *)node2)-&gt;string);
           }
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The pointers to the key and the element at the base of the table
       should be of type pointer-to-element.

       The comparison function need not compare every byte, so arbitrary
       data may be contained in the elements in addition to the values
       being compared.

       In practice, the array is usually sorted according to the
       comparison function.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The requirement that the second argument (hereafter referred to
       as <i>p</i>) to the comparison function is a pointer to an element of
       the array implies that for every call all of the following
       expressions are non-zero:

           ( (char *)p - (char *)base ) % width == 0
           (char *)p &gt;= (char *)base
           (char *)p &lt; (char *)base + nel * width
