NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_perf_event_raw - support for perf_events raw events syntax
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: perf_raw</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Raw perf_events event syntax</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports a pseudo PMU model to allow raw encodings of
       PMU events for the Linux perf_events kernel interface.

       With this PMU, it is possible to provide the raw hexadecimal
       encoding of any hardware event for any PMU models. The raw
       encoding is passed as is to the kernel. All events are encoded as
       <b>PERF_TYPE_RAW</b>. As such, perf_events generic events, such as
       cycles, instructions, cannot be encoded by this PMU.

       The syntax is very simple: rX. X is the hexadecimal 64-bit value
       for the event.  It may include event filters on some PMU models.
       The hexadecimal number is passed without the 0x prefix, e.g.,
       r01c4.

       The library's standard perf_events attributes are supported by
       this PMU model.  They are separated with colons as is customary
       with the library.

MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported by this PMU model:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>h      </b>Measure at the hypervisor level. This corresponds to
              <b>PFM_PLMH</b>.  This is a boolean modifier

       <b>mg     </b>Measure guest execution only. This is a boolean modifier

       <b>mh     </b>Measure host execution only. This is a boolean modifier

       <b>period </b>Specify the the sampling period value. Value can be
              expressed in decimal or hexadecimal.  Value is 64-bit
              wide. This option is mutually exclusive with <b>freq</b>. The
              period is expressed in the unit of the event. There is no
              default value.

       <b>freq   </b>Specify the the sampling frequency value. Value can be
              expressed in decimal or hexadecimal.  Value is 64-bit
              wide. This options is mutually exclusive with <b>period</b>. The
              value is expressed in Hertz. For instance, freq=100, means
              that the event should be sampled 100 times per second on
              average. There is no default value.

       <b>excl   </b>The associated event is the only event measured on the
              PMU. This applies only to hardware events. This attribute
              requires admin privileges. Default is off.

       <b>precise</b>
              Enables precise sampling mode. This option is only valid
              when sampling on events. The options takes an integer
              argument. It can have the following values: 1=enable
              precise sampling, 2=enable precise sampling and eliminate
              skid, 3=enable precise sampling, eliminate skid and bias.
              Not all events necessarily support precise mode at all
              levels, this is dependent on the underlying PMU.
              Eliminating skid is a best effort feature. It may not work
              for all samples. This option is mutually exclusive with
              <b>hw_smpl</b>. This options implies using the hardware assist
              sampling mechanism.

       <b>hw_smpl</b>
              Enables hardware assist sampling. This is a boolean
              option. It is false by default. On some processors, it is
              possible to have the hardware record samples in a buffer
              and then notify the kernel when it is full.  Such feature
              may not be available for all events. Using a hardware
              buffer does not necessarily eliminate skid and bias, it
              usually lowers the overhead of interrupt-based sampling by
              amortizing the interrupt over multiple samples. This
              option is usually implicit with precise sampling events.

       <b>cpu    </b>This integer option is used with system-wide events, i.e.,
              events attached to a CPU instead of a thread. The value
              designate the CPU to attach the event to. It is up to the
              caller of the library to use the cpu field in the library
              event encoding argument to create the event. No
              verification on the validity of the CPU number is made by
              the library. Default value is -1 for this field.

       <b>pinned </b>This boolean option is used with system-wide events, i.e.,
              events attached to a CPU instead of a thread. If set, then
              the event is marked as pinned. That means it needs to
              remain on the counters at all time, i.e., it cannot be
              multiplexed. There can only be as many pinned events as
              there are counters, yet the library does not check for
              that, the perf_event subsystem does. The default value for
              this field is false, i.e., the event is not pinned.
