PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       malloc — a memory allocator
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       void *malloc(size_t <i>size</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>malloc</i>() function shall allocate unused space for an object
       whose size in bytes is specified by <i>size</i> and whose value is
       unspecified.

       The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls
       to <i>malloc</i>() is unspecified. The pointer returned if the
       allocation succeeds shall be suitably aligned so that it may be
       assigned to a pointer to any type of object and then used to
       access such an object in the space allocated (until the space is
       explicitly freed or reallocated). Each such allocation shall
       yield a pointer to an object disjoint from any other object. The
       pointer returned points to the start (lowest byte address) of the
       allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null pointer
       shall be returned. If the size of the space requested is 0, the
       behavior is implementation-defined: either a null pointer shall
       be returned, or the behavior shall be as if the size were some
       non-zero value, except that the behavior is undefined if the
       returned pointer is used to access an object.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion with <i>size</i> not equal to 0, <i>malloc</i>()
       shall return a pointer to the allocated space. If <i>size</i> is 0,
       either:

        *  A null pointer shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> may be set to an
           implementation-defined value, or

        *  A pointer to the allocated space shall be returned. The
           application shall ensure that the pointer is not used to
           access an object.

       Otherwise, it shall return a null pointer and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>malloc</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.
