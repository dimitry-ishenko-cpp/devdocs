NAME </h2>
<pre>
       adjtime - correct the time to synchronize the system clock
</pre> <h2>
LIBRARY </h2>
<pre>
       Standard C library (<i>libc</i>, <i>-lc</i>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int adjtime(const struct timeval *</b><i>delta</i><b>, struct timeval *</b><i>olddelta</i><b>);</b>

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
   <a href="../man7/feature_test_macros.7.html">feature_test_macros(7)</a>):

       <b>adjtime</b>():
           Since glibc 2.19:
               _DEFAULT_SOURCE
           glibc 2.19 and earlier:
               _BSD_SOURCE
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>adjtime</b>() function gradually adjusts the system clock (as
       returned by <a href="../man2/gettimeofday.2.html">gettimeofday(2)</a>).  The amount of time by which the
       clock is to be adjusted is specified in the structure pointed to
       by <i>delta</i>.  This structure has the following form:

           struct timeval {
               time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds */
               suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
           };

       If the adjustment in <i>delta</i> is positive, then the system clock is
       speeded up by some small percentage (i.e., by adding a small
       amount of time to the clock value in each second) until the
       adjustment has been completed.  If the adjustment in <i>delta</i> is
       negative, then the clock is slowed down in a similar fashion.

       If a clock adjustment from an earlier <b>adjtime</b>() call is already
       in progress at the time of a later <b>adjtime</b>() call, and <i>delta</i> is
       not NULL for the later call, then the earlier adjustment is
       stopped, but any already completed part of that adjustment is not
       undone.

       If <i>olddelta</i> is not NULL, then the buffer that it points to is
       used to return the amount of time remaining from any previous
       adjustment that has not yet been completed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>adjtime</b>() returns 0.  On failure, -1 is returned, and
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>EINVAL </b>The adjustment in <i>delta</i> is outside the permitted range.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The caller does not have sufficient privilege to adjust
              the time.  Under Linux, the <b>CAP_SYS_TIME </b>capability is
              required.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       4.3BSD, System V.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The adjustment that <b>adjtime</b>() makes to the clock is carried out
       in such a manner that the clock is always monotonically
       increasing.  Using <b>adjtime</b>() to adjust the time prevents the
       problems that could be caused for certain applications (e.g.,
       <a href="../man1/make.1.html">make(1)</a>) by abrupt positive or negative jumps in the system time.

       <b>adjtime</b>() is intended to be used to make small adjustments to the
       system time.  Most systems impose a limit on the adjustment that
       can be specified in <i>delta</i>.  In the glibc implementation, <i>delta</i>
       must be less than or equal to (INT_MAX / 1000000 - 2) and greater
       than or equal to (INT_MIN / 1000000 + 2) (respectively 2145 and
       -2145 seconds on i386).
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       A longstanding bug meant that if <i>delta</i> was specified as NULL, no
       valid information about the outstanding clock adjustment was
       returned in <i>olddelta</i>.  (In this circumstance, <b>adjtime</b>() should
       return the outstanding clock adjustment, without changing it.)
       This bug is fixed on systems with glibc 2.8 or later and Linux
       kernel 2.6.26 or later.
