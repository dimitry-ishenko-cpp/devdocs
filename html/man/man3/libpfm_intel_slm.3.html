NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_intel_slm - support for Intel Silvermont core PMU
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: slm</b>
       <b>PMU desc: Intel Silvermont</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports the Intel Silvermont core PMU.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Silvermont
       processors:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition from no occurrence of the event to at
              least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with
              a counter mask modifier (m) with a value greater or equal
              to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

OFFCORE_RESPONSE events </h2>
<pre>
       Intel Silvermont provides two offcore_response events:
       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0 </b>and <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_1</b>.

       Those events need special treatment in the performance monitoring
       infrastructure because each event uses an extra register to store
       some settings. Thus, in case multiple offcore_response events are
       monitored simultaneously, the kernel needs to manage the sharing
       of that extra register.

       The offcore_response events are exposed as a normal event by the
       library. The extra settings are exposed as regular umasks. The
       library takes care of encoding the events according to the
       underlying kernel interface.

       On Intel Silvermont, the umasks are divided into three
       categories: request, supplier and snoop. The user must provide at
       least one umask for each category. The categories are shown in
       the umask descriptions. The library provides a default umask per
       category if not provided by the user.

       There is also the special response umask called <b>ANY_RESPONSE</b>.
       When this umask is used then it overrides any supplier and snoop
       umasks. In other words, users can specify either <b>ANY_RESPONSE OR</b>
       any combinations of supplier + snoops.

       In case no supplier or snoop is specified, the library defaults
       to using <b>ANY_RESPONSE</b>.

       For instance, the following are valid event selections:

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:DMND_DATA_RD:ANY_RESPONSE</b>

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:ANY_REQUEST</b>

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:ANY_RFO:LLC_HITM:SNOOP_ANY</b>

       But the following are illegal:

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:ANY_RFO:NON_DRAM:ANY_RESPONSE</b>

       <b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE_0:ANY_RFO:L2_HIT:SNOOP_ANY:ANY_RESPONSE</b>
