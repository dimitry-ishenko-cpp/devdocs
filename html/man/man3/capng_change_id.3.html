NAME </h2>
<pre>
       capng_change_id - change the credentials retaining capabilities
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;cap-ng.h&gt;</b>

       int capng_change_id(int uid, int gid, capng_flags_t flag);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This function will change uid and gid to the ones given while
       retaining the capabilities previously specified in capng_update.
       It is also possible to specify -1 for either the uid or gid in
       which case the function will not change the uid or gid and leave
       it "as is". This is useful if you just want the flag options to
       be applied (assuming the option doesn't require more privileges
       that you currently have).

       It is not necessary and perhaps better if capng_apply has not
       been called prior to this function so that all necessary
       privileges are still intact. The caller may be required to have
       CAP_SETPCAP capability still active before calling this function
       or capabilities cannot be changed.

       This function also takes a flag parameter that helps to tailor
       the exact actions performed by the function to secure the
       environment. The option may be or'ed together. The legal values
       are:

              <b>CAPNG_NO_FLAG</b>
                     Simply change uid and retain specified capabilities
                     and that's all.

              <b>CAPNG_DROP_SUPP_GRP</b>
                     After changing id, remove any supplement groups
                     that may still be in effect from the old uid.

              <b>CAPNG_INIT_SUPP_GRP</b>
                     After changing id, initialize any supplement groups
                     that may come with the new account. If given with
                     <b>CAPNG_DROP_SUPP_GRP </b>it will have no effect.

              <b>CAPNG_CLEAR_BOUNDING</b>
                     Clear the bounding set regardless to the internal
                     representation already setup prior to changing the
                     uid/gid.

              <b>CAPNG_CLEAR_AMBIENT</b>
                     Clear ambient capabilities regardless of the
                     internal representation already setup prior to
                     changing the uid/gid.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       This returns 0 on success and a negative number on failure.

              -1 means capng has not been initted properly

              -2 means a failure requesting to keep capabilities across
              the uid change

              -3 means that applying the intermediate capabilities
              failed

              -4 means changing gid failed

              -5 means dropping supplemental groups failed

              -6 means changing the uid failed

              -7 means dropping the ability to retain caps across a uid
              change failed

              -8 means clearing the bounding set failed

              -9 means dropping CAP_SETPCAP or ambient capabilities
              failed

              -10 means initializing supplemental groups failed

       Note: the only safe action to do upon failure of this function is
       to probably exit. This is because you are likely in a situation
       with partial permissions and not what you intended.
