PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE2 </h2>
<pre>

       In normal use of PCRE2, if there is a match up to the end of a
       subject string, but more characters are needed to match the
       entire pattern, PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH is returned, just like any
       other failing match. There are circumstances where it might be
       helpful to distinguish this "partial match" case.

       One example is an application where the subject string is very
       long, and not all available at once. The requirement here is to
       be able to do the matching segment by segment, but special action
       is needed when a matched substring spans the boundary between two
       segments.

       Another example is checking a user input string as it is typed,
       to ensure that it conforms to a required format. Invalid
       characters can be immediately diagnosed and rejected, giving
       instant feedback.

       Partial matching is a PCRE2-specific feature; it is not Perl-
       compatible. It is requested by setting one of the
       PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD or PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT options when calling a
       matching function. The difference between the two options is
       whether or not a partial match is preferred to an alternative
       complete match, though the details differ between the two types
       of matching function. If both options are set, PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD
       takes precedence.

       If you want to use partial matching with just-in-time optimized
       code, as well as setting a partial match option for the matching
       function, you must also call <b>pcre2_jit_compile() </b>with one or both
       of these options:

         PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_HARD
         PCRE2_JIT_PARTIAL_SOFT

       PCRE2_JIT_COMPLETE should also be set if you are going to run
       non-partial matches on the same pattern. Separate code is
       compiled for each mode. If the appropriate JIT mode has not been
       compiled, interpretive matching code is used.

       Setting a partial matching option disables two of PCRE2's
       standard optimization hints. PCRE2 remembers the last literal
       code unit in a pattern, and abandons matching immediately if it
       is not present in the subject string.  This optimization cannot
       be used for a subject string that might match only partially.
       PCRE2 also remembers a minimum length of a matching string, and
       does not bother to run the matching function on shorter strings.
       This optimization is also disabled for partial matching.
</pre> <h2>
REQUIREMENTS FOR A PARTIAL MATCH </h2>
<pre>

       A possible partial match occurs during matching when the end of
       the subject string is reached successfully, but either more
       characters are needed to complete the match, or the addition of
       more characters might change what is matched.

       Example 1: if the pattern is /abc/ and the subject is "ab", more
       characters are definitely needed to complete a match. In this
       case both hard and soft matching options yield a partial match.

       Example 2: if the pattern is /ab+/ and the subject is "ab", a
       complete match can be found, but the addition of more characters
       might change what is matched. In this case, only
       PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD returns a partial match; PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT
       returns the complete match.

       On reaching the end of the subject, when PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is
       set, if the next pattern item is \z, \Z, \b, \B, or $ there is
       always a partial match.  Otherwise, for both options, the next
       pattern item must be one that inspects a character, and at least
       one of the following must be true:

       (1) At least one character has already been inspected. An
       inspected character need not form part of the final matched
       string; lookbehind assertions and the \K escape sequence provide
       ways of inspecting characters before the start of a matched
       string.

       (2) The pattern contains one or more lookbehind assertions. This
       condition exists in case there is a lookbehind that inspects
       characters before the start of the match.

       (3) There is a special case when the whole pattern can match an
       empty string.  When the starting point is at the end of the
       subject, the empty string match is a possibility, and if
       PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set and neither of the above conditions is
       true, it is returned. However, because adding more characters
       might result in a non-empty match, PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD returns a
       partial match, which in this case means "there is going to be a
       match at this point, but until some more characters are added, we
       do not know if it will be an empty string or something longer".
</pre> <h2>
PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_match() </h2>
<pre>

       When a partial matching option is set, the result of calling
       <b>pcre2_match() </b>can be one of the following:

       <b>A successful match</b>
         A complete match has been found, starting and ending within
         this subject.

       <b>PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH</b>
         No match can start anywhere in this subject.

       <b>PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL</b>
         Adding more characters may result in a complete match that uses
         one or more characters from the end of this subject.

       When a partial match is returned, the first two elements in the
       ovector point to the portion of the subject that was matched, but
       the values in the rest of the ovector are undefined. The
       appearance of \K in the pattern has no effect for a partial
       match. Consider this pattern:

         /abc\K123/

       If it is matched against "456abc123xyz" the result is a complete
       match, and the ovector defines the matched string as "123",
       because \K resets the "start of match" point. However, if a
       partial match is requested and the subject string is "456abc12",
       a partial match is found for the string "abc12", because all
       these characters are needed for a subsequent re-match with
       additional characters.

       If there is more than one partial match, the first one that was
       found provides the data that is returned. Consider this pattern:

         /123\w+X|dogY/

       If this is matched against the subject string "abc123dog", both
       alternatives fail to match, but the end of the subject is reached
       during matching, so PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned. The offsets
       are set to 3 and 9, identifying "123dog" as the first partial
       match. (In this example, there are two partial matches, because
       "dog" on its own partially matches the second alternative.)

   <b>How a partial match is processed by pcre2_match()</b>

       What happens when a partial match is identified depends on which
       of the two partial matching options is set.

       If PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned as
       soon as a partial match is found, without continuing to search
       for possible complete matches. This option is "hard" because it
       prefers an earlier partial match over a later complete match. For
       this reason, the assumption is made that the end of the supplied
       subject string is not the true end of the available data, which
       is why \z, \Z, \b, \B, and $ always give a partial match.

       If PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, the partial match is remembered,
       but matching continues as normal, and other alternatives in the
       pattern are tried. If no complete match can be found,
       PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned instead of PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH.
       This option is "soft" because it prefers a complete match over a
       partial match. All the various matching items in a pattern behave
       as if the subject string is potentially complete; \z, \Z, and $
       match at the end of the subject, as normal, and for \b and \B the
       end of the subject is treated as a non-alphanumeric.

       The difference between the two partial matching options can be
       illustrated by a pattern such as:

         /dog(sbody)?/

       This matches either "dog" or "dogsbody", greedily (that is, it
       prefers the longer string if possible). If it is matched against
       the string "dog" with PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT, it yields a complete
       match for "dog". However, if PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, the
       result is PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL. On the other hand, if the pattern
       is made ungreedy the result is different:

         /dog(sbody)??/

       In this case the result is always a complete match because that
       is found first, and matching never continues after finding a
       complete match. It might be easier to follow this explanation by
       thinking of the two patterns like this:

         /dog(sbody)?/    is the same as  /dogsbody|dog/
         /dog(sbody)??/   is the same as  /dog|dogsbody/

       The second pattern will never match "dogsbody", because it will
       always find the shorter match first.

   <b>Example of partial matching using pcre2test</b>

       The <b>pcre2test </b>data modifiers <b>partial_hard </b>(or <b>ph</b>) and
       <b>partial_soft </b>(or <b>ps</b>) set PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD and
       PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT, respectively, when calling <b>pcre2_match()</b>.
       Here is a run of <b>pcre2test </b>using a pattern that matches the whole
       subject in the form of a date:

           re&gt;
       /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
         data&gt; 25dec3\=ph
         Partial match: 23dec3
         data&gt; 3ju\=ph
         Partial match: 3ju
         data&gt; 3juj\=ph
         No match

       This example gives the same results for both hard and soft
       partial matching options. Here is an example where there is a
       difference:

           re&gt;
       /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
         data&gt; 25jun04\=ps
          0: 25jun04
          1: jun
         data&gt; 25jun04\=ph
         Partial match: 25jun04

       With PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT, the subject is matched completely. For
       PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD, however, the subject is assumed not to be
       complete, so there is only a partial match.
</pre> <h2>
MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_match() </h2>
<pre>

       PCRE was not originally designed with multi-segment matching in
       mind. However, over time, features (including partial matching)
       that make multi-segment matching possible have been added. A very
       long string can be searched segment by segment by calling
       <b>pcre2_match() </b>repeatedly, with the aim of achieving the same
       results that would happen if the entire string was available for
       searching all the time. Normally, the strings that are being
       sought are much shorter than each individual segment, and are in
       the middle of very long strings, so the pattern is normally not
       anchored.

       Special logic must be implemented to handle a matched substring
       that spans a segment boundary. PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD should be used,
       because it returns a partial match at the end of a segment
       whenever there is the possibility of changing the match by adding
       more characters. The PCRE2_NOTBOL option should also be set for
       all but the first segment.

       When a partial match occurs, the next segment must be added to
       the current subject and the match re-run, using the <i>startoffset</i>
       argument of <b>pcre2_match() </b>to begin at the point where the partial
       match started.  For example:

           re&gt;
       /\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d/
         data&gt; ...the date is 23ja\=ph
         Partial match: 23ja
         data&gt; ...the date is 23jan19 and on that day...\=offset=15
          0: 23jan19
          1: jan

       Note the use of the <b>offset </b>modifier to start the new match where
       the partial match was found. In this example, the next segment
       was added to the one in which the partial match was found. This
       is the most straightforward approach, typically using a memory
       buffer that is twice the size of each segment. After a partial
       match, the first half of the buffer is discarded, the second half
       is moved to the start of the buffer, and a new segment is added
       before repeating the match as in the example above. After a no
       match, the entire buffer can be discarded.

       If there are memory constraints, you may want to discard text
       that precedes a partial match before adding the next segment.
       Unfortunately, this is not at present straightforward. In cases
       such as the above, where the pattern does not contain any
       lookbehinds, it is sufficient to retain only the partially
       matched substring. However, if the pattern contains a lookbehind
       assertion, characters that precede the start of the partial match
       may have been inspected during the matching process. When
       <b>pcre2test </b>displays a partial match, it indicates these characters
       with '&lt;' if the <b>allusedtext </b>modifier is set:

           re&gt; "(?&lt;=123)abc"
         data&gt; xx123ab\=ph,allusedtext
         Partial match: 123ab
                        &lt;&lt;&lt;

       However, the <b>allusedtext </b>modifier is not available for JIT
       matching, because JIT matching does not record the first (or
       last) consulted characters.  For this reason, this information is
       not available via the API. It is therefore not possible in
       general to obtain the exact number of characters that must be
       retained in order to get the right match result. If you cannot
       retain the entire segment, you must find some heuristic way of
       choosing.

       If you know the approximate length of the matching substrings,
       you can use that to decide how much text to retain. The only
       lookbehind information that is currently available via the API is
       the length of the longest individual lookbehind in a pattern, but
       this can be misleading if there are nested lookbehinds. The value
       returned by calling <b>pcre2_pattern_info() </b>with the
       PCRE2_INFO_MAXLOOKBEHIND option is the maximum number of
       characters (not code units) that any individual lookbehind moves
       back when it is processed. A pattern such as "(?&lt;=(?&lt;!b)a)" has a
       maximum lookbehind value of one, but inspects two characters
       before its starting point.

       In a non-UTF or a 32-bit case, moving back is just a subtraction,
       but in UTF-8 or UTF-16 you have to count characters while moving
       back through the code units.
</pre> <h2>
PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre2_dfa_match() </h2>
<pre>

       The DFA function moves along the subject string character by
       character, without backtracking, searching for all possible
       matches simultaneously. If the end of the subject is reached
       before the end of the pattern, there is the possibility of a
       partial match.

       When PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT is set, PCRE2_ERROR_PARTIAL is returned
       only if there have been no complete matches. Otherwise, the
       complete matches are returned.  If PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD is set, a
       partial match takes precedence over any complete matches. The
       portion of the string that was matched when the longest partial
       match was found is set as the first matching string.

       Because the DFA function always searches for all possible
       matches, and there is no difference between greedy and ungreedy
       repetition, its behaviour is different from the <b>pcre2_match()</b>.
       Consider the string "dog" matched against this ungreedy pattern:

         /dog(sbody)??/

       Whereas the standard function stops as soon as it finds the
       complete match for "dog", the DFA function also finds the partial
       match for "dogsbody", and so returns that when PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD
       is set.
</pre> <h2>
MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre2_dfa_match() </h2>
<pre>

       When a partial match has been found using the DFA matching
       function, it is possible to continue the match by providing
       additional subject data and calling the function again with the
       same compiled regular expression, this time setting the
       PCRE2_DFA_RESTART option. You must pass the same working space as
       before, because this is where details of the previous partial
       match are stored. You can set the PCRE2_PARTIAL_SOFT or
       PCRE2_PARTIAL_HARD options with PCRE2_DFA_RESTART to continue
       partial matching over multiple segments. Here is an example using
       <b>pcre2test</b>:

           re&gt;
       /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
         data&gt; 23ja\=dfa,ps
         Partial match: 23ja
         data&gt; n05\=dfa,dfa_restart
          0: n05

       The first call has "23ja" as the subject, and requests partial
       matching; the second call has "n05" as the subject for the
       continued (restarted) match.  Notice that when the match is
       complete, only the last part is shown; PCRE2 does not retain the
       previously partially-matched string. It is up to the calling
       program to do that if it needs to. This means that, for an
       unanchored pattern, if a continued match fails, it is not
       possible to try again at a new starting point. All this facility
       is capable of doing is continuing with the previous match
       attempt. For example, consider this pattern:

         1234|3789

       If the first part of the subject is "ABC123", a partial match of
       the first alternative is found at offset 3. There is no partial
       match for the second alternative, because such a match does not
       start at the same point in the subject string. Attempting to
       continue with the string "7890" does not yield a match because
       only those alternatives that match at one point in the subject
       are remembered. Depending on the application, this may or may not
       be what you want.

       If you do want to allow for starting again at the next character,
       one way of doing it is to retain some or all of the segment and
       try a new complete match, as described for <b>pcre2_match() </b>above.
       Another possibility is to work with two buffers. If a partial
       match at offset <i>n</i> in the first buffer is followed by "no match"
       when PCRE2_DFA_RESTART is used on the second buffer, you can then
       try a new match starting at offset <i>n+1</i> in the first buffer.
