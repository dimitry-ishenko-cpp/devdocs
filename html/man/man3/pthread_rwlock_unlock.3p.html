PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_rwlock_unlock — unlock a read-write lock object
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_rwlock_unlock(pthread_rwlock_t *<i>rwlock</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() function shall release a lock held on
       the read-write lock object referenced by <i>rwlock</i>.  Results are
       undefined if the read-write lock <i>rwlock</i> is not held by the
       calling thread.

       If this function is called to release a read lock from the read-
       write lock object and there are other read locks currently held
       on this read-write lock object, the read-write lock object
       remains in the read locked state. If this function releases the
       last read lock for this read-write lock object, the read-write
       lock object shall be put in the unlocked state with no owners.

       If this function is called to release a write lock for this read-
       write lock object, the read-write lock object shall be put in the
       unlocked state.

       If there are threads blocked on the lock when it becomes
       available, the scheduling policy shall determine which thread(s)
       shall acquire the lock.  If the Thread Execution Scheduling
       option is supported, when threads executing with the scheduling
       policies SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, or SCHED_SPORADIC are waiting on
       the lock, they shall acquire the lock in priority order when the
       lock becomes available. For equal priority threads, write locks
       shall take precedence over read locks.  If the Thread Execution
       Scheduling option is not supported, it is implementation-defined
       whether write locks take precedence over read locks.

       Results are undefined if this function is called with an
       uninitialized read-write lock.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() function shall return
       zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
       the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() function shall not return an error
       code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>rwlock</i> argument to <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() does not refer to an
       initialized read-write lock object, it is recommended that the
       function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
       <i>rwlock</i> argument to <i>pthread_rwlock_unlock</i>() refers to a read-write
       lock object for which the current thread does not hold a lock, it
       is recommended that the function should fail and report an
       <b>[EPERM] </b>error.
