DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The routine <b>pmTraversePMNS </b>may be used to perform a depth-first
       traversal of the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS).

       The traversal starts at the node identified by <i>name</i> - if <i>name</i> is
       an empty string (i.e. <b>""</b>), the traversal starts at the root of
       the PMNS.  Usually <i>name</i> would be the pathname of a non-leaf node
       in the PMNS.

       For each leaf node (i.e. performance metric) found in the
       traversal, the user-supplied routine <i>dometric</i> is called with the
       full pathname of that metric in the PMNS as the single argument.
       This argument is null-byte terminated, and is constructed from a
       buffer that is managed internally to <b>pmTraversePMNS</b>.
       Consequently the value is only valid during the call to <i>dometric</i>
       - if the pathname needs to be retained, it should be copied using
       <a href="strdup.3.html">strdup(3)</a> before returning from <i>dometric</i>.

       The <b>pmTraversePMNS_r </b>routine performs the same function, except
       the callback method <i>func_r</i> has an additional parameter that will
       be <i>closure</i> from the initial call to <b>pmTraversePMNS_r</b>.  The
       additional parameter to <b>pmTraversePMNS_r </b>and the callback method
       allows the caller to pass context through <b>pmTraversePMNS_r </b>and
       into the callback method <i>func_r</i>, making the service more useful
       for multi-threaded applications where thread-private data can be
       accessed in the callback method via the <i>closure</i> argument.

       On success <b>pmTraversePMNS </b>and <b>pmTraversePMNS_r </b>return the number
       of leaf nodes found in the traversal, which will be one (1) if
       <i>name</i> is either a leaf node, or a derived metric or a non-leaf
       node with one child.  If <i>name</i> is a non-leaf node, the returned
       value will be zero or greater (zero is returned in the special
       case where <i>name</i> is a dynamic root node that currently has no
       children).  In all cases, derived metrics present in the PMNS
       subtree below <i>name</i> are counted as leaf-nodes.  If an an error
       occurs, <b>pmTraversePMNS </b>and <b>pmTraversePMNS_r </b>will return a
       negative error code, as described in the <b>DIAGNOSTICS </b>section
       below.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PM_ERR_NOPMNS</b>
              Failed to access a PMNS for operation.  Note that if the
              application hasn't a priori called pmLoadNameSpace(3) and
              wants to use the distributed PMNS, then a call to
              <b>pmTraversePMNS </b>must be made inside a current context.

       <b>PM_ERR_NAME</b>
              The initial pathname <i>name</i> is not valid in the current
              PMNS.

       <b>PM_ERR_*</b>
              Other diagnostics are for protocol failures when accessing
              the distributed PMNS.
