DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>seccomp_init</b>() and <b>seccomp_reset</b>() functions (re)initialize
       the internal seccomp filter state, prepares it for use, and sets
       the default action based on the <i>def_action</i> parameter.  The
       <b>seccomp_init</b>() function must be called before any other
       libseccomp functions as the rest of the library API will fail if
       the filter context is not initialized properly.  The
       <b>seccomp_reset</b>() function releases the existing filter context
       state before reinitializing it and can only be called after a
       call to <b>seccomp_init</b>() has succeeded.  If <b>seccomp_reset</b>() is
       called with a NULL filter, it resets the library's global task
       state, including any notification file descriptors retrieved by
       <a href="seccomp_notify_fd.3.html">seccomp_notify_fd(3)</a>.  Normally this is not needed, but it may be
       required to continue using the library after a <b>fork</b>() or <b>clone</b>()
       call to ensure the API level and user notification state is
       properly reset.

       When the caller is finished configuring the seccomp filter and
       has loaded it into the kernel, the caller should call
       <a href="seccomp_release.3.html">seccomp_release(3)</a> to release all of the filter context state.

       Valid <i>def_action</i> values are as follows:

       <b>SCMP_ACT_KILL</b>
              The thread will be terminated by the kernel with SIGSYS
              when it calls a syscall that does not match any of the
              configured seccomp filter rules.  The thread will not be
              able to catch the signal.

       <b>SCMP_ACT_KILL_PROCESS</b>
              The entire process will be terminated by the kernel with
              SIGSYS when it calls a syscall that does not match any of
              the configured seccomp filter rules.

       <b>SCMP_ACT_TRAP</b>
              The thread will be sent a SIGSYS signal when it calls a
              syscall that does not match any of the configured seccomp
              filter rules.  It may catch this and change its behavior
              accordingly.  When using SA_SIGINFO with <a href="../man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2)</a>,
              si_code will be set to SYS_SECCOMP, si_syscall will be set
              to the syscall that failed the rules, and si_arch will be
              set to the AUDIT_ARCH for the active ABI.

       <b>SCMP_ACT_ERRNO(uint16_t errno)</b>
              The thread will receive a return value of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> when it
              calls a syscall that does not match any of the configured
              seccomp filter rules.

       <b>SCMP_ACT_TRACE(uint16_t msg_num)</b>
              If the thread is being traced and the tracing process
              specified the <b>PTRACE_O_TRACESECCOMP </b>option in the call to
              <a href="../man2/ptrace.2.html">ptrace(2)</a>, the tracing process will be notified, via
              <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b>, and the value provided in <i>msg_num</i>
              can be retrieved using the <b>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG </b>option.

       <b>SCMP_ACT_LOG</b>
              The seccomp filter will have no effect on the thread
              calling the syscall if it does not match any of the
              configured seccomp filter rules but the syscall will be
              logged.

       <b>SCMP_ACT_ALLOW</b>
              The seccomp filter will have no effect on the thread
              calling the syscall if it does not match any of the
              configured seccomp filter rules.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>seccomp_init</b>() function returns a filter context on success,
       NULL on failure.  The <b>seccomp_reset</b>() function returns zero on
       success or one of the following error codes on failure:

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
              Invalid input, either the context or action is invalid.

       <b>-ENOMEM</b>
              The library was unable to allocate enough memory.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;seccomp.h&gt;

       int main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
            int rc = -1;
            scmp_filter_ctx ctx;

            ctx = seccomp_init(SCMP_ACT_KILL);
            if (ctx == NULL)
                 goto out;

            /* ... */

            rc = seccomp_reset(ctx, SCMP_ACT_KILL);
            if (rc &lt; 0)
                 goto out;

            /* ... */

       out:
            seccomp_release(ctx);
            return -rc;
       }
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       While the seccomp filter can be generated independent of the
       kernel, kernel support is required to load and enforce the
       seccomp filter generated by libseccomp.

       code repository, can be found at
       <a href="https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp">https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp</a>.  This tool, as well as the
       libseccomp library, is currently under development, please report
