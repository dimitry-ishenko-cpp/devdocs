NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>post_form</b>, <b>unpost_form </b>- write or erase forms from associated
       subwindows
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;form.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int post_form(FORM *</b><i>form</i><b>);</b>
       <b>int unpost_form(FORM *</b><i>form</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The function <b>post_form </b>displays a form to its associated
       subwindow.  To trigger physical display of the subwindow, use
       <b>refresh</b>(3X) or some equivalent <b>curses </b>routine (the implicit
       <b>doupdate </b>triggered by an <b>curses </b>input request will do).

       The function <b>unpost_form </b>erases form from its associated
       subwindow.
</pre> <h2>
