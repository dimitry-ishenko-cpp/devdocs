PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fsync — synchronize changes to a file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       int fsync(int <i>fildes</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fsync</i>() function shall request that all data for the open
       file descriptor named by <i>fildes</i> is to be transferred to the
       storage device associated with the file described by <i>fildes</i>.  The
       nature of the transfer is implementation-defined. The <i>fsync</i>()
       function shall not return until the system has completed that
       action or until an error is detected.

       If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is defined, the <i>fsync</i>() function shall
       force all currently queued I/O operations associated with the
       file indicated by file descriptor <i>fildes</i> to the synchronized I/O
       completion state. All I/O operations shall be completed as
       defined for synchronized I/O file integrity completion.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>fsync</i>() shall return 0. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error. If the
       <i>fsync</i>() function fails, outstanding I/O operations are not
       guaranteed to have been completed.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fsync</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid descriptor.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>fsync</i>() function was interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument does not refer to a file on which this
              operation is possible.

       <b>EIO    </b>An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
              file system.

       In the event that any of the queued I/O operations fail, <i>fsync</i>()
       shall return the error conditions defined for <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>().

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fsync</i>() function should be used by programs which require
       modifications to a file to be completed before continuing; for
       example, a program which contains a simple transaction facility
       might use it to ensure that all modifications to a file or files
       caused by a transaction are recorded.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fsync</i>() function is intended to force a physical write of
       data from the buffer cache, and to assure that after a system
       crash or other failure that all data up to the time of the
       <i>fsync</i>() call is recorded on the disk. Since the concepts of
       ``buffer cache'', ``system crash'', ``physical write'', and
       ``non-volatile storage'' are not defined here, the wording has to
       be more abstract.

       If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is not defined, the wording relies
       heavily on the conformance document to tell the user what can be
       expected from the system. It is explicitly intended that a null
       implementation is permitted. This could be valid in the case
       where the system cannot assure non-volatile storage under any
       circumstances or when the system is highly fault-tolerant and the
       functionality is not required. In the middle ground between these
       extremes, <i>fsync</i>() might or might not actually cause data to be
       written where it is safe from a power failure. The conformance
       document should identify at least that one configuration exists
       (and how to obtain that configuration) where this can be assured
       for at least some files that the user can select to use for
       critical data. It is not intended that an exhaustive list is
       required, but rather sufficient information is provided so that
       if critical data needs to be saved, the user can determine how
       the system is to be configured to allow the data to be written to
       non-volatile storage.

       It is reasonable to assert that the key aspects of <i>fsync</i>() are
       unreasonable to test in a test suite. That does not make the
       function any less valuable, just more difficult to test. A formal
       conformance test should probably force a system crash (power
       shutdown) during the test for this condition, but it needs to be
       done in such a way that automated testing does not require this
       to be done except when a formal record of the results is being
       made. It would also not be unreasonable to omit testing for
       <i>fsync</i>(), allowing it to be treated as a quality-of-implementation
       issue.
