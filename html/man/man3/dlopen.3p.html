       dlopen — open a symbol table handle
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;

       void *dlopen(const char *<i>file</i>, int <i>mode</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>dlopen</i>() function shall make the symbols (function
       identifiers and data object identifiers) in the executable object
       file specified by <i>file</i> available to the calling program.

       The class of executable object files eligible for this operation
       and the manner of their construction are implementation-defined,
       though typically such files are shared libraries or programs.

       Implementations may permit the construction of embedded
       dependencies in executable object files. In such cases, a
       <i>dlopen</i>() operation shall load those dependencies in addition to
       the executable object file specified by <i>file</i>.  Implementations
       may also impose specific constraints on the construction of
       programs that can employ <i>dlopen</i>() and its related services.

       A successful <i>dlopen</i>() shall return a symbol table handle which
       the caller may use on subsequent calls to <i>dlsym</i>() and <i>dlclose</i>().

       The value of this symbol table handle should not be interpreted
       in any way by the caller.

       The <i>file</i> argument is used to construct a pathname to the
       executable object file. If <i>file</i> contains a &lt;slash&gt; character, the
       <i>file</i> argument is used as the pathname for the file. Otherwise,
       <i>file</i> is used in an implementation-defined manner to yield a
       pathname.

       If <i>file</i> is a null pointer, <i>dlopen</i>() shall return a global symbol
       table handle for the currently running process image. This symbol
       table handle shall provide access to the symbols from an ordered
       set of executable object files consisting of the original program
       image file, any executable object files loaded at program start-
       up as specified by that process file (for example, shared
       libraries), and the set of executable object files loaded using
       <i>dlopen</i>() operations with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. As the latter set
       of executable object files can change during execution, the set
       of symbols made available by this symbol table handle can also
       change dynamically.

       Only a single copy of an executable object file shall be brought
       into the address space, even if <i>dlopen</i>() is invoked multiple
       times in reference to the executable object file, and even if
       different pathnames are used to reference the executable object
       file.

       The <i>mode</i> parameter describes how <i>dlopen</i>() shall operate upon <i>file</i>
       with respect to the processing of relocations and the scope of
       visibility of the symbols provided within <i>file</i>.  When an
       executable object file is brought into the address space of a
       process, it may contain references to symbols whose addresses are
       not known until the executable object file is loaded.

       These references shall be relocated before the symbols can be
       accessed. The <i>mode</i> parameter governs when these relocations take
       place and may have the following values:

       RTLD_LAZY   Relocations shall be performed at an implementation-
                   defined time, ranging from the time of the <i>dlopen</i>()
                   call until the first reference to a given symbol
                   occurs. Specifying RTLD_LAZY should improve
                   performance on implementations supporting dynamic
                   symbol binding since a process might not reference
                   all of the symbols in an executable object file. And,
                   for systems supporting dynamic symbol resolution for
                   normal process execution, this behavior mimics the
                   normal handling of process execution.

       RTLD_NOW    All necessary relocations shall be performed when the
                   executable object file is first loaded. This may
                   waste some processing if relocations are performed
                   for symbols that are never referenced. This behavior
                   may be useful for applications that need to know that
                   all symbols referenced during execution will be
                   available before <i>dlopen</i>() returns.

       Any executable object file loaded by <i>dlopen</i>() that requires
       relocations against global symbols can reference the symbols in
       the original process image file, any executable object files
       loaded at program start-up, from the initial process image
       itself, from any other executable object file included in the
       same <i>dlopen</i>() invocation, and any executable object files that
       were loaded in any <i>dlopen</i>() invocation and which specified the
       RTLD_GLOBAL flag. To determine the scope of visibility for the
       symbols loaded with a <i>dlopen</i>() invocation, the <i>mode</i> parameter
       should be a bitwise-inclusive OR with one of the following
       values:

       RTLD_GLOBAL The executable object file's symbols shall be made
                   available for relocation processing of any other
                   executable object file. In addition, symbol lookup
                   using <i>dlopen</i>(NULL,<i>mode</i>) and an associated <i>dlsym</i>()
                   allows executable object files loaded with this mode
                   to be searched.

       RTLD_LOCAL  The executable object file's symbols shall not be
                   made available for relocation processing of any other
                   executable object file.

       If neither RTLD_GLOBAL nor RTLD_LOCAL is specified, the default
       behavior is unspecified.

       If an executable object file is specified in multiple <i>dlopen</i>()
       invocations, <i>mode</i> is interpreted at each invocation.

       If RTLD_NOW has been specified, all relocations shall have been
       completed rendering further RTLD_NOW operations redundant and any
       further RTLD_LAZY operations irrelevant.

       If RTLD_GLOBAL has been specified, the executable object file
       shall maintain the RTLD_GLOBAL status regardless of any previous
       or future specification of RTLD_LOCAL, as long as the executable
       object file remains in the address space (see <a href="dlclose.3p.html">dlclose(3p)</a>).

       Symbols introduced into the process image through calls to
       <i>dlopen</i>() may be used in relocation activities. Symbols so
       introduced may duplicate symbols already defined by the program
       or previous <i>dlopen</i>() operations. To resolve the ambiguities such
       a situation might present, the resolution of a symbol reference
       to symbol definition is based on a symbol resolution order. Two
       such resolution orders are defined: load order and dependency
       order. Load order establishes an ordering among symbol
       definitions, such that the first definition loaded (including
       definitions from the process image file and any dependent
       executable object files loaded with it) has priority over
       executable object files added later (by <i>dlopen</i>()).  Load ordering
       is used in relocation processing. Dependency ordering uses a
       breadth-first order starting with a given executable object file,
       then all of its dependencies, then any dependents of those,
       iterating until all dependencies are satisfied. With the
       exception of the global symbol table handle obtained via a
       <i>dlopen</i>() operation with a null pointer as the <i>file</i> argument,
       dependency ordering is used by the <i>dlsym</i>() function. Load
       ordering is used in <i>dlsym</i>() operations upon the global symbol
       table handle.

       When an executable object file is first made accessible via
       <i>dlopen</i>(), it and its dependent executable object files are added
       in dependency order. Once all the executable object files are
       added, relocations are performed using load order. Note that if
       an executable object file or its dependencies had been previously
       loaded, the load and dependency orders may yield different
       resolutions.

       The symbols introduced by <i>dlopen</i>() operations and available
       through <i>dlsym</i>() are at a minimum those which are exported as
       identifiers of global scope by the executable object file.
       Typically, such identifiers shall be those that were specified in
       (for example) C source code as having <b>extern </b>linkage. The precise
       manner in which an implementation constructs the set of exported
       symbols for an executable object file is implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>dlopen</i>() shall return a symbol table
       handle. If <i>file</i> cannot be found, cannot be opened for reading, is
       not of an appropriate executable object file format for
       processing by <i>dlopen</i>(), or if an error occurs during the process
       of loading <i>file</i> or relocating its symbolic references, <i>dlopen</i>()
       shall return a null pointer. More detailed diagnostic information
       shall be available through <i>dlerror</i>().
