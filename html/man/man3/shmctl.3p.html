PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       shmctl — XSI shared memory control operations
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;

       int shmctl(int <i>shmid</i>, int <i>cmd</i>, struct shmid_ds *<i>buf</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>shmctl</i>() function operates on XSI shared memory (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.346</i>, <i>Shared Memory</i>
       <i>Object</i>).  It is unspecified whether this function interoperates
       with the realtime interprocess communication facilities defined
       in <i>Section 2.8</i>, <i>Realtime</i>.

       The <i>shmctl</i>() function provides a variety of shared memory control
       operations as specified by <i>cmd</i>.  The following values for <i>cmd</i> are
       available:

       IPC_STAT    Place the current value of each member of the
                   <b>shmid_ds </b>data structure associated with <i>shmid</i> into
                   the structure pointed to by <i>buf</i>.  The contents of the
                   structure are defined in <i>&lt;sys/shm.h&gt;</i>.

       IPC_SET     Set the value of the following members of the
                   <b>shmid_ds </b>data structure associated with <i>shmid</i> to the
                   corresponding value found in the structure pointed to
                   by <i>buf</i>:

                       shm_perm.uid
                       shm_perm.gid
                       shm_perm.mode    Low-order nine bits.

                   Also, the <i>shm_ctime</i> timestamp shall be set to the
                   current time, as described in <i>Section 2.7.1</i>, <i>IPC</i>
                   <i>General Description</i>.

                   IPC_SET can only be executed by a process that has an
                   effective user ID equal to either that of a process
                   with appropriate privileges or to the value of
                   <i>shm_perm.cuid</i> or <i>shm_perm.uid</i> in the <b>shmid_ds </b>data
                   structure associated with <i>shmid</i>.

       IPC_RMID    Remove the shared memory identifier specified by
                   <i>shmid</i> from the system and destroy the shared memory
                   segment and <b>shmid_ds </b>data structure associated with
                   it. IPC_RMID can only be executed by a process that
                   has an effective user ID equal to either that of a
                   process with appropriate privileges or to the value
                   of <i>shm_perm.cuid</i> or <i>shm_perm.uid</i> in the <b>shmid_ds </b>data
                   structure associated with <i>shmid</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>shmctl</i>() shall return 0; otherwise,
       it shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>shmctl</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The argument <i>cmd</i> is equal to IPC_STAT and the calling
              process does not have read permission; see <i>Section 2.7</i>,
              <i>XSI Interprocess Communication</i>.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>shmid</i> is not a valid shared memory
              identifier, or the value of <i>cmd</i> is not a valid command.

       <b>EPERM  </b>The argument <i>cmd</i> is equal to IPC_RMID or IPC_SET and the
              effective user ID of the calling process is not equal to
              that of a process with appropriate privileges and it is
              not equal to the value of <i>shm_perm.cuid</i> or <i>shm_perm.uid</i> in
              the data structure associated with <i>shmid</i>.

       The <i>shmctl</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The <i>cmd</i> argument is IPC_STAT and the <i>gid</i> or <i>uid</i> value is
              too large to be stored in the structure pointed to by the
              <i>buf</i> argument.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>

</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The POSIX Realtime Extension defines alternative interfaces for
       interprocess communication. Application developers who need to
       use IPC should design their applications so that modules using
       the IPC routines described in <i>Section 2.7</i>, <i>XSI Interprocess</i>
       <i>Communication</i> can be easily modified to use the alternative
       interfaces.
