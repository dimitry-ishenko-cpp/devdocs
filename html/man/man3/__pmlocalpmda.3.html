CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This  documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not  work,  or  may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       PCP  contexts  of  type <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL </b>are used by clients that
       wish to fetch metrics directly from one or more PMDAs on the  lo‐
       cal host without involving <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  A PMDA that is to be used in
       this way must have been built as a Dynamic Shared Object (DSO).

       Historically  the  table  of PMDAs available for use with <b>PM_CON‐</b>
       <b>TEXT_LOCAL </b>was hardcoded to the following:

       * The PMDA (or PMDAs) that export the operating system perfor‐
         mance data and data about process activity.
       * The <b>mmv </b>PMDA.
       * The <b>sample </b>PMDA provided <b>$PCP_LITE_SAMPLE </b>or <b>$PMDA_LOCAL_SAMPLE</b>
         is set in the environment - used mostly for QA and testing.

       The initial table of PMDAs available for use with <b>PM_CONTEXT_LO‐</b>
       <b>CAL </b>is now generated dynamically from all those PMDAs that have
       been installed as DSOs on the local host.  The one exception is
       the ``pmcd'' PMDA which only operates correctly in the address
       space of a running <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> process and so is not available to an
       application using a <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL </b>context.

       <b>__pmLocalPMDA </b>provides a number of services to amend the table of
       PMDAs available for use with <b>PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL</b>.

       The <i>op</i> argument specifies the what should be done and takes one
       of the following values and actions:

       PM_LOCAL_ADD    Append an entry to the table for the PMDA with a
                       Performance Metrics Domain (PMD) of <i>domain</i>, the
                       path to the DSO PMDA is given by <i>path</i> and the PM‐
                       DA's initialization routine is <i>init</i>.

       PM_LOCAL_DEL    Removes all entries in the table where the <i>domain</i>
                       matches, or the <i>path</i> matches.  Setting the argu‐
                       ments <i>domain</i> to -1 or <i>path</i> to <b>NULL </b>to force
                       matching on the <i>other</i> argument.  The <i>init</i> argu‐
                       ment is ignored.

       PM_LOCAL_CLEAR  Remove all entries from the table.  All the other
                       arguments are ignored in this case.

       The <i>domain</i>, <i>name</i> and <i>init</i> arguments have similar syntax and se‐
       mantics to the associated fields in the <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> configuration
       file.  The one difference is the <i>path</i> argument which is used by
       <b>__pmLocalPMDA </b>to find a likely looking DSO by searching in this
       order: <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR</b>/<i>path</i>, <i>path</i>, <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR</b>/<i>path</i>.<i>dso-suffix</i>
       and finally <i>path</i>.<i>dso-suffix</i> (<i>dso-suffix</i> is the local platform
       specific default file name suffix for a DSO, e.g.  <b>so </b>for Linux,
       <b>dylib </b>for Mac OS X, <b>dll </b>for Windows, etc.).
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       In most cases, <b>__pmLocalPMDA </b>returns 0 to indicate success.  If
       <i>op</i> is invalid, then the return value is <b>PM_ERR_CONV </b>else if there
       is no matching table entry found for a <b>PM_LOCAL_DEL </b>operation,
       PM_ERR_INDOM is returned.
