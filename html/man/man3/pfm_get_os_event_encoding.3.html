SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int pfm_get_os_event_encoding(const char *</b><i>str</i><b>, int </b><i>dfl_plm</i><b>, pfm_os_t </b><i>os</i><b>,  void *</b><i>arg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is the key function to retrieve the encoding of an event for
       a specific operating system interface. The event string passed in
       <b>str </b>is parsed and encoded for the operating system specified by
       <b>os</b>. Only one event per call can be encoded. As such, <b>str </b>can
       contain only one symbolic event name. The event is encoded to
       monitor at the privilege levels specified by the <b>dfl_plm </b>mask, if
       supported, otherwise this parameter is ignored. The operating
       system specific input and output arguments are passed in <b>arg</b>.

       The event string, <b>str</b>, may contains sub-event masks (umask) and
       any other supported modifiers. Only one event is parsed from the
       string. For convenience, it is possible to pass a comma-separated
       list of events in <b>str </b>but only the first event is encoded.

       The following values are supported for <b>os</b>:

       <b>PFM_OS_NONE</b>
              This value causes the event to be encoded purely as
              specified by the PMU hardware. The <b>arg </b>argument must be a
              pointer to a <b>pfm_pmu_encode_arg_t </b>structure which is
              defined as follows:

              typedef struct {
                  uint64_t    *codes;
                  char        **fstr;
                  size_t      size;
                  int         count;
                  int         idx;
              } pfm_pmu_encode_arg_t;

              The fields are defined as follows:

              <b>codes  </b>A pointer to an array of 64-bit values. On input,
                     if <b>codes </b>is NULL, then the library allocates
                     whatever is necessary to store the encoding of the
                     event. If <b>codes </b>is not NULL on input, then <b>count</b>
                     must reflect its actual number of elements. If
                     <b>count </b>is big enough, the library stores the
                     encoding at the address provided.  Otherwise, an
                     error is returned.

              <b>count  </b>On input, the field contains the maximum number of
                     elements in the array <b>codes</b>. Upon return, it
                     contains the number of actual entries in <b>codes</b>. If
                     <b>codes </b>is NULL, then count must be zero.

              <b>fstr   </b>If the caller is interested in retrieving the fully
                     qualified event string where all used unit masks
                     and all modifiers are spelled out, this field must
                     be set to a non-null address of a pointer to a
                     string (char **).  Upon return, if <b>fstr </b>was not
                     NULL, then the string pointer passed on entry
                     points to the event string. The string is
                     dynamically allocated and <b>must </b>eventually be freed
                     by the caller. If <b>fstr </b>was NULL on entry, then
                     nothing is returned in this field. The typical
                     calling sequence looks as follows:
                        char *fstr = NULL
                        pfm_pmu_encode_arg_t arg;
                        arg.fstr = &amp;fstr;
                        ret = pfm_get_os_event_encoding("event",
                                                        PFM_PLM0|PFM_PLM3,
                                                        PFM_OS_NONE,
                                                        &amp;e);
                        if (ret == PFM_SUCCESS) {
                           printf("fstr=%s\n", fstr);
                           free(fstr);
                        }

              <b>size   </b>This field contains the size of the struct passed.
                     This field is used to provide for extensibility of
                     the struct without compromising backward
                     compatibility.  The value should be set to
                     <b>sizeof(pfm_pmu_encode_arg_t)</b>. If instead, a value
                     of <b>0 </b>is specified, the library assumes the struct
                     passed is identical to the first ABI version which
                     size is <b>PFM_RAW_ENCODE_ABI0</b>. Thus, if fields were
                     added after the first ABI, they will not be set by
                     the library. The library does check that bytes
                     beyond what is implemented are zeroes.

              <b>idx    </b>Upon return, this field contains the opaque unique
                     identifier for the event described in <b>str</b>.  This
                     index can be used to retrieve information about the
                     event using <b>pfm_get_event_info()</b>, for instance.

       <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT, PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT_EXT</b>
              This value causes the event to be encoded for the
              perf_event Linux kernel interface (available since
              2.6.31).  The <b>arg </b>must be a pointer to a
              <b>pfm_perf_encode_arg_t </b>structure. The PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT
              layer provides the modifiers exported by the underlying
              PMU hardware, some of which may actually be overridden by
              the perf_event interface, such as the monitoring privilege
              levels. The <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT_EXT </b>extends
              <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT </b>to add modifiers controlled only by the
              perf_event interface, such as sampling period (<b>period</b>),
              frequency (<b>freq</b>) and exclusive resource access (<b>excl</b>).

              typedef struct {
                  struct perf_event_attr *attr;
                  char **fstr;
                  size_t size;
                  int idx;
                  int cpu;
                  int flags;
              } pfm_perf_encode_arg_t;
              The fields are defined as follows:

              <b>attr   </b>A pointer to a struct perf_event_attr as defined in
                     perf_event.h. This field cannot be NULL on entry.
                     The struct is not completely overwritten by the
                     call. The library only modifies the fields it knows
                     about, thereby allowing perf_event ABI mismatch
                     between caller and library.

              <b>fstr   </b>Same behavior as is described for PFM_OS_NONE
                     above.

              <b>size   </b>This field contains the size of the struct passed.
                     This field is used to provide for extensibility of
                     the struct without compromising backward
                     compatibility.  The value should be set to
                     <b>sizeof(pfm_perf_encode_arg_t)</b>. If instead, a value
                     of <b>0 </b>is specified, the library assumes the struct
                     passed is identical to the first ABI version which
                     size is <b>PFM_PERF_ENCODE_ABI0</b>. Thus, if fields were
                     added after the first ABI, they will not be set by
                     the library. The library does check that bytes
                     beyond what is implemented are zeroes.

              <b>idx    </b>Upon return, this field contains the opaque unique
                     identifier for the event described in <b>str</b>.  This
                     index can be used to retrieve information about the
                     event using <b>pfm_get_event_info()</b>, for instance.

              <b>cpu    </b>Not used yet.

              <b>flags  </b>Not used yet.

       Here is a example of how this function could be used with
       PFM_OS_NONE:
       #include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
       #include &lt;err.h&gt;
       #include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;
       int main(int argc, char **argv)
       {
          pfm_pmu_encode_t arg;
          int ret;

          ret = pfm_initialize();
          if (ret != PFMLIB_SUCCESS)
             errx(1, "cannot initialize library %s", pfm_strerror(ret));

          memset(&amp;arg, 0, sizeof(arg));

          ret = pfm_get_os_event_encoding("RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS", PFM_PLM3, PFM_OS_NONE, &amp;arg);
          if (ret != PFM_SUCCESS)
             err(1", cannot get encoding %s", pfm_strerror(ret));

          for(i=0; i &lt; arg.count; i++)
             printf("count[%d]=0x%"PRIx64"\n", i, arg.codes[i]);

          free(arg.codes);
          return 0;
       }
</pre> <h2>
RETURN </h2>
<pre>
       The function returns in <b>arg </b>the encoding of the event for the os
       passed in <b>os</b>. The content of <b>arg </b>depends on the <b>os </b>argument. Upon
       success, <b>PFM_SUCCESS </b>is returned otherwise a specific error code
       is returned.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PFM_ERR_TOOSMALL</b>
              The <b>code </b>argument is too small for the encoding.

       <b>PFM_ERR_INVAL</b>
              The <b>code </b>or <b>count </b>argument is <b>NULL </b>or the <b>str </b>contains
              more than one symbolic event.

       <b>PFM_ERR_NOMEM</b>
              Not enough memory.

       <b>PFM_ERR_NOTFOUND</b>
              Event not found.

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR</b>
              Invalid event attribute (unit mask or modifier)

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR_VAL</b>
              Invalid modifier value.

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR_SET</b>
              attribute already set, cannot be changed.

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR_UMASK</b>
              Missing unit mask.

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR_FEATCOMB</b>
              Unit masks or features cannot be combined into a single
              event.
