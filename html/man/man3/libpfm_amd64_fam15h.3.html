NAME </h2>
<pre>
       libpfm_amd64_fam15h - support for AMD64 Family 15h processors
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU name: amd64_fam15h_interlagos</b>
       <b>PMU desc: AMD64 Fam15h Interlagos</b>
       <b>PMU name: amd64_fam15h_nb</b>
       <b>PMU desc: AMD64 Fam15h Northbridge</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The library supports AMD Family 15h processors core PMU in both
       32 and 64-bit modes. The uncore (NorthBridge) PMU is also
       supported as a separate PMU model.
</pre> <h2>
MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on AMD64 Family 15h core
       PMU:

       <b>u      </b>Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
              2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This is a boolean
              modifier.

       <b>k      </b>Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
              This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>h      </b>Measure at while executing in host mode (when using
              virtualization). This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLMH</b>.  This
              modifier is available starting with Fam10h. This is a
              boolean modifier.

       <b>g      </b>Measure at while executing in guest mode (when using
              virtualization). This modifier is available starting with
              Fam10h. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>i      </b>Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
              count cycles in which the event is <b>not </b>occurring. This is
              a boolean modifier

       <b>e      </b>Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
              state transition. This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c      </b>Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
              The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
              number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
              the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
              the range [0:255].

       The uncore (NorthBridge) PMU <b>does not support </b>any modifiers.
