DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <a href="io_uring_prep_cancel.3.html">io_uring_prep_cancel(3)</a> function prepares a cancelation
       request. The submission queue entry <i>sqe</i> is prepared to cancel an
       existing request identified by <i>user_data</i>.  For the <i>flags</i>
       argument, see below.

       <a href="io_uring_prep_cancel64.3.html">io_uring_prep_cancel64(3)</a> is identical to
       <a href="io_uring_prep_cancel.3.html">io_uring_prep_cancel(3)</a>, except it takes a 64-bit integer rather
       than a pointer type.

       The cancelation request will attempt to find the previously
       issued request identified by <i>user_data</i> and cancel it. The
       identifier is what the previously issued request has in their
       <i>user_data</i> field in the SQE.

       The <a href="io_uring_prep_cancel_fd.3.html">io_uring_prep_cancel_fd(3)</a> function prepares a cancelation
       request. The submission queue entry <i>sqe</i> is prepared to cancel an
       existing request that used the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.  For the <i>flags</i>
       argument, see below.

       The cancelation request will attempt to find the previously
       issued request that used <i>fd</i> as the file descriptor and cancel it.

       By default, the first request matching the criteria given will be
       canceled.  This can be modified with any of the following flags
       passed in:

       <b>IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_ALL</b>
              Cancel all requests that match the given criteria, rather
              than just canceling the first one found. Available since
              5.19.

       <b>IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_FD</b>
              Match based on the file descriptor used in the original
              request rather than the user_data. This is what
              <a href="io_uring_prep_cancel_fd.3.html">io_uring_prep_cancel_fd(3)</a> sets up. Available since 5.19.

       <b>IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_FD_FIXED</b>
              Set in conjunction with <b>IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_FD ,</b>
              indicating that the file descriptor given is a direct
              descriptor rather than a normal file descriptor. Available
              since 6.0.

       <b>IORING_ASYNC_CANCEL_ANY</b>
              Match any request in the ring, regardless of user_data or
              file descriptor.  Can be used to cancel any pending
              request in the ring. Available since 5.19.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       None
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These are the errors that are reported in the CQE <i>res</i> field. If
       no flags are used to cancel multiple requests, <b>0 </b>is returned on
       success. If flags are used to match multiple requests, then a
       positive value is returned indicating how many requests were
       found and canceled.

       <b>-ENOENT</b>
              The request identified by <i>user_data</i> could not be located.
              This could be because it completed before the cancelation
              request was issued, or if an invalid identifier is used.

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
              One of the fields set in the SQE was invalid.

       <b>-EALREADY</b>
              The execution state of the request has progressed far
              enough that cancelation is no longer possible. This should
              normally mean that it will complete shortly, either
              successfully, or interrupted due to the cancelation.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Although the cancelation request uses async request syntax, the
       kernel side of the cancelation is always run synchronously. It is
       guaranteed that a CQE is always generated by the time the cancel
       request has been submitted. If the cancelation is successful, the
       completion for the request targeted for cancelation will have
       been posted by the time submission returns. For <b>-EALREADY </b>it may
       take a bit of time to do so. For this case, the caller must wait
       for the canceled request to post its completion event.
