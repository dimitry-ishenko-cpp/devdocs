DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       As part of the coverage-driven changes to QA in PCP 3.6, it
       became apparent that we needed someway to exercise the
       ``uncommon'' code paths associated with error detection and
       recovery.

       The facilities described below provide a basic fault injection
       infrastructure (for <i>libpcp</i> only at this stage, although the
       mechanism is far more general and could easily be extended).

       A special build is required to create <i>libpcp_fault</i> and the
       associated <i>&lt;pcp/fault.h&gt;</i> header file.  Once this has been done,
       new QA applications may be built with <b>-DPM_FAULT_INJECTION=1</b>
       and/or existing applications can be exercised in presence of
       fault injection by forcing <i>libpcp_fault</i> to be used in preference
       to <i>libpcp</i> as described below.

       In the code to be tested, <b>__pmFaultInject </b>defines a fault point
       at which a fault of type <i>class</i> may be injected.  <i>ident</i> is a
       string to uniquely identify the fault point across all of the PCP
       source code, so something like "libpcp/" __FILE__ ":&lt;number&gt;"
       works just fine.  The <i>ident</i> string also determines if a fault
       will be injected at run-time or not - refer to the <b>RUN-TIME</b>
       <b>CONTROL </b>section below.  <i>class</i> selects a failure type, using one
       of the following defined values (this list may well grow over
       time):

       <b>PM_FAULT_ALLOC</b>
              Will cause the <b>next </b>call to <a href="malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a>, <a href="realloc.3.html">realloc(3)</a> or
              <a href="strdup.3.html">strdup(3)</a> to fail, returning NULL and setting <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
              <b>ENOMEM</b>.  We could extend the coverage to all of the
              malloc-related routines, but these three are sufficient to
              cover the vast majority of the uses within <i>libpcp</i>.

       <b>PM_FAULT_CALL</b>
              Will cause the <b>next </b>call to an instrumented routine to
              fail by returning an error code (possibly the new
              <b>PM_ERR_FAULT </b>code).  The actual error code is defined in
              the <b>PM_FAULT_RETURN </b>macro at the head of an instrumented
              routine.  Initially, only <b>__pmRegisterAnon</b>(3) (returns
              <b>PM_ERR_FAULT</b>), <b>__pmGetPDU</b>(3) (returns <b>PM_ERR_TIMEOUT</b>) and
              <b>__pmAllocResult</b>(3) (returns <b>NULL</b>) were instrumented as a
              proof of concept for this part of the facility, however
              other routines may have this fault injection capability
              added over time.

       <b>PM_FAULT_MISC</b>
              The ``other'' class, currently used with <b>PM_FAULT_CHECK </b>as
              described below.

       To allow fault injection to co-exist within the production source
       code, <b>PM_FAULT_POINT </b>is a macro that emits no code by default,
       but when <b>PM_FAULT_INJECTION </b>is defined this becomes a call to
       <b>__pmFaultInject</b>.  Throughout <i>libpcp</i> we use <b>PM_FAULT_POINT </b>and <b>not</b>
       <b>__pmFaultInject </b>so that both <i>libpcp</i> and <i>libpcp_fault</i> can be built
       from the same source code.

       Similarly, the macro <b>PM_FAULT_RETURN </b>emits no code unless
       <b>PM_FAULT_INJECTION </b>is defined, in which case if a fault of type
       <b>PM_FAULT_CALL </b>has been armed with <b>__pmFaultInject </b>then, the
       enclosing routine return with the function value <i>retvalue</i>.

       The <b>PM_FAULT_CHECK </b>macro returns a value that may be 0 or 1.  If
       <b>PM_FAULT_INJECTION </b>is defined then if a fault of type
       <b>PM_FAULT_MISC </b>has been armed with <b>__pmFaultInject </b>then the value
       is 1 else it is 0.

       <b>PM_FAULT_CHECK </b>is most often used in concert with the
       <b>PM_FAULT_POINT </b>macro with the <b>PM_FAULT_MISC </b>class to potentially
       arm a trigger, then test <b>PM_FAULT_CHECK </b>and if this has the value
       1, then the <b>PM_FAULT_CLEAR </b>macro is used to clear any armed
       faults, and the fault injection code is executed.

       This is illustrated in the example below from
       <i>src/libpcp/src/exec.c</i>:

           pid = fork();

           /* begin fault-injection block */
           PM_FAULT_POINT("libpcp/" __FILE__ ":4", PM_FAULT_MISC);
           if (PM_FAULT_CHECK) {
            PM_FAULT_CLEAR;
            if (pid &gt; (pid_t)0)
                kill(pid, SIGKILL);
            setoserror(EAGAIN);
            pid = -1;
           }
           /* end fault-injection block */

       A summary of fault points seen and faults injected is produced on
       stdio stream <i>f</i> by <b>__pmFaultSummary</b>.

       Additional tracing (via <b>-Dfault </b>or <b>pmDebugOptions.fault</b>) and a
       new PMAPI error code (<b>PM_ERR_FAULT</b>) are also defined, although
       these will only ever be seen or used in <i>libpcp_fault</i>.  If
       <b>pmDebugOptions.fault </b>is set the first time <b>__pmFaultInject </b>is
       called, then <b>__pmFaultSummary </b>will be called automatically to
       report on <i>stderr</i> when the application exits (via <a href="atexit.3.html">atexit(3)</a>).

       Fault injection cannot be nested.  Each call to <b>__pmFaultInject</b>
       clears any previous fault injection that has been armed, but not
       yet executed.

       The fault injection infrastructure is <b>not </b>thread-safe and should
       only be used with applications that are known to be single-
       threaded.
</pre> <h2>
RUN-TIME CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       By default, no fault injection is enabled at run-time, even when
       <b>__pmFaultInject </b>is called.

       Faults are selectively enabled using a control file, identified
       by the environment variable <b>$PM_FAULT_CONTROL</b>; if this is not
       set, no faults are enabled.

       The control file (if it exists) is read the first time
       <b>__pmFaultInject </b>is called, and contains lines of the form:
               <i>ident op number</i>
       that define fault injection guards.

       <i>ident</i> is a fault point string (as defined by a call to
       <b>__pmFaultInject</b>, or more usually the <b>PM_FAULT_POINT </b>macro).  So
       one needs access to the <i>libpcp</i> source code to determine the
       available <i>ident</i> strings and their semantics.

       <i>op</i> is one of the C-style operators <b>&gt;=</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>==</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&lt;=</b>, <b>!= </b>or <b>% </b>and
       <i>number</i> is an unsigned integer.  <i>op number</i> is optional and the
       default is <b>&gt;0</b>

       The semantics of the fault injection guards are that each time
       <b>__pmFaultInject </b>is called for a particular <i>ident</i>, a trip count is
       incremented (the first trip is 1); if the C-style expression
       <i>tripcount op number</i> has the value 1 (so <b>true </b>for most <i>op</i>s, or the
       remainder equals 1 for the <b>% </b><i>op</i>), then a fault of the <i>class</i>
       defined for the fault point associated with <i>ident</i> will be armed,
       and executed as soon as possible.

       Within the control file, blank lines are ignored and lines
       beginning with # are treated as comments.

       For an existing application linked with <i>libpcp</i> fault injection
       may still be used by forcing <i>libpcp_fault</i> to be used in the place
       of <i>libpcp</i>.  The following example shows how this might be done.

       $ export PM_FAULT_CONTROL=/tmp/control
       $ cat $PM_FAULT_CONTROL
       # ok for 2 trips, then inject errors
       libpcp/events.c:1  &gt;2

       $ export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpcp_fault.so
       $ pmevent -Dfault -s 3 sample.event.records
       host:      localhost
       samples:   3
       interval:  1.00 sec
       sample.event.records[fungus]: 0 event records
       __pmFaultInject(libpcp/events.c:1) ntrip=1 SKIP
       sample.event.records[bogus]: 2 event records
         10:46:12.413 --- event record [0] flags 0x1 (point) ---
           sample.event.param_string "fetch #0"
         10:46:12.413 --- event record [1] flags 0x1 (point) ---
           sample.event.param_string "bingo!"
       __pmFaultInject(libpcp/events.c:1) ntrip=2 SKIP
       sample.event.records[fungus]: 1 event records
         10:46:03.416 --- event record [0] flags 0x1 (point) ---
       __pmFaultInject(libpcp/events.c:1) ntrip=3 INJECT
       sample.event.records[bogus]: pmUnpackEventRecords: Cannot allocate memory
       __pmFaultInject(libpcp/events.c:1) ntrip=4 INJECT
       sample.event.records[fungus]: pmUnpackEventRecords: Cannot allocate memory
       __pmFaultInject(libpcp/events.c:1) ntrip=5 INJECT
       sample.event.records[bogus]: pmUnpackEventRecords: Cannot allocate memory
