NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_cond_broadcast, pthread_cond_signal — broadcast or signal
       a condition
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_cond_broadcast(pthread_cond_t *<i>cond</i>);
       int pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *<i>cond</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall unblock threads blocked on a condition
       variable.

       The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function shall unblock all threads
       currently blocked on the specified condition variable <i>cond</i>.

       The <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() function shall unblock at least one of
       the threads that are blocked on the specified condition variable
       <i>cond</i> (if any threads are blocked on <i>cond</i>).

       If more than one thread is blocked on a condition variable, the
       scheduling policy shall determine the order in which threads are
       unblocked. When each thread unblocked as a result of a
       <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() returns from
       its call to <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>(), the
       thread shall own the mutex with which it called
       <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>().  The thread(s)
       that are unblocked shall contend for the mutex according to the
       scheduling policy (if applicable), and as if each had called
       <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>().

       The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions
       may be called by a thread whether or not it currently owns the
       mutex that threads calling <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or
       <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() have associated with the condition
       variable during their waits; however, if predictable scheduling
       behavior is required, then that mutex shall be locked by the
       thread calling <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>().

       The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() and <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions
       shall have no effect if there are no threads currently blocked on
       <i>cond</i>.

       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the <i>cond</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>()
       does not refer to an initialized condition variable.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() and
       <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions shall return zero; otherwise, an
       error number shall be returned to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function is used whenever the
       shared-variable state has been changed in a way that more than
       one thread can proceed with its task. Consider a single
       producer/multiple consumer problem, where the producer can insert
       multiple items on a list that is accessed one item at a time by
       the consumers. By calling the <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function,
       the producer would notify all consumers that might be waiting,
       and thereby the application would receive more throughput on a
       multi-processor. In addition, <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() makes it
       easier to implement a read-write lock. The
       <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function is needed in order to wake up
       all waiting readers when a writer releases its lock. Finally, the
       two-phase commit algorithm can use this broadcast function to
       notify all clients of an impending transaction commit.

       It is not safe to use the <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() function in a
       signal handler that is invoked asynchronously. Even if it were
       safe, there would still be a race between the test of the Boolean
       <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() that could not be efficiently eliminated.

       Mutexes and condition variables are thus not suitable for
       releasing a waiting thread by signaling from code running in a
       signal handler.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>cond</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>()
       does not refer to an initialized condition variable, it is
       recommended that the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b>
       error.

   <b>Multiple Awakenings by Condition Signal</b>
       On a multi-processor, it may be impossible for an implementation
       of <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() to avoid the unblocking of more than one
       thread blocked on a condition variable. For example, consider the
       following partial implementation of <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() and
       <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(), executed by two threads in the order
       given. One thread is trying to wait on the condition variable,
       another is concurrently executing <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(), while a
       third thread is already waiting.

           pthread_cond_wait(mutex, cond):
               value = cond-&gt;value; /* 1 */
               pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex); /* 2 */
               pthread_mutex_lock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 10 */
               if (value == cond-&gt;value) { /* 11 */
                   me-&gt;next_cond = cond-&gt;waiter;
                   cond-&gt;waiter = me;
                   pthread_mutex_unlock(cond-&gt;mutex);
                   unable_to_run(me);
               } else
                   pthread_mutex_unlock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 12 */
               pthread_mutex_lock(mutex); /* 13 */

           pthread_cond_signal(cond):
               pthread_mutex_lock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 3 */
               cond-&gt;value++; /* 4 */
               if (cond-&gt;waiter) { /* 5 */
                   sleeper = cond-&gt;waiter; /* 6 */
                   cond-&gt;waiter = sleeper-&gt;next_cond; /* 7 */
                   able_to_run(sleeper); /* 8 */
               }
               pthread_mutex_unlock(cond-&gt;mutex); /* 9 */

       The effect is that more than one thread can return from its call
       to <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() as a result of
       one call to <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>().  This effect is called
       ``spurious wakeup''.  Note that the situation is self-correcting
       in that the number of threads that are so awakened is finite; for
       example, the next thread to call <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() after the
       sequence of events above blocks.

       While this problem could be resolved, the loss of efficiency for
       a fringe condition that occurs only rarely is unacceptable,
       especially given that one has to check the predicate associated
       with a condition variable anyway. Correcting this problem would
       unnecessarily reduce the degree of concurrency in this basic
       building block for all higher-level synchronization operations.

       An added benefit of allowing spurious wakeups is that
       applications are forced to code a predicate-testing-loop around
       the condition wait.  This also makes the application tolerate
       superfluous condition broadcasts or signals on the same condition
       variable that may be coded in some other part of the application.
       The resulting applications are thus more robust. Therefore,
       POSIX.1‐2008 explicitly documents that spurious wakeups may
       occur.
