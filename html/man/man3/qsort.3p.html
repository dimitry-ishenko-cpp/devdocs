PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       qsort — sort a table of data
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

       void qsort(void *<i>base</i>, size_t <i>nel</i>, size_t <i>width</i>,
           int (*<i>compar</i>)(const void *, const void *));
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>qsort</i>() function shall sort an array of <i>nel</i> objects, the
       initial element of which is pointed to by <i>base</i>.  The size of each
       object, in bytes, is specified by the <i>width</i> argument. If the <i>nel</i>
       argument has the value zero, the comparison function pointed to
       by <i>compar</i> shall not be called and no rearrangement shall take
       place.

       The application shall ensure that the comparison function pointed
       to by <i>compar</i> does not alter the contents of the array. The
       implementation may reorder elements of the array between calls to
       the comparison function, but shall not alter the contents of any
       individual element.

       When the same objects (consisting of width bytes, irrespective of
       their current positions in the array) are passed more than once
       to the comparison function, the results shall be consistent with
       one another.  That is, they shall define a total ordering on the
       array.

       The contents of the array shall be sorted in ascending order
       according to a comparison function. The <i>compar</i> argument is a
       pointer to the comparison function, which is called with two
       arguments that point to the elements being compared. The
       application shall ensure that the function returns an integer
       less than, equal to, or greater than 0, if the first argument is
       considered respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the
       second. If two members compare as equal, their order in the
       sorted array is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qsort</i>() function shall not return a value.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The comparison function need not compare every byte, so arbitrary
       data may be contained in the elements in addition to the values
       being compared.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The requirement that each argument (hereafter referred to as <i>p)</i>
       to the comparison function is a pointer to elements of the array
       implies that for every call, for each argument separately, all of
       the following expressions are non-zero:

           ((char *)p - (char *)base) % width == 0
           (char *)p &gt;= (char *)base
           (char *)p &lt; (char *)base + nel * width
