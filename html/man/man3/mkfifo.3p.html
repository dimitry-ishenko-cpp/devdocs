NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mkfifo, mkfifoat — make a FIFO special file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

       int mkfifo(const char *<i>path</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>);

       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int mkfifoat(int <i>fd</i>, const char *<i>path</i>, mode_t <i>mode</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mkfifo</i>() function shall create a new FIFO special file named
       by the pathname pointed to by <i>path</i>.  The file permission bits of
       the new FIFO shall be initialized from <i>mode</i>.  The file permission
       bits of the <i>mode</i> argument shall be modified by the process' file
       creation mask.

       When bits in <i>mode</i> other than the file permission bits are set,
       the effect is implementation-defined.

       If <i>path</i> names a symbolic link, <i>mkfifo</i>() shall fail and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>
       to <b>[EEXIST]</b>.

       The FIFO's user ID shall be set to the process' effective user
       ID. The FIFO's group ID shall be set to the group ID of the
       parent directory or to the effective group ID of the process.
       Implementations shall provide a way to initialize the FIFO's
       group ID to the group ID of the parent directory. Implementations
       may, but need not, provide an implementation-defined way to
       initialize the FIFO's group ID to the effective group ID of the
       calling process.

       Upon successful completion, <i>mkfifo</i>() shall mark for update the
       last data access, last data modification, and last file status
       change timestamps of the file. Also, the last data modification
       and last file status change timestamps of the directory that
       contains the new entry shall be marked for update.

       The <i>mkfifoat</i>() function shall be equivalent to the <i>mkfifo</i>()
       function except in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a relative path.
       In this case the newly created FIFO is created relative to the
       directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the
       current working directory. If the access mode of the open file
       description associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH,
       the function shall check whether directory searches are permitted
       using the current permissions of the directory underlying the
       file descriptor. If the access mode is O_SEARCH, the function
       shall not perform the check.

       If <i>mkfifoat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the <i>fd</i>
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to <i>mkfifo</i>().
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return 0.
       Otherwise, these functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error. If -1 is returned, no FIFO shall be created.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>A component of the path prefix denies search permission,
              or write permission is denied on the parent directory of
              the FIFO to be created.

       <b>EEXIST </b>The named file already exists.

       <b>ELOOP  </b>A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
              resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
              {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT </b>A component of the path prefix of <i>path</i> does not name an
              existing file or <i>path</i> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOENT </b>or <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt;
              character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters. If <i>path</i> without the trailing &lt;slash&gt;
              characters would name an existing file, an <b>[ENOENT] </b>error
              shall not occur.

       <b>ENOSPC </b>The directory that would contain the new file cannot be
              extended or the file system is out of file-allocation
              resources.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
              is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EROFS  </b>The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       The <i>mkfifoat</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>The access mode of the open file description associated
              with <i>fd</i> is not O_SEARCH and the permissions of the
              directory underlying <i>fd</i> do not permit directory searches.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>path</i> argument does not specify an absolute path and
              the <i>fd</i> argument is neither AT_FDCWD nor a valid file
              descriptor open for reading or searching.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              The <i>path</i> argument is not an absolute path and <i>fd</i> is a file
              descriptor associated with a non-directory file.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP  </b>More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
              during resolution of the <i>path</i> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
              resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
              result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Creating a FIFO File</b>
       The following example shows how to create a FIFO file named
       <b>/home/cnd/mod_done</b>, with read/write permissions for owner, and
       with read permissions for group and others.

           #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

           int status;
           ...
           status = mkfifo("/home/cnd/mod_done", S_IWUSR | S_IRUSR |
               S_IRGRP | S_IROTH);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The syntax of this function is intended to maintain compatibility
       with historical implementations of <i>mknod</i>().  The latter function
       was included in the 1984 /usr/group standard but only for use in
       creating FIFO special files. The <i>mknod</i>() function was originally
       excluded from the POSIX.1‐1988 standard as implementation-defined
       and replaced by <i>mkdir</i>() and <i>mkfifo</i>().  The <i>mknod</i>() function is
       now included for alignment with the Single UNIX Specification.

       The POSIX.1‐1990 standard required that the group ID of a newly
       created FIFO be set to the group ID of its parent directory or to
       the effective group ID of the creating process. FIPS 151‐2
       required that implementations provide a way to have the group ID
       be set to the group ID of the containing directory, but did not
       prohibit implementations also supporting a way to set the group
       ID to the effective group ID of the creating process.  Conforming
       applications should not assume which group ID will be used. If it
       matters, an application can use <i>chown</i>() to set the group ID after
       the FIFO is created, or determine under what conditions the
       implementation will set the desired group ID.

       The purpose of the <i>mkfifoat</i>() function is to create a FIFO
       special file in directories other than the current working
       directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the
       path of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to
       <i>mkfifo</i>(), resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file
       descriptor for the target directory and using the <i>mkfifoat</i>()
       function it can be guaranteed that the newly created FIFO is
       located relative to the desired directory.
