       default colors

SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;curses.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int use_default_colors(void);</b>
       <b>int assume_default_colors(int </b><i>fg</i><b>, int </b><i>bg</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>use_default_colors </b>and <b>assume_default_colors </b>functions are
       extensions to the curses library.  They are used with terminals
       that support ISO 6429 color, or equivalent.  These terminals
       allow the application to reset color to an unspecified default
       value (e.g., with SGR 39 or SGR 49).

       Applications that paint a colored background over the whole
       screen do not take advantage of SGR 39 and SGR 49.  Some
       applications are designed to work with the default background,
       using colors only for text.  For example, there are several
       implementations of the <b>ls </b>program which use colors to denote
       different file types or permissions.  These “color ls” programs
       do not necessarily modify the background color, typically using
       only the <b>setaf </b>terminfo capability to set the foreground color.
       Full-screen applications that use default colors can achieve
       similar visual effects.

       The first function, <b>use_default_colors </b>tells the curses library
       to assign terminal default foreground/background colors to color
       number -1.  So init_pair(x,COLOR_RED,-1) will initialize pair x
       as red on default background and init_pair(x,-1,COLOR_BLUE) will
       initialize pair x as default foreground on blue.

       The other, <b>assume_default_colors </b>is a refinement which tells
       which colors to paint for color pair 0.  This function recognizes
       a special color number -1, which denotes the default terminal
       color.

       The following are equivalent:
              <i>use_default_colors();</i>
              <i>assume_default_colors(-1,-1);</i>

       These are ncurses extensions.  For other curses implementations,
       color number -1 does not mean anything, just as for ncurses
       before a successful call of <b>use_default_colors </b>or
       <b>assume_default_colors</b>.

       Other curses implementations do not allow an application to
       modify color pair 0.  They assume that the background is
       COLOR_BLACK, but do not ensure that the color pair 0 is painted
       to match the assumption.  If your application does not use either
       <b>use_default_colors </b>or <b>assume_default_colors </b>ncurses will paint a
       white foreground (text) with black background for color pair 0.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       These functions return the integer <b>ERR </b>upon failure and <b>OK </b>on
       success.  They will fail if either the terminal does not support
       the <b>orig_pair </b>or <b>orig_colors </b>capability.  If the <b>initialize_pair</b>
       capability is not found, this causes an error as well.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Associated with this extension, the <b>init_pair </b>function accepts
       negative arguments to specify default foreground or background
       colors.

       The <b>use_default_colors </b>function was added to support <b>ded</b>.  This
       is a full-screen application which uses curses to manage only
       part of the screen.  The bottom portion of the screen, which is
       of adjustable size, is left uncolored to display the results from
       shell commands.  The top portion of the screen colors filenames
       using a scheme like the “color ls” programs.  Attempting to
       manage the background color of the screen for this application
       would give unsatisfactory results for a variety of reasons.  This
       extension was devised after noting that color xterm (and similar
       programs) provides a background color which does not necessarily
       correspond to any of the ANSI colors.  While a special terminfo
       entry could be constructed using nine colors, there was no
       mechanism provided within curses to account for the related
       <b>orig_pair </b>and <b>back_color_erase </b>capabilities.

       The <b>assume_default_colors </b>function was added to solve a different
       problem: support for applications which would use environment
       variables and other configuration to bypass curses' notion of the
       terminal's default colors, setting specific values.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported
       on Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended
       that any code depending on them be conditioned using
       NCURSES_VERSION.
