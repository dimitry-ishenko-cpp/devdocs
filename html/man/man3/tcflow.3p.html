PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       tcflow — suspend or restart the transmission or reception of data
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;termios.h&gt;

       int tcflow(int <i>fildes</i>, int <i>action</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tcflow</i>() function shall suspend or restart transmission or
       reception of data on the object referred to by <i>fildes</i>, depending
       on the value of <i>action</i>.  The <i>fildes</i> argument is an open file
       descriptor associated with a terminal.

        *  If <i>action</i> is TCOOFF, output shall be suspended.

        *  If <i>action</i> is TCOON, suspended output shall be restarted.

        *  If <i>action</i> is TCIOFF and <i>fildes</i> refers to a terminal device,
           the system shall transmit a STOP character, which is intended
           to cause the terminal device to stop transmitting data to the
           system. If <i>fildes</i> is associated with a pseudo-terminal, the
           STOP character need not be transmitted.

        *  If <i>action</i> is TCION and <i>fildes</i> refers to a terminal device,
           the system shall transmit a START character, which is
           intended to cause the terminal device to start transmitting
           data to the system. If <i>fildes</i> is associated with a pseudo-
           terminal, the START character need not be transmitted.

       The default on the opening of a terminal file is that neither its
       input nor its output are suspended.

       Attempts to use <i>tcflow</i>() from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a <i>fildes</i> associated with its
       controlling terminal, shall cause the process group to be sent a
       SIGTTOU signal.  If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU
       signals or the process is ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process
       shall be allowed to perform the operation, and no signal is sent.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise, -1
       shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tcflow</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>action</i> argument is not a supported value.

       <b>EIO    </b>The process group of the writing process is orphaned, the
              calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, and the process is
              not ignoring SIGTTOU.

       <b>ENOTTY </b>The file associated with <i>fildes</i> is not a terminal.
