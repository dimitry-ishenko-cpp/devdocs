NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gnutls_global_init - API function
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int gnutls_global_init( </b><i>void</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
        void
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Since GnuTLS 3.3.0 this function is no longer necessary to be
       explicitly called. To disable the implicit call (in a library
       constructor) of this function set the environment variable
       <b>GNUTLS_NO_IMPLICIT_INIT </b>to 1.

       This function performs any required precalculations, detects the
       supported CPU capabilities and initializes the underlying
       cryptographic backend. In order to free any resources taken by
       this call you should <b>gnutls_global_deinit() </b>when gnutls usage is
       no longer needed.

       This function increments a global counter, so that
       <b>gnutls_global_deinit() </b>only releases resources when it has been
       called as many times as <b>gnutls_global_init()</b>.  This is useful
       when GnuTLS is used by more than one library in an application.
       This function can be called many times, but will only do
       something the first time. It is thread safe since GnuTLS 3.3.0.

       A subsequent call of this function if the initial has failed will
       return the same error code.
</pre> <h2>
RETURNS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS </b>(0) is returned, otherwise a
       negative error code is returned.
