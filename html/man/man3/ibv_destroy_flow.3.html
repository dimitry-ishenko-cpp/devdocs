       Flow specification general structure:
       struct ibv_flow_spec_xxx {
               enum ibv_flow_spec_type  type;
               uint16_t  size;                  /* Flow specification size = sizeof(struct ibv_flow_spec_xxx) */
               struct ibv_flow_xxx_filter val;
               struct ibv_flow_xxx_filter mask; /* Defines which bits from the filter value are applicable when looking for a match in the incoming packet */
       };

       Each spec struct holds the relevant network layer parameters for matching. To enforce the match, the user sets a mask for each parameter.
       Packets coming from the wire are matched against the flow specification. If a match is found, the associated flow actions are executed on the packet.
       In ingress flows, the QP parameter is treated as another action of scattering the packet to the respected QP.
       If the bit is set in the mask, the corresponding bit in the value should be matched.
       Note that most vendors support either full mask (all "1"s) or zero mask (all "0"s).
       <b>Network parameters in the relevant network structs should be given in network order (big endian).</b>

   <b>Flow domains and priority</b>
       Flow steering defines the concept of domain and priority. Each
       domain represents an application that can attach a flow.  Domains
       are prioritized. A higher priority domain will always supersede a
       lower priority domain when their flow specifications overlap.
       <b>IB verbs have the higher priority domain.</b>
       In addition to the domain, there is priority within each of the
       domains.  A lower priority numeric value (higher priority) takes
       precedence over matching rules with higher numeric priority value
       (lower priority).  It is important to note that the priority
       value of a flow spec is used not only to establish the precedence
       of conflicting flow matches but also as a way to abstract the
       order on which flow specs are tested for matches. Flows with
       higher priorities will be tested before flows with lower
       priorities.

   <b>Rules definition ordering</b>
       An application can provide the ibv_flow_spec_xxx rules in an un-
       ordered scheme. In this case, each spec should be well defined
       and match a specific network header layer.  In some cases, when
       certain flow spec types are present in the spec list, it is
       required to provide the list in an ordered manner so that the
       position of that flow spec type in the protocol stack is strictly
       defined.  When the certain spec type, which requires the
       ordering, resides in the inner network protocol stack (in tunnel
       protocols) the ordering should be applied to the inner network
       specs and should be combined with the inner spec indication using
       the IBV_FLOW_SPEC_INNER flag.  For example: An MPLS spec which
       attempts to match an MPLS tag in the inner network should have
       the IBV_FLOW_SPEC_INNER flag set and so do the rest of the inner
       network specs. On top of that, all the inner network specs should
       be provided in an ordered manner.  This is essential to represent
       many of the encapsulation tunnel protocols.

       The flow spec types which require this sort of ordering are:
       <b>1. IBV_FLOW_SPEC_MPLS -</b>
       Since MPLS header can appear at several locations in the protocol
       stack and can also be encapsulated on top of different layers, it
       is required to place this spec according to its exact location in
       the protocol stack.

   <b>ibv_destroy_flow()</b>
       destroys the flow <i>flow_id</i>.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ibv_create_flow() </b>returns a pointer to the flow, or NULL if the
       request fails. In case of an error, errno is updated.

       <b>ibv_destroy_flow() </b>returns 0 on success, or the value of errno on
       failure (which indicates the failure reason).
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>EINVAL</b>
       <b>ibv_create_flow() </b>flow specification, QP or priority are invalid

       <b>ibv_destroy_flow() </b>flow_id is invalid

   <b>ENOMEM</b>
       Couldn't create/destroy flow, not enough memory

   <b>ENXIO</b>
       Device managed flow steering isn't currently supported

   <b>EPERM</b>
       No permissions to add the flow steering rule
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       1. These verbs are available only for devices supporting
          IBV_DEVICE_MANAGED_FLOW_STEERING and only for QPs of Transport
       Service Type <b>IBV_QPT_UD </b>or <b>IBV_QPT_RAW_PACKET</b>
       2. User must memset the spec struct with zeros before using it.
       3. ether_type field in ibv_flow_eth_filter is the ethertype
       following the last VLAN tag of the packet.
       4. Only rule type IBV_FLOW_ATTR_NORMAL supports
       IBV_FLOW_ATTR_FLAGS_DONT_TRAP flag.
       5. No specifications are needed for IBV_FLOW_ATTR_SNIFFER rule
       type.
       6. When IBV_FLOW_ATTR_FLAGS_EGRESS flag is set, the qp parameter
       is used only as a mean to get the device.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       Below flow_attr defines a rule in priority 0 to match a
       destination mac address and a source ipv4 address. For that, L2
       and L3 specs are used.
       If there is a hit on this rule, means the received packet has
       destination mac: 66:11:22:33:44:55 and source ip: 0x0B86C806, the
       packet is steered to its attached qp.
