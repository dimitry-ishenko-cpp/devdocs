</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_bus_negotiate_fds() </b>controls whether file descriptor passing
       shall be negotiated for the specified bus connection. It takes a
       bus object and a boolean, which, when true, enables file
       descriptor passing, and, when false, disables it. Note that not
       all transports and servers support file descriptor passing. In
       particular, networked transports generally do not support file
       descriptor passing. To find out whether file descriptor passing
       is available after negotiation, use <a href="sd_bus_can_send.3.html">sd_bus_can_send(3)</a> and pass
       <b>SD_BUS_TYPE_UNIX_FD</b>. Note that file descriptor passing is always
       enabled for both sending and receiving or for neither, but never
       only in one direction. By default, file descriptor passing is
       negotiated for all connections.

       <b>sd_bus_negotiate_timestamp() </b>controls whether implicit sender
       timestamps shall be attached automatically to all incoming
       messages. Takes a bus object and a boolean, which, when true,
       enables timestamping, and, when false, disables it. Use
       <a href="sd_bus_message_get_monotonic_usec.3.html">sd_bus_message_get_monotonic_usec(3)</a>,
       <a href="sd_bus_message_get_realtime_usec.3.html">sd_bus_message_get_realtime_usec(3)</a>, <a href="sd_bus_message_get_seqnum.3.html">sd_bus_message_get_seqnum(3)</a>
       to query the timestamps of incoming messages. If negotiation is
       disabled or not supported, these calls will fail with <b>-ENODATA</b>.
       Note that currently no transports support timestamping of
       messages. By default, message timestamping is not negotiated for
       connections.

       <b>sd_bus_negotiate_creds() </b>controls whether and which implicit
       sender credentials shall be attached automatically to all
       incoming messages. Takes a bus object and a boolean indicating
       whether to enable or disable the credential parts encoded in the
       bit mask value argument. Note that not all transports support
       attaching sender credentials to messages, or do not support all
       types of sender credential parameters, or might suppress them
       under certain circumstances for individual messages.
       Specifically, dbus1 only supports <b>SD_BUS_CREDS_UNIQUE_NAME</b>. The
       sender credentials are suitable for authorization decisions. By
       default, only <b>SD_BUS_CREDS_WELL_KNOWN_NAMES </b>and
       <b>SD_BUS_CREDS_UNIQUE_NAME </b>are enabled. In fact, these two
       credential fields are always sent along and cannot be turned off.

       <b>sd_bus_get_creds_mask() </b>returns the set of sender credentials
       that was negotiated to be attached to all incoming messages in
       <i>mask</i>. This value is an upper boundary only. Hence, always make
       sure to explicitly check which credentials are attached to a
       specific message before using it.

       The <b>sd_bus_negotiate_fds() </b>function may be called only before the
       connection has been started with <a href="sd_bus_start.3.html">sd_bus_start(3)</a>. Both
       <b>sd_bus_negotiate_timestamp() </b>and <b>sd_bus_negotiate_creds() </b>may
       also be called after a connection has been set up. Note that,
       when operating on a connection that is shared between multiple
       components of the same program (for example via
       <a href="sd_bus_default.3.html">sd_bus_default(3)</a>), it is highly recommended to only enable
       additional per message metadata fields, but never disable them
       again, in order not to disable functionality needed by other
       components.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       On success, these functions return a non-negative integer. On
       failure, they return a negative errno-style error code.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-EPERM</b>
           The bus connection has already been started.

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
           An argument is invalid.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>-ENOPKG</b>
           The bus cannot be resolved.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>-ECHILD</b>
           The bus was created in a different process, library or module
           instance.

           Added in version 246.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which
       can be compiled against and linked to with the
       <b>libsystemd pkg-config</b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <a href="getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>, which is declared to be
       not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the
       functions described here must not call <a href="setenv.3.html">setenv(3)</a> from a parallel
       thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv() </b>from an
       early phase of the program when no other threads have been
       started.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sd_bus_negotiate_fds()</b>, <b>sd_bus_negotiate_timestamp()</b>, and
       <b>sd_bus_negotiate_creds() </b>were added in version 212.

       <b>sd_bus_get_creds_mask() </b>was added in version 246.
