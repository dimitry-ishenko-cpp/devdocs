PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       longjmp — non-local goto
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;

       void longjmp(jmp_buf <i>env</i>, int <i>val</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>longjmp</i>() function shall restore the environment saved by the
       most recent invocation of <i>setjmp</i>() in the same process, with the
       corresponding <b>jmp_buf </b>argument. If the most recent invocation of
       <i>setjmp</i>() with the corresponding <b>jmp_buf </b>occurred in another
       thread, or if there is no such invocation, or if the function
       containing the invocation of <i>setjmp</i>() has terminated execution in
       the interim, or if the invocation of <i>setjmp</i>() was within the
       scope of an identifier with variably modified type and execution
       has left that scope in the interim, the behavior is undefined.
       It is unspecified whether <i>longjmp</i>() restores the signal mask,
       leaves the signal mask unchanged, or restores it to its value at
       the time <i>setjmp</i>() was called.

       All accessible objects have values, and all other components of
       the abstract machine have state (for example, floating-point
       status flags and open files), as of the time <i>longjmp</i>() was
       called, except that the values of objects of automatic storage
       duration are unspecified if they meet all the following
       conditions:

        *  They are local to the function containing the corresponding
           <i>setjmp</i>() invocation.

        *  They do not have volatile-qualified type.

        *  They are changed between the <i>setjmp</i>() invocation and
           <i>longjmp</i>() call.

       Although <i>longjmp</i>() is an async-signal-safe function, if it is
       invoked from a signal handler which interrupted a non-async-
       signal-safe function or equivalent (such as the processing
       equivalent to <i>exit</i>() performed after a return from the initial
       call to <i>main</i>()), the behavior of any subsequent call to a non-
       async-signal-safe function or equivalent is undefined.

       The effect of a call to <i>longjmp</i>() where initialization of the
       <b>jmp_buf </b>structure was not performed in the calling thread is
       undefined.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       After <i>longjmp</i>() is completed, program execution continues as if
       the corresponding invocation of <i>setjmp</i>() had just returned the
       value specified by <i>val</i>.  The <i>longjmp</i>() function shall not cause
       <i>setjmp</i>() to return 0; if <i>val</i> is 0, <i>setjmp</i>() shall return 1.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Applications whose behavior depends on the value of the signal
       mask should not use <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>setjmp</i>(), since their effect on
       the signal mask is unspecified, but should instead use the
       <i>siglongjmp</i>() and <i>sigsetjmp</i>() functions (which can save and
       restore the signal mask under application control).

       It is recommended that applications do not call <i>longjmp</i>() or
       <i>siglongjmp</i>() from signal handlers. To avoid undefined behavior
       when calling these functions from a signal handler, the
       application needs to ensure one of the following two things:

        1. After the call to <i>longjmp</i>() or <i>siglongjmp</i>() the process only
           calls async-signal-safe functions and does not return from
           the initial call to <i>main</i>().

        2. Any signal whose handler calls <i>longjmp</i>() or <i>siglongjmp</i>() is
           blocked during <i>every</i> call to a non-async-signal-safe
           function, and no such calls are made after returning from the
           initial call to <i>main</i>().
