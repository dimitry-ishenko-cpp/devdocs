       #include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;

       pid_t wait(int *<i>stat_loc</i>);

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() functions shall obtain status
       information (see <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Status Information</i>) pertaining to
       one of the caller's child processes. The <i>wait</i>() function obtains
       status information for process termination from any child
       process. The <i>waitpid</i>() function obtains status information for
       process termination, and optionally process stop and/or continue,
       from a specified subset of the child processes.

       The <i>wait</i>() function shall cause the calling thread to become
       blocked until status information generated by child process
       termination is made available to the thread, or until delivery of
       a signal whose action is either to execute a signal-catching
       function or to terminate the process, or an error occurs. If
       termination status information is available prior to the call to
       <i>wait</i>(), return shall be immediate. If termination status
       information is available for two or more child processes, the
       order in which their status is reported is unspecified.

       As described in <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Status Information</i>, the <i>wait</i>() and
       <i>waitpid</i>() functions consume the status information they obtain.

       The behavior when multiple threads are blocked in <i>wait</i>(),
       <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>() is described in <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Status</i>
       <i>Information</i>.

       The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>wait</i>() if the <i>pid</i>
       argument is (<b>pid_t</b>)-1 and the <i>options</i> argument is 0. Otherwise,
       its behavior shall be modified by the values of the <i>pid</i> and
       <i>options</i> arguments.

       The <i>pid</i> argument specifies a set of child processes for which
       <i>status</i> is requested. The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall only return the
       status of a child process from this set:

        *  If <i>pid</i> is equal to (<b>pid_t</b>)-1, <i>status</i> is requested for any
           child process. In this respect, <i>waitpid</i>() is then equivalent
           to <i>wait</i>().

        *  If <i>pid</i> is greater than 0, it specifies the process ID of a
           single child process for which <i>status</i> is requested.

        *  If <i>pid</i> is 0, <i>status</i> is requested for any child process whose
           process group ID is equal to that of the calling process.

        *  If <i>pid</i> is less than (<b>pid_t</b>)-1, <i>status</i> is requested for any
           child process whose process group ID is equal to the absolute
           value of <i>pid</i>.

       The <i>options</i> argument is constructed from the bitwise-inclusive OR
       of zero or more of the following flags, defined in the
       <i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i> header:

       WCONTINUED  The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall report the status of any
                   continued child process specified by <i>pid</i> whose status
                   has not been reported since it continued from a job
                   control stop.

       WNOHANG     The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall not suspend execution of
                   the calling thread if <i>status</i> is not immediately
                   available for one of the child processes specified by
                   <i>pid</i>.

       WUNTRACED   The status of any child processes specified by <i>pid</i>
                   that are stopped, and whose status has not yet been
                   reported since they stopped, shall also be reported
                   to the requesting process.

       If <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() return because the status of a child
       process is available, these functions shall return a value equal
       to the process ID of the child process. In this case, if the
       value of the argument <i>stat_loc</i> is not a null pointer, information
       shall be stored in the location pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i>.  The
       value stored at the location pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i> shall be 0 if
       and only if the status returned is from a terminated child
       process that terminated by one of the following means:

        1. The process returned 0 from <i>main</i>().

        2. The process called <i>_exit</i>() or <i>exit</i>() with a <i>status</i> argument
           of 0.

        3. The process was terminated because the last thread in the
           process terminated.

       Regardless of its value, this information may be interpreted
       using the following macros, which are defined in <i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i> and
       evaluate to integral expressions; the <i>stat_val</i> argument is the
       integer value pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i>.

       WIFEXITED(<i>stat_val</i>)
             Evaluates to a non-zero value if <i>status</i> was returned for a
             child process that terminated normally.

       WEXITSTATUS(<i>stat_val</i>)
             If the value of WIFEXITED(<i>stat_val</i>) is non-zero, this macro
             evaluates to the low-order 8 bits of the <i>status</i> argument
             that the child process passed to <i>_exit</i>() or <i>exit</i>(), or the
             value the child process returned from <i>main</i>().

       WIFSIGNALED(<i>stat_val</i>)
             Evaluates to a non-zero value if <i>status</i> was returned for a
             child process that terminated due to the receipt of a
             signal that was not caught (see <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>).

       WTERMSIG(<i>stat_val</i>)
             If the value of WIFSIGNALED(<i>stat_val</i>) is non-zero, this
             macro evaluates to the number of the signal that caused the
             termination of the child process.

       WIFSTOPPED(<i>stat_val</i>)
             Evaluates to a non-zero value if <i>status</i> was returned for a
             child process that is currently stopped.

       WSTOPSIG(<i>stat_val</i>)
             If the value of WIFSTOPPED(<i>stat_val</i>) is non-zero, this
             macro evaluates to the number of the signal that caused the
             child process to stop.

       WIFCONTINUED(<i>stat_val</i>)
             Evaluates to a non-zero value if <i>status</i> was returned for a
             child process that has continued from a job control stop.

       It is unspecified whether the <i>status</i> value returned by calls to
       <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() for processes created by <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
       <i>posix_spawnp</i>() can indicate a WIFSTOPPED(<i>stat_val</i>) before
       subsequent calls to <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() indicate
       WIFEXITED(<i>stat_val</i>) as the result of an error detected before the
       new process image starts executing.

       It is unspecified whether the <i>status</i> value returned by calls to
       <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() for processes created by <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
       <i>posix_spawnp</i>() can indicate a WIFSIGNALED(<i>stat_val</i>) if a signal
       is sent to the parent's process group after <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
       <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is called.

       If the information pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i> was stored by a call to
       <i>waitpid</i>() that specified the WUNTRACED flag and did not specify
       the WCONTINUED flag, exactly one of the macros
       WIFEXITED(*<i>stat_loc</i>), WIFSIGNALED(*<i>stat_loc</i>), and
       WIFSTOPPED(*<i>stat_loc</i>) shall evaluate to a non-zero value.

       If the information pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i> was stored by a call to
       <i>waitpid</i>() that specified the WUNTRACED and WCONTINUED flags,
       exactly one of the macros WIFEXITED(*<i>stat_loc</i>),
       WIFSIGNALED(*<i>stat_loc</i>), WIFSTOPPED(*<i>stat_loc</i>), and
       WIFCONTINUED(*<i>stat_loc</i>) shall evaluate to a non-zero value.

       If the information pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i> was stored by a call to
       <i>waitpid</i>() that did not specify the WUNTRACED or WCONTINUED flags,
       or by a call to the <i>wait</i>() function, exactly one of the macros
       WIFEXITED(*<i>stat_loc</i>) and WIFSIGNALED(*<i>stat_loc</i>) shall evaluate to
       a non-zero value.

       If the information pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i> was stored by a call to
       <i>waitpid</i>() that did not specify the WUNTRACED flag and specified
       the WCONTINUED flag, exactly one of the macros
       WIFEXITED(*<i>stat_loc</i>), WIFSIGNALED(*<i>stat_loc</i>), and
       WIFCONTINUED(*<i>stat_loc</i>) shall evaluate to a non-zero value.

       If _POSIX_REALTIME_SIGNALS is defined, and the implementation
       queues the SIGCHLD signal, then if <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() returns
       because the status of a child process is available, any pending
       SIGCHLD signal associated with the process ID of the child
       process shall be discarded. Any other pending SIGCHLD signals
       shall remain pending.

       Otherwise, if SIGCHLD is blocked, if <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() return
       because the status of a child process is available, any pending
       SIGCHLD signal shall be cleared unless the status of another
       child process is available.

       For all other conditions, it is unspecified whether child <i>status</i>
       will be available when a SIGCHLD signal is delivered.

       There may be additional implementation-defined circumstances
       under which <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() report <i>status</i>.  This shall not
       occur unless the calling process or one of its child processes
       explicitly makes use of a non-standard extension. In these cases
       the interpretation of the reported <i>status</i> is implementation-
       defined.

       If a parent process terminates without waiting for all of its
       child processes to terminate, the remaining child processes shall
       be assigned a new parent process ID corresponding to an
       implementation-defined system process.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() returns because the status of a child
       process is available, these functions shall return a value equal
       to the process ID of the child process for which <i>status</i> is
       reported. If <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() returns due to the delivery of a
       signal to the calling process, -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set
       to <b>[EINTR]</b>.  If <i>waitpid</i>() was invoked with WNOHANG set in
       <i>options</i>, it has at least one child process specified by <i>pid</i> for
       which <i>status</i> is not available, and <i>status</i> is not available for
       any process specified by <i>pid</i>, 0 is returned. Otherwise, -1 shall
       be returned, and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>wait</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ECHILD </b>The calling process has no existing unwaited-for child
              processes.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The function was interrupted by a signal. The value of the
              location pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i> is undefined.

       The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ECHILD </b>The process specified by <i>pid</i> does not exist or is not a
              child of the calling process, or the process group
              specified by <i>pid</i> does not exist or does not have any
              member process that is a child of the calling process.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The function was interrupted by a signal. The value of the
              location pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i> is undefined.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>options</i> argument is not valid.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Waiting for a Child Process and then Checking its Status</b>
       The following example demonstrates the use of <i>waitpid</i>(), <i>fork</i>(),
       and the macros used to interpret the status value returned by
       <i>waitpid</i>() (and <i>wait</i>()).  The code segment creates a child process
       which does some unspecified work. Meanwhile the parent loops
       performing calls to <i>waitpid</i>() to monitor the status of the child.
       The loop terminates when child termination is detected.

           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
           #include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
           ...

           pid_t child_pid, wpid;
           int status;

           child_pid = fork();
           if (child_pid == -1) {      /* fork() failed */
               perror("fork");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           if (child_pid == 0) {       /* This is the child */
               /* Child does some work and then terminates */
               ...

           } else {                    /* This is the parent */
               do {
                   wpid = waitpid(child_pid, &amp;status, WUNTRACED
           #ifdef WCONTINUED       /* Not all implementations support this */
                   | WCONTINUED
           #endif
                   );
                   if (wpid == -1) {
                       perror("waitpid");
                       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                   }

                   if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
                       printf("child exited, status=%d\n", WEXITSTATUS(status));

                       printf("child killed (signal %d)\n", WTERMSIG(status));

                   } else if (WIFSTOPPED(status)) {
                       printf("child stopped (signal %d)\n", WSTOPSIG(status));

           #ifdef WIFCONTINUED     /* Not all implementations support this */
                   } else if (WIFCONTINUED(status)) {
                       printf("child continued\n");
           #endif
                   } else {    /* Non-standard case -- may never happen */

               } while (!WIFEXITED(status) &amp;&amp; !WIFSIGNALED(status));
           }

   <b>Waiting for a Child Process in a Signal Handler for SIGCHLD</b>
       The following example demonstrates how to use <i>waitpid</i>() in a
       signal handler for SIGCHLD without passing -1 as the <i>pid</i>
       argument. (See the APPLICATION USAGE section below for the
       reasons why passing a <i>pid</i> of -1 is not recommended.) The method
       used here relies on the standard behavior of <i>waitpid</i>() when
       SIGCHLD is blocked. On historical non-conforming systems, the
       status of some child processes might not be reported.

</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Calls to <i>wait</i>() will collect information about any child process.
       This may result in interactions with other interfaces that may be
       waiting for their own children (such as by use of <i>system</i>()).  For
       this and other reasons it is recommended that portable
       applications not use <i>wait</i>(), but instead use <i>waitpid</i>().  For
       these same reasons, the use of <i>waitpid</i>() with a <i>pid</i> argument of
       -1, and the use of <i>waitid</i>() with the <i>idtype</i> argument set to
       P_ALL, are also not recommended for portable applications.

       As specified in <i>Consequences of Process Termination</i>, if the
       calling process has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or has SIGCHLD set to
       SIG_IGN, then the termination of a child process will not cause
       status information to become available to a thread blocked in
       <i>wait</i>(), <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>().  Thus, a thread blocked in one of
       the wait functions will remain blocked unless some other
       condition causes the thread to resume execution (such as an
       <b>[ECHILD] </b>failure due to no remaining children in the set of
       waited-for children).

       A call to the <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() function only returns <i>status</i> on
       an immediate child process of the calling process; that is, a
       child that was produced by a single <i>fork</i>() call (perhaps followed
       by an <i>exec</i> or other function calls) from the parent. If a child
       produces grandchildren by further use of <i>fork</i>(), none of those
       grandchildren nor any of their descendants affect the behavior of
       a <i>wait</i>() from the original parent process. Nothing in this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 prevents an implementation from providing
       extensions that permit a process to get <i>status</i> from a grandchild
       or any other process, but a process that does not use such
       extensions must be guaranteed to see <i>status</i> from only its direct
       children.

       The <i>waitpid</i>() function is provided for three reasons:

        1. To support job control

        2. To permit a non-blocking version of the <i>wait</i>() function

        3. To permit a library routine, such as <i>system</i>() or <i>pclose</i>(), to
           wait for its children without interfering with other
           terminated children for which the process has not waited

       The first two of these facilities are based on the <i>wait3</i>()
       function provided by 4.3 BSD. The function uses the <i>options</i>
       argument, which is equivalent to an argument to <i>wait3</i>().  The
       WUNTRACED flag is used only in conjunction with job control on
       systems supporting job control. Its name comes from 4.3 BSD and
       refers to the fact that there are two types of stopped processes
       in that implementation: processes being traced via the <i>ptrace</i>()
       debugging facility and (untraced) processes stopped by job
       control signals. Since <i>ptrace</i>() is not part of this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, only the second type is relevant. The name
       WUNTRACED was retained because its usage is the same, even though
       the name is not intuitively meaningful in this context.

       The third reason for the <i>waitpid</i>() function is to permit
       independent sections of a process to spawn and wait for children
       without interfering with each other. For example, the following
       problem occurs in developing a portable shell, or command
       interpreter:

           stream = popen("/bin/true");
           (void) system("sleep 100");
           (void) pclose(stream);

       On all historical implementations, the final <i>pclose</i>() fails to
       reap the <i>wait</i>() <i>status</i> of the <i>popen</i>().

       The status values are retrieved by macros, rather than given as
       specific bit encodings as they are in most historical
       implementations (and thus expected by existing programs). This
       was necessary to eliminate a limitation on the number of signals
       an implementation can support that was inherent in the
       traditional encodings. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does require
       that a <i>status</i> value of zero corresponds to a process calling
       <i>_exit</i>(0), as this is the most common encoding expected by
       existing programs.  Some of the macro names were adopted from 4.3
       BSD.

       These macros syntactically operate on an arbitrary integer value.
       The behavior is undefined unless that value is one stored by a
       successful call to <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() in the location pointed to
       by the <i>stat_loc</i> argument. An early proposal attempted to make
       this clearer by specifying each argument as *<i>stat_loc</i> rather than
       <i>stat_val</i>.  However, that did not follow the conventions of other
       specifications in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 or traditional
       usage. It also could have implied that the argument to the macro
       must literally be *<i>stat_loc</i>; in fact, that value can be stored or
       passed as an argument to other functions before being interpreted
       by these macros.

       The extension that affects <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() and is common in
       historical implementations is the <i>ptrace</i>() function. It is called
       by a child process and causes that child to stop and return a
       <i>status</i> that appears identical to the <i>status</i> indicated by
       WIFSTOPPED.  The <i>status</i> of <i>ptrace</i>() children is traditionally
       returned regardless of the WUNTRACED flag (or by the <i>wait</i>()
       function). Most applications do not need to concern themselves
       with such extensions because they have control over what
       extensions they or their children use. However, applications,
       such as command interpreters, that invoke arbitrary processes may
       see this behavior when those arbitrary processes misuse such
       extensions.

       Implementations that support <b>core </b>file creation or other
       implementation-defined actions on termination of some processes
       traditionally provide a bit in the <i>status</i> returned by <i>wait</i>() to
       indicate that such actions have occurred.

       Allowing the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to discard a pending
       SIGCHLD signal that is associated with a successfully waited-for
       child process puts them into the <i>sigwait</i>() and <i>sigwaitinfo</i>()
       category with respect to SIGCHLD.

       This definition allows implementations to treat a pending SIGCHLD
       signal as accepted by the process in <i>wait</i>(), with the same
       meaning of ``accepted'' as when that word is applied to the
       <i>sigwait</i>() family of functions.

       Allowing the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to behave this way
       permits an implementation to be able to deal precisely with
       SIGCHLD signals.

       In particular, an implementation that does accept (discard) the
       SIGCHLD signal can make the following guarantees regardless of
       the queuing depth of signals in general (the list of waitable
       children can hold the SIGCHLD queue):

        1. If a SIGCHLD signal handler is established via <i>sigaction</i>()
           without the SA_RESETHAND flag, SIGCHLD signals can be
           accurately counted; that is, exactly one SIGCHLD signal will
           be delivered to or accepted by the process for every child
           process that terminates.

        2. A single <i>wait</i>() issued from a SIGCHLD signal handler can be
           guaranteed to return immediately with status information for
           a child process.

        3. When SA_SIGINFO is requested, the SIGCHLD signal handler can
           be guaranteed to receive a non-null pointer to a <b>siginfo_t</b>
           structure that describes a child process for which a wait via
           <i>waitpid</i>() or <i>waitid</i>() will not block or fail.

        4. The <i>system</i>() function will not cause the SIGCHLD handler of a
           process to be called as a result of the <i>fork</i>()/<i>exec</i> executed
           within <i>system</i>() because <i>system</i>() will accept the SIGCHLD
           signal when it performs a <i>waitpid</i>() for its child process.
           This is a desirable behavior of <i>system</i>() so that it can be
           used in a library without causing side-effects to the
           application linked with the library.

       An implementation that does not permit the <i>wait</i>() family of
       functions to accept (discard) a pending SIGCHLD signal associated
       with a successfully waited-for child, cannot make the guarantees
       described above for the following reasons:

       Guarantee #1
             Although it might be assumed that reliable queuing of all
             SIGCHLD signals generated by the system can make this
             guarantee, the counter-example is the case of a process
             that blocks SIGCHLD and performs an indefinite loop of
             <i>fork</i>()/<i>wait</i>() operations. If the implementation supports
             queued signals, then eventually the system will run out of
             memory for the queue. The guarantee cannot be made because
             there must be some limit to the depth of queuing.

       Guarantees #2 and #3
             These cannot be guaranteed unless the <i>wait</i>() family of
             functions accepts the SIGCHLD signal. Otherwise, a
             <i>fork</i>()/<i>wait</i>() executed while SIGCHLD is blocked (as in the
             <i>system</i>() function) will result in an invocation of the
             handler when SIGCHLD is unblocked, after the process has
             disappeared.

       Guarantee #4
             Although possible to make this guarantee, <i>system</i>() would
             have to set the SIGCHLD handler to SIG_DFL so that the
             SIGCHLD signal generated by its <i>fork</i>() would be discarded
             (the SIGCHLD default action is to be ignored), then restore
             it to its previous setting. This would have the undesirable
             side-effect of discarding all SIGCHLD signals pending to
             the process.
