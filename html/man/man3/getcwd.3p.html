</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       getcwd — get the pathname of the current working directory
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       char *getcwd(char *<i>buf</i>, size_t <i>size</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getcwd</i>() function shall place an absolute pathname of the
       current working directory in the array pointed to by <i>buf</i>, and
       return <i>buf</i>.  The pathname shall contain no components that are
       dot or dot-dot, or are symbolic links.

       If there are multiple pathnames that <i>getcwd</i>() could place in the
       array pointed to by <i>buf</i>, one beginning with a single &lt;slash&gt;
       character and one or more beginning with two &lt;slash&gt; characters,
       then <i>getcwd</i>() shall place the pathname beginning with a single
       &lt;slash&gt; character in the array. The pathname shall not contain
       any unnecessary &lt;slash&gt; characters after the leading one or two
       &lt;slash&gt; characters.

       The <i>size</i> argument is the size in bytes of the character array
       pointed to by the <i>buf</i> argument. If <i>buf</i> is a null pointer, the
       behavior of <i>getcwd</i>() is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>getcwd</i>() shall return the <i>buf</i>
       argument. Otherwise, <i>getcwd</i>() shall return a null pointer and set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to indicate the error. The contents of the array pointed to
       by <i>buf</i> are then undefined.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getcwd</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>size</i> argument is 0.

       <b>ERANGE </b>The <i>size</i> argument is greater than 0, but is smaller than
              the length of the string +1.

       The <i>getcwd</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES </b>Search permission was denied for the current directory, or
              read or search permission was denied for a directory above
              the current directory in the file hierarchy.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient storage space is available.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following example uses {PATH_MAX} as the initial buffer size
       (unless it is indeterminate or very large), and calls <i>getcwd</i>()
       with progressively larger buffers until it does not give an
       <b>[ERANGE] </b>error.

           #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
           #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
           #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

           ...

           long path_max;
           size_t size;
           char *buf;
           char *ptr;

           path_max = pathconf(".", _PC_PATH_MAX);
           if (path_max == -1)
               size = 1024;
           else if (path_max &gt; 10240)
               size = 10240;
           else
               size = path_max;

           for (buf = ptr = NULL; ptr == NULL; size *= 2)
           {
               if ((buf = realloc(buf, size)) == NULL)
               {
                   ... handle error ...
               }

               ptr = getcwd(buf, size);
               if (ptr == NULL &amp;&amp; errno != ERANGE)
               {
                   ... handle error ...
               }
           }
           ...
           free (buf);
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the pathname obtained from <i>getcwd</i>() is longer than {PATH_MAX}
       bytes, it could produce an <b>[ENAMETOOLONG] </b>error if passed to
       <i>chdir</i>().  Therefore, in order to return to that directory it may
       be necessary to break the pathname into sections shorter than
       {PATH_MAX} bytes and call <i>chdir</i>() on each section in turn (the
       first section being an absolute pathname and subsequent sections
       being relative pathnames). A simpler way to handle saving and
       restoring the working directory when it may be deeper than
       {PATH_MAX} bytes in the file hierarchy is to use a file
       descriptor and <i>fchdir</i>(), rather than <i>getcwd</i>() and <i>chdir</i>().
       However, the two methods do have some differences. The <i>fchdir</i>()
       approach causes the program to restore a working directory even
       if it has been renamed in the meantime, whereas the <i>chdir</i>()
       approach restores to a directory with the same name as the
       original, even if the directories were renamed in the meantime.
       Since the <i>fchdir</i>() approach does not access parent directories,
       it can succeed when <i>getcwd</i>() would fail due to permissions
       problems. In applications conforming to earlier versions of this
       standard, it was not possible to use the <i>fchdir</i>() approach when
       the working directory is searchable but not readable, as the only
       way to open a directory was with O_RDONLY, whereas the <i>getcwd</i>()
       approach can succeed in this case.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Having <i>getcwd</i>() take no arguments and instead use the <i>malloc</i>()
       function to produce space for the returned argument was
       considered.  The advantage is that <i>getcwd</i>() knows how big the
       working directory pathname is and can allocate an appropriate
       amount of space. But the programmer would have to use the <i>free</i>()
       function to free the resulting object, or each use of <i>getcwd</i>()
       would further reduce the available memory. Finally, <i>getcwd</i>() is
       taken from the SVID where it has the two arguments used in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The older function <i>getwd</i>() was rejected for use in this context
       because it had only a buffer argument and no <i>size</i> argument, and
       thus had no way to prevent overwriting the buffer, except to
       depend on the programmer to provide a large enough buffer.

       On some implementations, if <i>buf</i> is a null pointer, <i>getcwd</i>() may
       obtain <i>size</i> bytes of memory using <i>malloc</i>().  In this case, the
       pointer returned by <i>getcwd</i>() may be used as the argument in a
       subsequent call to <i>free</i>().  Invoking <i>getcwd</i>() with <i>buf</i> as a null
       pointer is not recommended in conforming applications.

       Earlier implementations of <i>getcwd</i>() sometimes generated pathnames
       like <b>"../../../subdirname" </b>internally, using them to explore the
       path of ancestor directories back to the root. If one of these
       internal pathnames exceeded {PATH_MAX} in length, the
       implementation could fail with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[ENAMETOOLONG]</b>.  This
       is no longer allowed.

       If a program is operating in a directory where some (grand)parent
       directory does not permit reading, <i>getcwd</i>() may fail, as in most
       implementations it must read the directory to determine the name
       of the file. This can occur if search, but not read, permission
       is granted in an intermediate directory, or if the program is
       placed in that directory by some more privileged process (for
       example, login). Including the <b>[EACCES] </b>error condition makes the
       reporting of the error consistent and warns the application
       developer that <i>getcwd</i>() can fail for reasons beyond the control
       of the application developer or user. Some implementations can
       avoid this occurrence (for example, by implementing <i>getcwd</i>()
       using <i>pwd</i>, where <i>pwd</i> is a set-user-root process), thus the error
       was made optional. Since this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 permits the
       addition of other errors, this would be a common addition and yet
       one that applications could not be expected to deal with without
       this addition.
