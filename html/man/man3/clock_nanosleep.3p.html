NAME </h2>
<pre>
       clock_nanosleep — high resolution sleep with specifiable clock
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       int clock_nanosleep(clockid_t <i>clock_id</i>, int <i>flags</i>,
           const struct timespec *<i>rqtp</i>, struct timespec *<i>rmtp</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is not set in the <i>flags</i> argument, the
       <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function shall cause the current thread to be
       suspended from execution until either the time interval specified
       by the <i>rqtp</i> argument has elapsed, or a signal is delivered to the
       calling thread and its action is to invoke a signal-catching
       function, or the process is terminated. The clock used to measure
       the time shall be the clock specified by <i>clock_id</i>.

       If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is set in the <i>flags</i> argument, the
       <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function shall cause the current thread to be
       suspended from execution until either the time value of the clock
       specified by <i>clock_id</i> reaches the absolute time specified by the
       <i>rqtp</i> argument, or a signal is delivered to the calling thread and
       its action is to invoke a signal-catching function, or the
       process is terminated.  If, at the time of the call, the time
       value specified by <i>rqtp</i> is less than or equal to the time value
       of the specified clock, then <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() shall return
       immediately and the calling process shall not be suspended.

       The suspension time caused by this function may be longer than
       requested because the argument value is rounded up to an integer
       multiple of the sleep resolution, or because of the scheduling of
       other activity by the system. But, except for the case of being
       interrupted by a signal, the suspension time for the relative
       <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function (that is, with the TIMER_ABSTIME flag
       not set) shall not be less than the time interval specified by
       <i>rqtp</i>, as measured by the corresponding clock. The suspension for
       the absolute <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function (that is, with the
       TIMER_ABSTIME flag set) shall be in effect at least until the
       value of the corresponding clock reaches the absolute time
       specified by <i>rqtp</i>, except for the case of being interrupted by a
       signal.

       The use of the <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function shall have no effect on
       the action or blockage of any signal.

       The <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function shall fail if the <i>clock_id</i>
       argument refers to the CPU-time clock of the calling thread. It
       is unspecified whether <i>clock_id</i> values of other CPU-time clocks
       are allowed.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function returns because the requested
       time has elapsed, its return value shall be zero.

       If the <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function returns because it has been
       interrupted by a signal, it shall return the corresponding error
       value. For the relative <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function, if the <i>rmtp</i>
       argument is non-NULL, the <b>timespec </b>structure referenced by it
       shall be updated to contain the amount of time remaining in the
       interval (the requested time minus the time actually slept). The
       <i>rqtp</i> and <i>rmtp</i> arguments can point to the same object. If the <i>rmtp</i>
       argument is NULL, the remaining time is not returned. The
       absolute <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function has no effect on the
       structure referenced by <i>rmtp</i>.

       If <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() fails, it shall return the corresponding
       error value.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINTR  </b>The <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function was interrupted by a
              signal.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The <i>rqtp</i> argument specified a nanosecond value less than
              zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million; or the
              TIMER_ABSTIME flag was specified in flags and the <i>rqtp</i>
              argument is outside the range for the clock specified by
              <i>clock_id</i>; or the <i>clock_id</i> argument does not specify a
              known clock, or specifies the CPU-time clock of the
              calling thread.

       <b>ENOTSUP</b>
              The <i>clock_id</i> argument specifies a clock for which
              <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() is not supported, such as a CPU-time
              clock.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Calling <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() with the value TIMER_ABSTIME not set in
       the <i>flags</i> argument and with a <i>clock_id</i> of CLOCK_REALTIME is
       equivalent to calling <i>nanosleep</i>() with the same <i>rqtp</i> and <i>rmtp</i>
       arguments.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>nanosleep</i>() function specifies that the system-wide clock
       CLOCK_REALTIME is used to measure the elapsed time for this time
       service. However, with the introduction of the monotonic clock
       CLOCK_MONOTONIC a new relative sleep function is needed to allow
       an application to take advantage of the special characteristics
       of this clock.

       There are many applications in which a process needs to be
       suspended and then activated multiple times in a periodic way;
       for example, to poll the status of a non-interrupting device or
       to refresh a display device. For these cases, it is known that
       precise periodic activation cannot be achieved with a relative
       <i>sleep</i>() or <i>nanosleep</i>() function call. Suppose, for example, a
       periodic process that is activated at time <i>T</i>0, executes for a
       while, and then wants to suspend itself until time <i>T</i>0+<i>T</i>, the
       period being <i>T</i>.  If this process wants to use the <i>nanosleep</i>()
       function, it must first call <i>clock_gettime</i>() to get the current
       time, then calculate the difference between the current time and
       <i>T</i>0+<i>T</i> and, finally, call <i>nanosleep</i>() using the computed interval.
       However, the process could be preempted by a different process
       between the two function calls, and in this case the interval
       computed would be wrong; the process would wake up later than
       desired. This problem would not occur with the absolute
       <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function, since only one function call would be
       necessary to suspend the process until the desired time. In other
       cases, however, a relative sleep is needed, and that is why both
       functionalities are required.

       Although it is possible to implement periodic processes using the
       timers interface, this implementation would require the use of
       signals, and the reservation of some signal numbers. In this
       regard, the reasons for including an absolute version of the
       <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function in POSIX.1‐2008 are the same as for
       the inclusion of the relative <i>nanosleep</i>().

       It is also possible to implement precise periodic processes using
       <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>(), in which an absolute timeout is
       specified that takes effect if the condition variable involved is
       never signaled. However, the use of this interface is unnatural,
       and involves performing other operations on mutexes and condition
       variables that imply an unnecessary overhead.  Furthermore,
       <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() is not available in implementations that
       do not support threads.

       Although the interface of the relative and absolute versions of
       the new high resolution sleep service is the same
       <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function, the <i>rmtp</i> argument is only used in the
       relative sleep. This argument is needed in the relative
       <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function to reissue the function call if it is
       interrupted by a signal, but it is not needed in the absolute
       <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function call; if the call is interrupted by a
       signal, the absolute <i>clock_nanosleep</i>() function can be invoked
       again with the same <i>rqtp</i> argument used in the interrupted call.
