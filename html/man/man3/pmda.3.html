DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       To assist in the development of Performance Metric Domain Agents
       (<b>PMDA</b>s) for the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), a procedural
       interface is provided that extends the Performance Metrics
       Application Programming Interface (<a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a>) library.  These
       procedures are designed to enable a programmer to quickly build a
       PMDA which can then be tested and refined.  However, this also
       implies that a PMDA has a particular structure which may not be
       suitable for all PMDA implementations.

       Once you are familiar with the PCP and PMDA frameworks, you can
       quickly implement a new PMDA with only a few data structures and
       functions.  This is covered in far greater detail in the
       <i>Performance Co-Pilot Programmer's Guide</i>.

       A PMDA is responsible for a set of performance metrics, in the
       sense that it must respond to requests from <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> for
       information about performance metrics, instance domains, and
       instantiated values.

       This man page contains sections of the <b>simple PMDA </b>which is
       located at <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR</i>/simple.
</pre> <h2>
COMMUNICATING WITH PMCD </h2>
<pre>
       Two approaches may be used for connecting a PMDA to a <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
       process.  A Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) can be attached by
       <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> using <a href="dlopen.3.html">dlopen(3)</a> when the <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> process is started.  A
       procedural interface referenced through a shared data structure
       is used to handle requests from <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to the PMDA .

       The preferred approach is for a separate process (daemon) to
       communicate with <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> using the Performance Data Units (PDU)
       Inter-Process Communication (IPC) protocol.

       All PMDAs are launched and controlled by the <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> process on
       the local host.  The requests from the clients are received by
       <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and forwarded to the appropriate PMDAs.  Responses, when
       required, are returned through <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to the clients.  The
       requests (PDUs) that may be sent to a PMDA from <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> are
       <b>PDU_FETCH</b>, <b>PDU_PROFILE</b>, <b>PDU_INSTANCE_REQ</b>, <b>PDU_DESC_REQ</b>,
       <b>PDU_TEXT_REQ </b>and <b>PDU_RESULT</b>.  If the PMDA implements any dynamic
       metrics it may also receive <b>PDU_PMNS_CHILD</b>, <b>PDU_PMNS_IDS</b>,
       <b>PDU_PMNS_NAMES </b>and <b>PDU_PMNS_TRAVERSE </b>PDUs.
</pre> <h2>
DEFAULT CALLBACKS FOR HANDLING PDUs </h2>
<pre>
       To allow a consistent framework, <a href="pmdamain.3.html">pmdaMain(3)</a> can be used by a
       daemon PMDA to handle the communication protocol using the same
       callbacks as a DSO PMDA.  The structure <b>pmdaInterface </b>is used to
       convey the common procedural interface and state information that
       is used by <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and a PMDA.  This state information includes
       tables describing the supported metrics and instance domains.

       As most of the procedural interface is identical for all PMDAs,
       they are provided as part of this support library
       (<a href="pmdaprofile.3.html">pmdaProfile(3)</a>, <a href="pmdafetch.3.html">pmdaFetch(3)</a>, <a href="pmdainstance.3.html">pmdaInstance(3)</a>, <a href="pmdadesc.3.html">pmdaDesc(3)</a>,
       <a href="pmdatext.3.html">pmdaText(3)</a> and <a href="pmdastore.3.html">pmdaStore(3)</a>).  However, these routines require
       access to the <b>pmdaInterface </b>state information so it must be
       correctly initialized using <a href="pmdaconnect.3.html">pmdaConnect(3)</a>, <a href="pmdadaemon.3.html">pmdaDaemon(3)</a>,
       <a href="pmdaopenlog.3.html">pmdaOpenLog(3)</a>, <a href="pmdadso.3.html">pmdaDSO(3)</a>, <a href="pmdagetopt.3.html">pmdaGetOpt(3)</a> and <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
INSTANCES AND INSTANCE DOMAINS </h2>
<pre>
       Three structures are declared in <i>/usr/include/pcp/pmda.h</i> which
       provide a framework for declaring the metrics and instances
       supported by the PMDA.

       Every instance requires a unique integer identifier and a unique
       name, as defined by the structure <b>pmdaInstid</b>:

            /*
             * Instance description: index and name
             */

            typedef struct {
                int         i_inst;        /* internal instance identifier */
                char        *i_name;       /* external instance identifier */
            } pmdaInstid;

       An instance domain requires its own unique identification
       (<b>pmInDom</b>), the number of instances the domain represents, and a
       pointer to an array of instance descriptions.  This is defined in
       the structure <b>pmdaIndom</b>:

            /*
             * Instance domain description: unique instance id,
             * number of instances in this domain, and the list of
             * instances (not null terminated).
             */

            typedef struct {
                pmInDom     it_indom;       /* indom, filled in */
                int         it_numinst;     /* number of instances */
                pmdaInstid  *it_set;        /* instance identifiers */
            } pmdaIndom;

       The <b>simple PMDA </b>has one instance domain for <i>simple</i>.<i>color</i> with
       three instances (<i>red</i>, <i>green</i> and <i>blue</i>), and a second instance
       domain for <i>simple</i>.<i>now</i> with instances which can be specified at
       run-time.  These instance domains are defined as:

            static pmdaInstid _color[] = {
                { 0, "red" }, { 1, "green" }, { 2, "blue" }
            };
            static pmdaInstid *_timenow = NULL;

            static pmdaIndom indomtab[] = {
            #define COLOR_INDOM 0
                { COLOR_INDOM, 3, _color },
            #define NOW_INDOM 1
                { NOW_INDOM, 0, NULL },
            };

       The preprocessor macros <b>COLOR_INDOM </b>and <b>NOW_INDOM </b>are used in the
       metric description table to identify the instance domains of
       individual metrics.  These correspond to the <i>serial</i> value in the
       instance domain <b>pmInDom </b>structure (the <i>domain</i> field is set by
       <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a> at run-time).  The serial value must be unique for
       each instance domain within the PMDA.

       The indom table shown above which is usually passed to
       <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a> does not need to be created if one wants to write
       one's own Fetch and Instance functions.  See <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a> for more
       details.
</pre> <h2>
NAMESPACE </h2>
<pre>
       Every PMDA has its own unique <b>namespace </b>using the format defined
       in <a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>.  In summary, the namespace matches the names of the
       metrics to the unique identifier.  The <b>simple PMDA </b>defines five
       metrics: <i>simple</i>.<i>numfetch</i>, <i>simple</i>.<i>color</i>, <i>simple</i>.<i>time</i>.<i>user,</i>
       <i>simple</i>.<i>time</i>.<i>sys</i> and <i>simple</i>.<i>now</i>.  The namespace for these metrics
       is defined in <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR</i>/simple/pmns and is installed as:

            simple {
                numfetch    253:0:0
                color       253:0:1
                time
                now         253:2:4
            }

            simple.time {
                user        253:1:2
                sys         253:1:3
            }

       The domain number of <i>253</i> is obtained from
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR</i>/pmns/stdpmid.  New PMDAs should specify a unique
       domain number in this file, and obtain the number during
       installation.  This allows the domain number to change by
       modifying only the file <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR</i>/pmns/stdpmid.

       The <i>simple.time</i> and <i>simple.now</i> metrics are defined in separate
       clusters to the other metrics which allows a PMDA to support more
       than 1024 metrics, as well as grouping similar metrics together.
       Therefore, the item numbers for a new cluster may be identical to
       the item numbers in other clusters.  The <b>simple PMDA </b>continues to
       increment the item numbers to permit direct mapping (see
       <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a>).

       The namespace file should be installed and removed with the agent
       using <a href="../man1/pmnsadd.1.html">pmnsadd(1)</a> and <a href="../man1/pmnsdel.1.html">pmnsdel(1)</a>.  See the later sections on
       INSTALLATION and REMOVAL.

       A simple ASCII namespace can be constructed by creating a file
       similar to <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR</i>/simple/root:

            /*
             * fake "root" for validating the local PMNS subtree
             */

            #include "$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/stdpmid"

            root { simple }

            #include "pmns"

       and can be referred to with the <b>-n </b>option in most PCP tools.
</pre> <h2>
METRIC DESCRIPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Each metric requires a description (<b>pmDesc</b>), which contains its
       Performance Metric Identifier (PMID), data type specification,
       instance domain, semantics and units (see <a href="pmlookupdesc.3.html">pmLookupDesc(3)</a>).  A
       handle is also provided for application specific information in
       the <b>pmdaMetric </b>structure:

            /*
             * Metric description: handle for extending description,
             * and the description.
             */

            typedef struct {
                void*       m_user;         /* for users external use */
                pmDesc      m_desc;         /* metric description */
            } pmdaMetric;

       The <b>simple PMDA </b>defines the metrics as:

            static pmdaMetric metrictab[] = {
            /* numfetch */
                { (void *)0,
                  { PMDA_PMID(0,0), PM_TYPE_U32, PM_INDOM_NULL, PM_SEM_INSTANT,
                    { 0,0,0,0,0,0} }, },
            /* color */
                { (void *)0,
                  { PMDA_PMID(0,1), PM_TYPE_32, COLOR_INDOM, PM_SEM_INSTANT,
                    { 0,0,0,0,0,0} }, },
            /* time.user */
                { (void*)0,
                  { PMDA_PMID(1,2), PM_TYPE_DOUBLE, PM_INDOM_NULL, PM_SEM_COUNTER,
                       { 0, 1, 0, 0, PM_TIME_SEC, 0 } }, },
            /* time.sys */
                { (void*)0,
                  { PMDA_PMID(1,3), PM_TYPE_DOUBLE, PM_INDOM_NULL, PM_SEM_COUNTER,
                       { 0, 1, 0, 0, PM_TIME_SEC, 0 } }, },
            /* now */
                { NULL,
                  { PMDA_PMID(2,4), PM_TYPE_U32, NOW_INDOM, PM_SEM_INSTANT,
                    { 0,0,0,0,0,0 } }, },
            };

       The macro <b>PMDA_PMID </b>(defined in <i>/usr/include/pcp/pmda.h</i>) is used
       to specify each metric's <i>cluster</i> and <i>item</i> fields of the
       associated <b>pmID</b>.  As with instance domains, the <i>domain</i> field is
       set by <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a> at run-time, however, the default domain is
       assumed to be defined by the PMDA in the macro <b>MYDOMAIN</b>.

       The metric table shown above which is usually passed to
       <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a> does not need to be created if one wants to write
       one's own Fetch and Descriptor functions.  See <a href="pmdainit.3.html">pmdaInit(3)</a> for
       more details.
</pre> <h2>
DSO PMDA </h2>
<pre>
       A PMDA that is run as a DSO is opened by <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> with <a href="dlopen.3.html">dlopen(3)</a>.
       <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> will call the PMDA's initialization function that is
       specified in <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i>.  This function is passed a
       pointer to a <b>pmdaInterface </b>structure which must be completed.
       Any callbacks which are <i>not</i> the default PMDA support library
       callbacks must be specified in the <b>pmdaInterface </b>structure.

       The <b>simple PMDA </b>uses its own store and fetch callback.
       <b>simple_fetch</b>() calls <a href="pmdafetch.3.html">pmdaFetch(3)</a> which requires a callback to be
       set with <a href="pmdasetfetchcallback.3.html">pmdaSetFetchCallBack(3)</a> as can be seen in
       <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR</i>/simple/simple.c.

       The flag <b>_isDSO </b>is used to determine if the PMDA is a daemon or a
       DSO so that the correct initialization routine, <a href="pmdadaemon.3.html">pmdaDaemon(3)</a> or
       <a href="pmdadso.3.html">pmdaDSO(3)</a>, is called.
</pre> <h2>
DAEMON PMDA </h2>
<pre>
       A PMDA that is run as a daemon is forked and executed by <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.
       Therefore, unlike a DSO PMDA, the starting point for a daemon
       PMDA is <b>main</b>().  The agent should parse the command line
       arguments, create a log file and initialize some data structures
       that <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> would initialize for a DSO agent.

       The <b>pmdaInterface </b>structure must be completely defined by the
       daemon PMDA.  The function <a href="pmdadaemon.3.html">pmdaDaemon(3)</a> can be called at the
       start of <b>main</b>() to set most of these fields.  Command line
       parsing can be simplified by using <a href="pmdagetopt.3.html">pmdaGetOpt(3)</a>, which is
       similar to <b>getopt</b>(2), but extracts a common set of options into
       the <b>pmdaInterface </b>structure.  <i>stderr</i> can be mapped to a log file
       using <a href="pmdaopenlog.3.html">pmdaOpenLog(3)</a> to simplify debugging and error messages.
       The connection to <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> can be made with <a href="pmdaconnect.3.html">pmdaConnect(3)</a> and the
       loop which handles the incoming PDUs, <a href="pmdamain.3.html">pmdaMain(3)</a>, should be the
       last function called.  This can be seen in
       <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR</i>/simple/simple.c.

       The <b>simple_init</b>() routine is common to an agent that can be run
       as both a Daemon and DSO PMDA.
</pre> <h2>
HELP TEXT </h2>
<pre>
       Each PMDA must be able to provide <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> with the help text for
       each metric.  Most PMDAs use specially created files with indexes
       to support efficient retrieval of the help text.  Tools are
       provided with PCP to create the help text files of appropriate
       format. See <a href="../man1/newhelp.1.html">newhelp(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL </h2>
<pre>
       A series of shell procedures are defined in
       <i>$PCP_SHARE_DIR</i>/lib/pmdaproc.sh which greatly simplify the
       installation and removal of a PMDA.

       The <i>Install</i> scripts for most PMDAs should only need to specify
       the name of the PMDA in <b>iam</b>, call <b>pmdaSetup </b>which sets up some
       default variables, checks permissions (you have to be ``root'' to
       install or remove a PMDA), checks that you're in the right
       directory (somewhere that ends with /pmdas/<i>$iam</i>), optionally
       generate the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) and PMDA
       domain number files for Perl or Python PMDAs, checks the PMDA
       domain number is valid, etc., specify the communication
       protocols, and finally call <b>pmdaInstall </b>to do all the work of
       updating the PMNS, updating the <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> control file, notifying
       or restarting <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>,

       Beyond <b>pmdaSetup </b>and <b>pmdaInstall</b>, another optional helper
       routines is <b>pmdaChooseConfigFile </b>that may be used to
       interactively select or create a PMDA-specific configuration
       file, e.g. <a href="../man1/pmdalogger.1.html">pmdalogger(1)</a>.

       The <i>Remove</i> scripts are even simpler as setting up the
       communication protocols are not required, so set the name of the
       PMDA in <i>iam</i>, then call <b>pmdaSetup </b>followed by a call to
       <b>pmdaRemove</b>.

       Further information is contained in the
       <i>$PCP_SHARE_DIR</i>/lib/pmdaproc.sh file and the following section.

       Optionally, a PMDA may provide an <i>Upgrade</i> script alongside
       <i>Install</i> and <i>Remove</i>.  If present this script will be used by the
       <b>pmcd </b>startup process to ensure corrections to an installation
       have been made before starting the PMDA.  Examples of such
       corrections include: updates to <i>pmcd.conf</i> when a PMDA script or
       binary has been renamed, when the PMDA supports a new format of
       its configuration file, or if there is some latent problem from
       an earlier install (e.g. some PMDAs may need to introduce use of
       the <b>notready </b>keyword in <i>pmcd.conf</i>, as described below).
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION REFINEMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       As outlined below there are a number of variables that can be set
       in a PMDA's <i>Install</i> script to influence the behaviour of the
       installation procedures.  These would typically need to be set
       before the call to <b>pmdaInstall</b>, but in some instances (like <i>$iam</i>
       and the cases specifically noted below), before the call to
       <b>pmdaSetup</b>.

       The following variables control the communication options between
       the PMDA and <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  At least one of <i>$daemon_opt</i>, <i>$dso_opt</i>,
       <i>$perl_opt</i> or <i>$python_opt</i> must be set to define the supported
       mode(s) of communication.  If more than one of these is set the
       user will be prompted to make a selection when the <i>Install</i> script
       is run.

       <i>daemon_opt</i>
              We are willing to install the PMDA as a daemon.
              Default: true

       <i>dso_opt</i>
              We are willing to install the PMDA as a DSO, so <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
              will use the dynamic linking loader to attach the PMDA's
              DSO at run-time and communication from <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to the PMDA
              and back uses procedure calls, not an IPC channel.
              Default: false

       <i>dso_entry</i>
              For a DSO PMDA, this is the name of the PMDA's
              initialization routine.
              Default: <i>${iam}</i>_init

       <i>dso_name</i>
              For a DSO PMDA, this is the full pathanme of the PMDA's
              DSO file.
              Default: <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR</i>/<i>$iam</i>/pmda_<i>$iam</i>.<i>$dso_suffix</i>

       <i>pipe_opt</i>
              For a daemon PMDA, is the default IPC channel via a
              <a href="../man2/pipe.2.html">pipe(2)</a>?
              Default: Platform-specific, so <b>true </b>for most, but <b>false</b>
              for Windows

       <i>perl_opt</i>
              We are willing to install the PMDA as a Perl script and
              <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> will use the <b>perl</b>(1) interpreter to run the PMDA.
              Default: false

       <i>pmda_dir</i>
              Full pathname to the directory where the PMDA's
              installation files (executable, script, PMNS source, help
              text source, etc) are to be found.
              Default: output from pwd(1)

                       If set, must be done before the call to
                       <b>pmdaSetup</b>.

       <i>pmda_name</i>
              For a daemon PMDA, this is the name of the PMDA's
              executable binary relative to the <i>$pmda_dir</i> directory.
              Default: pmda<i>$iam</i>

       <i>python_opt</i>
              We are willing to install the PMDA as a Python script and
              <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> will use the <b>python</b>(1) interpreter to run the
              PMDA.
              Default: false

       <i>ipc_prot</i>
              For a daemon PMDA, this can be set to either <b>binary </b>or
              <b>text</b>.  The default is <b>binary </b>and <b>text </b>is rarely used.  In
              addition, an optional IPC parameter <b>notready </b>can be used
              to signify that the PMDA will start up in the <b>notready</b>
              state, e.g. <b>ipc_prot="binary notready"</b>.  Note that the
              quotes are required.  The IPC parameters for a PMDA appear
              in <b>pmcd.conf </b>in the <b>IPC Params </b>column.  For further
              details, see <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> but basically <b>pmcd </b>will not issue any
              requests to a PMDA that has started in the <b>notready </b>state
              until the PMDA sends a <b>PM_ERR_PMDAREADY </b>PDU.  This allows
              PMDAs with long startup times to initialize correctly
              without timing out.  For details, see <a href="pmdasenderror.3.html">pmdaSendError(3)</a> and
              <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  When a PMDA is in the <b>notready </b>state, any client
              requests sent to <b>pmcd </b>for the PMDA domain will return with
              the <b>PM_ERR_PMDANOTREADY </b>error.

       <i>socket_inet_def</i>
              For a daemon PMDA using a <a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket(2)</a> as the IPC channel the
              default Internet port number or service name (if known).
              Default: ""

       <i>socket_opt</i>
              For a daemon PMDA, is the default IPC channel via a
              <a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket(2)</a>?
              Default: Platform-specific, so <b>false </b>for most, but <b>true</b>
              for Windows

       The following variables control the PMNS options.

       <i>pmns_dupok</i>
              Most PMDAs do not have duplicate names for the same PMID
              in their PMNS.  But if this is not the case, <i>pmns_dupok</i>
              should be set to <b>true</b>.
              Default: false

       <i>pmns_name</i>
              Each PMDA will add one or more non-leaf nodes to the top
              of the PMNS.  The most common case is that all of the
              metrics for a PMDA will be placed below the node named
              <i>$iam</i>.  If this is not the case, and especially when the
              PMDA adds more than one non-leaf node at the top of the
              PMNS, <i>pmns_name</i> needs to be set to the list of node names
              (separated by white space), e.g. for <a href="../man1/pmdaproc.1.html">pmdaproc(1)</a> <i>pmns_name</i>
              is set to "proc cgroup hotproc".
              Default: <i>$iam</i>

                       It is most important that if <i>pmns_name</i> is set to
                       a non-default value in the <i>Install</i> script then it
                       must also be set to the same value in the <i>Remove</i>
                       script.

       <i>pmns_source</i>
              The name of the PMDA's PMNS source file.  By default, the
              name is interpreted as a relative pathname from the
              <i>$pmda_dir</i> directory.
              Default: pmns

       The following variables provide assorted additional options
       associated with the installation of a PMDA.

       <i>args</i>   Additional command line args for the PMDA.  These will be
              appended to the PMDA's control line in <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i>.
              Default: ""

       <i>check_delay</i>
              Delay (in seconds) after finishing the PMDA installation
              (or removal) before checking the availability of metrics
              from the PMDA.  May need to be increased if the PMDA has a
              lengthy startup procedure.
              Default: 0.3

       <i>signal_delay</i>
              Delay (in seconds) after notifying <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> with a signal.
              Required to allow <a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to complete processing before
              proceeding to the next step of the installation (or
              removal).
              Default: 1

       <i>configdir</i>
              Determines the directory in which a PMDA's configuration
              file will be stored.  Used by <b>pmdaChooseConfigFile </b>so
              should be set before calling that procedure.
              Default: <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR</i>/config/<i>$iam</i>

       <i>configfile</i>
              Preferred configuration file for the PMDA.  Used by
              <b>pmdaChooseConfigFile </b>so should be set before calling that
              procedure.
              Default: ""

       <i>default_configfile</i>
              Default configuration file for the PMDA.  Used by
              <b>pmdaChooseConfigFile </b>so should be set before calling that
              procedure.
              Default: ""

       <i>dso_suffix</i>
              Standard suffix for a DSO.  Should not need to be changed
              under normal circumstances.
              Default: Platform-specific, so 'so' for Linux, 'dylib' for
              Mac OS X, 'dll' for Windows, etc.

                       If set, must be done before the call to
                       <b>pmdaSetup</b>.

       <i>help_source</i>
              The name of the help text source file that should be used
              as input to <b>pmnewhelp</b>(1).  By default, the name is
              interpreted as a relative pathname from the <i>$pmda_dir</i>
              directory.
              Default: help

       <i>python_name</i>
              Full pathname of the Python script for a Python PMDA.
              Default: <i>$pmda_dir</i>/pmda<i>$iam</i>.python or
              <i>$pmda_dir</i>/pmda<i>$iam</i>.py

       The shell procedures in <i>$PCP_SHARE_DIR</i>/lib/pmdaproc.sh manipulate
       a number of temporary files using the variable <i>$tmp</i> as the prefix
       for the name of the temporary files.  <i>$tmp</i> is a directory that is
       created, used and removed internally within the procedures of
       <i>$PCP_SHARE_DIR</i>/lib/pmdaproc.sh but can also be used as the prefix
       for temporary files needed by a PMDA's <i>Install</i> or <i>Remove</i> scripts.
       When used in this way, <i>$tmp</i> should be followed by a ``/'' and
       then a suffix, e.g. <i>$tmp</i>/myfoo.  The <i>Install</i> and <i>Remove</i> scripts
       should not use other temporary file name prefixes nor use <b>sh</b>(1)
       <b>trap </b>statements to clean up temporary files as this is all done
       within <i>$PCP_SHARE_DIR</i>/lib/pmdaproc.sh.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       Failing to complete any of the data structures or calling any of
       the library routines out of order may cause unexpected behavior
       in the PMDA.

       Due to changes to the <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> and <a href="pmda.3.html">PMDA(3)</a> API in the PCP 2.0
       release, as described in the product release notes, PMDAs built
       using PCP 2.0 must specify <b>PMDA_INTERFACE_2 </b>or later and link
       with <i>libpcp_pmda.so.2</i> and <i>libpcp.so.2</i>.  Pre-existing Daemon PMDAs
       specifying <b>PMDA_INTERFACE_1 </b>will continue to function using the
       backwards compatible <i>libpcp_pmda.so.1</i> and <i>libpcp.so.1</i> libraries
       and may be recompiled using the headers installed in
       <i>/usr/include/pcp1.x/</i> without any modification.  These backwards
       compatible headers and libraries are contained in the
       <i>pcp.sw.compat</i> subsystem.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       Any PMDA which uses this library can set <a href="pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> debugging
       control option <b>libpmda </b>(with <b>-Dlibpmda </b>on the command line or via
       <b>3</b>pmSetDebug<b>(3)) </b>to to enable the display of debugging information
       which may be useful during development (see <a href="../man1/pmdbg.1.html">pmdbg(1)</a>).

       The <i>status</i> field of the <b>pmdaInterface </b>structure should be zero
       after <b>pmdaDaemon</b>, <b>pmdaDSO</b>, <b>pmdaGetOpt</b>, <b>pmdaConnect </b>and <b>pmdaInit</b>
       are called.  A value less than zero indicates that initialization
       has failed.

       Some error messages that are common to most functions in this
       library are:

       <b>PMDA interface version </b><i>interface</i> <b>not supported</b>
              Most of the functions require that the <i>comm.version</i> field
              of the <b>pmdaInterface </b>structure be set to <b>PMDA_INTERFACE_2</b>
              or later.  <b>PMDA_INTERFACE_2 </b>or <b>PMDA_INTERFACE_3 </b>implies
              that the <i>version.two</i> fields are correctly initialized,
              while <b>PMDA_INTERFACE_4 </b>implies that the <i>version.four</i>
              fields are correctly initialized (see <a href="pmdadaemon.3.html">pmdaDaemon(3)</a> and
              <a href="pmdadso.3.html">pmdaDSO(3)</a>).
</pre> <h2>

</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <i>$PCP_CONF</i> variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.  Values for these variables may be obtained
       programmatically using the <a href="pmgetconfig.3.html">pmGetConfig(3)</a> function.
