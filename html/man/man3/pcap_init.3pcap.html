NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pcap_init - initialize the library
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];</b>

       <b>int pcap_init(unsigned int opts, char *errbuf);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_init</b>() is used to initialize the Packet Capture library.
       <i>opts</i> specifies options for the library; <i>errbuf</i> is a buffer large
       enough to hold at least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE </b>chars.

       Currently, the options that can be specified in <i>opts</i> are:

       <b>PCAP_MMAP_32BIT</b>
              Map packet buffers with 32-bit addresses.

       <b>PCAP_CHAR_ENC_LOCAL</b>
              Treat all strings supplied as arguments, and return all
              strings to the caller, as being in the local character
              encoding.

       <b>PCAP_CHAR_ENC_UTF_8</b>
              Treat all strings supplied as arguments, and return all
              strings to the caller, as being in UTF-8.

       On UNIX-like systems, the local character encoding is assumed to
       be UTF-8, so no character encoding transformations are done.

       On Windows, the local character encoding is the local ANSI code
       page.

       If <b>pcap_init</b>() is not called, strings are treated as being in the
       local ANSI code page on Windows, <b>pcap_lookupdev</b>(3PCAP) will
       succeed if there is a device on which to capture, and
       <b>pcap_create</b>(3PCAP) makes an attempt to check whether the string
       passed as an argument is a UTF-16LE string - note that this
       attempt is unsafe, as it may run past the end of the string - to
       handle <b>pcap_lookupdev</b>() returning a UTF-16LE string. Programs
       that don't call <b>pcap_init</b>() should, on Windows, call
       <b>pcap_wsockinit</b>() to initialize Winsock; this is not necessary if
       <b>pcap_init</b>() is called, as <b>pcap_init</b>() will initialize Winsock
       itself on Windows.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcap_init</b>() returns <b>0 </b>on success and <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>on failure.  If
       <b>PCAP_ERROR </b>is returned, <i>errbuf</i> is filled in with an appropriate
       error message.
</pre> <h2>
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       This function became available in libpcap release 1.9.0.  In
       previous releases, on Windows, all strings supplied as arguments,
       and all strings returned to the caller, are in the local
       character encoding.
