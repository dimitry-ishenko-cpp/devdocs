NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>key_defined </b>- check if a keycode is defined
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;curses.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int key_defined(const char *</b><i>definition</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to determine if a string is currently bound to any
       keycode.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If the string is bound to a keycode, its value (greater than
       zero) is returned.  If no keycode is bound, zero is returned.  If
       the string conflicts with longer strings which are bound to keys,
       -1 is returned.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported
       on Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended
       that any code depending on them be conditioned using
       NCURSES_VERSION.
