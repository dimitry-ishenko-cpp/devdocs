       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_key_delete — thread-specific data key deletion
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_key_delete(pthread_key_t <i>key</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() function shall delete a thread-specific
       data key previously returned by <i>pthread_key_create</i>().  The
       thread-specific data values associated with <i>key</i> need not be NULL
       at the time <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() is called. It is the
       responsibility of the application to free any application storage
       or perform any cleanup actions for data structures related to the
       deleted key or associated thread-specific data in any threads;
       this cleanup can be done either before or after
       <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() is called. Any attempt to use <i>key</i> following
       the call to <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() results in undefined behavior.

       The <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() function shall be callable from within
       destructor functions. No destructor functions shall be invoked by
       <i>pthread_key_delete</i>().  Any destructor function that may have been
       associated with <i>key</i> shall no longer be called upon thread exit.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() function shall return
       zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
       the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() function shall not return an error code
       of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       A thread-specific data key deletion function has been included in
       order to allow the resources associated with an unused thread-
       specific data key to be freed. Unused thread-specific data keys
       can arise, among other scenarios, when a dynamically loaded
       module that allocated a key is unloaded.

       Conforming applications are responsible for performing any
       cleanup actions needed for data structures associated with the
       key to be deleted, including data referenced by thread-specific
       data values. No such cleanup is done by <i>pthread_key_delete</i>().  In
       particular, destructor functions are not called. There are
       several reasons for this division of responsibility:

        1. The associated destructor functions used to free thread-
           specific data at thread exit time are only guaranteed to work
           correctly when called in the thread that allocated the
           thread-specific data. (Destructors themselves may utilize
           thread-specific data.) Thus, they cannot be used to free
           thread-specific data in other threads at key deletion time.
           Attempting to have them called by other threads at key
           deletion time would require other threads to be
           asynchronously interrupted. But since interrupted threads
           could be in an arbitrary state, including holding locks
           necessary for the destructor to run, this approach would
           fail. In general, there is no safe mechanism whereby an
           implementation could free thread-specific data at key
           deletion time.

        2. Even if there were a means of safely freeing thread-specific
           data associated with keys to be deleted, doing so would
           require that implementations be able to enumerate the threads
           with non-NULL data and potentially keep them from creating
           more thread-specific data while the key deletion is
           occurring. This special case could cause extra
           synchronization in the normal case, which would otherwise be
           unnecessary.

       For an application to know that it is safe to delete a key, it
       has to know that all the threads that might potentially ever use
       the key do not attempt to use it again. For example, it could
       know this if all the client threads have called a cleanup
       procedure declaring that they are through with the module that is
       being shut down, perhaps by setting a reference count to zero.

       If an implementation detects that the value specified by the <i>key</i>
       argument to <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() does not refer to a a key value
       obtained from <i>pthread_key_create</i>() or refers to a key that has
       been deleted with <i>pthread_key_delete</i>(), it is recommended that
       the function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL] </b>error.
