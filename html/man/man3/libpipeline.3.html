DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>libpipeline </b>is a C library for setting up and running pipelines
       of processes, without needing to involve shell command-line
       parsing which is often error-prone and insecure.  This relieves
       programmers of the need to laboriously construct pipelines using
       lower-level primitives such as <b>fork </b>and <b>execve</b>.

       The general way to use <b>libpipeline </b>involves constructing a
       <i>pipeline</i> structure and adding one or more <i>pipecmd</i> structures to
       it.  A <i>pipecmd</i> represents a subprocess (or “command”), while a
       <i>pipeline</i> represents a sequence of subprocesses each of whose
       outputs is connected to the next one's input, as in the example
       <b>ls </b>| <b>grep pattern </b>| <b>less</b>.  The calling program may adjust certain
       properties of each command independently, such as its environment
       and <i>nice</i>(3) priority, as well as properties of the entire
       pipeline such as its input and output and the way signals are
       handled while executing it.  The calling program may then start
       the pipeline, read output from it, wait for it to complete, and
       gather its exit status.

       Strings passed as <i>const char *</i> function arguments will be copied
       by the library.

   <b>Functions to build individual commands</b>
       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipecmd_new</b>(<i>const char *name</i>)

             Construct a new command representing execution of a program
             called <i>name</i>.

       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipecmd_new_argv</b>(<i>const char *name</i>, <i>va_list argv</i>)
       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipecmd_new_args</b>(<i>const char *name</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Convenience constructors wrapping <b>pipecmd_new</b>() and
             <b>pipecmd_arg</b>().  Construct a new command representing
             execution of a program called <i>name</i> with arguments.
             Terminate arguments with <b>NULL</b>.

       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipecmd_new_argstr</b>(<i>const char *argstr</i>)

             Split <i>argstr</i> on whitespace to construct a command and
             arguments, honouring shell-style single-quoting, double-
             quoting, and backslashes, but not other shell evilness like
             wildcards, semicolons, or backquotes.  This is included
             only to support situations where command arguments are
             encoded into configuration files and the like.  While it is
             safer than <i>system</i>(3), it still involves significant string
             parsing which is inherently riskier than avoiding it
             altogether.  Please try to avoid using it in new code.

       <i>typedef void pipecmd_function_type (void *)</i>;
       <i>typedef void pipecmd_function_free_type (void *)</i>;
       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipecmd_new_function</b>(<i>const char *name</i>,
             <i>pipecmd_function_type *func</i>,
             <i>pipecmd_function_free_type *free_func</i>, <i>void *data</i>)

             Construct a new command that calls a given function rather
             than executing a process.

             The data argument is passed as the function's only
             argument, and will be freed before returning using
             free_func (if non-<i>NULL</i>).

             <b>pipecmd_* </b>functions that deal with arguments cannot be used
             with the command returned by this function.

       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipecmd_new_sequencev</b>(<i>const char *name</i>, <i>va_list cmdv</i>)
       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipecmd_new_sequence</b>(<i>const char *name</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Construct a new command that itself runs a sequence of
             commands, supplied as <i>command *</i> arguments following <i>name</i>
             and terminated by <b>NULL</b>.  The commands will be executed in
             forked children; if any exits non-zero then it will
             terminate the sequence, as with "&amp;&amp;" in shell.

             <b>pipecmd_* </b>functions that deal with arguments cannot be used
             with the command returned by this function.

       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipecmd_new_passthrough</b>(<i>void</i>)

             Return a new command that just passes data from its input
             to its output.

       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipecmd_dup</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>)

             Return a duplicate of a command.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_arg</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>const char *arg</i>)

             Add an argument to a command.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_argf</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>const char *format</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Convenience function to add an argument with printf
             substitutions.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_argv</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>va_list argv</i>)
       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_args</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Convenience functions wrapping <b>pipecmd_arg</b>() to add
             multiple arguments at once.  Terminate arguments with <b>NULL</b>.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_argstr</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>const char *argstr</i>)

             Split <i>argstr</i> on whitespace to add a list of arguments,
             honouring shell-style single-quoting, double-quoting, and
             backslashes, but not other shell evilness like wildcards,
             semicolons, or backquotes.  This is included only to
             support situations where command arguments are encoded into
             configuration files and the like.  While it is safer than
             <i>system</i>(3), it still involves significant string parsing
             which is inherently riskier than avoiding it altogether.
             Please try to avoid using it in new code.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_get_nargs</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>)

             Return the number of arguments to this command.  Note that
             this includes the command name as the first argument, so
             the command ‘echo foo bar’ is counted as having three
             arguments.

             Added in <b>libpipeline </b>1.1.0.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_nice</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>int value</i>)

             Set the <i>nice</i>(3) value for this command.  Defaults to 0.
             Errors while attempting to set the nice value are ignored,
             aside from emitting a debug message.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_discard_err</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>int discard_err</i>)

             If <i>discard_err</i> is non-zero, redirect this command's
             standard error to <i>/dev/null</i>.  Otherwise, and by default,
             pass it through.  This is usually a bad idea.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_chdir</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>const char *directory</i>)

             Change the working directory to <i>directory</i> while running
             this command.

             Added in <b>libpipeline </b>1.3.0.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_fchdir</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>int directory_fd</i>)

             Change the working directory to the directory given by the
             open file descriptor <i>directory_fd</i> while running this
             command.

             Added in <b>libpipeline </b>1.4.0.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_setenv</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>const char *name</i>, <i>const char</i>
             <i>*value</i>)

             Set environment variable <i>name</i> to <i>value</i> while running this
             command.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_unsetenv</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>const char *name</i>)

             Unset environment variable <i>name</i> while running this command.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_clearenv</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>)

             Clear the environment while running this command.  (Note
             that environment operations work in sequence;
             pipecmd_clearenv followed by pipecmd_setenv causes the
             command to have just a single environment variable set.)
             Beware that this may cause unexpected failures, for example
             if some of the contents of the environment are necessary to
             execute programs at all (say, <b>PATH</b>).

             Added in <b>libpipeline </b>1.1.0.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_pre_exec</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>pipecmd_function_type *func</i>,
             <i>pipecmd_function_free_type *free_func</i>, <i>void *data</i>)

             Install a pre-exec handler.  This will be run immediately
             before executing the command's payload (process or
             function).  Pass NULL to clear any existing pre-exec
             handler.  The data argument is passed as the function's
             only argument, and will be freed before returning using
             free_func (if non-NULL).

             This is similar to pipeline_install_post_fork, except that
             is specific to a single command rather than installing a
             global handler, and it runs slightly later (immediately
             before exec rather than immediately after fork).

             Added in <b>libpipeline </b>1.5.0.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_sequence_command</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>pipecmd *child</i>)

             Add a command to a sequence created using
             <b>pipecmd_new_sequence</b>().

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_dump</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>, <i>FILE *stream</i>)

             Dump a string representation of a command to stream.

       <i>char *</i><b>pipecmd_tostring</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>)

             Return a string representation of a command.  The caller
             should free the result.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_exec</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>)

             Execute a single command, replacing the current process.
             Never returns, instead exiting non-zero on failure.

             Added in <b>libpipeline </b>1.1.0.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipecmd_free</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd</i>)

             Destroy a command.  Safely does nothing if <i>cmd</i> is <b>NULL</b>.

   <b>Functions to build pipelines</b>
       <i>pipeline *</i><b>pipeline_new</b>(<i>void</i>)

             Construct a new pipeline.

       <i>pipeline *</i><b>pipeline_new_commandv</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd1</i>, <i>va_list cmdv</i>)
       <i>pipeline *</i><b>pipeline_new_commands</b>(<i>pipecmd *cmd1</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Convenience constructors wrapping <b>pipeline_new</b>() and
             <b>pipeline_command</b>().  Construct a new pipeline consisting of
             the given list of commands.  Terminate commands with <b>NULL</b>.

       <i>pipeline *</i><b>pipeline_new_command_argv</b>(<i>const char *name</i>, <i>va_list</i>
             <i>argv</i>)
       <i>pipeline *</i><b>pipeline_new_command_args</b>(<i>const char *name</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Construct a new pipeline and add a single command to it.

       <i>pipeline *</i><b>pipeline_join</b>(<i>pipeline *p1</i>, <i>pipeline *p2</i>)

             Joins two pipelines, neither of which are allowed to be
             started.  Discards <i>want_out</i>, <i>want_outfile</i>, and <i>outfd</i> from
             <i>p1</i>, and <i>want_in</i>, <i>want_infile</i>, and <i>infd</i> from <i>p2</i>.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_connect</b>(<i>pipeline *source</i>, <i>pipeline *sink</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Connect the input of one or more sink pipelines to the
             output of a source pipeline.  The source pipeline may be
             started, but in that case <b>pipeline_want_out</b>() must have
             been called with a negative <i>fd</i>; otherwise, calls
             <b>pipeline_want_out</b>(<i>source</i>, <i>-1</i>).  In any event, calls
             <b>pipeline_want_in</b>(<i>sink</i>, <i>-1</i>) on all sinks, none of which are
             allowed to be started.  Terminate arguments with <b>NULL</b>.

             This is an application-level connection; data may be
             intercepted between the pipelines by the program before
             calling <b>pipeline_pump</b>(), which sets data flowing from the
             source to the sinks.  It is primarily useful when more than
             one sink pipeline is involved, in which case the pipelines
             cannot simply be concatenated into one.

             The result is similar to <i>tee</i>(1), except that output can be
             sent to more than two places and can easily be sent to
             multiple processes.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_command</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>pipecmd *cmd</i>)

             Add a command to a pipeline.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_command_argv</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>const char *name</i>, <i>va_list</i>
             <i>argv</i>)
       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_command_args</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>const char *name</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Construct a new command and add it to a pipeline in one go.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_command_argstr</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>const char *argstr</i>)

             Construct a new command from a shell-quoted string and add
             it to a pipeline in one go.  See the comment against
             <b>pipecmd_new_argstr</b>() above if you're tempted to use this
             function.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_commandv</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>va_list cmdv</i>)
       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_commands</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Convenience functions wrapping <b>pipeline_command</b>() to add
             multiple commands at once.  Terminate arguments with <b>NULL</b>.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_want_in</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>int fd</i>)
       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_want_out</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>int fd</i>)

             Set file descriptors to use as the input and output of the
             whole pipeline.  If non-negative, <i>fd</i> is used directly as a
             file descriptor.  If negative, <b>pipeline_start</b>() will create
             pipes and store the input writing half and the output
             reading half in the pipeline's <i>infd</i> or <i>outfd</i> field as
             appropriate.  The default is to leave input and output as
             stdin and stdout unless <b>pipeline_want_infile</b>() or
             <b>pipeline_want_outfile</b>() respectively has been called.

             Calling these functions supersedes any previous call to
             <b>pipeline_want_infile</b>() or <b>pipeline_want_outfile</b>()
             respectively.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_want_infile</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>const char *file</i>)
       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_want_outfile</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>const char *file</i>)

             Set file names to open and use as the input and output of
             the whole pipeline.  This may be more convenient than
             supplying file descriptors, and guarantees that the files
             are opened with the same privileges under which the
             pipeline is run.

             Calling these functions (even with <b>NULL</b>, which returns to
             the default of leaving input and output as stdin and
             stdout) supersedes any previous call to <b>pipeline_want_in</b>()
             or <b>pipeline_want_outfile</b>() respectively.

             The given files will be opened when the pipeline is
             started.  If an output file does not already exist, it is
             created (with mode 0666 modified in the usual way by
             umask); if it does exist, then it is truncated.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_ignore_signals</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>int ignore_signals</i>)

             If <i>ignore_signals</i> is non-zero, ignore <b>SIGINT </b>and <b>SIGQUIT </b>in
             the calling process while the pipeline is running, like
             <i>system</i>(3).  Otherwise, and by default, leave their
             dispositions unchanged.

       <i>int</i> <b>pipeline_get_ncommands</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Return the number of commands in this pipeline.

       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipeline_get_command</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>int n</i>)

             Return command number <i>n</i> from this pipeline, counting from
             zero, or <b>NULL </b>if <i>n</i> is out of range.

       <i>pipecmd *</i><b>pipeline_set_command</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>int n</i>, <i>pipecmd *cmd</i>)

             Set command number <i>n</i> in this pipeline, counting from zero,
             to <i>cmd</i>, and return the previous command in that position.
             Do nothing and return <b>NULL </b>if <i>n</i> is out of range.

       <i>pid_t</i> <b>pipeline_get_pid</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>int n</i>)

             Return the process ID of command number <i>n</i> from this
             pipeline, counting from zero.  The pipeline must be
             started.  Return <b>-1 </b>if <i>n</i> is out of range or if the command
             has already exited and been reaped.

             Added in <b>libpipeline </b>1.2.0.

       <i>FILE *</i><b>pipeline_get_infile</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)
       <i>FILE *</i><b>pipeline_get_outfile</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Get streams corresponding to <i>infd</i> and <i>outfd</i> respectively.
             The pipeline must be started.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_dump</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>FILE *stream</i>)

             Dump a string representation of <i>p</i> to stream.

       <i>char *</i><b>pipeline_tostring</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Return a string representation of <i>p</i>.  The caller should
             free the result.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_free</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Destroy a pipeline and all its commands.  Safely does
             nothing if <i>p</i> is <b>NULL</b>.  May wait for the pipeline to
             complete if it has not already done so.

   <b>Functions to run pipelines and handle signals</b>
       <i>typedef void pipeline_post_fork_fn (void)</i>;
       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_install_post_fork</b>(<i>pipeline_post_fork_fn *fn</i>)

             Install a post-fork handler.  This will be run in any child
             process immediately after it is forked.  For instance, this
             may be used for cleaning up application-specific signal
             handlers.  Pass <b>NULL </b>to clear any existing post-fork
             handler.

             See pipecmd_pre_exec for a similar facility limited to a
             single command rather than global to the calling process.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_start</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Start the processes in a pipeline.  Installs this library's
             <b>SIGCHLD </b>handler if not already installed.  Calls <b>error</b>
             <b>(FATAL) </b>on error.

             The standard file descriptors (0, 1, and 2) must be open
             before calling this function.

       <i>int</i> <b>pipeline_wait_all</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>int **statuses</i>, <i>int</i>
             <i>*n_statuses</i>)

             Wait for a pipeline to complete.  Set *<i>statuses</i> to a newly-
             allocated array of wait statuses, as returned by
             <i>waitpid</i>(2), and *<i>n_statuses</i> to the length of that array.
             The return value is similar to the exit status that a shell
             would return, with some modifications.  If the last command
             exits with a signal (other than <b>SIGPIPE</b>, which is
             considered equivalent to exiting zero), then the return
             value is 128 plus the signal number; if the last command
             exits normally but non-zero, then the return value is its
             exit status; if any other command exits non-zero, then the
             return value is 127; otherwise, the return value is 0.
             This means that the return value is only 0 if all commands
             in the pipeline exit successfully.

       <i>int</i> <b>pipeline_wait</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Wait for a pipeline to complete and return its combined
             exit status, calculated as for <b>pipeline_wait_all</b>().

       <i>int</i> <b>pipeline_run</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Start a pipeline, wait for it to complete, and free it, all
             in one go.

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_pump</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>...</i>)

             Pump data among one or more pipelines connected using
             <b>pipeline_connect</b>() until all source pipelines have reached
             end-of-file and all data has been written to all sinks (or
             failed).  All relevant pipelines must be supplied: that is,
             no pipeline that has been connected to a source pipeline
             may be supplied unless that source pipeline is also
             supplied.  Automatically starts all pipelines if they are
             not already started, but does not wait for them.  Terminate
             arguments with <b>NULL</b>.

   <b>Functions to read output from pipelines</b>
       In general, output is returned as a pointer into a buffer owned
       by the pipeline, which is automatically freed when
       <b>pipeline_free</b>() is called.  This saves the caller from having to
       explicitly free individual blocks of output data.

       <i>const char *</i><b>pipeline_read</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>size_t *len</i>)

             Read <i>len</i> bytes of data from the pipeline, returning the
             data block.  <i>len</i> is updated with the number of bytes read.

       <i>const char *</i><b>pipeline_peek</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>size_t *len</i>)

             Look ahead in the pipeline's output for <i>len</i> bytes of data,
             returning the data block.  <i>len</i> is updated with the number
             of bytes read.  The starting position of the next read or
             peek is not affected by this call.

       <i>size_t</i> <b>pipeline_peek_size</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Return the number of bytes of data that can be read using
             <b>pipeline_read</b>() or <b>pipeline_peek</b>() solely from the peek
             cache, without having to read from the pipeline itself (and
             thus potentially block).

       <i>void</i> <b>pipeline_peek_skip</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>, <i>size_t len</i>)

             Skip over and discard <i>len</i> bytes of data from the peek
             cache.  Asserts that enough data is available to skip, so
             you may want to check using <b>pipeline_peek_size</b>() first.

       <i>const char *</i><b>pipeline_readline</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Read a line of data from the pipeline, returning it.

       <i>const char *</i><b>pipeline_peekline</b>(<i>pipeline *p</i>)

             Look ahead in the pipeline's output for a line of data,
             returning it.  The starting position of the next read or
             peek is not affected by this call.

   <b>Signal handling</b>
       <b>libpipeline </b>installs a signal handler for <b>SIGCHLD</b>, and collects
       the exit status of child processes in <b>pipeline_wait</b>().
       Applications using this library must either refrain from changing
       the disposition of <b>SIGCHLD </b>(in other words, must rely on
       <b>libpipeline </b>for all child process handling) or else must make
       sure to restore 's <b>SIGCHLD </b>handler before calling any of its
       functions.

       If the <i>ignore_signals</i> flag is set in a pipeline (which is the
       default), then the <b>SIGINT </b>and <b>SIGQUIT </b>signals will be ignored in
       the parent process while child processes are running.  This
       mirrors the behaviour of <i>system</i>(3).

       <b>libpipeline </b>leaves child processes with the default disposition
       of <b>SIGPIPE</b>, namely to terminate the process.  It ignores <b>SIGPIPE</b>
       in the parent process while running <b>pipeline_pump</b>().

   <b>Reaping of child processes</b>
       <b>libpipeline </b>installs a <b>SIGCHLD </b>handler that will attempt to reap
       child processes which have exited.  This calls <i>waitpid</i>(2) with
       <b>-1</b>, so it will reap any child process, not merely those created
       by way of this library.  At present, this means that if the
       calling program forks other child processes which may exit while
       a pipeline is running, the program is not guaranteed to be able
       to collect exit statuses of those processes.

       You should not rely on this behaviour, and in future it may be
       modified either to reap only child processes created by this
       library or to provide a way to return foreign statuses to the
       application.  Please contact the author if you have an example
       application and would like to help design such an interface.

ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       If the PIPELINE_DEBUG environment variable is set to “1”, then
       <b>libpipeline </b>will emit debugging messages on standard error.

       If the PIPELINE_QUIET environment variable is set to any value,
       then <b>libpipeline </b>will refrain from printing an error message when
       a subprocess is terminated by a signal.  Added in <b>libpipeline</b>
       1.4.0.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       In the following examples, function names starting with <b>pipecmd_</b>
       or <b>pipeline_ </b>are real <b>libpipeline </b>functions, while any other
       function names are pseudocode.

       The simplest case is simple.  To run a single command, such as <b>mv</b>
       <i>source dest</i>:

             pipeline *p = pipeline_new_command_args ("mv", source, dest, NULL);
             int status = pipeline_run (p);

       <b>libpipeline </b>is often used to mimic shell pipelines, such as the
       following example:

             <b>zsoelim &lt; input-file </b>| <b>tbl </b>| <b>nroff -mandoc -Tutf8</b>

       The code to construct this would be:

             pipeline *p;
             int status;

             p = pipeline_new ();
             pipeline_want_infile (p, "input-file");
             pipeline_command_args (p, "zsoelim", NULL);
             pipeline_command_args (p, "tbl", NULL);
             pipeline_command_args (p, "nroff", "-mandoc", "-Tutf8", NULL);
             status = pipeline_run (p);

       You might want to construct a command more dynamically:

             pipecmd *manconv = pipecmd_new_args ("manconv", "-f", from_code,
                                                  "-t", "UTF-8", NULL);
             if (quiet)
                     pipecmd_arg (manconv, "-q");
             pipeline_command (p, manconv);

       Perhaps you want an environment variable set only while running a
       certain command:

             pipecmd *less = pipecmd_new ("less");
             pipecmd_setenv (less, "LESSCHARSET", lesscharset);

       You might find yourself needing to pass the output of one
       pipeline to several other pipelines, in a “tee” arrangement:

             pipeline *source, *sink1, *sink2;

             source = make_source ();
             sink1 = make_sink1 ();
             sink2 = make_sink2 ();
             pipeline_connect (source, sink1, sink2, NULL);
             /* Pump data among these pipelines until there's nothing left. */
             pipeline_pump (source, sink1, sink2, NULL);
             pipeline_free (sink2);
             pipeline_free (sink1);
             pipeline_free (source);

       Maybe one of your commands is actually an in-process function,
       rather than an external program:

             pipecmd *inproc = pipecmd_new_function ("in-process", &amp;func,
                                                     NULL, NULL);
             pipeline_command (p, inproc);

       Sometimes your program needs to consume the output of a pipeline,
       rather than sending it all to some other subprocess:

             pipeline *p = make_pipeline ();
             const char *line;

             pipeline_want_out (p, -1);
             pipeline_start (p);
             line = pipeline_peekline (p);
             if (!strstr (line, "coding: UTF-8"))
                     printf ("Unicode text follows:0);
             while (line = pipeline_readline (p))
                     printf ("  %s", line);
             pipeline_free (p);

       version was based very loosely on the <b>run_pipeline</b>() function in
       GNU groff, written by James Clark &lt;jjc@jclark.com&gt;.  It also
       contains library code by Markus Armbruster, and by various

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Using this library in a program which runs any other child
       processes and/or installs its own <b>SIGCHLD </b>handler is unlikely to
       work.
