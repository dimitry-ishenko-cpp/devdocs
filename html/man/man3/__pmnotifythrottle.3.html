CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       This documentation is intended for internal Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) developer use.

       These interfaces are not part of the PCP APIs that are guaranteed
       to remain fixed across releases, and they may not work, or may
       provide different semantics at some point in the future.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       When the same error condition occurs over and over, like in a DoS
       attack, or catastrophic networking failure, or bad system
       configuration, or software botch, there is a risk that a PCP
       application could generate a large number of identical diagnostic
       messages, filling up a log file and hence a filesystem.
       <b>__pmNotifyThrottle </b>is intended to be used as a guard that can
       detect repeated calls for the same error condition and allow the
       caller to stop issuing messages when repeated badness happens.

       The error condition is identified by <i>key</i> and <i>subkey</i>, and the most
       common use case would be for these to be <b>__FILE__ </b>and <b>__LINE__ </b>at
       the point where <b>__pmNotifyThrottle </b>is called.

       For each unique <i>key</i> and <i>subkey</i> pair <b>__pmNotifyThrottle </b>maintains
       a count of the number of times it has been called in the life of
       the calling process.

       The return values are 0 if the throttle limit for <i>key</i> and <i>subkey</i>
       has not been reached, else 1 if the throttle limit has been
       reached, else 2 if the throttle limit has been exceeded.

       The same throttle limit as applied across all error conditions
       and set by the environment variable <b>PCP_NOTIFY_THROTTLE </b>else a
       default of 10 if the environment variable is not set, although
       this can be subsequently modified by calling
       <b>__pmResetNotifyThrottle</b>.

       <b>__pmResetNotifyThrottle </b>may be used to reset the counter for an
       error condition to zero, so that diagnostic output can be resumed
       if the caller determines it is safe to do so.  If <i>limit</i> is
       greater than zero then the limit for the error condition is also
       reset, otherwise the limit is unchanged.

       Calling <b>__pmResetNotifyThrottle </b>with a <i>key</i> value of NULL will
       reset the counters (and possibly limits) for <b>all </b>error
       conditions, and in this case if <i>limit</i> is greater than zero the
       default limit for any new error conditions is also set (over-
       riding the default setting or the value initialized from the
       <b>PCP_NOTIFY_THROTTLE </b>environment variable).

       <b>__pmResetNotifyThrottle </b>will return -ENOENT if <i>key</i> and <i>subkey</i>
       does not match an existing error condition, else the return value
       is the sum of the number of times the limit has been exceeded
       across all selected error conditions.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       The following is a simple throttle that stops reporting errors
       after 10 trips.
           if ((sts = __pmNotifyThrottle(__FILE__, __LINE__)) &lt; 2) {
               fprintf(stderr, "Some error message\n");
               if (sts == 1)
                fprintf(stderr, "[further messages will be suppressed]\n");
           }

       The more sophisticated example below throttles messages, but
       enables them again after 10 minutes.
           int    lineno;
           time_t first_throttle;
           ...
           lineno = __LINE__ + 1;
           if ((sts = __pmNotifyThrottle(__FILE__, lineno)) &lt; 2) {
               pmNotifyErr(LOG_INFO, "Some error message");
               if (sts == 1) {
                first_throttle = time(NULL);
                pmNotifyErr(LOG_INFO, "[further messages will be suppressed]");
               }
           }
           else if (sts == 2) {
               if (time(NULL) - first_throttle &gt;= 600) {
                sts = __pmResetNotifyThrottle(__FILE__, lineno, -1);
                pmNotifyErr(LOG_INFO, "[%d messages were suppressed]", sts);
               }
           }
