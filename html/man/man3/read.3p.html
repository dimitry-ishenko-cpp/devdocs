</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>read</i>() function shall attempt to read <i>nbyte</i> bytes from the
       file associated with the open file descriptor, <i>fildes</i>, into the
       buffer pointed to by <i>buf</i>.  The behavior of multiple concurrent
       reads on the same pipe, FIFO, or terminal device is unspecified.

       Before any action described below is taken, and if <i>nbyte</i> is zero,
       the <i>read</i>() function may detect and return errors as described
       below. In the absence of errors, or if error detection is not
       performed, the <i>read</i>() function shall return zero and have no
       other results.

       On files that support seeking (for example, a regular file), the
       <i>read</i>() shall start at a position in the file given by the file
       offset associated with <i>fildes</i>.  The file offset shall be
       incremented by the number of bytes actually read.

       Files that do not support seeking—for example, terminals—always
       read from the current position. The value of a file offset
       associated with such a file is undefined.

       No data transfer shall occur past the current end-of-file. If the
       starting position is at or after the end-of-file, 0 shall be
       returned.  If the file refers to a device special file, the
       result of subsequent <i>read</i>() requests is implementation-defined.

       If the value of <i>nbyte</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is
       implementation-defined.

       When attempting to read from an empty pipe or FIFO:

        *  If no process has the pipe open for writing, <i>read</i>() shall
           return 0 to indicate end-of-file.

        *  If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK
           is set, <i>read</i>() shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

        *  If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK
           is clear, <i>read</i>() shall block the calling thread until some
           data is written or the pipe is closed by all processes that
           had the pipe open for writing.

       When attempting to read a file (other than a pipe or FIFO) that
       supports non-blocking reads and has no data currently available:

        *  If O_NONBLOCK is set, <i>read</i>() shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
           <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.

        *  If O_NONBLOCK is clear, <i>read</i>() shall block the calling thread
           until some data becomes available.

        *  The use of the O_NONBLOCK flag has no effect if there is some
           data available.

       The <i>read</i>() function reads data previously written to a file. If
       any portion of a regular file prior to the end-of-file has not
       been written, <i>read</i>() shall return bytes with value 0. For
       example, <i>lseek</i>() allows the file offset to be set beyond the end
       of existing data in the file. If data is later written at this
       point, subsequent reads in the gap between the previous end of
       data and the newly written data shall return bytes with value 0
       until data is written into the gap.

       Upon successful completion, where <i>nbyte</i> is greater than 0, <i>read</i>()
       shall mark for update the last data access timestamp of the file,
       and shall return the number of bytes read.  This number shall
       never be greater than <i>nbyte</i>.  The value returned may be less than
       <i>nbyte</i> if the number of bytes left in the file is less than <i>nbyte</i>,
       if the <i>read</i>() request was interrupted by a signal, or if the file
       is a pipe or FIFO or special file and has fewer than <i>nbyte</i> bytes
       immediately available for reading. For example, a <i>read</i>() from a
       file associated with a terminal may return one typed line of
       data.

       If a <i>read</i>() is interrupted by a signal before it reads any data,
       it shall return -1 with <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       If a <i>read</i>() is interrupted by a signal after it has successfully
       read some data, it shall return the number of bytes read.

       For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset
       maximum established in the open file description associated with
       <i>fildes</i>.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, <i>read</i>() shall be equivalent to
       <i>recv</i>() with no flags set.

       If the O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O
       operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by
       synchronized I/O data integrity completion. If the O_SYNC and
       O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O operations on the file
       descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file
       integrity completion.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory object, the result of the
       <i>read</i>() function is unspecified.

       If <i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of the
       <i>read</i>() function is unspecified.

       A <i>read</i>() from a STREAMS file can read data in three different
       modes: <i>byte-stream</i> mode, <i>message-nondiscard</i> mode, and <i>message-</i>
       <i>discard</i> mode. The default shall be byte-stream mode.  This can be
       changed using the I_SRDOPT <i>ioctl</i>() request, and can be tested
       with I_GRDOPT <i>ioctl</i>().  In byte-stream mode, <i>read</i>() shall
       retrieve data from the STREAM until as many bytes as were
       requested are transferred, or until there is no more data to be
       retrieved.  Byte-stream mode ignores message boundaries.

       In STREAMS message-nondiscard mode, <i>read</i>() shall retrieve data
       until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or until a
       message boundary is reached. If <i>read</i>() does not retrieve all the
       data in a message, the remaining data shall be left on the
       STREAM, and can be retrieved by the next <i>read</i>() call. Message-
       discard mode also retrieves data until as many bytes as were
       requested are transferred, or a message boundary is reached.
       However, unread data remaining in a message after the <i>read</i>()
       returns shall be discarded, and shall not be available for a
       subsequent <i>read</i>(), <i>getmsg</i>(), or <i>getpmsg</i>() call.

       How <i>read</i>() handles zero-byte STREAMS messages is determined by
       the current read mode setting. In byte-stream mode, <i>read</i>() shall
       accept data until it has read <i>nbyte</i> bytes, or until there is no
       more data to read, or until a zero-byte message block is
       encountered. The <i>read</i>() function shall then return the number of
       bytes read, and place the zero-byte message back on the STREAM to
       be retrieved by the next <i>read</i>(), <i>getmsg</i>(), or <i>getpmsg</i>().  In
       message-nondiscard mode or message-discard mode, a zero-byte
       message shall return 0 and the message shall be removed from the
       STREAM. When a zero-byte message is read as the first message on
       a STREAM, the message shall be removed from the STREAM and 0
       shall be returned, regardless of the read mode.

       A <i>read</i>() from a STREAMS file shall return the data in the message
       at the front of the STREAM head read queue, regardless of the
       priority band of the message.

       By default, STREAMs are in control-normal mode, in which a <i>read</i>()
       from a STREAMS file can only process messages that contain a data
       part but do not contain a control part. The <i>read</i>() shall fail if
       a message containing a control part is encountered at the STREAM
       head. This default action can be changed by placing the STREAM in
       either control-data mode or control-discard mode with the
       I_SRDOPT <i>ioctl</i>() command. In control-data mode, <i>read</i>() shall
       convert any control part to data and pass it to the application
       before passing any data part originally present in the same
       message.  In control-discard mode, <i>read</i>() shall discard message
       control parts but return to the process any data part in the
       message.

       In addition, <i>read</i>() shall fail if the STREAM head had processed
       an asynchronous error before the call. In this case, the value of
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> shall not reflect the result of <i>read</i>(), but reflect the
       prior error. If a hangup occurs on the STREAM being read, <i>read</i>()
       shall continue to operate normally until the STREAM head read
       queue is empty. Thereafter, it shall return 0.

       The <i>pread</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>read</i>(), except that
       it shall read from a given position in the file without changing
       the file offset. The first three arguments to <i>pread</i>() are the
       same as <i>read</i>() with the addition of a fourth argument <i>offset</i> for
       the desired position inside the file. An attempt to perform a
       <i>pread</i>() on a file that is incapable of seeking shall result in an
       error.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a non-
       negative integer indicating the number of bytes actually read.
       Otherwise, the functions shall return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to
       indicate the error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The file is neither a pipe, nor a FIFO, nor a socket, the
              O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor, and the
              thread would be delayed in the read operation.

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument is not a valid file descriptor open
              for reading.

       <b>EBADMSG</b>
              The file is a STREAM file that is set to control-normal
              mode and the message waiting to be read includes a control
              part.

       <b>EINTR  </b>The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a
              signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EINVAL </b>The STREAM or multiplexer referenced by <i>fildes</i> is linked
              (directly or indirectly) downstream from a multiplexer.

       <b>EIO    </b>The process is a member of a background process group
              attempting to read from its controlling terminal, and
              either the calling thread is blocking SIGTTIN or the
              process is ignoring SIGTTIN or the process group of the
              process is orphaned. This error may also be generated for
              implementation-defined reasons.

       <b>EISDIR </b>The <i>fildes</i> argument refers to a directory and the
              implementation does not allow the directory to be read
              using <i>read</i>() or <i>pread</i>().  The <i>readdir</i>() function should be
              used instead.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The file is a regular file, <i>nbyte</i> is greater than 0, the
              starting position is before the end-of-file, and the
              starting position is greater than or equal to the offset
              maximum established in the open file description
              associated with <i>fildes</i>.

       The <i>pread</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The file is a regular file or block special file, and the
              <i>offset</i> argument is negative. The file offset shall remain
              unchanged.

       <b>ESPIPE </b>The file is incapable of seeking.

       The <i>read</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The file is a pipe or FIFO, the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for
              the file descriptor, and the thread would be delayed in
              the read operation.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The file is a socket, the O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the
              file descriptor, and the thread would be delayed in the
              read operation.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              A read was attempted on a socket and the connection was
              forcibly closed by its peer.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              A read was attempted on a socket that is not connected.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              A read was attempted on a socket and a transmission
              timeout occurred.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EIO    </b>A physical I/O error has occurred.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to
              perform the operation.

       <b>ENOMEM </b>Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.

       <b>ENXIO  </b>A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request
              was outside the capabilities of the device.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the value of the
       file offset after an error is returned; there are too many cases.
       For programming errors, such as <b>[EBADF]</b>, the concept is
       meaningless since no file is involved. For errors that are
       detected immediately, such as <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, clearly the offset should
       not change. After an interrupt or hardware error, however, an
       updated value would be very useful and is the behavior of many
       implementations.

       Note that a <i>read</i>() of zero bytes does not modify the last data
       access timestamp. A <i>read</i>() that requests more than zero bytes,
       but returns zero, is required to modify the last data access
       timestamp.

       Implementations are allowed, but not required, to perform error
       checking for <i>read</i>() requests of zero bytes.

   <b>Input and Output</b>
       The use of I/O with large byte counts has always presented
       problems.  Ideas such as <i>lread</i>() and <i>lwrite</i>() (using and
       returning <b>long</b>s) were considered at one time. The current
       solution is to use abstract types on the ISO C standard function
       to <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>().  The abstract types can be declared so
       that existing functions work, but can also be declared so that
       larger types can be represented in future implementations. It is
       presumed that whatever constraints limit the maximum range of
       <b>size_t </b>also limit portable I/O requests to the same range. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 also limits the range further by requiring
       that the byte count be limited so that a signed return value
       remains meaningful. Since the return type is also a (signed)
       abstract type, the byte count can be defined by the
       implementation to be larger than an <b>int </b>can hold.

       The standard developers considered adding atomicity requirements
       to a pipe or FIFO, but recognized that due to the nature of pipes
       and FIFOs there could be no guarantee of atomicity of reads of
       {PIPE_BUF} or any other size that would be an aid to applications
       portability.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that no action be taken for
       <i>read</i>() or <i>write</i>() when <i>nbyte</i> is zero. This is not intended to
       take precedence over detection of errors (such as invalid buffer
       pointers or file descriptors). This is consistent with the rest
       of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, but the phrasing here could be
       misread to require detection of the zero case before any other
       errors.  A value of zero is to be considered a correct value, for
       which the semantics are a no-op.

       I/O is intended to be atomic to ordinary files and pipes and
       FIFOs.  Atomic means that all the bytes from a single operation
       that started out together end up together, without interleaving
       from other I/O operations. It is a known attribute of terminals
       that this is not honored, and terminals are explicitly (and
       implicitly permanently) excepted, making the behavior
       unspecified. The behavior for other device types is also left
       unspecified, but the wording is intended to imply that future
       standards might choose to specify atomicity (or not).

       There were recommendations to add format parameters to <i>read</i>() and
       <i>write</i>() in order to handle networked transfers among
       heterogeneous file system and base hardware types. Such a
       facility may be required for support by the OSI presentation of
       layer services. However, it was determined that this should
       correspond with similar C-language facilities, and that is beyond
       the scope of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. The concept was
       suggested to the developers of the ISO C standard for their
       consideration as a possible area for future work.

       In 4.3 BSD, a <i>read</i>() or <i>write</i>() that is interrupted by a signal
       before transferring any data does not by default return an
       <b>[EINTR] </b>error, but is restarted. In 4.2 BSD, 4.3 BSD, and the
       Eighth Edition, there is an additional function, <i>select</i>(), whose
       purpose is to pause until specified activity (data to read, space
       to write, and so on) is detected on specified file descriptors.
       It is common in applications written for those systems for
       <i>select</i>() to be used before <i>read</i>() in situations (such as keyboard
       input) where interruption of I/O due to a signal is desired.

       The issue of which files or file types are interruptible is
       considered an implementation design issue. This is often affected
       primarily by hardware and reliability issues.

       There are no references to actions taken following an
       ``unrecoverable error''. It is considered beyond the scope of
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to describe what happens in the case
       of hardware errors.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed two very different
       behaviors with regard to the handling of interrupts. In order to
       minimize the resulting confusion, it was decided that
       POSIX.1‐2008 should support only one of these behaviors.
       Historical practice on AT&amp;T-derived systems was to have <i>read</i>()
       and <i>write</i>() return -1 and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINTR] </b>when interrupted
       after some, but not all, of the data requested had been
       transferred. However, the US Department of Commerce FIPS 151‐1
       and FIPS 151‐2 require the historical BSD behavior, in which
       <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>() return the number of bytes actually
       transferred before the interrupt.  If -1 is returned when any
       data is transferred, it is difficult to recover from the error on
       a seekable device and impossible on a non-seekable device. Most
       new implementations support this behavior.  The behavior required
       by POSIX.1‐2008 is to return the number of bytes transferred.

       POSIX.1‐2008 does not specify when an implementation that buffers
       <i>read</i>()s actually moves the data into the user-supplied buffer, so
       an implementation may choose to do this at the latest possible
       moment.  Therefore, an interrupt arriving earlier may not cause
       <i>read</i>() to return a partial byte count, but rather to return -1
       and set <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       Consideration was also given to combining the two previous
       options, and setting <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to <b>[EINTR] </b>while returning a short
       count. However, not only is there no existing practice that
       implements this, it is also contradictory to the idea that when
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> is set, the function responsible shall return -1.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 intentionally does not specify any
       <i>pread</i>() errors related to pipes, FIFOs, and sockets other than
       <b>[ESPIPE]</b>.
