       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sleep — suspend execution for an interval of time
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

       unsigned sleep(unsigned <i>seconds</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sleep</i>() function shall cause the calling thread to be
       suspended from execution until either the number of realtime
       seconds specified by the argument <i>seconds</i> has elapsed or a signal
       is delivered to the calling thread and its action is to invoke a
       signal-catching function or to terminate the process. The
       suspension time may be longer than requested due to the
       scheduling of other activity by the system.

       In single-threaded programs, <i>sleep</i>() may make use of SIGALRM. In
       multi-threaded programs, <i>sleep</i>() shall not make use of SIGALRM
       and the remainder of this DESCRIPTION does not apply.

       If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process during
       execution of <i>sleep</i>() and if the SIGALRM signal is being ignored
       or blocked from delivery, it is unspecified whether <i>sleep</i>()
       returns when the SIGALRM signal is scheduled. If the signal is
       being blocked, it is also unspecified whether it remains pending
       after <i>sleep</i>() returns or it is discarded.

       If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process during
       execution of <i>sleep</i>(), except as a result of a prior call to
       <i>alarm</i>(), and if the SIGALRM signal is not being ignored or
       blocked from delivery, it is unspecified whether that signal has
       any effect other than causing <i>sleep</i>() to return.

       If a signal-catching function interrupts <i>sleep</i>() and examines or
       changes either the time a SIGALRM is scheduled to be generated,
       the action associated with the SIGALRM signal, or whether the
       SIGALRM signal is blocked from delivery, the results are
       unspecified.

       If a signal-catching function interrupts <i>sleep</i>() and calls
       <i>siglongjmp</i>() or <i>longjmp</i>() to restore an environment saved prior
       to the <i>sleep</i>() call, the action associated with the SIGALRM
       signal and the time at which a SIGALRM signal is scheduled to be
       generated are unspecified.  It is also unspecified whether the
       SIGALRM signal is blocked, unless the signal mask of the process
       is restored as part of the environment.

       Interactions between <i>sleep</i>() and <i>setitimer</i>() are unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>sleep</i>() returns because the requested time has elapsed, the
       value returned shall be 0. If <i>sleep</i>() returns due to delivery of
       a signal, the return value shall be the ``unslept'' amount (the
       requested time minus the time actually slept) in seconds.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       There are two general approaches to the implementation of the
       <i>sleep</i>() function. One is to use the <i>alarm</i>() function to schedule
       a SIGALRM signal and then suspend the calling thread waiting for
       that signal. The other is to implement an independent facility.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 permits either approach in single-
       threaded programs, but the simple alarm/suspend implementation is
       not appropriate for multi-threaded programs.

       In order to comply with the requirement that no primitive shall
       change a process attribute unless explicitly described by this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, an implementation using SIGALRM must
       carefully take into account any SIGALRM signal scheduled by
       previous <i>alarm</i>() calls, the action previously established for
       SIGALRM, and whether SIGALRM was blocked. If a SIGALRM has been
       scheduled before the <i>sleep</i>() would ordinarily complete, the
       <i>sleep</i>() must be shortened to that time and a SIGALRM generated
       (possibly simulated by direct invocation of the signal-catching
       function) before <i>sleep</i>() returns. If a SIGALRM has been scheduled
       after the <i>sleep</i>() would ordinarily complete, it must be
       rescheduled for the same time before <i>sleep</i>() returns. The action
       and blocking for SIGALRM must be saved and restored.

       Historical implementations often implement the SIGALRM-based
       version using <i>alarm</i>() and <i>pause</i>().  One such implementation is
       prone to infinite hangups, as described in <a href="pause.3p.html">pause(3p)</a>.  Another
       such implementation uses the C-language <i>setjmp</i>() and <i>longjmp</i>()
       functions to avoid that window. That implementation introduces a
       different problem: when the SIGALRM signal interrupts a signal-
       catching function installed by the user to catch a different
       signal, the <i>longjmp</i>() aborts that signal-catching function. An
       implementation based on <i>sigprocmask</i>(), <i>alarm</i>(), and <i>sigsuspend</i>()
       can avoid these problems.

       Despite all reasonable care, there are several very subtle, but
       detectable and unavoidable, differences between the two types of
       implementations. These are the cases mentioned in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 where some other activity relating to SIGALRM takes
       place, and the results are stated to be unspecified. All of these
       cases are sufficiently unusual as not to be of concern to most
       applications.

       See also the discussion of the term <i>realtime</i> in <a href="alarm.3p.html">alarm(3p)</a>.

       Since <i>sleep</i>() can be implemented using <i>alarm</i>(), the discussion
       about alarms occurring early under <i>alarm</i>() applies to <i>sleep</i>() as
       well.

       Application developers should note that the type of the argument
       <i>seconds</i> and the return value of <i>sleep</i>() is <b>unsigned</b>.  That means
       that a Strictly Conforming POSIX System Interfaces Application
       cannot pass a value greater than the minimum guaranteed value for
       {UINT_MAX}, which the ISO C standard sets as 65535, and any
       application passing a larger value is restricting its
       portability. A different type was considered, but historical
       implementations, including those with a 16-bit <b>int </b>type,
       consistently use either <b>unsigned </b>or <b>int</b>.

       Scheduling delays may cause the process to return from the
       <i>sleep</i>() function significantly after the requested time. In such
       cases, the return value should be set to zero, since the formula
       (requested time minus the time actually spent) yields a negative
       number and <i>sleep</i>() returns an <b>unsigned</b>.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version of this standard may require that <i>sleep</i>() does
       not make use of SIGALRM in all programs, not just multi-threaded
       programs.
