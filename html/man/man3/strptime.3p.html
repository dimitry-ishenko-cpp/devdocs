       strptime — date and time conversion
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;time.h&gt;

       char *strptime(const char *restrict <i>buf</i>, const char *restrict <i>format</i>,
           struct tm *restrict <i>tm</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>strptime</i>() function shall convert the character string
       pointed to by <i>buf</i> to values which are stored in the <b>tm </b>structure
       pointed to by <i>tm</i>, using the format specified by <i>format</i>.

       The format is composed of zero or more directives. Each directive
       is composed of one of the following: one or more white-space
       characters (as specified by <i>isspace</i>()); an ordinary character
       (neither <b>'%' </b>nor a white-space character); or a conversion
       specification.

       Each conversion specification is introduced by the <b>'%' </b>character
       after which the following appear in sequence:

        *  An optional flag, the zero character (<b>'0'</b>) or the &lt;plus-sign&gt;
           character (<b>'+'</b>), which is ignored.

        *  An optional field width. If a field width is specified, it
           shall be interpreted as a string of decimal digits that will
           determine the maximum number of bytes converted for the
           conversion rather than the number of bytes specified below in
           the description of the conversion specifiers.

        *  An optional <b>E </b>or <b>O </b>modifier.

        *  A terminating conversion specifier character that indicates
           the type of conversion to be applied.

       The conversions are determined using the <i>LC_TIME</i> category of the
       current locale. The application shall ensure that there is white-
       space or other non-alphanumeric characters between any two
       conversion specifications unless all of the adjacent conversion
       specifications convert a known, fixed number of characters. In
       the following list, the maximum number of characters scanned
       (excluding the one matching the next directive) is as follows:

        *  If a maximum field width is specified, then that number

        *  Otherwise, the pattern <b>"{x}" </b>indicates that the maximum is <i>x</i>

        *  Otherwise, the pattern <b>"[x,y]" </b>indicates that the value shall
           fall within the range given (both bounds being inclusive),
           and the maximum number of characters scanned shall be the
           maximum required to represent any value in the range without
           leading zeros and without a leading &lt;plus-sign&gt;

       The following conversion specifiers are supported.

       The results are unspecified if a modifier is specified with a
       flag or with a minimum field width, or if a field width is
       specified for any conversion specifier other than <b>C </b>or <b>Y</b>.

       a       The day of the week, using the locale's weekday names;
               either the abbreviated or full name may be specified.

       A       Equivalent to <b>%a</b>.

       b       The month, using the locale's month names; either the
               abbreviated or full name may be specified.

       B       Equivalent to <b>%b</b>.

       c       Replaced by the locale's appropriate date and time
               representation.

       C       All but the last two digits of the year {2}; leading
               zeros shall be permitted but shall not be required. A
               leading <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-' </b>character shall be permitted before
               any leading zeros but shall not be required.

       p       The locale's equivalent of a.m. or p.m.

       r       12-hour clock time using the AM/PM notation if <b>t_fmt_ampm</b>
               is not an empty string in the <i>LC_TIME</i> portion of the
               current locale; in the POSIX locale, this shall be
               equivalent to <b>%I</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S %p</b>.

       R       The time as <b>%H</b>:<b>%M</b>.

       S       The seconds [00,60]; leading zeros shall be permitted but

       t       Any white space.

       T       The time as <b>%H</b>:<b>%M</b>:<b>%S</b>.

       U       The week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of
               the week) as a decimal number [00,53]; leading zeros
               shall be permitted but shall not be required.

       w       The weekday as a decimal number [0,6], with 0
               representing Sunday.

       W       The week number of the year (Monday as the first day of
               the week) as a decimal number [00,53]; leading zeros

       x       The date, using the locale's date format.

       X       The time, using the locale's time format.

       y       The last two digits of the year. When <i>format</i> contains
               neither a <b>C </b>conversion specifier nor a <b>Y </b>conversion
               specifier, values in the range [69,99] shall refer to
               years 1969 to 1999 inclusive and values in the range
               [00,68] shall refer to years 2000 to 2068 inclusive;
               leading zeros shall be permitted but shall not be
               required. A leading <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-' </b>character shall be

               required.

               <b>Note:  </b>It is expected that in a future version of this
                      standard the default century inferred from a
                      2-digit year will change. (This would apply to all
                      commands accepting a 2-digit year as input.)

       Y       The full year {4}; leading zeros shall be permitted but
               shall not be required. A leading <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-' </b>character
               shall be permitted before any leading zeros but shall not
               be required.

       %       Replaced by <b>%</b>.

   <b>Modified Conversion Specifiers</b>
       Some conversion specifiers can be modified by the <b>E </b>and <b>O</b>
       modifier characters to indicate that an alternative format or
       specification should be used rather than the one normally used by
       the unmodified conversion specifier. If the alternative format or
       specification does not exist in the current locale, the behavior
       shall be as if the unmodified conversion specification were used.

       %Ec     The locale's alternative appropriate date and time
               representation.

       %EC     The name of the base year (period) in the locale's
               alternative representation.

       %Ex     The locale's alternative date representation.

       %EX     The locale's alternative time representation.

       %Ey     The offset from <b>%EC </b>(year only) in the locale's
               alternative representation.

       %EY     The full alternative year representation.

       %Od     The day of the month using the locale's alternative
               numeric symbols; leading zeros shall be permitted but
               shall not be required.

       %Oe     Equivalent to <b>%Od</b>.

       %OH     The hour (24-hour clock) using the locale's alternative
               numeric symbols.

       %OI     The hour (12-hour clock) using the locale's alternative
               numeric symbols.

       %Om     The month using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %OM     The minutes using the locale's alternative numeric
               symbols.

       %OS     The seconds using the locale's alternative numeric
               symbols.

       %OU     The week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of
               the week) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %Ow     The number of the weekday (Sunday=0) using the locale's
               alternative numeric symbols.

       %OW     The week number of the year (Monday as the first day of
               the week) using the locale's alternative numeric symbols.

       %Oy     The year (offset from <b>%C</b>) using the locale's alternative
               numeric symbols.

       A conversion specification composed of white-space characters is
       executed by scanning input up to the first character that is not
       white-space (which remains unscanned), or until no more
       characters can be scanned.

       A conversion specification that is an ordinary character is
       executed by scanning the next character from the buffer. If the
       character scanned from the buffer differs from the one comprising
       the directive, the directive fails, and the differing and
       subsequent characters remain unscanned.

       A series of conversion specifications composed of <b>%n</b>, <b>%t</b>, white-
       space characters, or any combination is executed by scanning up
       to the first character that is not white space (which remains
       unscanned), or until no more characters can be scanned.

       Any other conversion specification is executed by scanning
       characters until a character matching the next directive is
       scanned, or until no more characters can be scanned. These
       characters, except the one matching the next directive, are then
       compared to the locale values associated with the conversion
       specifier. If a match is found, values for the appropriate <b>tm</b>
       structure members are set to values corresponding to the locale
       information. Case is ignored when matching items in <i>buf</i> such as
       month or weekday names. If no match is found, <i>strptime</i>() fails
       and no more characters are scanned.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, <i>strptime</i>() shall return a pointer to
       the character following the last character parsed. Otherwise, a
       null pointer shall be returned.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Convert a Date-Plus-Time String to Broken-Down Time and Then into</b>
       <b>Seconds</b>
       The following example demonstrates the use of <i>strptime</i>() to
       convert a string into broken-down time. The broken-down time is
       then converted into seconds since the Epoch using <i>mktime</i>().

           #include &lt;time.h&gt;
           ...

           struct tm tm;
           time_t t;

           if (strptime("6 Dec 2001 12:33:45", "%d %b %Y %H:%M:%S", &amp;tm) == NULL)
               /* Handle error */;

           printf("year: %d; month: %d; day: %d;\n",
                   tm.tm_year, tm.tm_mon, tm.tm_mday);
           printf("hour: %d; minute: %d; second: %d\n",
                   tm.tm_hour, tm.tm_min, tm.tm_sec);
           printf("week day: %d; year day: %d\n", tm.tm_wday, tm.tm_yday);

           tm.tm_isdst = -1;      /* Not set by strptime(); tells mktime()
                                     to determine whether daylight saving time
                                     is in effect */
           t = mktime(&amp;tm);
           if (t == -1)
               /* Handle error */;
           printf("seconds since the Epoch: %ld\n", (long) t);"
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Several ``equivalent to'' formats and the special processing of
       white-space characters are provided in order to ease the use of
       identical <i>format</i> strings for <i>strftime</i>() and <i>strptime</i>().

       It should be noted that dates constructed by the <i>strftime</i>()
       function with the <b>%Y </b>or <b>%C%y </b>conversion specifiers may have
       values larger than 9999. If the <i>strptime</i>() function is used to
       read such values using <b>%C%y </b>or <b>%Y</b>, the year values will be
       truncated to four digits. Applications should use <b>%+</b><i>w</i><b>%y </b>or <b>%+</b><i>x</i><b>Y</b>
       with <i>w</i> and <i>x</i> set large enough to contain the full value of any
       years that will be printed or scanned.

       See also the APPLICATION USAGE section in <a href="strftime.3p.html">strftime(3p)</a>.

       It is unspecified whether multiple calls to <i>strptime</i>() using the
       same <b>tm </b>structure will update the current contents of the
       structure or overwrite all contents of the structure. Conforming
       applications should make a single call to <i>strptime</i>() with a
       format and all data needed to completely specify the date and
       time being converted.
