PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       posix_openpt — open a pseudo-terminal device
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
       #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

       int posix_openpt(int <i>oflag</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_openpt</i>() function shall establish a connection between
       a master device for a pseudo-terminal and a file descriptor. The
       file descriptor shall be allocated as described in <i>Section 2.14</i>,
       <i>File Descriptor Allocation</i> and can be used by other I/O functions
       that refer to that pseudo-terminal.

       The file status flags and file access modes of the open file
       description shall be set according to the value of <i>oflag</i>.

       Values for <i>oflag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of
       flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>:

       O_RDWR      Open for reading and writing.

       O_NOCTTY    If set <i>posix_openpt</i>() shall not cause the terminal
                   device to become the controlling terminal for the
                   process.

       The behavior of other values for the <i>oflag</i> argument is
       unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <i>posix_openpt</i>() function shall
       open a file descriptor for a master pseudo-terminal device and
       return a non-negative integer representing the file descriptor.
       Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> set to indicate the
       error.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>posix_openpt</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EMFILE </b>All file descriptors available to the process are
              currently open.

       <b>ENFILE </b>The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in
              the system.

       The <i>posix_openpt</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value of <i>oflag</i> is not valid.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>Out of pseudo-terminal resources.

       <b>ENOSR  </b>Out of STREAMS resources.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Opening a Pseudo-Terminal and Returning the Name of the Slave Device</b>
       <b>and a File Descriptor</b>
           #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
           #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

           int masterfd, slavefd;
           char *slavedevice;

           masterfd = posix_openpt(O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY);

           if (masterfd == -1
               || grantpt (masterfd) == -1
               || unlockpt (masterfd) == -1
               || (slavedevice = ptsname (masterfd)) == NULL)
               return -1;

           printf("slave device is: %s\n", slavedevice);

           slavefd = open(slavedevice, O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY);
           if (slavefd &lt; 0)
               return -1;
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       This function is a method for portably obtaining a file
       descriptor of a master terminal device for a pseudo-terminal. The
       <i>grantpt</i>() and <i>ptsname</i>() functions can be used to manipulate mode
       and ownership permissions, and to obtain the name of the slave
       device, respectively.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The standard developers considered the matter of adding a special
       device for cloning master pseudo-terminals: the <b>/dev/ptmx </b>device.
       However, consensus could not be reached, and it was felt that
       adding a new function would permit other implementations. The
       <i>posix_openpt</i>() function is designed to complement the <i>grantpt</i>(),
       <i>ptsname</i>(), and <i>unlockpt</i>() functions.

       On implementations supporting the <b>/dev/ptmx </b>clone device, opening
       the master device of a pseudo-terminal is simply:

           mfdp = open("/dev/ptmx", oflag );
           if (mfdp &lt; 0)
               return -1;
