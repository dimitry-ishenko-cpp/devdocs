PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fwide — set stream orientation
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
       #include &lt;wchar.h&gt;

       int fwide(FILE *<i>stream</i>, int <i>mode</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
       with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
       described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <i>fwide</i>() function shall determine the orientation of the
       stream pointed to by <i>stream</i>.  If <i>mode</i> is greater than zero, the
       function first attempts to make the stream wide-oriented. If <i>mode</i>
       is less than zero, the function first attempts to make the stream
       byte-oriented. Otherwise, <i>mode</i> is zero and the function does not
       alter the orientation of the stream.

       If the orientation of the stream has already been determined,
       <i>fwide</i>() shall not change it.

       The <i>fwide</i>() function shall not change the setting of <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> if
       successful.

       Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an
       application wishing to check for error situations should set
       <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i> to 0, then call <i>fwide</i>(), then check <i><a href="errno.3.html">errno</a></i>, and if it is
       non-zero, assume an error has occurred.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fwide</i>() function shall return a value greater than zero if,
       after the call, the stream has wide-orientation, a value less
       than zero if the stream has byte-orientation, or zero if the
       stream has no orientation.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fwide</i>() function may fail if:

       <b>EBADF  </b>The <i>stream</i> argument is not a valid stream.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       A call to <i>fwide</i>() with <i>mode</i> set to zero can be used to determine
       the current orientation of a stream.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
