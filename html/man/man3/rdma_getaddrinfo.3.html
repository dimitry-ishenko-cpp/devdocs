</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rdma_getaddrinfo - Provides transport independent address
       translation.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int rdma_getaddrinfo (const char *</b><i>node</i><b>, const char *</b><i>service</i><b>,</b>
       <b>const struct rdma_addrinfo *</b><i>hints</i><b>, struct rdma_addrinfo **</b><i>res</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       node        Optional, name, dotted-decimal IPv4, or IPv6 hex
                   address to resolve.

       service     Service name or port number of address.

       hints       Reference to an rdma_addrinfo structure containing
                   hints about the type of service the caller supports.

       res         A pointer to a linked list of rdma_addrinfo
                   structures containing response information.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Resolves the destination node and service address and returns
       information needed to establish communication.  Provides the RDMA
       functional equivalent to getaddrinfo.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error (errno will be set to
       indicate the failure reason), or one of the following nonzero
       error codes:

       EAI_ADDRFAMILY
                   The specified network host does not have any network
                   addresses in the requested address family.

       EAI_AGAIN   The name server returned a temporary failure
                   indication. Try again later.

       EAI_BADFLAGS
                   hints.ai_flags contains invalid flags.

       EAI_FAIL    The name server returned a permanent failure
                   indication.

       EAI_FAMILY  The requested address family is not supported.

       EAI_MEMORY  Out of memory.

       EAI_NODATA  The specified network host exists, but does not have
                   any network addresses defined.

       EAI_NONAME  The node or service is not known; or both node and
                   service are NULL.

       EAI_SERVICE The requested service is not available for the
                   requested QP type. It may be available through
                   another QP type.

       EAI_QPTYPE  The requested socket type is not supported. This
                   could occur, for example, if hints.ai_qptype and
                   hints.ai_port_space are inconsistent (e.g.,
                   IBV_QPT_UD and RDMA_PS_TCP, respectively).

       EAI_SYSTEM  Other system error, check errno for details.  The
                   gai_strerror() function translates these error codes
                   to a human readable string, suitable for error
                   reporting.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Either node, service, or hints must be provided.  If hints are
       provided, the operation will be controlled by hints.ai_flags.  If
       RAI_PASSIVE is specified, the call will resolve address
       information for use on the passive side of a connection.  If node
       is provided, rdma_getaddrinfo will attempt to resolve the RDMA
       address, route, and connection data to the given node.  The hints
       parameter, if provided, may be used to control the resulting
       output as indicated below.  If node is not given,
       rdma_getaddrinfo will attempt to resolve the RDMA addressing
       information based on the hints.ai_src_addr, hints.ai_dst_addr, or
       hints.ai_route.
</pre> <h2>
rdma_addrinfo </h2>
<pre>
       ai_flags    Hint flags that control the operation.  Supported
                   flags are:

       RAI_PASSIVE Indicates that the results will be used on the
                   passive/listening side of a connection.

       RAI_NUMERICHOST
                   If specified, then the node parameter, if provided,
                   must be a numerical network address.  This flag
                   suppresses any lengthy address resolution.

       RAI_NOROUTE If set, this flag suppresses any lengthy route
                   resolution.

       RAI_FAMILY  If set, the ai_family setting should be used as an
                   input hint for interpretting the node parameter.

       ai_family   Address family for the source and destination
                   address.  Supported families are: AF_INET, AF_INET6,
                   and AF_IB.

       ai_qp_type  Indicates the type of RDMA QP used for communication.
                   Supported types are: IBV_QPT_UD (unreliable datagram)
                   and IBV_QPT_RC (reliable connected).

       ai_port_space
                   RDMA port space in use.  Supported values are:
                   RDMA_PS_UDP, RDMA_PS_TCP, and RDMA_PS_IB.

       ai_src_len  The length of the source address referenced by
                   ai_src_addr.  This will be 0 if an appropriate source
                   address could not be discovered for a given
                   destination.

       ai_dst_len  The length of the destination address referenced by
                   ai_dst_addr.  This will be 0 if the RAI_PASSIVE flag
                   was specified as part of the hints.

       ai_src_addr If provided, the address for the local RDMA device.

       ai_dst_addr If provided, the address for the destination RDMA
                   device.

       ai_src_canonname
                   The canonical for the source.

       ai_dst_canonname
                   The canonical for the destination.

       ai_route_len
                   Size of the routing information buffer referenced by
                   ai_route.  This will be 0 if the underlying transport
                   does not require routing data, or none could be
                   resolved.

       ai_route    Routing information for RDMA transports that require
                   routing data as part of connection establishment.
                   The format of the routing data depends on the
                   underlying transport.  If Infiniband transports are
                   used, ai_route will reference an array of struct
                   ibv_path_data on output, if routing data is
                   available.  Routing paths may be restricted by
                   setting desired routing data fields on input to
                   rdma_getaddrinfo.  For Infiniband, hints.ai_route may
                   reference an array of struct ibv_path_record or
                   struct ibv_path_data on input.

       ai_connect_len
                   Size of connection information referenced by
                   ai_connect.  This will be 0 if the underlying
                   transport does not require additional connection
                   information.

       ai_connect  Data exchanged as part of the connection
                   establishment process.  If provided, ai_connect data
                   must be transferred as private data, with any user
                   supplied private data following it.

       ai_next     Pointer to the next rdma_addrinfo structure in the
                   list.  Will be NULL if no more structures exist.
