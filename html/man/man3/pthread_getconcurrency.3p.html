PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pthread_getconcurrency, pthread_setconcurrency — get and set the
       level of concurrency
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

       int pthread_getconcurrency(void);
       int pthread_setconcurrency(int <i>new_level</i>);
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Unbound threads in a process may or may not be required to be
       simultaneously active. By default, the threads implementation
       ensures that a sufficient number of threads are active so that
       the process can continue to make progress. While this conserves
       system resources, it may not produce the most effective level of
       concurrency.

       The <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() function allows an application to
       inform the threads implementation of its desired concurrency
       level, <i>new_level</i>.  The actual level of concurrency provided by
       the implementation as a result of this function call is
       unspecified.

       If <i>new_level</i> is zero, it causes the implementation to maintain
       the concurrency level at its discretion as if
       <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() had never been called.

       The <i>pthread_getconcurrency</i>() function shall return the value set
       by a previous call to the <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() function. If
       the <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() function was not previously called,
       this function shall return zero to indicate that the
       implementation is maintaining the concurrency level.

       A call to <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() shall inform the
       implementation of its desired concurrency level.  The
       implementation shall use this as a hint, not a requirement.

       If an implementation does not support multiplexing of user
       threads on top of several kernel-scheduled entities, the
       <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() and <i>pthread_getconcurrency</i>() functions
       are provided for source code compatibility but they shall have no
       effect when called. To maintain the function semantics, the
       <i>new_level</i> parameter is saved when <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() is
       called so that a subsequent call to <i>pthread_getconcurrency</i>()
       shall return the same value.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       If successful, the <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() function shall return
       zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
       the error.

       The <i>pthread_getconcurrency</i>() function shall always return the
       concurrency level set by a previous call to
       <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>().  If the <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>()
       function has never been called, <i>pthread_getconcurrency</i>() shall
       return zero.
</pre> <h2>
ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL </b>The value specified by <i>new_level</i> is negative.

       <b>EAGAIN </b>The value specified by <i>new_level</i> would cause a system
              resource to be exceeded.

       The <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() function shall not return an error
       code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Application developers should note that an implementation can
       always ignore any calls to <i>pthread_setconcurrency</i>() and return a
       constant for <i>pthread_getconcurrency</i>().  For this reason, it is
       not recommended that portable applications use this function.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       These functions may be removed in a future version.
