DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>bkgdset</b>
       The <b>bkgdset </b>and <b>wbkgdset </b>routines set the <i>background</i> for a
       window.  A window's background is a <b>chtype </b>consisting of any
       combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and a character:

       •   The attribute part of the background is combined (OR'ed) with
           all non-blank characters that are written into the window
           with <b>waddch</b>.

       •   Both the character and attribute parts of the background are
           combined with blank characters that are written into the
           window.

       The background becomes a property of each character and moves
       with the character through any scrolling and insert/delete
       line/character operations.

       To the extent possible on a particular terminal, the attribute
       part of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of
       the character put on the screen.

   <b>bkgd</b>
       The <b>bkgd </b>and <b>wbkgd </b>functions set the background property of the
       current or specified window and then apply this setting to every
       character position in that window.  According to X/Open Curses,
       it should do this:

       •   The rendition of every character on the screen is changed to
           the new background rendition.

       •   Wherever the former background character appears, it is
           changed to the new background character.

       Neither X/Open Curses nor the SVr4 manual pages give details
       about the way the rendition of characters on the screen is
       updated when <b>bkgd </b>or <b>wbkgd </b>is used to change the background
       character.

       This implementation, like SVr4 curses, does not store the
       background and window attribute contributions to each cell
       separately.  It updates the rendition by comparing the character,
       non-color attributes and colors contained in the background.  For
       each cell in the window, whether or not it is blank:

       •   The library first compares the <i>character</i>, and if it matches
           the current character part of the background, it replaces
           that with the new background character.

           When <b>bkgdset </b>is used to set the background character, that
           does not update each cell in the window.  A subsequent call
           to <b>bkgd </b>will only modify the <i>character</i> in cells which match
           the current background character.

       •   The library then checks if the cell uses color, i.e., its
           color pair value is nonzero.  If not, it simply replaces the
           attributes and color pair in the cell with those from the new
           background character.

       •   If the cell uses color, and that matches the color in the
           current background, the library removes attributes which may
           have come from the current background and adds attributes
           from the new background.  It finishes by setting the cell to
           use the color from the new background.

       •   If the cell uses color, and that does not match the color in
           the current background, the library updates only the non-
           color attributes, first removing those which may have come
           from the current background, and then adding attributes from
           the new background.

       If the background's character value is zero (0), a space is
       assumed.

       If the terminal does not support color, or if color has not been
       started with <b>start_color</b>, the new background character's color
       attribute will be ignored.

   <b>getbkgd</b>
       The <b>getbkgd </b>function returns the given window's current
       background character/attribute pair.

RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue
       4.  It specifies that <b>bkgd </b>and <b>wbkgd </b>return <b>ERR </b>on failure, but
       gives no failure conditions.

       The routines <b>bkgd </b>and <b>wbkgd </b>return the integer <b>OK</b>, unless the
       library has not been initialized.

       In contrast, the SVr4.0 manual says <b>bkgd </b>and <b>wbkgd </b>may return <b>OK</b>
       "or a non-negative integer if <b>immedok </b>is set", which refers to
       the return value from <b>wrefresh </b>(used to implement the immediate
       repainting).  The SVr4 curses <b>wrefresh </b>returns the number of
       characters written to the screen during the refresh.  This
       implementation does not do that.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that <b>bkgdset </b>and <b>bkgd </b>may be macros.

       X/Open Curses mentions that the character part of the background
       must be a single-byte value.  This implementation, like SVr4,
       checks to ensure that, and will reuse the old background
       character if the check fails.
