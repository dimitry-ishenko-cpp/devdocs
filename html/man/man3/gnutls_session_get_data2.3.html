NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gnutls_session_get_data2 - API function
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;gnutls/gnutls.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int gnutls_session_get_data2(gnutls_session_t </b><i>session</i><b>,</b>
       <b>gnutls_datum_t * </b><i>data</i><b>);</b>
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       gnutls_session_t session
                   is a <b>gnutls_session_t </b>type.

       gnutls_datum_t * data
                   is a pointer to a datum that will hold the session.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Returns necessary parameters to support resumption. The client
       should call this function and store the returned session data. A
       session can be resumed later by calling <b>gnutls_session_set_data()</b>
       with the returned data. Note that under TLS 1.3, it is
       recommended for clients to use session parameters only once, to
       prevent passive-observers from correlating the different
       connections.

       The returned  <i>data</i> are allocated and must be released using
       <b>gnutls_free()</b>.

       This function will fail if called prior to handshake completion.
       In case of false start TLS, the handshake completes only after
       data have been successfully received from the peer.

       Under TLS1.3 session resumption is possible only after a session
       ticket is received by the client. To ensure that such a ticket
       has been received use <b>gnutls_session_get_flags() </b>and check for
       flag <b>GNUTLS_SFLAGS_SESSION_TICKET</b>; if this flag is not set, this
       function will wait for a new ticket within an estimated
       roundtrip, and if not received will return dummy data which
       cannot lead to resumption.

       To get notified when new tickets are received by the server use
       <b>gnutls_handshake_set_hook_function() </b>to wait for
       <b>GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_NEW_SESSION_TICKET </b>messages. Each call of
       <b>gnutls_session_get_data2() </b>after a ticket is received, will
       return session resumption data corresponding to the last received
       ticket.

       Note that this function under TLS1.3 requires a callback to be
       set with <b>gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function() </b>for
       successful operation. There was a bug before 3.6.10 which could
       make this function fail if that callback was not set. On later
       versions if not set, the function will return a successful error
       code, but will return dummy data that cannot lead to a
       resumption.
</pre> <h2>
RETURNS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, <b>GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS </b>(0) is returned, otherwise an error
       code is returned.
