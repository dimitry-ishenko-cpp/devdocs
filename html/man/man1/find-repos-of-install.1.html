</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--version</b>
              Report program version and exit.

       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Display a help message, and then quit.

       <b>--repoid=REPOID</b>
              Specify repo ids to query, can be specified multiple times
              (default is all enabled).

       <b>--enablerepo=ENABLEREPOS</b>
              In addition to the default set, query the given additional
              repository, even if it is disabled in YUM configuration.
              Can be used multiple times.

       <b>--disablerepo=DISABLEREPOS</b>
              Do not query the given repository, even if it is enabled
              in YUM configuration.  Can be used multiple times.

       <b>--repofrompath=REPOID,PATH/URL</b>
              Specify a path or url to a repository (same path as in a
              baseurl) to add to the repositories for this query. This
              option can be used multiple times. If you want to view
              only the pkgs from this repository combine this with

              makecache".

              Use a temp dir for storing/accessing yum-cache.
