NAME </h2>
<pre>
       repodiff - list differences between two or more Yum repositories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>repodiff </b>--old=old_repo_baseurl --new=new_repo_baseurl
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>repodiff </b>is a program which will list differences between two
       sets of repositories.  <b>Note </b>that by default only source packages
       are compared.
</pre> <h2>
GENERAL OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--old, -o</b>
              Add a repo. as an old repo. Note that if you prefix the
              url with "mirror:" then the following url is treated as a
              mirror and not a baseurl.

       <b>--new, -n</b>
              Add a repo. as an new repo. Note that if you prefix the
              url with "mirror:" then the following url is treated as a
              mirror and not a baseurl.

       <b>--archlist, -a</b>
              Add architectures to change the default from just
              comparing source packages.  Note that if you want the same
              as a native "x86_64" architecture machine you just need to
              pass "x86_64" (this is different from earlier versions
              where you needed to specify
              "x86_64,athlon,i686,i586,i486,i386,noarch" and you still
              got "src").

       <b>--size, -s</b>
              Output additional data about the size of the changes.

       <b>--compare-arch</b>
              Normally packages are just compared based on their name,
              this flag makes the comparison also use the arch. So
              foo.i386 and foo.x86_64 are different.

       <b>--simple</b>
              Output a simple one line message for modified packages.

       <b>--downgrade</b>
              Split the data for modified packages between upgraded and
              downgraded packages.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Compare source pkgs in two local repos:
              <b>repodiff --old=/tmp/repo-old --new=/tmp/repo-new</b>

       Compare x86_64 compat. binary pkgs in two remote repos, and two
       local one:
              <b>repodiff -a x86_64 --old=http://example.com/repo1-old</b>
              <b>--old=/tmp/repo-old --new=http://example.com/repo1-new</b>
              <b>--new=/tmp/repo-new</b>

       Compare x86_64 compat. binary pkgs, but also compare arch:
              <b>repodiff -a x86_64 --compare-arch</b>
              <b>--old=http://example.com/repo1-old --old=/tmp/repo-old</b>
              <b>--new=http://example.com/repo1-new --new=/tmp/repo-new</b>

       Compare two releases of Fedora (15 =&gt; 16):
              <b>repodiff</b>
              <b>--old='mirror:https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=fedora-</b>
              <b>source-15&amp;arch=i386'</b>
              <b>--new='mirror:https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=fedora-</b>
              <b>source-16&amp;arch=i386' --size --simple --downgrade</b>
