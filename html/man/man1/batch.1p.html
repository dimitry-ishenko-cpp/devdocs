PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       batch — schedule commands to be executed in a batch queue
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>batch</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>batch</i> utility shall read commands from standard input and
       schedule them for execution in a batch queue. It shall be the
       equivalent of the command:

           at -q b -m now

       where queue <i>b</i> is a special <i>at</i> queue, specifically for batch jobs.
       Batch jobs shall be submitted to the batch queue with no time
       constraints and shall be run by the system using algorithms,
       based on unspecified factors, that may vary with each invocation
       of <i>batch</i>.

       Users shall be permitted to use <i>batch</i> if their name appears in
       the file <b>at.allow </b>which is located in an implementation-defined
       directory.  If that file does not exist, the file <b>at.deny</b>, which
       is located in an implementation-defined directory, shall be
       checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access to
       <i>batch</i>.  If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate
       privileges shall be allowed to submit a job. If only <b>at.deny</b>
       exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The
       <b>at.allow </b>and <b>at.deny </b>files shall consist of one user name per
       line.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be a text file consisting of commands
       acceptable to the shell command language described in <i>Chapter 2</i>,
       <i>Shell Command Language</i>.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The text files <b>at.allow </b>and <b>at.deny</b>, which are located in an
       implementation-defined directory, shall contain zero or more user
       names, one per line, of users who are, respectively, authorized
       or denied access to the <i>at</i> and <i>batch</i> utilities.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>batch</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error and informative messages written to
                 standard output.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Determine the format and contents for date and time
                 strings written by <i>batch</i>.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>SHELL</i>     Determine the name of a command interpreter to be used
                 to invoke the at-job. If the variable is unset or null,
                 <i>sh</i> shall be used. If it is set to a value other than a
                 name for <i>sh</i>, the implementation shall do one of the
                 following: use that shell; use <i>sh</i>; use the login shell
                 from the user database; any of the preceding
                 accompanied by a warning diagnostic about which was
                 chosen.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone. The job shall be submitted for
                 execution at the time specified by <i>timespec</i> or <b>-t </b><i>time</i>
                 relative to the timezone specified by the <i>TZ</i> variable.
                 If <i>timespec</i> specifies a timezone, it overrides <i>TZ</i>.  If
                 <i>timespec</i> does not specify a timezone and <i>TZ</i> is unset or
                 null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       When standard input is a terminal, prompts of unspecified format
       for each line of the user input described in the STDIN section
       may be written to standard output.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The following shall be written to standard error when a job has
       been successfully submitted:

           "job %s at %s\n", <i>at_job_id</i>, &lt;<i>date</i>&gt;

       where <i>date</i> shall be equivalent in format to the output of:

           date +"%a %b %e %T %Y"

       The date and time written shall be adjusted so that they appear
       in the timezone of the user (as determined by the <i>TZ</i> variable).

       Neither this, nor warning messages concerning the selection of
       the command interpreter, are considered a diagnostic that changes
       the exit status.

       Diagnostic messages, if any, shall be written to standard error.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The job shall not be scheduled.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       It may be useful to redirect standard output within the specified
       commands.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. This sequence can be used at a terminal:

               batch
               sort &lt; file &gt;outfile
               EOT

        2. This sequence, which demonstrates redirecting standard error
           to a pipe, is useful in a command procedure (the sequence of
           output redirection specifications is significant):

               batch &lt;&lt;!
               diff file1 file2 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;outfile | mailx mygroup
               !
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Early proposals described <i>batch</i> in a manner totally separated
       from <i>at</i>, even though the historical model treated it almost as a
       synonym for <i>at</i> <b>-qb</b>.  A number of features were added to list and
       control batch work separately from those in <i>at</i>.  Upon further
       reflection, it was decided that the benefit of this did not merit
       the change to the historical interface.

       The <b>-m </b>option was included on the equivalent <i>at</i> command because
       it is historical practice to mail results to the submitter, even
       if all job-produced output is redirected. As explained in the
       RATIONALE for <i>at</i>, the <b>now </b>keyword submits the job for immediate
       execution (after scheduling delays), despite some historical
       systems where <i>at</i> <b>now </b>would have been considered an error.
