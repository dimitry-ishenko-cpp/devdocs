NAME </h2>
<pre>
       perf-annotate - Read perf.data (created by perf record) and
       display annotated code
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>perf annotate</i> [-i &lt;file&gt; | --input=file] [symbol_name]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This command reads the input file and displays an annotated
       version of the code. If the object file has debug symbols then
       the source code will be displayed alongside assembly code.

       If there is no debug info in the object, then annotated assembly
       is displayed.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -i, --input=&lt;file&gt;
           Input file name. (default: perf.data unless stdin is a fifo)

       -d, --dsos=&lt;dso[,dso...]&gt;
           Only consider symbols in these dsos.

       -s, --symbol=&lt;symbol&gt;
           Symbol to annotate.

       -f, --force
           Don’t do ownership validation.

       -v, --verbose
           Be more verbose. (Show symbol address, etc)

       -q, --quiet
           Do not show any warnings or messages. (Suppress -v)

       -n, --show-nr-samples
           Show the number of samples for each symbol

       -D, --dump-raw-trace
           Dump raw trace in ASCII.

       -k, --vmlinux=&lt;file&gt;
           vmlinux pathname.

       --ignore-vmlinux
           Ignore vmlinux files.

       --itrace
           Options for decoding instruction tracing data. The options
           are:

               i       synthesize instructions events
               y       synthesize cycles events
               b       synthesize branches events (branch misses for Arm SPE)
               c       synthesize branches events (calls only)
               r       synthesize branches events (returns only)
               x       synthesize transactions events
               w       synthesize ptwrite events
               p       synthesize power events (incl. PSB events for Intel PT)
               o       synthesize other events recorded due to the use
                       of aux-output (refer to perf record)
               I       synthesize interrupt or similar (asynchronous) events
                       (e.g. Intel PT Event Trace)
               e       synthesize error events
               d       create a debug log
               f       synthesize first level cache events
               m       synthesize last level cache events
               M       synthesize memory events
               t       synthesize TLB events
               a       synthesize remote access events
               g       synthesize a call chain (use with i or x)
               G       synthesize a call chain on existing event records
               l       synthesize last branch entries (use with i or x)
               L       synthesize last branch entries on existing event records
               s       skip initial number of events
               q       quicker (less detailed) decoding
               A       approximate IPC
               Z       prefer to ignore timestamps (so-called "timeless" decoding)
               T       use the timestamp trace as kernel time

               The default is all events i.e. the same as --itrace=iybxwpe,
               except for perf script where it is --itrace=ce

               In addition, the period (default 100000, except for perf script where it is 1)
               for instructions events can be specified in units of:

               i       instructions
               t       ticks
               ms      milliseconds
               us      microseconds
               ns      nanoseconds (default)

               Also the call chain size (default 16, max. 1024) for instructions or
               transactions events can be specified.

               Also the number of last branch entries (default 64, max. 1024) for
               instructions or transactions events can be specified.

               Similar to options g and l, size may also be specified for options G and L.
               On x86, note that G and L work poorly when data has been recorded with
               large PEBS. Refer linkperf:perf-intel-pt[1] man page for details.

               It is also possible to skip events generated (instructions, branches, transactions,
               ptwrite, power) at the beginning. This is useful to ignore initialization code.

               --itrace=i0nss1000000

               skips the first million instructions.

               The 'e' option may be followed by flags which affect what errors will or
               will not be reported. Each flag must be preceded by either '+' or '-'.
               The flags are:
                       o       overflow
                       l       trace data lost

               If supported, the 'd' option may be followed by flags which affect what
               debug messages will or will not be logged. Each flag must be preceded
               by either '+' or '-'. The flags are:
                       a       all perf events
                       e       output only on errors (size configurable - see linkperf:perf-config[1])
                       o       output to stdout

               If supported, the 'q' option may be repeated to increase the effect.

               To disable decoding entirely, use --no-itrace.

       -m, --modules
           Load module symbols. WARNING: use only with -k and LIVE
           kernel.

       -l, --print-line
           Print matching source lines (may be slow).

       -P, --full-paths
           Don’t shorten the displayed pathnames.

       --stdio
           Use the stdio interface.

       --stdio2
           Use the stdio2 interface, non-interactive, uses the TUI
           formatting.

       --stdio-color=&lt;mode&gt;
           <i>always</i>, <i>never</i> or <i>auto</i>, allowing configuring color output via
           the command line, in addition to via "color.ui" .perfconfig.
           Use <i>--stdio-color always</i> to generate color even when
           redirecting to a pipe or file. Using just <i>--stdio-color</i> is
           equivalent to using <i>always</i>.

       --tui
           Use the TUI interface. Use of --tui requires a tty, if one is
           not present, as when piping to other commands, the stdio
           interface is used. This interfaces starts by centering on the
           line with more samples, TAB/UNTAB cycles through the lines
           with more samples.

       --gtk
           Use the GTK interface.

       -C, --cpu=&lt;cpu&gt;
           Only report samples for the list of CPUs provided. Multiple
           CPUs can be provided as a comma-separated list with no space:
           0,1. Ranges of CPUs are specified with -: 0-2. Default is to
           report samples on all CPUs.

       --asm-raw
           Show raw instruction encoding of assembly instructions.

       --show-total-period
           Show a column with the sum of periods.

       --source
           Interleave source code with assembly code. Enabled by
           default, disable with --no-source.

       --symfs=&lt;directory&gt;
           Look for files with symbols relative to this directory.

       -M, --disassembler-style=
           Set disassembler style for objdump.

       --addr2line=&lt;path&gt;
           Path to addr2line binary.

       --objdump=&lt;path&gt;
           Path to objdump binary.

       --prefix=PREFIX, --prefix-strip=N
           Remove first N entries from source file path names in
           executables and add PREFIX. This allows to display source
           code compiled on systems with different file system layout.

       --skip-missing
           Skip symbols that cannot be annotated.

       --group
           Show event group information together

       --demangle
           Demangle symbol names to human readable form. It’s enabled by
           default, disable with --no-demangle.

       --demangle-kernel
           Demangle kernel symbol names to human readable form (for C++
           kernels).

       --percent-type
           Set annotation percent type from following choices:
           global-period, local-period, global-hits, local-hits

               The local/global keywords set if the percentage is computed
               in the scope of the function (local) or the whole data (global).
               The period/hits keywords set the base the percentage is computed
               on - the samples period or the number of samples (hits).

       --percent-limit
           Do not show functions which have an overhead under that
           percent on stdio or stdio2 (Default: 0). Note that this is
           about selection of functions to display, not about lines
           within the function.

       --data-type[=TYPE_NAME]
           Display data type annotation instead of code. It infers data
           type of samples (if they are memory accessing instructions)
           using DWARF debug information. It can take an optional
           argument of data type name. In that case it’d show annotation
           for the type only, otherwise it’d show all data types it
           finds.

       --type-stat
           Show stats for the data type annotation.
