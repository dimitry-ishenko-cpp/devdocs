NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-query - a tool to query the dpkg database
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-query </b>[<i>option</i>...] <i>command</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-query </b>is a tool to show information about packages listed in
       the <b>dpkg </b>database.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list </b>[<i>package-name-pattern</i>...]
           List all known packages matching one or more patterns,
           regardless of their status, which includes any real or
           virtual package referenced in any dependency relationship
           field (such as <b>Breaks</b>, <b>Enhances</b>, etc.).  If no <i>package-name-</i>
           <i>pattern</i> is given, list all packages in
           <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/status</i>, excluding the ones marked as
           not-installed (i.e.  those which have been previously
           purged).  Normal shell wildcard characters are allowed in
           <i>package-name-pattern</i>.  Please note you will probably have to
           quote <i>package-name-pattern</i> to prevent the shell from
           performing filename expansion.  For example this will list
           all package names starting with “libc6”:

            dpkg-query -l 'libc6*'

           The first three columns of the output show the desired
           action, the package status, and errors, in that order.

           Desired action:

           u = Unknown
           i = Install
           h = Hold
           r = Remove
           p = Purge

           Package status:

           n = Not-installed
           c = Config-files
           H = Half-installed
           U = Unpacked
           F = Half-configured
           W = Triggers-awaiting
           t = Triggers-pending
           i = Installed

           Error flags:

           &lt;empty&gt; = (none)
           R = Reinst-required

           An uppercase status or error letter indicates the package is
           likely to cause severe problems.  Please refer to <a href="dpkg.1.html">dpkg(1)</a> for
           information about the above states and flags.

           The output format of this option is not configurable, but
           varies automatically to fit the terminal width.  It is
           intended for human readers, and is not easily machine-
           readable.  See <b>-W </b>(<b>--show</b>) and <b>--showformat </b>for a way to
           configure the output format.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--show </b>[<i>package-name-pattern</i>...]
           Just like the <b>--list </b>option this will list all packages
           matching the given patterns.  However the output can be
           customized using the <b>--showformat </b>option.

           The default output format gives one line per matching
           package, each line consisting of the package name and its
           installed version, separated by a tab.  The package name will
           be architecture qualified for packages with a <b>Multi-Arch</b>
           field with the value <b>same </b>or with a foreign architecture,
           which is an architecture that is neither the native one nor
           <b>all</b>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--status </b>[<i>package-name</i>...]
           Report status of specified packages.  This just displays the
           entry in the installed package status database.  If no
           <i>package-name</i> is specified it will display all package entries
           in the status database (since dpkg 1.19.1).  When multiple
           <i>package-name</i> entries are listed, the requested status entries
           are separated by an empty line, with the same order as
           specified on the argument list.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--listfiles </b><i>package-name</i>...
           List files installed to your system from <i>package-name</i>.  When
           multiple <i>package-name</i>s are listed, the requested lists of
           files are separated by an empty line, with the same order as
           specified on the argument list.

           Each file diversion is printed on its own line after its
           diverted file, prefixed with one of the following localized
           strings:

             locally diverted to: <i>diverted-to</i>
             package diverts others to: <i>diverted-to</i>
             diverted by <i>pkg</i> to: <i>diverted-to</i>

           <b>Hint</b>: When machine parsing the output, it is customary to set
           the locale to <b>C.UTF-8 </b>to get reproducible results.  On some
           systems this might also require adapting the <b>LANGUAGE</b>
           environment variable appropriately if it is already set (see
           <a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale(7)</a>).

           This command will not list extra files created by maintainer
           scripts, nor will it list alternatives.

       <b>--control-list </b><i>package-name</i>
           List control files installed to your system from <i>package-name</i>
           (since dpkg 1.16.5).  These can be used as input arguments to
           <b>--control-show</b>.

       <b>--control-show </b><i>package-name control-file</i>
           Print the <i>control-file</i> installed to your system from <i>package-</i>
           <i>name</i> to the standard output (since dpkg 1.16.5).

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--control-path </b><i>package-name</i> [<i>control-file</i>]
           List paths for control files installed to your system from
           <i>package-name</i> (since dpkg 1.15.4).  If <i>control-file</i> is
           specified then only list the path for that control file if it
           is present.

           <b>Warning</b>: this command is deprecated as it gives direct access
           to the internal dpkg database, please switch to use
           <b>--control-list </b>and <b>--control-show </b>instead for all cases where
           those commands might give the same end result.  Although, as
           long as there is still at least one case where this command
           is needed (i.e. when having to remove a damaging postrm
           maintainer script), and while there is no good solution for
           that, this command will not get removed.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--search </b><i>filename-search-pattern</i>...
           Search for packages that own files corresponding to the given
           patterns.  Standard shell wildcard characters can be used in
           the pattern, where asterisk (<b>*</b>) and question mark (<b>?</b>) will
           match a slash, and backslash (<b>\</b>) will be used as an escape
           character.

           If the first character in the <i>filename-search-pattern</i> is none
           of ‘<b>*[?/</b>’ then it will be considered a substring match and
           will be implicitly surrounded by ‘<b>*</b>’ (as in <b>*</b><i>filename-search-</i>
           <i>pattern</i><b>*</b>).  If the subsequent string contains any of ‘<b>*[?\</b>’,
           then it will handled like a glob pattern, otherwise any
           trailing ‘<b>/</b>’ or ‘<b>/.</b>’ will be removed and a literal path
           lookup will be performed.

           This command will not list extra files created by maintainer
           scripts, nor will it list alternatives.

           The output format consists of one line per matching pattern,
           with a list of packages owning the pathname separated by a
           comma (U+002C ‘<b>,</b>’) and a space (U+0020 ‘ ’), followed by a
           colon (U+003A ‘<b>:</b>’) and a space, followed by the pathname.  As
           in:

             pkgname1, pkgname2: pathname1
             pkgname3: pathname2

           File diversions are printed with the following localized
           strings:

             diversion by <i>pkgname</i> from: <i>diverted-from</i>
             diversion by <i>pkgname</i> to: <i>diverted-to</i>

           or for local diversions:

             local diversion from: <i>diverted-from</i>
             local diversion to: <i>diverted-to</i>

           <b>Hint</b>: When machine parsing the output, it is customary to set
           the locale to <b>C.UTF-8 </b>to get reproducible results.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print-avail </b>[<i>package-name</i>...]
           Display details about packages, as found in
           <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/available</i>.  If no <i>package-name</i> is
           specified, it will display all package entries in the
           <i>available</i> database (since dpkg 1.19.1).  When multiple
           <i>package-name</i> are listed, the requested <i>available</i> entries are
           separated by an empty line, with the same order as specified
           on the argument list.

           Users of APT-based frontends should use <b>apt show </b><i>package-name</i>
           instead as the <i>available</i> file is only kept up-to-date when
           using <b>dselect</b>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--admindir=</b><i>dir</i>
           Change the location of the <b>dpkg </b>database.  The default
           location is <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</i>.

       <b>--root=</b><i>directory</i>
           Set the root directory to <i>directory</i>, which sets the
           administrative directory to
           «<i>directory</i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>--load-avail</b>
           Also load the available file when using the <b>--show </b>and <b>--list</b>
           commands, which now default to only querying the status file
           (since dpkg 1.16.2).

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Disables the use of any pager when showing information (since
           dpkg 1.19.2).

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--showformat=</b><i>format</i>
           This option is used to specify the format of the output
           <b>--show </b>will produce (short option since dpkg 1.13.1).  The
           format is a string that will be output for each package
           listed.

           In the format string, “<b>\</b>” introduces escapes:

           <b>\n </b>newline
           <b>\r </b>carriage return
           <b>\t </b>tab

           “<b>\</b>” before any other character suppresses any special meaning
           of the following character, which is useful for “<b>\</b>” and “<b>$</b>”.

           Package information can be included by inserting variable
           references to package fields using the syntax
           “<b>${</b><i>field</i>[<b>;</b><i>width</i>]<b>}</b>”.  Fields are printed right-aligned unless
           the width is negative in which case left alignment will be
           used.  The following <i>field</i>s are recognized but they are not
           necessarily available in the status file (only internal
           fields or fields stored in the binary package end up in it):

           <b>Version</b>

           The following are virtual fields, generated by <b>dpkg-query</b>
           from values from other fields (note that these do not use
           valid names for fields in control files):

           <b>binary:Package</b>
               It contains the binary package name with a possible
               architecture qualifier like “libc6:amd64” (since dpkg
               1.16.2).  An architecture qualifier will be present to
               make the package name unambiguous, for packages with a
               <b>Multi-Arch </b>field with the value <b>same </b>or with a foreign
               architecture, which is an architecture that is neither
               the native one nor <b>all</b>.

           <b>binary:Synopsis</b>
               It contains the package short description (since dpkg
               1.19.1).

           <b>binary:Summary</b>
               This is an alias for <b>binary:Synopsis </b>(since dpkg 1.16.2).

           <b>db:Status-Abbrev</b>
               It contains the abbreviated package status (as three
               characters), such as “ii ” or “iHR” (since dpkg 1.16.2).
               See the <b>--list </b>command description for more details.

           <b>db:Status-Want</b>
               It contains the package wanted status, part of the Status
               field (since dpkg 1.17.11).

           <b>db:Status-Status</b>
               It contains the package status word, part of the Status
               field (since dpkg 1.17.11).

           <b>db:Status-Eflag</b>
               It contains the package status error flag, part of the
               Status field (since dpkg 1.17.11).

           <b>db-fsys:Files</b>
               It contains the list of the package filesystem entries
               separated by newlines (since dpkg 1.19.3).

           <b>db-fsys:Last-Modified</b>
               It contains the timestamp in seconds of the last time the
               package filesystem entries were modified (since dpkg
               1.19.3).

           <b>source:Package</b>
               It contains the source package name for this binary
               package (since dpkg 1.16.2).

           <b>source:Version</b>
               It contains the source package version for this binary
               package (since dpkg 1.16.2)

           <b>source:Upstream-Version</b>
               It contains the source package upstream version for this
               binary package (since dpkg 1.18.16)

           The default format string is
           “<b>${binary:Package}\t${Version}\n</b>”.  Actually, all other
           fields found in the status file (i.e. user defined fields)
           can be requested, too.  They will be printed as-is, though,
           no conversion nor error checking is done on them.  To get the
           name of the <b>dpkg </b>maintainer and the installed version, you
           could run:

            dpkg-query -f='${binary:Package} ${Version}\t${Maintainer}\n' \
             -W dpkg
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0   </b>The requested query was successfully performed.

       <b>1   </b>The requested query failed either fully or partially, due to
           no file or package being found (except for <b>--control-path</b>,
           <b>--control-list </b>and <b>--control-show </b>were such errors are
           fatal).

       <b>2   </b>Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
           usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to
           the database, memory allocations, etc.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
   <b>External environment</b>
       <b>SHELL</b>
           Sets the program to execute when spawning a command via a
           shell (since dpkg 1.19.2).

       <b>PAGER</b>
       <b>DPKG_PAGER</b>
           Sets the pager command to use (since dpkg 1.19.1), which will
           be executed with «<b>$SHELL -c</b>».  If <b>SHELL </b>is not set, «<b>sh</b>» will
           be used instead.  The <b>DPKG_PAGER </b>overrides the <b>PAGER</b>
           environment variable (since dpkg 1.19.2).

       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
           If set and the <b>--root </b>option has not been specified, it will
           be used as the filesystem root directory (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR</b>
           If set and the <b>--admindir </b>option has not been specified, it
           will be used as the <b>dpkg </b>data directory.

       <b>DPKG_DEBUG</b>
           Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
           The currently accepted flags are described in the <b>dpkg</b>
           <b>--debug </b>option, but not all these flags might have an effect
           on this program.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.22.7).  The accepted values are:
           <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>(default).

   <b>Internal environment</b>
       <b>LESS</b>
           Defined by <b>dpkg-query </b>to “<b>-FRSXMQ</b>”, if not already set, when
           spawning a pager (since dpkg 1.19.2).  To change the default
           behavior, this variable can be preset to some other value
           including an empty string, or the <b>PAGER </b>or <b>DPKG_PAGER</b>
           variables can be set to disable specific options with «<b>-+</b>»,
           for example <b>DPKG_PAGER="less -+F"</b>.
</pre> <h2>
SECURITY </h2>
<pre>
       Query operations should never require root, and delegating their
       execution to unprivileged users via some gain-root command can
       have security implications (such as privilege escalation), for
       example when a pager is automatically invoked by the tool.
