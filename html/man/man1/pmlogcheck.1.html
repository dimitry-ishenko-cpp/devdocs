</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogcheck </b>- checks for invalid data in a PCP archive
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogcheck </b>[<b>-lmvwz?</b>]  [<b>-n </b><i>pmnsfile</i>] [<b>-S </b><i>start</i>] [<b>-T </b><i>finish</i>] [<b>-Z</b>
       <i>timezone</i>] <i>archive</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogcheck </b>prints information about the nature of any invalid
       data which it detects in the files of a PCP archive.

       The archive has the base name <i>archive</i> and must have been
       previously created using <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--label</b>
            Print the archive label, showing the archive format version,
            the time and date for the start and (current) end of the
            archive, and the host from which the performance metrics
            values were collected.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--metadataonly</b>
            Skip <b>Pass 3 </b>(see below) and only check the archive meta
            data.  This can run substantially faster in cases where the
            volume data doesn't need to be checked, especially on
            archives with compressed data volume(s).

       <b>-n </b><i>pmnsfile</i>, <b>--namespace</b>=<i>pmnsfile</i>
            Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (<a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>)
            from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       <b>-S </b><i>starttime</i>, <b>--start</b>=<i>starttime</i>
            Specify the <i>starttime</i> of time window over which metrics
            should be checked in Pass 3 (see below).  Refer to
            <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for a complete description of the syntax for
            <i>starttime</i>.

       <b>-T </b><i>endtime</i>, <b>--finish</b>=<i>endtime</i>
            Specify the <i>endtime</i> of time window over which metrics should
            be checked in Pass 3 (see below).  Refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for
            a complete description of the syntax for <i>endtime</i>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            Enable verbose mode.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--nowrap</b>
            Suppress reporting of counter wraps.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--hostzone</b>
            Use the local timezone of the host that is the source of the
            performance metrics archive.  The default is to use the
            timezone of the local host.

       <b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i>, <b>--timezone</b>=<i>timezone</i>
            Use <i>timezone</i> for the date and time.  <i>Timezone</i> is in the
            format of the environment variable <b>TZ </b>as described in
            <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.  The default is to use the timezone of the local
            host.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
OPERATION </h2>
<pre>
       The checking proceeds in a number of passes, each designed to
       validate progressively more complex semantic relationships
       between the information in a PCP archive.

   <b>Pass 0</b>
       Each physical file of the PCP archive is processed to ensure the
       label records are valid and consistent, and that each file
       contains an integral number of physical records with correct
       header and trailer fields.

       Any errors at this stage are usually fatal.  The PCP archive is
       probably damaged beyond repair, and no more passes of <b>pmlogcheck</b>
       are attempted.

   <b>Pass 1</b>
       Validates the integrity of the temporal index, usually
       <i>archive</i><b>.index</b>.

       As the temporal index is (strictly speaking) optional, errors at
       this stage are handled by marking the index as bad and ignoring
       it for the remainder of the <b>pmlogcheck </b>passes.

       Permanent repair can be achieved by removing the temporal index
       file and then making a copy of the PCP archive using
       <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> or <a href="pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a>.  This will create a new
       temporal index for the copied archive as a side-effect.

   <b>Pass 2</b>
       Validates the integrity of the metadata file, usually
       <i>archive</i><b>.meta</b>.

   <b>Pass 3</b>
       Validates the integrity of each of the volumes of the PCP
       archive, usually <i>archive</i><b>.0</b>, <i>archive</i><b>.1</b>, etc.

       There is some basic integrity checks to ensure the encoding of
       values for each metric remains consistent and the values are well
       formed across all the observations in the archive.

       Also the timestamps for the observations are expected to be
       monotonically increasing as the archive is traversed.

       Additional attention is given to counter metrics (<i>type</i> from
       <a href="../man3/pmlookupdesc.3.html">pmLookupDesc(3)</a> is <b>PM_SEM_COUNTER</b>) which are expected to have
       monotonically increasing values.  If the values are not monotonic
       increasing this may suggest a counter wrap has happened or there
       has been some interruption or reset to the underlying source of
       the performance data that is no captured in the archive.

       For each counter metric which has been detected as having wrapped
       at some point in the archive, <b>pmlogcheck </b>produces output
       describing the metric name (with instance identifiers where
       appropriate), the internal storage type for the metric, the value
       of the metric before the counter wrap (with its associated
       timestamp), and the value of the metric after the wrap (also with
       a timestamp).

       The <b>-w </b>option may be used to suppress reporting of counter wraps.

       <b>pmlogcheck </b>produces two different timestamp formats, depending on
       the interval over which it is run.  For an interval greater than
       24 hours, the date is displayed in addition to the time at which
       the counter wrap occurred.  If the extent of the data being
       checked is less than 24 hours, a more precise format is used
       (time is displayed with millisecond precision, but without the
       date).

       <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/&lt;hostname&gt;</i>
            default directory for PCP archives containing performance
            data collected from the host <i>hostname</i>.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
