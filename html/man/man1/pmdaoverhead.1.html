SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/overhead/pmdaoverhead </b>[<b>-C</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>config</i>] [<b>-d </b><i>domain</i>]
       [<b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>] [<b>-R </b><i>interval</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaoverhead </b>is a configurable Performance Metrics Domain Agent
       (PMDA) for exporting resource consumption for groups of related
       processes.

       The <b>pmdaoverhead </b>command line options are:

       <b>-C  </b>parse the configuration file(s) and exit after reporting any
           errors.

       <b>-c  </b>configuration file(s), <i>config</i> may be either a file or a
           directory; in the latter case all the files within <i>config</i> are
           assumed to be configuration files for <b>pmdaoverhead </b>and they
           will all be processed.

           Each configuration file defines one or more ``groups'' of
           processes of interest, using the syntax described in the
           ``CONFIGURATION'' section below.

           By default all configuration files below the
           <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/overhead/conf.d/</i> directory are used.

       <b>-d  </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
           number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
           <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
           and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
           on all hosts.

       <b>-l  </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
           <i>overhead.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
           when <b>pmdaoverhead </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If
           the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
           written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-R  </b>The PMDA uses a separate thread to periodically scan all
           processes to determine which processes are deemed
           ``interesting'' in each group, and extracting resource
           consumption for those processes.  The <i>interval</i> (in seconds)
           determines how often this scanning and resource calculation
           is done, the default is 60 (seconds).
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Each configuration file defines one or more ``groups'' of
       processes.  The file format is simple and follows the following
       rules.

       1.  Lines beginning with a hash ``#'' are treated as comments.
           More generally, except for the <b>pattern: </b>clause described
           below, all text between a hash and the end of line is treated
           as a comment.

       2.  White space (spaces or tabs or newlines) are required to
           separate lexical components.  Spaces and tabs are otherwise
           ignored.  Other than terminating comments and the <i>regex</i> in a
           <b>pattern: </b>clause, newlines are also ignored.

       3.  Each group is introduced by a <b>group </b>clause that has the form
                   <b>group </b><i>name</i> <b>{ </b><i>parameters</i> <b>}</b>
           where <i>name</i> is a unique name for the group across all groups
           in the <b>pmdaoverhead </b>configuration files.  As <i>name</i> becomes
           embedded in the Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) if must
           follow the rules for metric name components as described in
           <a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>, namely beginning with an alphabetic character,
           followed by zero or more characters drawn from the
           alphabetics, numerics and the underscore ``_'' character.

       4.  The <i>parameters</i> must include one <b>id: </b>clause and one <b>pattern:</b>
           clause.

       5.  An <b>id: </b>clause has the form
                   <b>id: </b><i>ident</i>
           where <i>ident</i> is a unique identifier number for the group
           across all groups in the <b>pmdaoverhead </b>configuration files.
           Valid values for <i>ident</i> are in the range 0 to 4094
           (inclusive).

       6.  A <b>pattern: </b>clause has the form
                   <b>pattern: </b><i>regex</i>
           where <i>regex</i> is an extended regular expression notation in the
           style of <b>egrep</b>(1).  The <i>regex</i> starts at the first non-
           whitespace character after <b>pattern: </b>and extends to the next
           newline.

           The processes that are considered to be members of the group
           are those for which the command name, as reported by
                   $ pminfo -f proc.psinfo.cmd
           is matched by <i>regex</i> <b>plus </b>all the descendents of those
           processes.  So for example the <i>regex</i> <b>^pmcd$ </b>will match
           <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and all the PMDA processes launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and
           any of their children, etc.

INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
       overhead performance metrics, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/overhead
            # ./Install

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/overhead
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdaoverhead </b>is launched by <b>pmcd </b>and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <b>pmcd </b>when the
       agent is installed or removed.

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
