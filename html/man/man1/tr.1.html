NAME </h2>
<pre>
       tr - translate or delete characters
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tr </b>[<i>OPTION</i>]... <i>STRING1</i> [<i>STRING2</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input,
       writing to standard output.  STRING1 and STRING2 specify arrays
       of characters ARRAY1 and ARRAY2 that control the action.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>--complement</b>
              use the complement of ARRAY1

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--delete</b>
              delete characters in ARRAY1, do not translate

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--squeeze-repeats</b>
              replace each sequence of a repeated character that is
              listed in the last specified ARRAY, with a single
              occurrence of that character

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--truncate-set1</b>
              first truncate ARRAY1 to length of ARRAY2

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       ARRAYs are specified as strings of characters.  Most represent
       themselves.  Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order

       [CHAR*]
              in ARRAY2, copies of CHAR until length of ARRAY1

       [CHAR*REPEAT]
              REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0

       [:alnum:]
              all letters and digits

       [:alpha:]
              all letters

       [:blank:]
              all horizontal whitespace

       [:cntrl:]
              all control characters

       [:digit:]
              all digits

       [:graph:]
              all printable characters, not including space

       [:lower:]
              all lower case letters

       [:print:]
              all printable characters, including space

       [:punct:]
              all punctuation characters

       [:space:]
              all horizontal or vertical whitespace

       [:upper:]
              all upper case letters

       [:xdigit:]
              all hexadecimal digits

       [=CHAR=]
              all characters which are equivalent to CHAR

       Translation occurs if <b>-d </b>is not given and both STRING1 and
       STRING2 appear.  <b>-t </b>is only significant when translating.  ARRAY2
       is extended to length of ARRAY1 by repeating its last character
       as necessary.  Excess characters of ARRAY2 are ignored.
       Character classes expand in unspecified order; while translating,
       [:lower:] and [:upper:] may be used in pairs to specify case
       conversion.  Squeezing occurs after translation or deletion.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Full support is available only for safe single-byte locales, in
       which every possible input byte represents a single character.
       The C locale is safe in GNU systems, so you can avoid this issue
       in the shell by running <b>LC_ALL=C tr </b>instead of plain <b>tr</b>.
