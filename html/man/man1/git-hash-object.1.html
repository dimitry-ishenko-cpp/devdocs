NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-hash-object - Compute object ID and optionally create an
       object from a file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git hash-object</i> [-t &lt;type&gt;] [-w] [--path=&lt;file&gt; | --no-filters]
                       [--stdin [--literally]] [--] &lt;file&gt;...
       <i>git hash-object</i> [-t &lt;type&gt;] [-w] --stdin-paths [--no-filters]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Computes the object ID value for an object with specified type
       with the contents of the named file (which can be outside of the
       work tree), and optionally writes the resulting object into the
       object database. Reports its object ID to its standard output.
       When &lt;type&gt; is not specified, it defaults to "blob".
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -t &lt;type&gt;
           Specify the type of object to be created (default: "blob").
           Possible values are <b>commit</b>, <b>tree</b>, <b>blob</b>, and <b>tag</b>.

       -w
           Actually write the object into the object database.

       --stdin
           Read the object from standard input instead of from a file.

       --stdin-paths
           Read file names from the standard input, one per line,
           instead of from the command-line.

       --path
           Hash object as if it were located at the given path. The
           location of the file does not directly influence the hash
           value, but the path is used to determine which Git filters
           should be applied to the object before it can be placed in
           the object database. As a result of applying filters, the
           actual blob put into the object database may differ from the
           given file. This option is mainly useful for hashing
           temporary files located outside of the working directory or
           files read from stdin.

       --no-filters
           Hash the contents as is, ignoring any input filter that would
           have been chosen by the attributes mechanism, including the
           end-of-line conversion. If the file is read from standard
           input then this is always implied, unless the <b>--path </b>option
           is given.

       --literally
           Allow <b>--stdin </b>to hash any garbage into a loose object which
           might not otherwise pass standard object parsing or git-fsck
           checks. Useful for stress-testing Git itself or reproducing
           characteristics of corrupt or bogus objects encountered in
           the wild.
