</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Manage the serialized commit-graph file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --object-dir
           Use given directory for the location of packfiles and
           commit-graph file. This parameter exists to specify the
           location of an alternate that only has the objects directory,
           not a full <b>.git </b>directory. The commit-graph file is expected
           to be in the <b>&lt;dir&gt;/info </b>directory and the packfiles are
           expected to be in <b>&lt;dir&gt;/pack</b>. If the directory could not be
           made into an absolute path, or does not match any known
           object directory, <b>git commit-graph ...  </b>will exit with
           non-zero status.

       --[no-]progress
           Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
           progress is shown if standard error is connected to a
           terminal.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>write</i>
           Write a commit-graph file based on the commits found in
           packfiles. If the config option <b>core.commitGraph </b>is disabled,
           then this command will output a warning, then return success
           without writing a commit-graph file.

           With the <b>--stdin-packs </b>option, generate the new commit graph
           by walking objects only in the specified pack-indexes.
           (Cannot be combined with <b>--stdin-commits </b>or <b>--reachable</b>.)

           With the <b>--stdin-commits </b>option, generate the new commit
           graph by walking commits starting at the commits specified in
           stdin as a list of OIDs in hex, one OID per line. OIDs that
           resolve to non-commits (either directly, or by peeling tags)
           are silently ignored. OIDs that are malformed, or do not
           exist generate an error. (Cannot be combined with
           <b>--stdin-packs </b>or <b>--reachable</b>.)

           With the <b>--reachable </b>option, generate the new commit graph by
           walking commits starting at all refs. (Cannot be combined
           with <b>--stdin-commits </b>or <b>--stdin-packs</b>.)

           With the <b>--append </b>option, include all commits that are
           present in the existing commit-graph file.

           With the <b>--changed-paths </b>option, compute and write
           information about the paths changed between a commit and its
           first parent. This operation can take a while on large
           repositories. It provides significant performance gains for
           getting history of a directory or a file with <b>git log --</b>
           <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>. If this option is given, future commit-graph writes
           will automatically assume that this option was intended. Use
           <b>--no-changed-paths </b>to stop storing this data.

           With the <b>--max-new-filters=&lt;n&gt; </b>option, generate at most <b>n </b>new
           Bloom filters (if <b>--changed-paths </b>is specified). If <b>n </b>is <b>-1</b>,
           no limit is enforced. Only commits present in the new layer
           count against this limit. To retroactively compute Bloom
           filters over earlier layers, it is advised to use
           <b>--split=replace</b>. Overrides the <b>commitGraph.maxNewFilters</b>
           configuration.

           With the <b>--split[=&lt;strategy&gt;] </b>option, write the commit-graph
           as a chain of multiple commit-graph files stored in
           <b>&lt;dir&gt;/info/commit-graphs</b>. Commit-graph layers are merged
           based on the strategy and other splitting options. The new
           commits not already in the commit-graph are added in a new
           "tip" file. This file is merged with the existing file if the
           following merge conditions are met:

           •   If <b>--split=no-merge </b>is specified, a merge is never
               performed, and the remaining options are ignored.
               <b>--split=replace </b>overwrites the existing chain with a new
               one. A bare <b>--split </b>defers to the remaining options.
               (Note that merging a chain of commit graphs replaces the
               existing chain with a length-1 chain where the first and
               only incremental holds the entire graph).

           •   If <b>--size-multiple=&lt;X&gt; </b>is not specified, let <b>X </b>equal 2.
               If the new tip file would have <b>N </b>commits and the previous
               tip has <b>M </b>commits and <b>X </b>times <b>N </b>is greater than <b>M</b>,
               instead merge the two files into a single file.

           •   If <b>--max-commits=&lt;M&gt; </b>is specified with <b>M </b>a positive
               integer, and the new tip file would have more than <b>M</b>
               commits, then instead merge the new tip with the previous
               tip.

               Finally, if <b>--expire-time=&lt;datetime&gt; </b>is not specified,
               let <b>datetime </b>be the current time. After writing the split
               commit-graph, delete all unused commit-graph whose
               modified times are older than <b>datetime</b>.

       <i>verify</i>
           Read the commit-graph file and verify its contents against
           the object database. Used to check for corrupted data.

           With the <b>--shallow </b>option, only check the tip commit-graph
           file in a chain of split commit-graphs.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       •   Write a commit-graph file for the packed commits in your
           local <b>.git </b>directory.

               $ git commit-graph write

       •   Write a commit-graph file, extending the current commit-graph
           file using commits in <b>&lt;pack-index&gt;</b>.

               $ echo &lt;pack-index&gt; | git commit-graph write --stdin-packs

       •   Write a commit-graph file containing all reachable commits.

               $ git show-ref -s | git commit-graph write --stdin-commits

       •   Write a commit-graph file containing all commits in the
           current commit-graph file along with those reachable from
           <b>HEAD</b>.

               $ git rev-parse HEAD | git commit-graph write --stdin-commits --append

CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively
       included from the <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> documentation. The content is the
       same as what’s found there:

       commitGraph.generationVersion
           Specifies the type of generation number version to use when
           writing or reading the commit-graph file. If version 1 is
           specified, then the corrected commit dates will not be
           written or read. Defaults to 2.

       commitGraph.maxNewFilters
           Specifies the default value for the <b>--max-new-filters </b>option
           of <b>git commit-graph write </b>(c.f., <a href="git-commit-graph.1.html">git-commit-graph(1)</a>).

       commitGraph.readChangedPaths
           If true, then git will use the changed-path Bloom filters in
           the commit-graph file (if it exists, and they are present).
           Defaults to true. See <a href="git-commit-graph.1.html">git-commit-graph(1)</a> for more
           information.
