SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_daily_report </b>[<b>-ApV?</b>]  [<b>-a </b><i>archivefile</i>]
       [<b>-f </b><i>outputfile</i>] [<b>-h </b><i>hostname</i>] [<b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>] [<b>-o </b><i>directory</i>] [<b>-t</b>
       <i>interval</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>writes daily performance summary reports,
       much like those produced by <b>sadc</b>(1) and the <a href="../man8/sa2.8.html">sa2(8)</a> utility.

       All of the command line arguments are optional and intended to be
       self explanatory.

       By default, the reports are not generated, but if the <i>pcp-</i>
       <i>zeroconf</i> package has been installed (there will be files in
       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf/zeroconf</b>) then the necessary
       metrics will have been included in the default <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
       configuration file and the reports will be generated.

       The reports are generated (by default) soon after midnight, once
       <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> has completed the merging of any partial
       archives to generate one archive for yesterday's activity.

       Each performance summary report is named <b>sar</b><i>XX</i> (where <i>XX</i> is
       yesterdays day-of-the-month).  The <i>outputfile</i> may be changed with
       the <b>-f </b>option.  The report will be written to the <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/sa</i>
       directory by default, but this may be changed with the <b>-o </b>option
       to a different <i>directory</i>.

       Note that there are sufficiently flexible command line options
       for <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>to be used to read any <i>archivefile</i> and
       write the report to any output directory.

       If the <b>-a </b>option is not given, the default input <i>archivefile</i> is
       <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/HOSTNAME/YYYYMMDD</i>, where <i>HOSTNAME</i> defaults to
       the local hostname (unless changed with the <b>-h </b>option) and
       <i>YYYYMMDD</i> is the base name of yesterdays merged archive, as
       produced by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> and <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>.  If <i>archivefile</i> is
       a directory, then <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>will use all PCP archives
       found in that directory to write the report (this is known as
       multi-archive mode, and may be considerably slower than
       specifying a single archive as the input).

       The reports themselves are created by the <a href="pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a> utility using
       its default configuration file, see <a href="../man5/pmrep.conf.5.html">pmrep.conf(5)</a>.  The <a href="pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a>
       configuration entries used to write the reports is currently
       hardwired into the <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>script.

       Finally, the input archives must contain sufficient metrics as
       needed by <a href="pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a> to write the report.  On platforms that
       support it, the <i>pcp-zeroconf</i> package configures PCP logging as
       required for this - hence <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>should be used
       with the <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> configuration that is set up by <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>zeroconf</b>.  As the name suggests, <b>pcp-zeroconf </b>requires no
       additional configuration after installation in order to capture
       the required archives needed by <b>pmlogger_daily_report</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-a </b><i>archive</i>
            Specifies an alternate input <i>archive</i> file basename or
            directory path.

       <b>-A   </b>Use the start and end times of input archive for the report,
            as opposed to the default behaviour of 24 hours from
            midnight yesterday.

       <b>-f </b><i>filename</i>
            Specifies an alternate output <i>filename</i>.  <b>-h </b><i>hostname</i>
            Specifies an alternate <i>hostname</i> to use within the default
            input archive file path.

       <b>-l </b><i>file</i>, <b>--logfile</b>=<i>file</i>
            In order to ensure that mail is not unintentionally sent
            when this script is run from <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> diagnostics
            are always sent to a log <i>file</i>.  By default, this file is
            <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger_daily_report.log</i> but this can
            be changed using the <b>-l </b>option.  If this log file already
            exists when the script starts, it will be renamed with a
            <i>.prev</i> suffix (overwriting any log file saved earlier) before
            diagnostics are generated to the log file.

       <b>-p   </b>If this option is specified then the status of the daily
            processing is polled and if the report has not been done in
            the last 24 hours then it is done now.  With this option,
            <b>pmlogger_daily_report </b>simply exits if the previous day's
            processing has already been done.

            This option is no longer required as the polling of
            <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> will ensure the report will be generated,
            however the option is retained for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-t </b><i>interval</i>
            Specifies the sampling <i>interval</i> used when generating the
            report, in the format described in <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>.  The default
            is every 10 minutes.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            The output from the execution of the script may be extended
            using this option which enables verbose tracing of activity.
            By default the script generates no log output unless some
            error or warning condition is encountered.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
