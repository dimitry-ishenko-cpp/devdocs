NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rcopy - simple file copy over RDMA.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>rcopy</i> source server[:destination] [-p port]
       <i>rcopy</i> [-p port]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Uses sockets over RDMA interface to copy a source file to the
       specified destination.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       source The name and path of the source file to copy.

       server The name or address of the destination server.

       :destination
              An optional destination filename and path.  If not given,
              the destination filename will match that of the source.

       -p server_port
              The server's port number.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
              Basic usage is to start rcopy on a server system, then run
              rcopy sourcefile servername.  The server application will
              continue to run after copying the file, but is currently
              single-threaded.

       Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace, users must
       ensure that they have available system resources and permissions.
       See the libibverbs README file for additional details.
