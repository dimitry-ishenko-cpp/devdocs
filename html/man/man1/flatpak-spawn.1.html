</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-spawn - Run commands in a sandbox
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak-spawn </b>[OPTION...] COMMAND [ARGUMENT...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Unlike other flatpak commands, <b>flatpak-spawn </b>is available to
       applications inside the sandbox. It runs COMMAND outside the
       sandbox: either in another sandbox, or on the host.

       When called without <b>--host</b>, <b>flatpak-spawn </b>uses the Flatpak portal
       to create a copy of the sandbox it was called from, optionally
       using tighter permissions and optionally the latest version of
       the app and runtime (see <b>--latest-version</b>).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information

       <b>--forward-fd=FD</b>
           Forward a file descriptor

       <b>--clear-env</b>
           Run with a clean environment

       <b>--watch-bus</b>
           Make the spawned command exit if the caller disappears from
           the session bus

       <b>--env=VAR=VALUE</b>
           Set an environment variable

       <b>--latest-version</b>
           Use the latest version of the refs that are used to set up
           the sandbox

       <b>--no-network</b>
           Run without network access

       <b>--sandbox</b>
           Run fully sandboxed. See the documentation for the <b>--sandbox</b>
           option in <a href="flatpak-run.1.html">flatpak-run(1)</a>

           See the <b>--sandbox-expose </b>and <b>--sandbox-expose-ro </b>options for
           selective file access.

       <b>--sandbox-expose=NAME</b>
           Expose read-write access to a file in the sandbox.

           Note that absolute paths or subdirectories are not allowed.
           The files must be in the sandbox subdirectory of the instance
           directory (i.e.  ~/.var/app/$APP_ID/sandbox).

           This option is useful in combination with <b>--sandbox</b>
           (otherwise the instance directory is accessible anyway).

       <b>--sandbox-expose-ro=NAME</b>
           Expose readonly access to a file in the sandbox.

           Note that absolute paths or subdirectories are not allowed.
           The files must be in the sandbox subdirectory of the instance
           directory (i.e.  ~/.var/app/$APP_ID/sandbox).

           This option is useful in combination with <b>--sandbox</b>
           (otherwise the instance directory is accessible anyway).

       <b>--host</b>
           Run the command unsandboxed on the host. This requires access
           to the org.freedesktop.Flatpak D-Bus interface.

       <b>--directory=DIR</b>
           The working directory in which to run the command.

           Note that the given directory must exist in the sandbox or,
           when used in conjunction with <b>--host</b>, on the host.
