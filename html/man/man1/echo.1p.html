PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       echo — write arguments to standard output
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       echo <b>[</b><i>string</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>echo</i> utility writes its arguments to standard output,
       followed by a &lt;newline&gt;.  If there are no arguments, only the
       &lt;newline&gt; is written.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>echo</i> utility shall not recognize the <b>"--" </b>argument in the
       manner specified by Guideline 10 of the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>; <b>"--"</b>
       shall be recognized as a string operand.

       Implementations shall not support any options.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>string</i>    A string to be written to standard output. If the first
                 operand is <b>-n</b>, or if any of the operands contain a
                 &lt;backslash&gt; character, the results are implementation-
                 defined.

                 On XSI-conformant systems, if the first operand is <b>-n</b>,
                 it shall be treated as a string, not an option. The
                 following character sequences shall be recognized on
                 XSI-conformant systems within any of the arguments:

                 \a      Write an &lt;alert&gt;.

                 \b      Write a &lt;backspace&gt;.

                 \c      Suppress the &lt;newline&gt; that otherwise follows
                         the final argument in the output. All
                         characters following the <b>'\c' </b>in the arguments
                         shall be ignored.

                 \f      Write a &lt;form-feed&gt;.

                 \n      Write a &lt;newline&gt;.

                 \r      Write a &lt;carriage-return&gt;.

                 \t      Write a &lt;tab&gt;.

                 \v      Write a &lt;vertical-tab&gt;.

                 \\      Write a &lt;backslash&gt; character.

                 \0<i>num</i>   Write an 8-bit value that is the zero, one,
                         two, or three-digit octal number <i>num</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>echo</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>echo</i> utility arguments shall be separated by single &lt;space&gt;
       characters and a &lt;newline&gt; character shall follow the last
       argument.  Output transformations shall occur based on the escape
       sequences in the input. See the OPERANDS section.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       It is not possible to use <i>echo</i> portably across all POSIX systems
       unless both <b>-n </b>(as the first argument) and escape sequences are
       omitted.

       The <i>printf</i> utility can be used portably to emulate any of the
       traditional behaviors of the <i>echo</i> utility as follows (assuming
       that <i>IFS</i> has its standard value or is unset):

        *  The historic System V <i>echo</i> and the requirements on XSI
           implementations in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 are equivalent
           to:

               printf "%b\n$*"

        *  The BSD <i>echo</i> is equivalent to:

               if [ "X$1" = "X-n" ]
               then
                   shift
                   printf "%s$*"
               else
                   printf "%s\n$*"
               fi

       New applications are encouraged to use <i>printf</i> instead of <i>echo</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>echo</i> utility has not been made obsolescent because of its
       extremely widespread use in historical applications. Conforming
       applications that wish to do prompting without &lt;newline&gt;
       characters or that could possibly be expecting to echo a <b>-n</b>,
       should use the <i>printf</i> utility derived from the Ninth Edition
       system.

       As specified, <i>echo</i> writes its arguments in the simplest of ways.
       The two different historical versions of <i>echo</i> vary in fatally
       incompatible ways.

       The BSD <i>echo</i> checks the first argument for the string <b>-n </b>which
       causes it to suppress the &lt;newline&gt; that would otherwise follow
       the final argument in the output.

       The System V <i>echo</i> does not support any options, but allows escape
       sequences within its operands, as described for XSI
       implementations in the OPERANDS section.

       The <i>echo</i> utility does not support Utility Syntax Guideline 10
       because historical applications depend on <i>echo</i> to echo <i>all</i> of its
       arguments, except for the <b>-n </b>option in the BSD version.
