</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaproc </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the state of the
       individual processes running on a Linux system.

       The <b>proc </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure the memory, processor
       and other resource use of each process, as well as summary
       information collated across all of the running processes.  The
       PMDA uses credentials passed from the <a href="../man3/pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> monitoring tool
       identifying the user requesting the information, to ensure that
       only values the user is allowed to access are returned by the
       PMDA.  This involves the PMDA temporarily changing its effective
       user and group identifiers for the duration of requests for
       instances and values.  In other words, system calls to extract
       information are performed as the user originating the request and
       not as a privileged user.  The mechanisms available for transfer
       of user credentials are described further in the <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>
       page.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaproc </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-A   </b>Disables use of the credentials provided by <b>PMAPI </b>client
            tools, and simply runs everything under the "root" account.
            Only enable this option if you understand the risks
            involved, and are sure that all remote accesses will be from
            benevolent users.  If enabled, unauthenticated remote <b>PMAPI</b>
            clients will be able to access potentially sensitive
            performance metric values which an unauthenticated <b>PMAPI</b>
            client usually would not be able to.  Refer to CVE-2012-3419
            for additional details.

       <b>-L   </b>Changes the per-process instance domain used by most
            <b>pmdaproc </b>metrics to include threads as well.

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>proc.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdaproc </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.

       <b>-r   </b>Restrict the set of processes exported in the per-process
            instance domain to only those processes that are contained
            by the specified <i>cgroup</i> resource container.  This option
            provides an optional finer granularity to the monitoring,
            and can also be used to reduce the resources consumed by
            <i>pmdaproc</i> during requests for instances and values.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the privileged "root" account, with seteuid (2) and setegid
            (2) switching for accessing most information.
</pre> <h2>
HOTPROC OVERVIEW </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pmdaproc </b>Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) includes an
       additional set of per-process metrics with an instance domain of
       processes restricted to an "interesting" or "hot" set.  Unlike
       the stock metrics exported by the <b>proc </b>PMDA, which have an
       instance domain equal to the current processes, <b>hot </b>metrics have
       an instance domain which is a subset of this.  This <b>hotproc</b>
       instance domain is determined by a configurable predicate
       evaluated over some refresh interval.

       As well as the equivalent per-process <b>proc </b>metrics, <b>hotproc</b>
       provides a <b>cpuburn </b>metric which specifies the CPU utilization of
       the process over the refresh interval, <b>total </b>metrics which
       indicate how much of the available CPU time the "interesting"
       processes account for, <b>predicate </b>metrics which show the values of
       the reserved variables (see below) that are being used in the
       hotproc predicate, and <b>control </b>metrics for controlling the agent.
</pre> <h2>
HOTPROC CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration file consists of one predicate used to
       determine if a process should be in the interesting set or not.

       An example configuration file may be found at
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/samplehotproc.conf</b>

       This file with any modifications can be copied to
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc/hotproc.conf </b>in order to configure the <b>hot</b>
       metrics. The <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> and <a href="../man3/pmstore.3.html">pmStore(3)</a> interfaces can be used as
       well (described below).

       The predicate is described using the language specified below.
       The symbols are based on those used by the <b>C</b>(1) and <b>awk</b>(1)
       languages.

       Boolean Connectives
              <b>&amp;&amp; </b>(and), <b>|| </b>(or), <b>!  </b>(not), <b>() </b>(precedence overriding)

       Number comparators
              <b>&lt; </b>, <b>&lt;= </b>, <b>&gt; </b>, <b>&gt;= </b>, <b>== </b>, <b>!=</b>

       String comparators
              <b>== </b>, <b>!=</b>

       String/Pattern comparators
              <b>~ </b>(string matches pattern) , <b>!~ </b>(string does not match
              pattern)

       Reserved variables
              <b>uid </b>(user id; type integer) <b>uname </b>(user name; type
              string), <b>gid </b>(group id; type integer) <b>gname </b>(group name;
              type string), <b>fname </b>(process file name; type string),
              <b>psargs </b>(process file name with args; type string), <b>cpuburn</b>
              (cpu utilization; type float), <b>iodemand </b>(I/O demand -
              Kbytes read/written per second; type float), <b>ctxswitch</b>
              (number of context switches per second; type float),
              <b>syscalls </b>(number of system calls per second; type float),
              <b>virtualsize </b>(virtual size in Kbytes; type float),
              <b>residentsize </b>(resident size in Kbytes; type float), <b>iowait</b>
              (blocked and raw io wait in secs/sec; type float),
              <b>schedwait </b>(time waiting in run queue in secs/sec; type
              float).

       Literal values
              <b>1234 </b>(positive integer), <b>0.35 </b>(positive float), <b>"foobar"</b>
              (string; delimited by <b>"</b>), <b>/[fF](o)+bar/ </b>(pattern;
              delimited by <b>/</b>), <b>true </b>(boolean), <b>false </b>(boolean)

       Comments
              <b>#this is a comment </b>(from <b># </b>to the end of the line).

       Examples
                cpuburn &gt; 0.2 # cpu utilization of more than 20%
                cpuburn &gt; 0.2 &amp;&amp; uname == "root"
                cpuburn &gt; 0.2 &amp;&amp; (uname == "root" || uname == "hot")
                psargs ~ /pmda/ &amp;&amp; cpuburn &gt; 0.4

       The <b>hotproc.predicate </b>metrics may be used to see what the values
       of the reserved variables are that were used by the predicate at
       the last refresh.  They do not cover the reserved variables which
       are already exported elsewhere. A <b>hotproc.predicate </b>metric may
       not have a value if it is not referenced in the configuration
       predicate.
</pre> <h2>
DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>hot </b>metrics can also be configured at runtime through the
       <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> interface (and, implicitly, the <a href="../man3/pmstore.3.html">pmStore(3)</a> API)

       Examples
                pmstore hotproc.control.config 'fname == "mingetty"'
                pmstore hotproc.control.config 'uid == 0'

       To force the config file to be reloaded:
                pmstore hotproc.control.reload_config "1"
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>proc </b>PMDA is installed and available by default.  If you want
       to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc
            # ./Remove

       If you want to establish access to the names, help text and
       values for the proc performance metrics once more, after removal,
       do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/proc
            # ./Install

       <b>pmdaproc </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>

</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
