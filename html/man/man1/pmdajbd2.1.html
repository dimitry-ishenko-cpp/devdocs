NAME </h2>

       <b>pmdajbd2 </b>- journal block device (JBD) performance metrics domain
       agent (PMDA)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/pmdajbd2 </b>[<b>-d </b><i>domain</i>] [<b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>] [<b>-j </b><i>path</i>]
       [<b>-U </b><i>username</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdajbd2 </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics from the Journal Block Device
       subsystem (version 2) in the Linux kernel.  These metrics are
       exported by the kernel in procfs files, one file per block
       device.  The JBD2 subsystem is used by several filesystems
       including ext3, ext4 and ocfs2.

       The <b>jbd2 </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure detailed journal
       transaction information, such as time spent waiting and locked,
       request rates, blocks used and so on.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdajbd2 </b>command line options follows
       (these are only relevant when running the PMDA as a daemon, and
       not as a shared library):

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, when running as a
            daemon a log file named <i>jbd2.log</i> is written in the current
            directory of when <b>pmdajbd2 </b>is started, i.e.
            <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log file cannot be created or is
            not writable, output is written to the standard error
            instead.  When running in shared library mode, and
            diagnostic information will be written into the <b>pmcd </b>log
            file, namely <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log</b>.

       <b>-j   </b>Allows an alternate path to the jbd2 statistics files to be
            specified.  The default path is <i>/proc/fs/jbd2</i>.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       This PMDA is installed by default and in the shared library mode
       (rather than as a separate daemon to <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>).  Thus, the names,
       help text and values for the jbd2 performance metrics should
       always be available.

       If you do not use these metrics you can remove this PMDA, do the
       following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2
            # ./Remove

       If you want to enable the installation again, do the following as
       root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2
            # ./Install

       <b>pmdajbd2 </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/help</b>
              default help text file for the jbd2 metrics
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/Install</b>

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/jbd2/Remove</b>
              undo installation script for the <b>pmdajbd2 </b>agent
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/jbd2.log</b>

              from <b>pmdajbd2</b>
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
