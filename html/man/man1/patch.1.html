SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>patch </b>[<i>options</i>] [<i>originalfile</i> [<i>patchfile</i>]]

       but usually just

       <b>patch -p</b><i>num</i> <b>&lt;</b><i>patchfile</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>patch </b>takes a patch file <i>patchfile</i> containing a difference
       listing produced by the <b>diff </b>program and applies those
       differences to one or more original files, producing patched
       versions.  Normally the patched versions are put in place of the
       originals.  Backups can be made; see the <b>-b </b>or <b>--backup </b>option.
       The names of the files to be patched are usually taken from the
       patch file, but if there's just one file to be patched it can be
       specified on the command line as <i>originalfile</i>.

       Upon startup, patch attempts to determine the type of the diff
       listing, unless overruled by a <b>-c </b>(<b>--context</b>), <b>-e </b>(<b>--ed</b>), <b>-n</b>
       (<b>--normal</b>), or <b>-u </b>(<b>--unified</b>) option.  Context diffs (old-style,
       new-style, and unified) and normal diffs are applied by the <b>patch</b>
       program itself, while <b>ed </b>diffs are simply fed to the <b>ed</b>(1) editor
       via a pipe.

       <b>patch </b>tries to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff, and then
       skip any trailing garbage.  Thus you could feed an article or
       message containing a diff listing to <b>patch</b>, and it should work.
       If the entire diff is indented by a consistent amount, if lines
       end in CRLF, or if a diff is encapsulated one or more times by
       prepending "<b>- </b>" to lines starting with "<b>-</b>" as specified by
       Internet RFC 934, this is taken into account.  After removing
       indenting or encapsulation, lines beginning with <b># </b>are ignored,
       as they are considered to be comments.

       With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs,
       <b>patch </b>can detect when the line numbers mentioned in the patch are
       incorrect, and attempts to find the correct place to apply each
       hunk of the patch.  As a first guess, it takes the line number
       mentioned for the hunk, plus or minus any offset used in applying
       the previous hunk.  If that is not the correct place, <b>patch </b>scans
       both forwards and backwards for a set of lines matching the
       context given in the hunk.  First <b>patch </b>looks for a place where
       all lines of the context match.  If no such place is found, and
       it's a context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or
       more, then another scan takes place ignoring the first and last
       line of context.  If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is
       set to 2 or more, the first two and last two lines of context are
       ignored, and another scan is made.  (The default maximum fuzz
       factor is 2.)

       Hunks with less prefix context than suffix context (after
       applying fuzz) must apply at the start of the file if their first
       line number is 1.  Hunks with more prefix context than suffix
       context (after applying fuzz) must apply at the end of the file.

       If <b>patch </b>cannot find a place to install that hunk of the patch,
       it puts the hunk out to a reject file, which normally is the name
       of the output file plus a <b>.rej </b>suffix, or <b># </b>if <b>.rej </b>would
       generate a file name that is too long (if even appending the
       single character <b># </b>makes the file name too long, then <b># </b>replaces
       the file name's last character).

       The rejected hunk comes out in unified or context diff format.
       If the input was a normal diff, many of the contexts are simply
       null.  The line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be
       different than in the patch file: they reflect the approximate
       location patch thinks the failed hunks belong in the new file
       rather than the old one.

       As each hunk is completed, you are told if the hunk failed, and
       if so which line (in the new file) <b>patch </b>thought the hunk should
       go on.  If the hunk is installed at a different line from the
       line number specified in the diff, you are told the offset.  A
       single large offset <i>may</i> indicate that a hunk was installed in the
       wrong place.  You are also told if a fuzz factor was used to make
       the match, in which case you should also be slightly suspicious.
       If the <b>--verbose </b>option is given, you are also told about hunks
       that match exactly.

       If no original file <i>origfile</i> is specified on the command line,
       <b>patch </b>tries to figure out from the leading garbage what the name
       of the file to edit is, using the following rules.

       First, <b>patch </b>takes an ordered list of candidate file names as
       follows:

        <b>• </b>If the header is that of a context diff, <b>patch </b>takes the old
          and new file names in the header.  A name is ignored if it
          does not have enough slashes to satisfy the <b>-p</b><i>num</i> or
          <b>--strip=</b><i>num</i> option.  The name <b>/dev/null </b>is also ignored.

        <b>• </b>If there is an <b>Index: </b>line in the leading garbage and if
          either the old and new names are both absent or if <b>patch </b>is
          conforming to POSIX, <b>patch </b>takes the name in the <b>Index: </b>line.

        <b>• </b>For the purpose of the following rules, the candidate file
          names are considered to be in the order (old, new, index),
          regardless of the order that they appear in the header.

       Then <b>patch </b>selects a file name from the candidate list as
       follows:

        <b>• </b>If some of the named files exist, <b>patch </b>selects the first name
          if conforming to POSIX, and the best name otherwise.

        <b>• </b>If <b>patch </b>is not ignoring RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, and SCCS
          (see the <b>-g </b><i>num</i> or <b>--get=</b><i>num</i> option), and no named files exist
          but an RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS master is found,
          <b>patch </b>selects the first named file with an RCS, ClearCase,
          Perforce, or SCCS master.

        <b>• </b>If no named files exist, no RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS
          master was found, some names are given, <b>patch </b>is not
          conforming to POSIX, and the patch appears to create a file,
          <b>patch </b>selects the best name requiring the creation of the
          fewest directories.

        <b>• </b>If no file name results from the above heuristics, you are
          asked for the name of the file to patch, and <b>patch </b>selects
          that name.

       To determine the <i>best</i> of a nonempty list of file names, <b>patch</b>
       first takes all the names with the fewest path name components;
       of those, it then takes all the names with the shortest basename;
       of those, it then takes all the shortest names; finally, it takes
       the first remaining name.

       Additionally, if the leading garbage contains a <b>Prereq: </b>line,
       <b>patch </b>takes the first word from the prerequisites line (normally
       a version number) and checks the original file to see if that
       word can be found.  If not, <b>patch </b>asks for confirmation before
       proceeding.

       The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say, while
       in a news interface, something like the following:

              <b>| patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl</b>

       and patch a file in the <b>blurfl </b>directory directly from the
       article containing the patch.

       If the patch file contains more than one patch, <b>patch </b>tries to
       apply each of them as if they came from separate patch files.
       This means, among other things, that it is assumed that the name
       of the file to patch must be determined for each diff listing,
       and that the garbage before each diff listing contains
       interesting things such as file names and revision level, as
       mentioned previously.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-b  </b>or  <b>--backup</b>
          Make backup files.  That is, when patching a file, rename or
          copy the original instead of removing it.  When backing up a
          file that does not exist, an empty, unreadable backup file is
          created as a placeholder to represent the nonexistent file.
          See the <b>-V </b>or <b>--version-control </b>option for details about how
          backup file names are determined.

       <b>--backup-if-mismatch</b>
          Back up a file if the patch does not match the file exactly
          and if backups are not otherwise requested.  This is the
          default unless <b>patch </b>is conforming to POSIX.

       <b>--no-backup-if-mismatch</b>
          Do not back up a file if the patch does not match the file
          exactly and if backups are not otherwise requested.  This is
          the default if <b>patch </b>is conforming to POSIX.

       <b>-B </b><i>pref</i>  or  <b>--prefix=</b><i>pref</i>
          Use the <b>simple </b>method to determine backup file names (see the
          <b>-V </b><i>method</i> or <b>--version-control </b><i>method</i> option), and append <i>pref</i>
          to a file name when generating its backup file name.  For
          example, with <b>-B /junk/ </b>the simple backup file name for
          <b>src/patch/util.c </b>is <b>/junk/src/patch/util.c</b>.

       <b>--binary</b>
          Write all files in binary mode, except for standard output and
          <b>/dev/tty</b>.  When reading, disable the heuristic for
          transforming CRLF line endings into LF line endings.  This
          option is needed on POSIX systems when applying patches
          generated on non-POSIX systems to non-POSIX files.  (On POSIX
          systems, file reads and writes never transform line endings.
          On Windows, reads and writes do transform line endings by
          default, and patches should be generated by <b>diff --binary </b>when
          line endings are significant.)

       <b>-c  </b>or  <b>--context</b>
          Interpret the patch file as a ordinary context diff.

       <b>-d </b><i>dir</i>  or  <b>--directory=</b><i>dir</i>
          Change to the directory <i>dir</i> immediately, before doing anything
          else.

       <b>-D </b><i>define</i>  or  <b>--ifdef=</b><i>define</i>
          Use the <b>#ifdef </b>... <b>#endif </b>construct to mark changes, with
          <i>define</i> as the differentiating symbol.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
          Print the results of applying the patches without actually
          changing any files.

       <b>-e  </b>or  <b>--ed</b>
          Interpret the patch file as an <b>ed </b>script.

       <b>-E  </b>or  <b>--remove-empty-files</b>
          Remove output files that are empty after the patches have been
          applied.  Normally this option is unnecessary, since <b>patch </b>can
          examine the time stamps on the header to determine whether a
          file should exist after patching.  However, if the input is
          not a context diff or if <b>patch </b>is conforming to POSIX, <b>patch</b>
          does not remove empty patched files unless this option is
          given.  When <b>patch </b>removes a file, it also attempts to remove
          any empty ancestor directories.

       <b>-f  </b>or  <b>--force</b>
          Assume that the user knows exactly what he or she is doing,
          and do not ask any questions.  Skip patches whose headers do
          not say which file is to be patched; patch files even though
          they have the wrong version for the <b>Prereq: </b>line in the patch;
          and assume that patches are not reversed even if they look
          like they are.  This option does not suppress commentary; use
          <b>-s </b>for that.

       <b>-F </b><i>num</i>  or  <b>--fuzz=</b><i>num</i>
          Set the maximum fuzz factor.  This option only applies to
          diffs that have context, and causes <b>patch </b>to ignore up to that
          many lines of context in looking for places to install a hunk.
          Note that a larger fuzz factor increases the odds of a faulty
          patch.  The default fuzz factor is 2.  A fuzz factor greater
          than or equal to the number of lines of context in the context
          diff, ordinarily 3, ignores all context.

       <b>-g </b><i>num</i>  or  <b>--get=</b><i>num</i>
          This option controls <b>patch</b>'s actions when a file is under RCS
          or SCCS control, and does not exist or is read-only and
          matches the default version, or when a file is under ClearCase
          or Perforce control and does not exist.  If <i>num</i> is positive,
          <b>patch </b>gets (or checks out) the file from the revision control
          system; if zero, <b>patch </b>ignores RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, and
          SCCS and does not get the file; and if negative, <b>patch </b>asks
          the user whether to get the file.  The default value of this
          option is given by the value of the <b>PATCH_GET </b>environment
          variable if it is set; if not, the default value is zero.

       <b>--help</b>
          Print a summary of options and exit.

       <b>-i </b><i>patchfile</i>  or  <b>--input=</b><i>patchfile</i>
          Read the patch from <i>patchfile</i>.  If <i>patchfile</i> is <b>-</b>, read from
          standard input, the default.

       <b>-l  </b>or  <b>--ignore-whitespace</b>
          Match patterns loosely, in case tabs or spaces have been
          munged in your files.  Any sequence of one or more blanks in
          the patch file matches any sequence in the original file, and
          sequences of blanks at the ends of lines are ignored.  Normal
          characters must still match exactly.  Each line of the context
          must still match a line in the original file.

       <b>--merge </b>or <b>--merge=merge </b>or <b>--merge=diff3</b>
          Merge a patch file into the original files similar to <a href="diff3.1.html">diff3(1)</a>
          or <b>merge</b>(1).  If a conflict is found, <b>patch </b>outputs a warning
          and brackets the conflict with <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; </b>and <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </b>lines.  A
          typical conflict will look like this:

              <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>
              <i>lines from the original file</i>
              <b>|||||||</b>
              <i>original lines from the patch</i>
              <b>=======</b>
              <i>new lines from the patch</i>
              <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>

          The optional argument of <b>--merge </b>determines the output format
          for conflicts: the diff3 format shows the <b>||||||| </b>section with
          the original lines from the patch; in the merge format, this
          section is missing.  The merge format is the default.

          This option implies <b>--forward </b>and does not take the <b>--fuzz</b>=<i>num</i>
          option into account.

       <b>-n  </b>or  <b>--normal</b>
          Interpret the patch file as a normal diff.

       <b>-N  </b>or  <b>--forward</b>
          When a patch does not apply, patch usually checks if the patch
          looks like it has been applied already by trying to reverse-
          apply the first hunk.  The <b>--forward </b>option prevents that.
          See also <b>-R</b>.

       <b>-o </b><i>outfile</i>  or  <b>--output=</b><i>outfile</i>
          Send output to <i>outfile</i> instead of patching files in place.  Do
          not use this option if <i>outfile</i> is one of the files to be
          patched.  When <i>outfile</i> is <b>-</b>, send output to standard output,
          and send any messages that would usually go to standard output
          to standard error.

       <b>-p</b><i>num</i>  or  <b>--strip=</b><i>num</i>
          Strip the smallest prefix containing <i>num</i> leading slashes from
          each file name found in the patch file.  A sequence of one or
          more adjacent slashes is counted as a single slash.  This
          controls how file names found in the patch file are treated,
          in case you keep your files in a different directory than the
          person who sent out the patch.  For example, supposing the
          file name in the patch file was

          <b>/u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</b>

       setting <b>-p0 </b>gives the entire file name unmodified, <b>-p1 </b>gives

          <b>u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c</b>

       without the leading slash, <b>-p4 </b>gives

          <b>blurfl/blurfl.c</b>

       and not specifying <b>-p </b>at all just gives you <b>blurfl.c</b>.  Whatever
       you end up with is looked for either in the current directory, or
       the directory specified by the <b>-d </b>option.

       <b>--posix</b>
          Conform more strictly to the POSIX standard, as follows.

           <b>• </b>Take the first existing file from the list (old, new,
             index) when intuiting file names from diff headers.

           <b>• </b>Do not remove files that are empty after patching.

           <b>• </b>Do not ask whether to get files from RCS, ClearCase,
             Perforce, or SCCS.

           <b>• </b>Require that all options precede the files in the command
             line.

           <b>• </b>Do not backup files when there is a mismatch.

       <b>--quoting-style=</b><i>word</i>
          Use style <i>word</i> to quote output names.  The <i>word</i> should be one
          of the following:

          <b>literal</b>
                 Output names as-is.

          <b>shell  </b>Quote names for the shell if they contain shell
                 metacharacters or would cause ambiguous output.

          <b>shell-always</b>
                 Quote names for the shell, even if they would normally
                 not require quoting.

          <b>c      </b>Quote names as for a C language string.

          <b>escape </b>Quote as with <b>c </b>except omit the surrounding double-
                 quote characters.

          You can specify the default value of the <b>--quoting-style</b>
          option with the environment variable <b>QUOTING_STYLE</b>.  If that
          environment variable is not set, the default value is <b>shell</b>.

       <b>-r </b><i>rejectfile</i>  or  <b>--reject-file=</b><i>rejectfile</i>
          Put rejects into <i>rejectfile</i> instead of the default <b>.rej </b>file.
          When <i>rejectfile</i> is <b>-</b>, discard rejects.

       <b>-R  </b>or  <b>--reverse</b>
          Assume that this patch was created with the old and new files
          swapped.  (Yes, I'm afraid that does happen occasionally,
          human nature being what it is.)  <b>patch </b>attempts to swap each
          hunk around before applying it.  Rejects come out in the
          swapped format.  The <b>-R </b>option does not work with <b>ed </b>diff
          scripts because there is too little information to reconstruct
          the reverse operation.

          If the first hunk of a patch fails, <b>patch </b>reverses the hunk to
          see if it can be applied that way.  If it can, you are asked
          if you want to have the <b>-R </b>option set.  If it can't, the patch
          continues to be applied normally.  (Note: this method cannot
          detect a reversed patch if it is a normal diff and if the
          first command is an append (i.e. it should have been a delete)
          since appends always succeed, due to the fact that a null
          context matches anywhere.  Luckily, most patches add or change
          lines rather than delete them, so most reversed normal diffs
          begin with a delete, which fails, triggering the heuristic.)

       <b>--read-only=</b><i>behavior</i>
          Behave as requested when trying to modify a read-only file:
          <b>ignore </b>the potential problem, <b>warn </b>about it (the default), or
          <b>fail</b>.

       <b>--reject-format=</b><i>format</i>
          Produce reject files in the specified <i>format</i> (either <b>context</b>
          or <b>unified</b>).  Without this option, rejected hunks come out in
          unified diff format if the input patch was of that format,
          otherwise in ordinary context diff form.

       <b>-s  </b>or  <b>--silent  </b>or  <b>--quiet</b>
          Work silently, unless an error occurs.

       <b>--follow-symlinks</b>
          When looking for input files, follow symbolic links.  Replaces
          the symbolic links, instead of modifying the files the
          symbolic links point to.  Git-style patches to symbolic links
          will no longer apply.  This option exists for backwards
          compatibility with previous versions of patch; its use is
          discouraged.

       <b>-t  </b>or  <b>--batch</b>
          Suppress questions like <b>-f</b>, but make some different
          assumptions: skip patches whose headers do not contain file
          names (the same as <b>-f</b>); skip patches for which the file has
          the wrong version for the <b>Prereq: </b>line in the patch; and
          assume that patches are reversed if they look like they are.

       <b>-T  </b>or  <b>--set-time</b>
          Set the modification and access times of patched files from
          time stamps given in context diff headers.  Unless specified
          in the time stamps, assume that the context diff headers use
          local time.

          Use of this option with time stamps that do not include time
          zones is not recommended, because patches using local time
          cannot easily be used by people in other time zones, and
          because local time stamps are ambiguous when local clocks move
          backwards during daylight-saving time adjustments.  Make sure
          that time stamps include time zones, or generate patches with
          UTC and use the <b>-Z </b>or <b>--set-utc </b>option instead.

       <b>-u  </b>or  <b>--unified</b>
          Interpret the patch file as a unified context diff.

       <b>-v  </b>or  <b>--version</b>
          Print out <b>patch</b>'s revision header and patch level, and exit.

       <b>-V </b><i>method</i>  or  <b>--version-control=</b><i>method</i>
          Use <i>method</i> to determine backup file names.  The method can
          also be given by the <b>PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL </b>(or, if that's not
          set, the <b>VERSION_CONTROL</b>) environment variable, which is
          overridden by this option.  The method does not affect whether
          backup files are made; it affects only the names of any backup
          files that are made.

          The value of <i>method</i> is like the GNU Emacs `version-control'
          variable; <b>patch </b>also recognizes synonyms that are more
          descriptive.  The valid values for <i>method</i> are (unique
          abbreviations are accepted):

          <b>existing  </b>or  <b>nil</b>
             Make numbered backups of files that already have them,
             otherwise simple backups.  This is the default.

          <b>numbered  </b>or  <b>t</b>
             Make numbered backups.  The numbered backup file name for <i>F</i>
             is <i>F</i><b>.~</b><i>N</i><b>~ </b>where <i>N</i> is the version number.

          <b>simple  </b>or  <b>never</b>
             Make simple backups.  The <b>-B </b>or <b>--prefix</b>, <b>-Y </b>or
             <b>--basename-prefix</b>, and <b>-z </b>or <b>--suffix </b>options specify the
             simple backup file name.  If none of these options are
             given, then a simple backup suffix is used; it is the value
             of the <b>SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX </b>environment variable if set,
             and is <b>.orig </b>otherwise.

          With numbered or simple backups, if the backup file name is
          too long, the backup suffix <b>~ </b>is used instead; if even
          appending <b>~ </b>would make the name too long, then <b>~ </b>replaces the
          last character of the file name.

       <b>--verbose</b>
          Output extra information about the work being done.

       <b>-x </b><i>num</i>  or  <b>--debug=</b><i>num</i>
          Set internal debugging flags of interest only to <b>patch</b>
          patchers.

       <b>-Y </b><i>pref</i>  or  <b>--basename-prefix=</b><i>pref</i>
          Use the <b>simple </b>method to determine backup file names (see the
          <b>-V </b><i>method</i> or <b>--version-control </b><i>method</i> option), and prefix <i>pref</i>
          to the basename of a file name when generating its backup file
          name.  For example, with <b>-Y .del/ </b>the simple backup file name
          for <b>src/patch/util.c </b>is <b>src/patch/.del/util.c</b>.

       <b>-z </b><i>suffix</i>  or  <b>--suffix=</b><i>suffix</i>
          Use the <b>simple </b>method to determine backup file names (see the
          <b>-V </b><i>method</i> or <b>--version-control </b><i>method</i> option), and use <i>suffix</i>
          as the suffix.  For example, with <b>-z - </b>the backup file name
          for <b>src/patch/util.c </b>is <b>src/patch/util.c-</b>.

       <b>-Z  </b>or  <b>--set-utc</b>
          Set the modification and access times of patched files from
          time stamps given in context diff headers. Unless specified in
          the time stamps, assume that the context diff headers use
          Coordinated Universal Time (UTC, often known as GMT).  Also
          see the <b>-T </b>or <b>--set-time </b>option.

          The <b>-Z </b>or <b>--set-utc </b>and <b>-T </b>or <b>--set-time </b>options normally
          refrain from setting a file's time if the file's original time
          does not match the time given in the patch header, or if its
          contents do not match the patch exactly.  However, if the <b>-f</b>
          or <b>--force </b>option is given, the file time is set regardless.

          Due to the limitations of <b>diff </b>output format, these options
          cannot update the times of files whose contents have not
          changed.  Also, if you use these options, you should remove
          (e.g. with <b>make clean</b>) all files that depend on the patched
          files, so that later invocations of <b>make </b>do not get confused
          by the patched files' times.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PATCH_GET</b>
          This specifies whether <b>patch </b>gets missing or read-only files
          from RCS, ClearCase, Perforce, or SCCS by default; see the <b>-g</b>
          or <b>--get </b>option.

       <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>
          If set, <b>patch </b>conforms more strictly to the POSIX standard by
          default: see the <b>--posix </b>option.

       <b>QUOTING_STYLE</b>
          Default value of the <b>--quoting-style </b>option.

       <b>SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX</b>
          Extension to use for simple backup file names instead of
          <b>.orig</b>.

       <b>TMPDIR</b>, <b>TMP</b>, <b>TEMP</b>
          Directory to put temporary files in; <b>patch </b>uses the first
          environment variable in this list that is set.  If none are
          set, the default is system-dependent; it is normally <b>/tmp </b>on
          Unix hosts.

       <b>VERSION_CONTROL </b>or <b>PATCH_VERSION_CONTROL</b>
          Selects version control style; see the <b>-v </b>or <b>--version-control</b>
          option.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$TMPDIR</i><b>/p*</b>

NOTES FOR PATCH SENDERS </h2>
<pre>
       There are several things you should bear in mind if you are going
       to be sending out patches.

       Create your patch systematically.  A good method is the command
       <b>diff -Naur </b><i>old new</i> where <i>old</i> and <i>new</i> identify the old and new
       directories.  The names <i>old</i> and <i>new</i> should not contain any
       slashes.  The <b>diff </b>command's headers should have dates and times
       in Universal Time using traditional Unix format, so that patch
       recipients can use the <b>-Z </b>or <b>--set-utc </b>option.  Here is an
       example command, using Bourne shell syntax:

              <b>LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC0 diff -Naur gcc-2.7 gcc-2.8</b>

       Tell your recipients how to apply the patch by telling them which
       directory to <b>cd </b>to, and which <b>patch </b>options to use.  The option
       string <b>-Np1 </b>is recommended.  Test your procedure by pretending to
       be a recipient and applying your patch to a copy of the original
       files.

       You can save people a lot of grief by keeping a <b>patchlevel.h </b>file
       which is patched to increment the patch level as the first diff
       in the patch file you send out.  If you put a <b>Prereq: </b>line in
       with the patch, it won't let them apply patches out of order
       without some warning.

       You can create a file by sending out a diff that compares
       <b>/dev/null </b>or an empty file dated the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00
       UTC) to the file you want to create.  This only works if the file
       you want to create doesn't exist already in the target directory.
       Conversely, you can remove a file by sending out a context diff
       that compares the file to be deleted with an empty file dated the
       Epoch.  The file will be removed unless <b>patch </b>is conforming to
       POSIX and the <b>-E </b>or <b>--remove-empty-files </b>option is not given.  An
       easy way to generate patches that create and remove files is to
       use GNU <b>diff</b>'s <b>-N </b>or <b>--new-file </b>option.

       If the recipient is supposed to use the <b>-p</b><i>N</i> option, do not send
       output that looks like this:

              diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README prog/README
              --- v2.0.29/prog/README   Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997
              +++ prog/README   Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997

       because the two file names have different numbers of slashes, and
       different versions of <b>patch </b>interpret the file names differently.
       To avoid confusion, send output that looks like this instead:

              diff -Naur v2.0.29/prog/README v2.0.30/prog/README
              --- v2.0.29/prog/README   Mon Mar 10 15:13:12 1997
              +++ v2.0.30/prog/README   Mon Mar 17 14:58:22 1997

       Avoid sending patches that compare backup file names like
       <b>README.orig</b>, since this might confuse <b>patch </b>into patching a
       backup file instead of the real file.  Instead, send patches that
       compare the same base file names in different directories, e.g.
       <b>old/README </b>and <b>new/README</b>.

       Take care not to send out reversed patches, since it makes people
       wonder whether they already applied the patch.

       Try not to have your patch modify derived files (e.g. the file
       <b>configure </b>where there is a line <b>configure: configure.in </b>in your
       makefile), since the recipient should be able to regenerate the
       derived files anyway.  If you must send diffs of derived files,
       generate the diffs using UTC, have the recipients apply the patch
       with the <b>-Z </b>or <b>--set-utc </b>option, and have them remove any
       unpatched files that depend on patched files (e.g. with
       <b>make clean</b>).

       While you may be able to get away with putting 582 diff listings
       into one file, it may be wiser to group related patches into
       separate files in case something goes haywire.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       Diagnostics generally indicate that <b>patch </b>couldn't parse your
       patch file.

       If the <b>--verbose </b>option is given, the message <b>Hmm... </b>indicates
       that there is unprocessed text in the patch file and that <b>patch</b>
       is attempting to intuit whether there is a patch in that text
       and, if so, what kind of patch it is.

       <b>patch</b>'s exit status is 0 if all hunks are applied successfully, 1
       if some hunks cannot be applied or there were merge conflicts,
       and 2 if there is more serious trouble.  When applying a set of
       patches in a loop it behooves you to check this exit status so
       you don't apply a later patch to a partially patched file.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       Context diffs cannot reliably represent the creation or deletion
       of empty files, empty directories, or special files such as
       symbolic links.  Nor can they represent changes to file metadata
       like ownership, permissions, or whether one file is a hard link
       to another.  If changes like these are also required, separate
       instructions (e.g. a shell script) to accomplish them should
       accompany the patch.

       <b>patch </b>cannot tell if the line numbers are off in an <b>ed </b>script,
       and can detect bad line numbers in a normal diff only when it
       finds a change or deletion.  A context diff using fuzz factor 3
       may have the same problem.  You should probably do a context diff
       in these cases to see if the changes made sense.  Of course,
       compiling without errors is a pretty good indication that the
       patch worked, but not always.

       <b>patch </b>usually produces the correct results, even when it has to
       do a lot of guessing.  However, the results are guaranteed to be
       correct only when the patch is applied to exactly the same
       version of the file that the patch was generated from.
</pre> <h2>
COMPATIBILITY ISSUES </h2>
<pre>
       The POSIX standard specifies behavior that differs from <b>patch</b>'s
       traditional behavior.  You should be aware of these differences
       if you must interoperate with <b>patch </b>versions 2.1 and earlier,
       which do not conform to POSIX.

        <b>• </b>In traditional <b>patch</b>, the <b>-p </b>option's operand was optional,
          and a bare <b>-p </b>was equivalent to <b>-p0.  </b>The <b>-p </b>option now
          requires an operand, and <b>-p 0 </b>is now equivalent to <b>-p0</b>.  For
          maximum compatibility, use options like <b>-p0 </b>and <b>-p1</b>.

          Also, traditional <b>patch </b>simply counted slashes when stripping
          path prefixes; <b>patch </b>now counts pathname components.  That is,
          a sequence of one or more adjacent slashes now counts as a
          single slash.  For maximum portability, avoid sending patches
          containing <b>// </b>in file names.

        <b>• </b>In traditional <b>patch</b>, backups were enabled by default.  This
          behavior is now enabled with the <b>-b </b>or <b>--backup </b>option.

          Conversely, in POSIX <b>patch</b>, backups are never made, even when
          there is a mismatch.  In GNU <b>patch</b>, this behavior is enabled
          with the <b>--no-backup-if-mismatch </b>option, or by conforming to
          POSIX with the <b>--posix </b>option or by setting the
          <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT </b>environment variable.

          The <b>-b </b><i>suffix</i> option of traditional <b>patch </b>is equivalent to the
          <b>-b -z </b><i>suffix</i> options of GNU <b>patch</b>.

        <b>• </b>Traditional <b>patch </b>used a complicated (and incompletely
          documented) method to intuit the name of the file to be
          patched from the patch header.  This method did not conform to
          POSIX, and had a few gotchas.  Now <b>patch </b>uses a different,
          equally complicated (but better documented) method that is
          optionally POSIX-conforming; we hope it has fewer gotchas.
          The two methods are compatible if the file names in the
          context diff header and the <b>Index: </b>line are all identical
          after prefix-stripping.  Your patch is normally compatible if
          each header's file names all contain the same number of
          slashes.

        <b>• </b>When traditional <b>patch </b>asked the user a question, it sent the
          question to standard error and looked for an answer from the
          first file in the following list that was a terminal: standard
          error, standard output, <b>/dev/tty</b>, and standard input.  Now
          <b>patch </b>sends questions to standard output and gets answers from
          <b>/dev/tty</b>.  Defaults for some answers have been changed so that
          <b>patch </b>never goes into an infinite loop when using default
          answers.

        <b>• </b>Traditional <b>patch </b>exited with a status value that counted the
          number of bad hunks, or with status 1 if there was real
          trouble.  Now <b>patch </b>exits with status 1 if some hunks failed,
          or with 2 if there was real trouble.

        <b>• </b>Limit yourself to the following options when sending
          instructions meant to be executed by anyone running GNU <b>patch</b>,
          traditional <b>patch</b>, or a <b>patch </b>that conforms to POSIX.  Spaces
          are significant in the following list, and operands are
          required.

             <b>-c</b>
             <b>-d </b><i>dir</i>
             <b>-D </b><i>define</i>
             <b>-e</b>
             <b>-l</b>
             <b>-n</b>
             <b>-N</b>
             <b>-o </b><i>outfile</i>
             <b>-p</b><i>num</i>
             <b>-R</b>
             <b>-r </b><i>rejectfile</i>
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Please report bugs via email to <b>&lt;bug-patch@gnu.org&gt;</b>.

       If code has been duplicated (for instance with <b>#ifdef OLDCODE </b>...
       <b>#else ... #endif</b>), <b>patch </b>is incapable of patching both versions,
       and, if it works at all, will likely patch the wrong one, and
       tell you that it succeeded to boot.

       If you apply a patch you've already applied, <b>patch </b>thinks it is a
       reversed patch, and offers to un-apply the patch.  This could be
       construed as a feature.

       Computing how to merge a hunk is significantly harder than using
       the standard fuzzy algorithm.  Bigger hunks, more context, a
       bigger offset from the original location, and a worse match all
       slow the algorithm down.
