NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-build-update-repo - Create a repository from a build
       directory
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak build-update-repo </b>[OPTION...] LOCATION
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Updates repository metadata for the repository at LOCATION. This
       command generates an OSTree summary file that lists the contents
       of the repository. The summary is used by flatpak remote-ls and
       other commands to display the contents of remote repositories.

       After this command, LOCATION can be used as the repository
       location for flatpak remote-add, either by exporting it over
       http, or directly with a file: url.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>--redirect-url=URL</b>
           Redirect this repo to a new URL.

       <b>--title=TITLE</b>
           A title for the repository, e.g. for display in a UI. The
           title is stored in the repository summary.

       <b>--comment=COMMENT</b>
           A single-line comment for the remote, e.g. for display in a
           UI. The comment is stored in the repository summary.

       <b>--description=DESCRIPTION</b>
           A full-paragraph description for the remote, e.g. for display
           in a UI. The description is stored in the repository summary.

       <b>--homepage=URL</b>
           URL for a website for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI.
           The url is stored in the repository summary.

       <b>--icon=URL</b>
           URL for an icon for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI. The
           url is stored in the repository summary.

       <b>--default-branch=BRANCH</b>
           A default branch for the repository, mainly for use in a UI.

       <b>--gpg-import=FILE</b>
           Import a new default GPG public key from the given file.

       <b>--collection-id=COLLECTION-ID</b>
           The globally unique identifier of the remote repository, to
           allow mirrors to be grouped. This must be set to a globally
           unique reverse DNS string if the repository is to be made
           publicly available. If a collection ID is already set on an
           existing repository, this will update it. If not specified,
           the existing collection ID will be left unchanged.

       <b>--deploy-collection-id</b>
           Deploy the collection ID (set using <b>--collection-id</b>) in the
           static remote configuration for all clients. This is
           irrevocable once published in a repository. Use it to decide
           when to roll out a collection ID to users of an existing
           repository. If constructing a new repository which has a
           collection ID, you should typically always pass this option.

       <b>--deploy-sideload-collection-id</b>
           This is similar to --deploy-collection-id, but it only
           applies the deploy to clients newer than flatpak 1.7 which
           supports the new form of sideloads.

       <b>--gpg-sign=KEYID</b>
           Sign the commit with this GPG key. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--gpg-homedir=PATH</b>
           GPG Homedir to use when looking for keyrings

       <b>--generate-static-deltas</b>
           Generate static deltas for all references. This generates
           from-empty and delta static files that allow for faster
           download.

       <b>--static-delta-jobs=NUM-JOBS</b>
           Limit the number of parallel jobs creating static deltas. The
           default is the number of cpus.

       <b>--static-delta-ignore-ref=PATTERN</b>
           Don't generate deltas for runtime or application id matching
           this pattern. For instance,
           --static-delta-ignore-ref=*.Sources means there will not be
           any deltas for source refs.

       <b>--prune</b>
           Remove unreferenced objects in repo.

       <b>--prune-depth</b>
           Only keep at most this number of old versions for any
           particular ref. Default is -1 which means infinite.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
