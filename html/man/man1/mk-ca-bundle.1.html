NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mk-ca-bundle - convert Mozilla's certificate bundle to PEM format
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       mk-ca-bundle [options] [output]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This tool downloads the <i>certdata.txt</i> file from Mozilla's source
       tree over HTTPS, then parses it and extracts the included
       certificates into PEM format.  By default, only CA root
       certificates trusted to issue SSL server authentication
       certificates are extracted. These are then processed with the
       OpenSSL command line tool to produce the final ca-bundle output
       file.

       The default <i>output</i> name is <b>ca-bundle.crt</b>. By setting it to '-' (a
       single dash) you get the output sent to STDOUT instead of a file.

       The PEM format this scripts uses for output makes the result
       readily available for use by just about all OpenSSL or GnuTLS
       powered applications, such as curl and others.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are supported:

       -b     backup an existing version of <i>output</i>

       -d [name]
              specify which Mozilla tree to pull <i>certdata.txt</i> from (or a
              custom URL).  Valid names are: <b>aurora</b>, <b>beta</b>, <b>central</b>,
              <b>Mozilla</b>, <b>nss</b>, <b>release </b>(default). They are shortcuts for
              which source tree to get the certificate data from.

       -f     force rebuild even if <i>certdata.txt</i> is current (Added in
              version 1.17)

       -i     print version info about used modules

       -k     Allow insecure data transfer. By default (since 1.27) this
              command fails if the HTTPS transfer fails. This overrides
              that decision (and opens for man-in-the-middle attacks).

       -l     print license info about <i>certdata.txt</i>

       -m     (Added in 1.26) Include meta data comments in the output.
              The meta data is specific information about each
              certificate that is stored in the original file as
              comments and using this option makes those comments get
              passed on to the output file. The meta data is not parsed
              in any way by mk-ca-bundle.

       -n     Do not download <i>certdata.txt</i> - use the existing.

       -p [purposes]:[levels]
              list of Mozilla trust purposes and levels for certificates
              to include in output. Takes the form of a comma separated
              list of purposes, a colon, and a comma separated list of
              levels. The default is to include all certificates trusted
              to issue SSL Server certificates
              (<i>SERVER_AUTH:TRUSTED_DELEGATOR</i>).

              Valid purposes are: <b>ALL</b>, <b>DIGITAL_SIGNATURE</b>,
              <b>NON_REPUDIATION</b>, <b>KEY_ENCIPHERMENT</b>, <b>DATA_ENCIPHERMENT</b>,
              <b>KEY_AGREEMENT</b>, <b>KEY_CERT_SIGN</b>, <b>CRL_SIGN</b>, <b>SERVER_AUTH</b>
              (default), <b>CLIENT_AUTH</b>, <b>CODE_SIGNING</b>, <b>EMAIL_PROTECTION</b>,
              <b>IPSEC_END_SYSTEM</b>, <b>IPSEC_TUNNEL</b>, <b>IPSEC_USER</b>, <b>TIME_STAMPING</b>,
              <b>STEP_UP_APPROVED</b>

              Valid trust levels are: <b>ALL</b>, <b>TRUSTED_DELEGATOR </b>(default),
              <b>NOT_TRUSTED</b>, <b>MUST_VERIFY_TRUST</b>, <b>TRUSTED</b>

       -q     be really quiet (no progress output at all)

       -t     include plain text listing of certificates

       -s [algorithms]
              A comma separated list of signature algorithms with which
              to hash/fingerprint each certificate and output when run
              in plain text mode.

              Valid algorithms are: ALL, NONE, MD5 (default), SHA1,
              SHA256, SHA384, SHA512

       -u     unlink (remove) <i>certdata.txt</i> after processing

       -v     be verbose and print out processed certificate authorities

       Returns 0 on success. Returns 1 if it fails to download data.
