NAME </h2>
<pre>
       getopts — parse utility options
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       getopts <i>optstring name</i> <b>[</b><i>arg</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getopts</i> utility shall retrieve options and option-arguments
       from a list of parameters. It shall support the Utility Syntax
       Guidelines 3 to 10, inclusive, described in the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       Each time it is invoked, the <i>getopts</i> utility shall place the
       value of the next option in the shell variable specified by the
       <i>name</i> operand and the index of the next argument to be processed
       in the shell variable <i>OPTIND</i>.  Whenever the shell is invoked,
       <i>OPTIND</i> shall be initialized to 1.

       When the option requires an option-argument, the <i>getopts</i> utility
       shall place it in the shell variable <i>OPTARG</i>.  If no option was
       found, or if the option that was found does not have an option-
       argument, <i>OPTARG</i> shall be unset.

       If an option character not contained in the <i>optstring</i> operand is
       found where an option character is expected, the shell variable
       specified by <i>name</i> shall be set to the &lt;question-mark&gt; (<b>'?'</b>)
       character. In this case, if the first character in <i>optstring</i> is a
       &lt;colon&gt; (<b>':'</b>), the shell variable <i>OPTARG</i> shall be set to the
       option character found, but no output shall be written to
       standard error; otherwise, the shell variable <i>OPTARG</i> shall be
       unset and a diagnostic message shall be written to standard
       error. This condition shall be considered to be an error detected
       in the way arguments were presented to the invoking application,
       but shall not be an error in <i>getopts</i> processing.

       If an option-argument is missing:

        *  If the first character of <i>optstring</i> is a &lt;colon&gt;, the shell
           variable specified by <i>name</i> shall be set to the &lt;colon&gt;
           character and the shell variable <i>OPTARG</i> shall be set to the
           option character found.

        *  Otherwise, the shell variable specified by <i>name</i> shall be set
           to the &lt;question-mark&gt; character, the shell variable <i>OPTARG</i>
           shall be unset, and a diagnostic message shall be written to
           standard error. This condition shall be considered to be an
           error detected in the way arguments were presented to the
           invoking application, but shall not be an error in <i>getopts</i>
           processing; a diagnostic message shall be written as stated,
           but the exit status shall be zero.

       When the end of options is encountered, the <i>getopts</i> utility shall
       exit with a return value greater than zero; the shell variable
       <i>OPTIND</i> shall be set to the index of the first operand, or the
       value <b>"$#"</b>+1 if there are no operands; the <i>name</i> variable shall be
       set to the &lt;question-mark&gt; character. Any of the following shall
       identify the end of options: the first <b>"--" </b>argument that is not
       an option-argument, finding an argument that is not an option-
       argument and does not begin with a <b>'-'</b>, or encountering an error.

       The shell variables <i>OPTIND</i> and <i>OPTARG</i> shall be local to the
       caller of <i>getopts</i> and shall not be exported by default.

       The shell variable specified by the <i>name</i> operand, <i>OPTIND</i>, and
       <i>OPTARG</i> shall affect the current shell execution environment; see
       <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>.

       If the application sets <i>OPTIND</i> to the value 1, a new set of
       parameters can be used: either the current positional parameters
       or new <i>arg</i> values. Any other attempt to invoke <i>getopts</i> multiple
       times in a single shell execution environment with parameters
       (positional parameters or <i>arg</i> operands) that are not the same in
       all invocations, or with an <i>OPTIND</i> value modified to be a value
       other than 1, produces unspecified results.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>optstring</i> A string containing the option characters recognized by
                 the utility invoking <i>getopts</i>.  If a character is
                 followed by a &lt;colon&gt;, the option shall be expected to
                 have an argument, which should be supplied as a
                 separate argument. Applications should specify an
                 option character and its option-argument as separate
                 arguments, but <i>getopts</i> shall interpret the characters
                 following an option character requiring arguments as an
                 argument whether or not this is done. An explicit null
                 option-argument need not be recognized if it is not
                 supplied as a separate argument when <i>getopts</i> is
                 invoked. (See also the <i>getopt</i>() function defined in the
                 System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017.) The
                 characters &lt;question-mark&gt; and &lt;colon&gt; shall not be
                 used as option characters by an application. The use of
                 other option characters that are not alphanumeric
                 produces unspecified results. If the option-argument is
                 not supplied as a separate argument from the option
                 character, the value in <i>OPTARG</i> shall be stripped of the
                 option character and the <b>'-'</b>.  The first character in
                 <i>optstring</i> determines how <i>getopts</i> behaves if an option
                 character is not known or an option-argument is
                 missing.

       <i>name</i>      The name of a shell variable that shall be set by the
                 <i>getopts</i> utility to the option character that was found.

       The <i>getopts</i> utility by default shall parse positional parameters
       passed to the invoking shell procedure. If <i>arg</i>s are given, they
       shall be parsed instead of the positional parameters.

       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>getopts</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>OPTIND</i>    This variable shall be used by the <i>getopts</i> utility as
                 the index of the next argument to be processed.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       Whenever an error is detected and the first character in the
       <i>optstring</i> operand is not a &lt;colon&gt; (<b>':'</b>), a diagnostic message
       shall be written to standard error with the following information
       in an unspecified format:

        *  The invoking program name shall be identified in the message.
           The invoking program name shall be the value of the shell
           special parameter 0 (see <i>Section 2.5.2</i>, <i>Special Parameters</i>)
           at the time the <i>getopts</i> utility is invoked. A name equivalent
           to:

               basename "$0"

           may be used.

        *  If an option is found that was not specified in <i>optstring</i>,
           this error is identified and the invalid option character
           shall be identified in the message.

        *  If an option requiring an option-argument is found, but an
           option-argument is not found, this error shall be identified
           and the invalid option character shall be identified in the
           message.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    An option, specified or unspecified by <i>optstring</i>, was
             found.

       &gt;0    The end of options was encountered or an error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since <i>getopts</i> affects the current shell execution environment, it
       is generally provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is
       called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment,
       such as one of the following:

           (getopts abc value "$@")
           nohup getopts ...
           find . -exec getopts ... \;

       it does not affect the shell variables in the caller's
       environment.

       Note that shell functions share <i>OPTIND</i> with the calling shell
       even though the positional parameters are changed. If the calling
       shell and any of its functions uses <i>getopts</i> to parse arguments,
       the results are unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following example script parses and displays its arguments:

           aflag=
           bflag=
           while getopts ab: name
           do
               case $name in
               a)    aflag=1;;
               b)    bflag=1
                     bval="$OPTARG";;
               ?)   printf "Usage: %s: [-a] [-b value] args\n" $0
                     exit 2;;
               esac
           done
           if [ ! -z "$aflag" ]; then
               printf "Option -a specified\n"
           fi
           if [ ! -z "$bflag" ]; then
               printf 'Option -b "%s" specified\n' "$bval"
           fi
           shift $(($OPTIND - 1))
           printf "Remaining arguments are: %s\n$*"
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>getopts</i> utility was chosen in preference to the System V
       <i>getopt</i> utility because <i>getopts</i> handles option-arguments
       containing &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       The <i>OPTARG</i> variable is not mentioned in the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       section because it does not affect the execution of <i>getopts</i>; it
       is one of the few ``output-only'' variables used by the standard
       utilities.

       The &lt;colon&gt; is not allowed as an option character because that is
       not historical behavior, and it violates the Utility Syntax
       Guidelines. The &lt;colon&gt; is now specified to behave as in the
       KornShell version of the <i>getopts</i> utility; when used as the first
       character in the <i>optstring</i> operand, it disables diagnostics
       concerning missing option-arguments and unexpected option
       characters. This replaces the use of the <i>OPTERR</i> variable that was
       specified in an early proposal.

       The formats of the diagnostic messages produced by the <i>getopts</i>
       utility and the <i>getopt</i>() function are not fully specified because
       implementations with superior (``friendlier'') formats objected
       to the formats used by some historical implementations. The
       standard developers considered it important that the information
       in the messages used be uniform between <i>getopts</i> and <i>getopt</i>().
       Exact duplication of the messages might not be possible,
       particularly if a utility is built on another system that has a
       different <i>getopt</i>() function, but the messages must have specific
       information included so that the program name, invalid option
       character, and type of error can be distinguished by a user.

       Only a rare application program intercepts a <i>getopts</i> standard
       error message and wants to parse it. Therefore, implementations
       are free to choose the most usable messages they can devise. The
       following formats are used by many historical implementations:

           "%s: illegal option -- %c\n", &lt;<i>program name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>option character</i>&gt;

           "%s: option requires an argument -- %c\n", &lt;<i>program name</i>&gt;, \
               &lt;<i>option character</i>&gt;

       Historical shells with built-in versions of <i>getopt</i>() or <i>getopts</i>
       have used different formats, frequently not even indicating the
       option character found in error.
