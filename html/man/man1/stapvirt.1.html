</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stapvirt - prepare libvirt domains for systemtap probing
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>stapvirt </b>[<b>-c </b><i>URI</i>] [<b>-d </b><i>PATH</i>] [<b>-v</b>] <i>COMMAND ARGUMENTS</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>stapvirt</i> program can be used to add ports to domains managed
       by libvirt (see &lt;<a href="http://libvirt.org/">http://libvirt.org/</a>&gt;).  These ports can then be
       used by <i>stap</i> to run scripts inside the domains (see the '--re‐
       mote' option in <a href="stap.1.html">stap(1)</a> for more information).

       Ports are added to the definition of the domain using the <b>port-</b>
       <b>add </b>command.  These ports can later be removed using the <b>port-re‐</b>
       <b>move </b>command.  Note that there can only be as many simultaneous
       <i>stap</i> sessions as there are ports.

       Starting from libvirt v1.1.1 and QEMU v0.10.0, SystemTap ports
       can be hotplugged and thus do not need to be added first using
       the <b>port-add </b>command.  However, you need to ensure that there is
       a virtio-serial controller in place so that hotplugged ports can
       be connected. If creating a domain using virt-install, you can do
       this by adding this option:

              <b>$ </b>virt-install [...] --controller=virtio-serial

       If the domain has already been created, you can simply do <b>port-</b>
       <b>add </b>followed immediately by <b>port-remove</b>, and then power off and
       restart the domain. The port will be removed, but the controller
       will remain.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are supported. Any other option prints a
       short help message.

       <b>-c </b><i>URI</i> Specify the libvirt driver URI to which to connect (e.g.
              'qemu:///system'). The default value is NULL, which indi‐
              cates to libvirt to connect to the default driver. See the
              page at &lt;<a href="http://libvirt.org/uri.html">http://libvirt.org/uri.html</a>&gt; for supported val‐
              ues.

       <b>-d </b><i>PATH</i>
              Specify the directory in which UNIX sockets should be cre‐
              ated when SystemTap ports are added. The default directory
              is '/var/lib/libvirt/qemu'.

       <b>-v     </b>Increase verbosity. This option may be repeated for more
              verbosity.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are recognized by stapvirt. Any other com‐
       mand prints a short help message.

       <b>help   </b>Display the help message.

       <b>list   </b>List available domains.

       <b>port-add </b><i>DOMAIN</i>
              Add a permanent SystemTap port to the domain's definition.
              If the domain is currently running, it must be powered off
              before changes take effect.

       <b>port-list </b><i>DOMAIN</i>
              List the UNIX socket paths of the permanent SystemTap
              ports in the domain's definition.

       <b>port-remove </b><i>DOMAIN</i>
              Remove a permanent SystemTap port from the domain's defin‐
              ition. If the domain is currently running, it must be pow‐
              ered off before changes take effect.

       <b>query </b><i>DOMAIN</i>
              Display the following information about the domain: its
              name, its UUID, its state, the number of permanent System‐
              Tap ports installed, and whether hotplugging is supported.
</pre> <h2>
TUTORIAL </h2>
<pre>
       This tutorial will help you get started with stapvirt. Let's
       start by listing all the privileged domains on the machine with
       the <b>list </b>command:

              <b>$ </b>stapvirt -c 'qemu:///system' list
              Available domains on URI 'qemu:///system':
              ID      State     Type        Name
              2       running   persistent  TestVM

       Note that we specified the libvirt URI using the -c switch. Oth‐
       erwise libvirt might have defaulted to e.g. 'qemu:///session'.

       Rather than typing the URI everytime, it might be easier to in‐
       stead set the LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI environment variable and omit
       the -c switch. Note that this is a libvirt functionality (see
       &lt;libvirt.org/uri.html&gt; for more details).

       The <b>list </b>command indicates that we have a running domain named
       'TestVM' with ID 2. Let's use the <b>query </b>command to retrieve more
       information:

              <b>$ </b>stapvirt query TestVM # by name
              <b>$ </b>stapvirt query 2      # by ID

                            Name:  TestVM
                            UUID:  905951c0-fa4f-409b-079c-c91ddda27028
                           State:  running
                              ID:  2
                            Type:  persistent
                 Permanent Ports:  0
                     Hotplugging:  not supported

       The <b>query </b>command gives us some basic information about the do‐
       main, such as its name, UUID, and state. More importantly, it
       gives us two pieces of information: the number of permanent ports
       installed, and whether hotplugging is supported.  Technically,
       hotplugging support depends on libvirt and qemu, and is not re‐
       lated to the domain in itself.

       If hotplugging were supported, we could stop here and run <i>stap</i>
       directly (assuming we have a virtio-serial controller already in
       place, see <b>DESCRIPTION</b>). Since in our case hotplugging is not
       supported, we need to add SystemTap ports. To do this, we use the
       <b>port-add </b>command:

              <b>$ </b>stapvirt port-add TestVM
              Added new port org.systemtap.stapsh.0
              The domain must be powered off before changes take effect.

       We can confirm that a port was added by running the <b>query </b>command
       again:

              <b>$ </b>stapvirt query TestVM
              <b>...</b>
                 Permanent Ports:  1
                     Hotplugging:  not supported

       It now indicates that there is 1 permanent port. We can also use
       the <b>port-list </b>command to know exactly where the port will be cre‐
       ated:

              <b>$ </b>stapvirt port-list TestVM
              /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/TestVM.org.systemtap.stapsh.0.sock

       After powering off and restarting the domain, we are now ready to
       use the port with <i>stap</i>:

              <b>$ </b>stap -e 'probe begin { printf("Hello from TestVM!\n"); exit() }' \
                     --remote=libvirt://TestVM
              Hello from TestVM!

       Finally, if we'd like to remove the port, we can use the <b>port-re‐</b>
       <b>move </b>command:

              <b>$ </b>stapvirt port-remove TestVM
              Removed port org.systemtap.stapsh.0
              The domain must be powered off before changes take effect.

       And that's all there is to it!
