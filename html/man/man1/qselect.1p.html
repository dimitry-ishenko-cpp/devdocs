DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       To select a set of batch jobs is to return the batch
       <i>job_identifier</i>s for each batch job that meets a list of selection
       criteria. A set of batch jobs is selected by a request to a batch
       server. The <i>qselect</i> utility is a user-accessible batch client
       that requests the selection of batch jobs.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>qselect</i> utility shall have
       returned a list of zero or more batch <i>job_identifier</i>s that meet
       the criteria specified by the options and option-arguments
       presented to the utility.

       The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select batch jobs by sending a <i>Select</i>
       <i>Jobs Request</i> to a batch server. The <i>qselect</i> utility shall not
       exit until the server replies to each request generated.

       For each option presented to the <i>qselect</i> utility, the utility
       shall restrict the set of selected batch jobs as described in the
       OPTIONS section.

       The <i>qselect</i> utility shall not restrict selection of batch jobs
       except by authorization and as required by the options presented
       to the utility.

       When an option is specified with a mandatory or optional <i>op</i>
       component to the option-argument, then <i>op</i> shall specify a
       relation between the value of a certain batch job attribute and
       the <i>value</i> component of the option-argument. If an <i>op</i> is allowable
       on an option, then the description of the option letter indicates
       the <i>op</i> as either mandatory or optional. Acceptable strings for
       the <i>op</i> component, and the relation the string indicates, are
       shown in the following list:

       .eq.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is equal to the value represented by the option-argument.

       .ge.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is greater than or equal to the value represented by the
               option-argument.

       .gt.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is greater than the value represented by the option-
               argument.

       .lt.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is less than the value represented by the option-
               argument.

       .le.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is less than or equal to the value represented by the
               option-argument.

       .ne.    The value represented by the attribute of the batch job
               is not equal to the value represented by the option-
               argument.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qselect</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-a [</b><i>op</i><b>]</b><i>date_time</i>
                 Restrict selection to a specific time, or a range of
                 times.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs for
                 which the value of the <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute is
                 related to the Epoch equivalent of the local time
                 expressed by the value of the <i>date_time</i> component of
                 the option-argument in the manner indicated by the
                 value of the <i>op</i> component of the option-argument.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept a <i>date_time</i> component
                 of the option-argument that conforms to the syntax of
                 the <i>time</i> operand of the <i>touch</i> utility.

                 If the <i>op</i> component of the option-argument is not
                 presented to the <i>qselect</i> utility, the utility shall
                 select batch jobs for which the <i>Execution_Time</i>
                 attribute is equal to the <i>date_time</i> component of the
                 option-argument.

                 When comparing times, the <i>qselect</i> utility shall use the
                 following definitions for the <i>op</i> component of the
                 option-argument:

                 .eq.    The time represented by value of the
                         <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute of the batch job is
                         equal to the time represented by the <i>date_time</i>
                         component of the option-argument.

                 .ge.    The time represented by value of the
                         <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute of the batch job is
                         after or equal to the time represented by the
                         <i>date_time</i> component of the option-argument.

                 .gt.    The time represented by value of the
                         <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute of the batch job is
                         after the time represented by the <i>date_time</i>
                         component of the option-argument.

                 .lt.    The time represented by value of the
                         <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute of the batch job is
                         before the time represented by the <i>date_time</i>
                         component of the option-argument.

                 .le.    The time represented by value of the
                         <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute of the batch job is
                         before or equal to the time represented by the
                         <i>date_time</i> component of the option-argument.

                 .ne.    The time represented by value of the
                         <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute of the batch job is
                         not equal to the time represented by the
                         <i>date_time</i> component of the option-argument.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept the defined character
                 strings for the <i>op</i> component of the option-argument.

       <b>-A </b><i>account_string</i>
                 Restrict selection to the batch jobs charging a
                 specified account.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs for
                 which the value of the <i>Account_Name</i> attribute of the
                 batch job matches the value of the <i>account_string</i>
                 option-argument.

                 The syntax of the <i>account_string</i> option-argument is
                 unspecified.

       <b>-c [</b><i>op</i><b>]</b><i>interval</i>
                 Restrict selection to batch jobs within a range of
                 checkpoint intervals.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs for
                 which the value of the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute relates to
                 the value of the <i>interval</i> component of the option-
                 argument in the manner indicated by the value of the <i>op</i>
                 component of the option-argument.

                 If the <i>op</i> component of the option-argument is omitted,
                 the <i>qselect</i> utility shall select batch jobs for which
                 the value of the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute is equal to the
                 value of the <i>interval</i> component of the option-argument.

                 When comparing checkpoint intervals, the <i>qselect</i>
                 utility shall use the following definitions for the <i>op</i>
                 component of the option-argument:

                 .eq.    The value of the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute of the
                         batch job equals the value of the <i>interval</i>
                         component of the option-argument.

                 .ge.    The value of the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute of the
                         batch job is greater than or equal to the value
                         of the <i>interval</i> component option-argument.

                 .gt.    The value of the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute of the
                         batch job is greater than the value of the
                         <i>interval</i> component option-argument.

                 .lt.    The value of the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute of the
                         batch job is less than the value of the
                         <i>interval</i> component option-argument.

                 .le.    The value of the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute of the
                         batch job is less than or equal to the value of
                         the <i>interval</i> component option-argument.

                 .ne.    The value of the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute of the
                         batch job does not equal the value of the
                         <i>interval</i> component option-argument.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept the defined character
                 strings for the <i>op</i> component of the option-argument.

                 The ordering relationship for the values of the
                 interval option-argument is defined to be:

                     `n' .gt. `s' .gt. `c=<i>minutes</i>' .ge. `c'

                 When comparing <i>Checkpoint</i> attributes with an interval
                 having the value of the single character <b>'u'</b>, only
                 equality or inequality are valid comparisons.

       <b>-h </b><i>hold_list</i>
                 Restrict selection to batch jobs that have a specific
                 type of hold.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs for
                 which the value of the <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute matches the
                 value of the <i>hold_list</i> option-argument.

                 The <i>qselect</i> <b>-h </b>option shall accept a value for the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                 (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <i>Section 6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>).

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept a value for the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument that is a string of one or
                 more of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, or <b>'o'</b>, or the single
                 character <b>'n'</b>.

                 Each unique character in the <i>hold_list</i> option-argument
                 of the <i>qselect</i> utility is defined as follows, each
                 representing a different hold type:

                 u     USER

                 s     SYSTEM

                 o     OPERATOR

                 If any of these characters are duplicated in the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument, the duplicates shall be
                 ignored.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall consider it an error if any
                 hold type other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with hold type
                 <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                 of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument. The <i>qselect</i> utility shall
                 permit the repetition of characters, but shall not
                 assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other hold types. The
                 conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe any additional hold types, how they are
                 specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                 the behavior of the utility.

       <b>-l </b><i>resource_list</i>
                 Restrict selection to batch jobs with specified
                 resource limits and attributes.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept a <i>resource_list</i>
                 option-argument with the following syntax:

                     <i>resource_name op value</i> <b>[</b>,,<i>resource_name op value</i>,, ...<b>]</b>

                 When comparing resource values, the <i>qselect</i> utility
                 shall use the following definitions for the <i>op</i>
                 component of the option-argument:

                 .eq.    The value of the resource of the same name in

                         the <i>Resource_List</i> attribute of the batch job is
                         less than the value of the value component of
                         the option-argument.

                 .ne.    The value of the resource of the same name in
                         the <i>Resource_List</i> attribute of the batch job
                         does not equal the value of the value component
                         of the option-argument.

                         component of the option-argument.

                 When comparing the limit of a <i>Resource_List</i> attribute
                 with the <i>value</i> component of the option-argument, if the
                 limit, the value, or both are non-numeric, only
                 equality or inequality are valid comparisons.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs for
                 which the values of the <i>resource_name</i>s listed in the
                 <i>resource_list</i> option-argument match the corresponding
                 limits of the <i>Resource_List</i> attribute of the batch job.

                 Limits of <i>resource_name</i>s present in the <i>Resource_List</i>
                 attribute of the batch job that have no corresponding
                 values in the <i>resource_list</i> option-argument shall not
                 be considered when selecting batch jobs.

       <b>-N </b><i>name</i>   Restrict selection to batch jobs with a specified name.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs for
                 which the value of the <i>Job_Name</i> attribute matches the
                 value of the <i>name</i> option-argument. The string specified
                 in the <i>name</i> option-argument shall be passed,
                 uninterpreted, to the server. This allows an
                 implementation to match ``wildcard'' patterns against
                 batch job names.

                 An implementation shall describe in the conformance
                 document the format it supports for matching against
                 the <i>Job_Name</i> attribute.

       <b>-p [</b><i>op</i><b>]</b><i>priority</i>
                 Restrict selection to batch jobs of the specified
                 priority or range of priorities.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs for
                 which the value of the <i>Priority</i> attribute of the batch
                 job relates to the value of the <i>priority</i> component of
                 the option-argument in the manner indicated by the
                 value of the <i>op</i> component of the option-argument.

                 If the <i>op</i> component of the option-argument is omitted,
                 the <i>qselect</i> utility shall select batch jobs for which

                 equal to the value of the <i>priority</i> component of the
                 option-argument.

                 When comparing priority values, the <i>qselect</i> utility
                 shall use the following definitions for the <i>op</i>
                 component of the option-argument:

                 .eq.    The value of the <i>Priority</i> attribute of the

                         <i>priority</i> component option-argument.

                 .lt.    The value of the <i>Priority</i> attribute of the
                         batch job is less than the value of the
                         <i>priority</i> component option-argument.

                 .lt.    The value of the <i>Priority</i> attribute of the
                         batch job is less than or equal to the value of
                         the <i>priority</i> component option-argument.

                 .ne.    The value of the <i>Priority</i> attribute of the
                         batch job does not equal the value of the
                         <i>priority</i> component option-argument.

       <b>-q </b><i>destination</i>
                 Restrict selection to the specified batch queue or
                 server, or both.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs that
                 are located at the destination indicated by the value
                 of the <i>destination</i> option-argument.

                 The destination defines a batch queue, a server, or a
                 batch queue at a server.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept an option-argument for
                 the <b>-q </b>option that conforms to the syntax for a
                 destination. If the <b>-q </b>option is not presented to the
                 <i>qselect</i> utility, the utility shall select batch jobs
                 from all batch queues at the default batch server.

                 If the option-argument describes only a batch queue,
                 the <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs from
                 the batch queue of the specified name at the default
                 batch server. The means by which <i>qselect</i> determines the
                 default server is implementation-defined.

                 If the option-argument describes only a batch server,
                 the <i>qselect</i> utility shall select batch jobs from all
                 the batch queues at that batch server.

                 If the option-argument describes both a batch queue and
                 a batch server, the <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only
                 batch jobs from the specified batch queue at the
                 specified server.

       <b>-r </b>y|n    Restrict selection to batch jobs with the specified
                 rerunability status.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only batch jobs for
                 which the value of the <i>Rerunable</i> attribute of the batch
                 job matches the value of the option-argument.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept a value for the
                 option-argument that consists of either the single
                 character <b>'y' </b>or the single character <b>'n'</b>.  The
                 character <b>'y' </b>represents the value TRUE, and the
                 character <b>'n' </b>represents the value FALSE.

       <b>-s </b><i>states</i> Restrict selection to batch jobs in the specified
                 states.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept an option-argument
                 that consists of any combination of the characters <b>'e'</b>,
                 <b>'q'</b>, <b>'r'</b>, <b>'w'</b>, <b>'h'</b>, and <b>'t'</b>.

                 Conforming applications shall not repeat any character
                 in the option-argument. The <i>qselect</i> utility shall
                 permit the repetition of characters in the option-
                 argument, but shall not assign additional meaning to
                 repeated characters.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall interpret the characters in
                 the <i>states</i> option-argument as follows:

                 e     Represents the EXITING state.

                 q     Represents the QUEUED state.

                 r     Represents the RUNNING state.

                 t     Represents the TRANSITING state.

                 h     Represents the HELD state.

                 w     Represents the WAITING state.

                 For each character in the <i>states</i> option-argument, the
                 <i>qselect</i> utility shall select batch jobs in the
                 corresponding state.

       <b>-u </b><i>user_list</i>
                 Restrict selection to batch jobs owned by the specified
                 user names.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall select only the batch jobs of
                 those users specified in the <i>user_list</i> option-argument.

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept a <i>user_list</i> option-
                 argument that conforms to the following syntax:

                     <i>username</i><b>[</b>@<i>host</i><b>][</b>,,<i>username</i><b>[</b>@<i>host</i><b>]</b>,, ...<b>]</b>

                 The <i>qselect</i> utility shall accept only one user name
                 that is missing a corresponding host name. The <i>qselect</i>
                 utility shall accept only one user name per named host.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following example shows how a user might use the <i>qselect</i>
       utility in conjunction with the <i>qdel</i> utility to delete all of his
       or her jobs in the queued state without affecting any jobs that
       are already running:

           qdel $(qselect -s q)

       or:

           qselect -s q || xargs qdel
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qselect</i> utility allows users to acquire a list of job
       identifiers that match user-specified selection criteria. The
       list of identifiers returned by the <i>qselect</i> utility conforms to
       the syntax of the batch job identifier list processed by a
       utility such as <i>qmove</i>, <i>qdel</i>, and <i>qrls</i>.  The <i>qselect</i> utility is
       thus a powerful tool for causing another batch system utility to
       act upon a set of jobs that match a list of selection criteria.

       The options of the <i>qselect</i> utility let the user apply a number of
       useful filters for selecting jobs. Each option further restricts
       the selection of jobs. Many of the selection options allow the
       specification of a relational operator. The FORTRAN-like syntax
       of the operator—that is, <b>".lt."</b>—was chosen rather than the C-like
       <b>"&lt;=" </b>meta-characters.

       The <b>-a </b>option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to those
       that have been submitted (or altered) to wait until a particular
       time. The time period is determined by the argument of this
       option, which includes both a time and an operator—it is thus
       possible to select jobs waiting until a specific time, jobs
       waiting until after a certain time, or those waiting for a time
       before the specified time.

       The <b>-A </b>option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to those
       that have been submitted (or altered) to charge a particular
       account.

       The <b>-c </b>option allows users to restrict the selected jobs to those
       whose checkpointing interval falls within the specified range.

       The <b>-l </b>option allows users to select those jobs whose resource
       limits fall within the range indicated by the value of the
       option. For example, a user could select those jobs for which the
       CPU time limit is greater than two hours.

       The <b>-N </b>option allows users to select jobs by job name. For
       instance, all the parts of a task that have been divided in
       parallel jobs might be given the same name, and thus manipulated
       as a group by means of this option.

       The <b>-q </b>option allows users to select jobs in a specified queue.

       The <b>-r </b>option allows users to select only those jobs with a
       specified rerun criteria. For instance, a user might select only
       those jobs that can be rerun for use with the <i>qrerun</i> utility.

       The <b>-s </b>option allows users to select only those jobs that are in
       a certain state.

       The <b>-u </b>option allows users to select jobs that have been
       submitted to execute under a particular account.

       The selection criteria provided by the options of the <i>qselect</i>
       utility allow users to select jobs based on all the appropriate
       attributes that can be assigned to jobs by the <i>qsub</i> utility.

       Historically, the <i>qselect</i> utility has not been a part of existing
       practice; it is an improvement that has been introduced in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
