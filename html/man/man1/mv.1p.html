SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       mv <b>[</b>-if<b>] </b><i>source_file target_file</i>

       mv <b>[</b>-if<b>] </b><i>source_file</i>... <i>target_dir</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       In the first synopsis form, the <i>mv</i> utility shall move the file
       named by the <i>source_file</i> operand to the destination specified by
       the <i>target_file</i>.  This first synopsis form is assumed when the
       final operand does not name an existing directory and is not a
       symbolic link referring to an existing directory. In this case,
       if <i>source_file</i> names a non-directory file and <i>target_file</i> ends
       with a trailing &lt;slash&gt; character, <i>mv</i> shall treat this as an
       error and no <i>source_file</i> operands will be processed.

       In the second synopsis form, <i>mv</i> shall move each file named by a
       <i>source_file</i> operand to a destination file in the existing
       directory named by the <i>target_dir</i> operand, or referenced if
       <i>target_dir</i> is a symbolic link referring to an existing directory.
       The destination path for each <i>source_file</i> shall be the
       concatenation of the target directory, a single &lt;slash&gt; character
       if the target did not end in a &lt;slash&gt;, and the last pathname
       component of the <i>source_file</i>.  This second form is assumed when
       the final operand names an existing directory.

       If any operand specifies an existing file of a type not specified
       by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the behavior is
       implementation-defined.

       For each <i>source_file</i> the following steps shall be taken:

        1. If the destination path exists, the <b>-f </b>option is not
           specified, and either of the following conditions is true:

            a. The permissions of the destination path do not permit
               writing and the standard input is a terminal.

            b. The <b>-i </b>option is specified.

           the <i>mv</i> utility shall write a prompt to standard error and
           read a line from standard input. If the response is not
           affirmative, <i>mv</i> shall do nothing more with the current
           <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

        2. If the <i>source_file</i> operand and destination path resolve to
           either the same existing directory entry or different
           directory entries for the same existing file, then the
           destination path shall not be removed, and one of the
           following shall occur:

            a. No change is made to <i>source_file</i>, no error occurs, and no
               diagnostic is issued.

            b. No change is made to <i>source_file</i>, a diagnostic is issued
               to standard error identifying the two names, and the exit
               status is affected.

            c. If the <i>source_file</i> operand and destination path name
               distinct directory entries, then the <i>source_file</i> operand
               is removed, no error occurs, and no diagnostic is issued.

           The <i>mv</i> utility shall do nothing more with the current
           <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

        3. The <i>mv</i> utility shall perform actions equivalent to the
           <i>rename</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, called with the following arguments:

            a. The <i>source_file</i> operand is used as the <i>old</i> argument.

            b. The destination path is used as the <i>new</i> argument.

           If this succeeds, <i>mv</i> shall do nothing more with the current
           <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.  If this
           fails for any reasons other than those described for the
           <i><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></i> <b>[EXDEV] </b>in the System Interfaces volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard
           error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go
           on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

        4. If the destination path exists, and it is a file of type
           directory and <i>source_file</i> is not a file of type directory, or
           it is a file not of type directory and <i>source_file</i> is a file
           of type directory, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to
           standard error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>,
           and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.  If the destination
           path exists and was created by a previous step, it is
           unspecified whether this will treated as an error or the
           destination path will be overwritten.

        5. If the destination path exists, <i>mv</i> shall attempt to remove
           it. If this fails for any reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic
           message to standard error, do nothing more with the current
           <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

        6. The file hierarchy rooted in <i>source_file</i> shall be duplicated
           as a file hierarchy rooted in the destination path. If
           <i>source_file</i> or any of the files below it in the hierarchy are
           symbolic links, the links themselves shall be duplicated,
           including their contents, rather than any files to which they
           refer. The following characteristics of each file in the file
           hierarchy shall be duplicated:

            *  The time of last data modification and time of last
               access

            *  The user ID and group ID

            *  The file mode

           If the user ID, group ID, or file mode of a regular file
           cannot be duplicated, the file mode bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID
           shall not be duplicated.

           When files are duplicated to another file system, the
           implementation may require that the process invoking <i>mv</i> has
           read access to each file being duplicated.

           If files being duplicated to another file system have hard
           links to other files, it is unspecified whether the files
           copied to the new file system have the hard links preserved
           or separate copies are created for the linked files.

           If the duplication of the file hierarchy fails for any
           reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard
           error, do nothing more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go
           on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

           If the duplication of the file characteristics fails for any
           reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard
           error, but this failure shall not cause <i>mv</i> to modify its exit
           status.

        7. The file hierarchy rooted in <i>source_file</i> shall be removed. If
           this fails for any reason, <i>mv</i> shall write a diagnostic
           message to the standard error, do nothing more with the
           current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mv</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-f        </b>Do not prompt for confirmation if the destination path
                 exists. Any previous occurrence of the <b>-i </b>option is
                 ignored.

       <b>-i        </b>Prompt for confirmation if the destination path exists.
                 Any previous occurrence of the <b>-f </b>option is ignored.

       Specifying more than one of the <b>-f </b>or <b>-i </b>options shall not be
       considered an error. The last option specified shall determine
       the behavior of <i>mv</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>source_file</i>
                 A pathname of a file or directory to be moved.

       <i>target_file</i>
                 A new pathname for the file or directory being moved.

       <i>target_dir</i>
                 A pathname of an existing directory into which to move
                 the input files.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used to read an input line in
       response to each prompt specified in the STDERR section.
       Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files specified by each <i>source_file</i> operand can be of
       any file type.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>mv</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                 elements used in the extended regular expression
                 defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale keyword in the
                 <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files), the behavior
                 of character classes used in the extended regular
                 expression defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale keyword in
                 the <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale used to process affirmative
                 responses, and the locale used to affect the format and
                 contents of diagnostic messages and prompts written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       Prompts shall be written to the standard error under the
       conditions specified in the DESCRIPTION section. The prompts
       shall contain the destination pathname, but their format is
       otherwise unspecified.  Otherwise, the standard error shall be
       used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The output files may be of any file type.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were moved successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If the copying or removal of <i>source_file</i> is prematurely
       terminated by a signal or error, <i>mv</i> may leave a partial copy of
       <i>source_file</i> at the source or destination. The <i>mv</i> utility shall
       not modify both <i>source_file</i> and the destination path
       simultaneously; termination at any point shall leave either
       <i>source_file</i> or the destination path complete.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Some implementations mark for update the last file status change
       timestamp of renamed files and some do not. Applications which
       make use of the last file status change timestamp may behave
       differently with respect to renamed files unless they are
       designed to allow for either behavior.

       The specification ensures that <i>mv</i> <b>a a </b>will not alter the contents
       of file <b>a</b>, and allows the implementation to issue an error that a
       file cannot be moved onto itself. Likewise, when <b>a </b>and <b>b </b>are hard
       links to the same file, <i>mv</i> <b>a b </b>will not alter <b>b</b>, but if a
       diagnostic is not issued, then it is unspecified whether <b>a </b>is
       left untouched (as it would be by the <i>rename</i>() function) or
       unlinked (reducing the link count of <b>b</b>).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       If the current directory contains only files <b>a </b>(of any type
       defined by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017), <b>b </b>(also
       of any type), and a directory <b>c</b>:

           mv a b c
           mv c d

       results with the original files <b>a </b>and <b>b </b>residing in the directory
       <b>d </b>in the current directory.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Early proposals diverged from the SVID and BSD historical
       practice in that they required that when the destination path
       exists, the <b>-f </b>option is not specified, and input is not a
       terminal, <i>mv</i> fails. This was done for compatibility with <i>cp</i>.  The
       current text returns to historical practice. It should be noted
       that this is consistent with the <i>rename</i>() function defined in the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, which does not require
       write permission on the target.

       For absolute clarity, paragraph (1), describing the behavior of
       <i>mv</i> when prompting for confirmation, should be interpreted in the
       following manner:

           if (exists AND (NOT f_option) AND
               ((not_writable AND input_is_terminal) OR i_option))

       The <b>-i </b>option exists on BSD systems, giving applications and
       users a way to avoid accidentally unlinking files when moving
       others. When the standard input is not a terminal, the 4.3 BSD <i>mv</i>
       deletes all existing destination paths without prompting, even
       when <b>-i </b>is specified; this is inconsistent with the behavior of
       the 4.3 BSD <i>cp</i> utility, which always generates an error when the
       file is unwritable and the standard input is not a terminal. The
       standard developers decided that use of <b>-i </b>is a request for
       interaction, so when the destination path exists, the utility
       takes instructions from whatever responds to standard input.

       The <i>rename</i>() function is able to move directories within the same
       file system. Some historical versions of <i>mv</i> have been able to
       move directories, but not to a different file system.  The
       standard developers considered that this was an annoying
       inconsistency, so this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires
       directories to be able to be moved even across file systems.
       There is no <b>-R </b>option to confirm that moving a directory is
       actually intended, since such an option was not required for
       moving directories in historical practice. Requiring the
       application to specify it sometimes, depending on the
       destination, seemed just as inconsistent. The semantics of the
       <i>rename</i>() function were preserved as much as possible. For
       example, <i>mv</i> is not permitted to ``rename'' files to or from
       directories, even though they might be empty and removable.

       Historic implementations of <i>mv</i> did not exit with a non-zero exit
       status if they were unable to duplicate any file characteristics
       when moving a file across file systems, nor did they write a
       diagnostic message for the user. The former behavior has been
       preserved to prevent scripts from breaking; a diagnostic message
       is now required, however, so that users are alerted that the file
       characteristics have changed.

       The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only
       the general nature of the contents of prompts are specified
       because implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than
       those used on historical implementations. Therefore, an
       application not using the <b>-f </b>option or using the <b>-i </b>option relies
       on the system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with
       the user, based on the behavior specified.

       When <i>mv</i> is dealing with a single file system and <i>source_file</i> is a
       symbolic link, the link itself is moved as a consequence of the
       dependence on the <i>rename</i>() functionality, per the DESCRIPTION.
       Across file systems, this has to be made explicit.
