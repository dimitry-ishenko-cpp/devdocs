PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cat — concatenate and print files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       cat <b>[</b>-u<b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cat</i> utility shall read files in sequence and shall write
       their contents to the standard output in the same sequence.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cat</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-u        </b>Write bytes from the input file to the standard output
                 without delay as each is read.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of an input file. If no <i>file</i> operands are
                 specified, the standard input shall be used. If a <i>file</i>
                 is <b>'-'</b>, the <i>cat</i> utility shall read from the standard
                 input at that point in the sequence. The <i>cat</i> utility
                 shall not close and reopen standard input when it is
                 referenced in this way, but shall accept multiple
                 occurrences of <b>'-' </b>as a <i>file</i> operand.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <i>file</i> operands are
       specified, or if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-'</b>.  See the INPUT FILES
       section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files can be any file type.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>cat</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The standard output shall contain the sequence of bytes read from
       the input files. Nothing else shall be written to the standard
       output.  If the standard output is a regular file, and is the
       same file as any of the input file operands, the implementation
       may treat this as an error.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were output successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-u </b>option has value in prototyping non-blocking reads from
       FIFOs. The intent is to support the following sequence:

           mkfifo foo
           cat -u foo &gt; /dev/tty13 &amp;
           cat -u &gt; foo

       It is unspecified whether standard output is or is not buffered
       in the default case. This is sometimes of interest when standard
       output is associated with a terminal, since buffering may delay
       the output. The presence of the <b>-u </b>option guarantees that
       unbuffered I/O is available. It is implementation-defined whether
       the <i>cat</i> utility buffers output if the <b>-u </b>option is not specified.
       Traditionally, the <b>-u </b>option is implemented using the equivalent
       of the <i>setvbuf</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following command:

           cat myfile

       writes the contents of the file <b>myfile </b>to standard output.

       The following command:

           cat doc1 doc2 &gt; doc.all

       concatenates the files <b>doc1 </b>and <b>doc2 </b>and writes the result to
       <b>doc.all</b>.

       Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform output
       redirection, a command such as this:

           cat doc doc.end &gt; doc

       causes the original data in <b>doc </b>to be lost before <i>cat</i> even begins
       execution. This is true whether the <i>cat</i> command fails with an
       error or silently succeeds (the specification allows both
       behaviors). In order to append the contents of <b>doc.end </b>without
       losing the original contents of <b>doc</b>, this command should be used
       instead:

           cat doc.end &gt;&gt; doc

       The command:

           cat start - middle - end &gt; file

       when standard input is a terminal, gets two arbitrary pieces of
       input from the terminal with a single invocation of <i>cat</i>.  Note,
       however, that if standard input is a regular file, this would be
       equivalent to the command:

           cat start - middle /dev/null end &gt; file

       because the entire contents of the file would be consumed by <i>cat</i>
       the first time <b>'-' </b>was used as a <i>file</i> operand and an end-of-file
       condition would be detected immediately when <b>'-' </b>was referenced
       the second time.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Historical versions of the <i>cat</i> utility include the <b>-e</b>, <b>-t</b>, and
       <b>-v</b>, options which permit the ends of lines, &lt;tab&gt; characters, and
       invisible characters, respectively, to be rendered visible in the
       output. The standard developers omitted these options because
       they provide too fine a degree of control over what is made
       visible, and similar output can be obtained using a command such
       as:

           sed -n l pathname

       The latter also has the advantage that its output is unambiguous,
       whereas the output of historical <i>cat</i> <b>-etv </b>is not.

       The <b>-s </b>option was omitted because it corresponds to different
       functions in BSD and System V-based systems. The BSD <b>-s </b>option to
       squeeze blank lines can be accomplished by the shell script shown
       in the following example:

           sed -n '
           # Write non-empty lines.
           /./   {
                 p
                 d
                 }
           # Write a single empty line, then look for more empty lines.
           /^$/  p
           # Get next line, discard the held &lt;newline&gt; (empty line),
           # and look for more empty lines.
           :Empty
           /^$/  {
                 N
                 s/.//
                 b Empty
                 }
           # Write the non-empty line before going back to search
           # for the first in a set of empty lines.
                 p
           '

       The System V <b>-s </b>option to silence error messages can be
       accomplished by redirecting the standard error. Note that the BSD
       documentation for <i>cat</i> uses the term ``blank line'' to mean the
       same as the POSIX ``empty line'': a line consisting only of a
       &lt;newline&gt;.

       The BSD <b>-n </b>option was omitted because similar functionality can
       be obtained from the <b>-n </b>option of the <i>pr</i> utility.
