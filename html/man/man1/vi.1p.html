NAME </h2>
<pre>
       vi — screen-oriented (visual) display editor
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       vi <b>[</b>-rR<b>] [</b>-c <i>command</i><b>] [</b>-t <i>tagstring</i><b>] [</b>-w <i>size</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This utility shall be provided on systems that both support the
       User Portability Utilities option and define the POSIX2_CHAR_TERM
       symbol.  On other systems it is optional.

       The <i>vi</i> (visual) utility is a screen-oriented text editor. Only
       the open and visual modes of the editor are described in
       POSIX.1‐2008; see the line editor <i>ex</i> for additional editing
       capabilities used in <i>vi</i>.  The user can switch back and forth
       between <i>vi</i> and <i>ex</i> and execute <i>ex</i> commands from within <i>vi</i>.

       This reference page uses the term <i>edit buffer</i> to describe the
       current working text. No specific implementation is implied by
       this term. All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer,
       and no changes to it shall affect any file until an editor
       command writes the file.

       When using <i>vi</i>, the terminal screen acts as a window into the
       editing buffer. Changes made to the editing buffer shall be
       reflected in the screen display; the position of the cursor on
       the screen shall indicate the position within the editing buffer.

       Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to
       support the complete <i>vi</i> definition. When these commands cannot be
       supported on such terminals, this condition shall not produce an
       error message such as ``not an editor command'' or report a
       syntax error. The implementation may either accept the commands
       and produce results on the screen that are the result of an
       unsuccessful attempt to meet the requirements of this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 or report an error describing the terminal-related
       deficiency.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>vi</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       that <b>'+' </b>may be recognized as an option delimiter as well as <b>'-'</b>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c </b><i>command</i>
                 See the <i>ex</i> command description of the <b>-c </b>option.

       <b>-r        </b>See the <i>ex</i> command description of the <b>-r </b>option.

       <b>-R        </b>See the <i>ex</i> command description of the <b>-R </b>option.

       <b>-t </b><i>tagstring</i>
                 See the <i>ex</i> command description of the <b>-t </b>option.

       <b>-w </b><i>size</i>   See the <i>ex</i> command description of the <b>-w </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       See the OPERANDS section of the <i>ex</i> command for a description of
       the operands supported by the <i>vi</i> command.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       If standard input is not a terminal device, the results are
       undefined.  The standard input consists of a series of commands
       and input text, as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       If a read from the standard input returns an error, or if the
       editor detects an end-of-file condition from the standard input,
       it shall be equivalent to a SIGHUP asynchronous event.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       See the INPUT FILES section of the <i>ex</i> command for a description
       of the input files supported by the <i>vi</i> command.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       See the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section of the <i>ex</i> command for the
       environment variables that affect the execution of the <i>vi</i>
       command.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       See the ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section of the <i>ex</i> for the
       asynchronous events that affect the execution of the <i>vi</i> command.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If standard output is not a terminal device, undefined results
       occur.

       Standard output may be used for writing prompts to the user, for
       informational messages, and for writing lines from the file.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       If standard output is not a terminal device, undefined results
       occur.

       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       See the OUTPUT FILES section of the <i>ex</i> command for a description
       of the output files supported by the <i>vi</i> command.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If the terminal does not have the capabilities necessary to
       support an unspecified portion of the <i>vi</i> definition,
       implementations shall start initially in <i>ex</i> mode or open mode.
       Otherwise, after initialization, <i>vi</i> shall be in command mode;
       text input mode can be entered by one of several commands used to
       insert or change text. In text input mode, &lt;ESC&gt; can be used to
       return to command mode; other uses of &lt;ESC&gt; are described later
       in this section; see <i>Terminate Command or Input Mode</i>.

   <b>Initialization in ex and vi</b>
       See <i>Initialization in ex and vi</i> for a description of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>
       initialization for the <i>vi</i> utility.

   <b>Command Descriptions in vi</b>
       The following symbols are used in this reference page to
       represent arguments to commands.

       <i>buffer</i>  See the description of <i>buffer</i> in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
               section of the <i>ex</i> utility; see <i>Command Descriptions in</i>
               <i>ex</i>.

               In open and visual mode, when a command synopsis shows
               both [<i>buffer</i>] and [<i>count</i>] preceding the command name,
               they can be specified in either order.

       <i>count</i>   A positive integer used as an optional argument to most
               commands, either to give a repeat count or as a size.
               This argument is optional and shall default to 1 unless
               otherwise specified.

               The Synopsis lines for the <i>vi</i> commands &lt;control&gt;‐G,
               &lt;control&gt;‐L, &lt;control&gt;‐R, &lt;control&gt;‐], <b>%</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>^</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>M</b>,
               <b>Q</b>, <b>u</b>, <b>U</b>, and <b>ZZ </b>do not have <i>count</i> as an optional
               argument. Regardless, it shall not be an error to specify
               a <i>count</i> to these commands, and any specified <i>count</i> shall
               be ignored.

       <i>motion</i>  An optional trailing argument used by the <b>!</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>,
               and <b>y </b>commands, which is used to indicate the region of
               text that shall be affected by the command. The motion
               can be either one of the command characters repeated or
               one of several other <i>vi</i> commands (listed in the following
               table). Each of the applicable commands specifies the
               region of text matched by repeating the command; each
               command that can be used as a motion command specifies
               the region of text it affects.

               Commands that take <i>motion</i> arguments operate on either
               lines or characters, depending on the circumstances. When
               operating on lines, all lines that fall partially or
               wholly within the text region specified for the command
               shall be affected. When operating on characters, only the
               exact characters in the specified text region shall be
               affected. Each motion command specifies this
               individually.

               When commands that may be motion commands are not used as
               motion commands, they shall set the current position to
               the current line and column as specified.

               The following commands shall be valid cursor motion
               commands:

                   &lt;apostrophe&gt;       (    -    j    H
                   &lt;carriage-return&gt;  )    $    k    L
                   &lt;comma&gt;            [[   %    l    M
                   &lt;control&gt;-H        ]]   _    n    N
                   &lt;control&gt;-N        {    ;    t    T
                   &lt;control&gt;-P        }    ?    w    W
                   &lt;grave-accent&gt;     ^    b    B
                   &lt;newline&gt;          +    e    E
                   &lt;space&gt;            |    f    F
                   &lt;zero&gt;             /    h    G

               Any <i>count</i> that is specified to a command that has an
               associated motion command shall be applied to the motion
               command. If a <i>count</i> is applied to both the command and
               its associated motion command, the effect shall be
               multiplicative.

       The following symbols are used in this section to specify
       locations in the edit buffer:

       <i>current character</i>
               The character that is currently indicated by the cursor.

       <i>end of a line</i>
               The point located between the last non-&lt;newline&gt; (if any)
               and the terminating &lt;newline&gt; of a line. For an empty
               line, this location coincides with the beginning of the
               line.

       <i>end of the edit buffer</i>
               The location corresponding to the end of the last line in
               the edit buffer.

       The following symbols are used in this section to specify command
       actions:

       <i>bigword</i> In the POSIX locale, <i>vi</i> shall recognize four kinds of
               <i>bigwords</i>:

                1. A maximal sequence of non-&lt;blank&gt; characters preceded
                   and followed by &lt;blank&gt; characters or the beginning
                   or end of a line or the edit buffer

                2. One or more sequential blank lines

                3. The first character in the edit buffer

                4. The last non-&lt;newline&gt; in the edit buffer

       <i>word</i>    In the POSIX locale, <i>vi</i> shall recognize five kinds of
               words:

                1. A maximal sequence of letters, digits, and
                   underscores, delimited at both ends by:

                   --  Characters other than letters, digits, or
                       underscores

                   --  The beginning or end of a line

                   --  The beginning or end of the edit buffer

                2. A maximal sequence of characters other than letters,
                   digits, underscores, or &lt;blank&gt; characters, delimited
                   at both ends by:

                   --  A letter, digit, underscore

                   --  &lt;blank&gt; characters

                   --  The beginning or end of a line

                   --  The beginning or end of the edit buffer

                3. One or more sequential blank lines

                5. The last non-&lt;newline&gt; in the edit buffer

       <i>section boundary</i>
               A <i>section boundary</i> is one of the following:

                1. A line whose first character is a &lt;form-feed&gt;

                2. A line whose first character is an open curly brace
                   (<b>'{'</b>)

                3. A line whose first character is a &lt;period&gt; and whose
                   second and third characters match a two-character
                   pair in the <b>sections </b>edit option (see <i>ex</i>)

                4. A line whose first character is a &lt;period&gt; and whose
                   only other character matches the first character of a
                   two-character pair in the <b>sections </b>edit option, where
                   the second character of the two-character pair is a
                   &lt;space&gt;

                5. The first line of the edit buffer

                6. The last line of the edit buffer if the last line of
                   the edit buffer is empty or if it is a <b>]] </b>or <b>}</b>
                   command; otherwise, the last non-&lt;newline&gt; of the
                   last line of the edit buffer

       <i>paragraph boundary</i>
               A <i>paragraph boundary</i> is one of the following:

                1. A section boundary

                2. A line whose first character is a &lt;period&gt; and whose
                   second and third characters match a two-character
                   pair in the <b>paragraphs </b>edit option (see <i>ex</i>)

                3. A line whose first character is a &lt;period&gt; and whose
                   only other character matches the first character of a
                   two-character pair in the <i>paragraphs</i> edit option,
                   where the second character of the two-character pair
                   is a &lt;space&gt;

                4. One or more sequential blank lines

       <i>remembered search direction</i>
               See the description of <i>remembered search direction</i> in <i>ex</i>.

       <i>sentence boundary</i>
               A <i>sentence boundary</i> is one of the following:

                1. A paragraph boundary

                2. The first non-&lt;blank&gt; that occurs after a paragraph
                   boundary

                3. The first non-&lt;blank&gt; that occurs after a &lt;period&gt;
                   (<b>'.'</b>), &lt;exclamation-mark&gt; (<b>'!'</b>), or &lt;question-mark&gt;
                   (<b>'?'</b>), followed by two &lt;space&gt; characters or the end
                   of a line; any number of closing parenthesis (<b>')'</b>),
                   closing brackets (<b>']'</b>), double-quote (<b>'"'</b>), or
                   single-quote (&lt;apostrophe&gt;) characters can appear
                   between the punctuation mark and the two &lt;space&gt;
                   characters or end-of-line

       In the remainder of the description of the <i>vi</i> utility, the term
       ``buffer line'' refers to a line in the edit buffer and the term
       ``display line'' refers to the line or lines on the display
       screen used to display one buffer line. The term ``current line''
       refers to a specific ``buffer line''.

       If there are display lines on the screen for which there are no
       corresponding buffer lines because they correspond to lines that
       would be after the end of the file, they shall be displayed as a
       single &lt;tilde&gt; (<b>'~'</b>) character, plus the terminating &lt;newline&gt;.

       The last line of the screen shall be used to report errors or
       display informational messages. It shall also be used to display
       the input for ``line-oriented commands'' (<b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>:</b>, and <b>!</b>).  When
       a line-oriented command is executed, the editor shall enter text
       input mode on the last line on the screen, using the respective
       command characters as prompt characters. (In the case of the <b>!</b>
       command, the associated motion shall be entered by the user
       before the editor enters text input mode.) The line entered by
       the user shall be terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;, a non-&lt;control&gt;‐V-
       escaped &lt;carriage-return&gt;, or unescaped &lt;ESC&gt;.  It is unspecified
       if more characters than require a display width minus one column
       number of screen columns can be entered.

       If any command is executed that overwrites a portion of the
       screen other than the last line of the screen (for example, the
       <i>ex</i> <b>suspend </b>or <b>!  </b>commands), other than the <i>ex</i> <b>shell </b>command, the
       user shall be prompted for a character before the screen is
       refreshed and the edit session continued.

       &lt;tab&gt; characters shall take up the number of columns on the
       screen set by the <b>tabstop </b>edit option (see <i>ex</i>), unless there are
       less than that number of columns before the display margin that
       will cause the displayed line to be folded; in this case, they
       shall only take up the number of columns up to that boundary.

       The cursor shall be placed on the current line and relative to
       the current column as specified by each command described in the
       following sections.

       In open mode, if the current line is not already displayed, then
       it shall be displayed.

       In visual mode, if the current line is not displayed, then the
       lines that are displayed shall be expanded, scrolled, or redrawn
       to cause an unspecified portion of the current line to be
       displayed. If the screen is redrawn, no more than the number of
       display lines specified by the value of the <b>window </b>edit option
       shall be displayed (unless the current line cannot be completely
       displayed in the number of display lines specified by the <b>window</b>
       edit option) and the current line shall be positioned as close to
       the center of the displayed lines as possible (within the
       constraints imposed by the distance of the line from the
       beginning or end of the edit buffer). If the current line is
       before the first line in the display and the screen is scrolled,
       an unspecified portion of the current line shall be placed on the
       first line of the display. If the current line is after the last
       line in the display and the screen is scrolled, an unspecified
       portion of the current line shall be placed on the last line of
       the display.

       In visual mode, if a line from the edit buffer (other than the
       current line) does not entirely fit into the lines at the bottom
       of the display that are available for its presentation, the
       editor may choose not to display any portion of the line. The
       lines of the display that do not contain text from the edit
       buffer for this reason shall each consist of a single <b>'@'</b>
       character.

       In visual mode, the editor may choose for unspecified reasons to
       not update lines in the display to correspond to the underlying
       edit buffer text. The lines of the display that do not correctly
       correspond to text from the edit buffer for this reason shall
       consist of a single <b>'@' </b>character (plus the terminating
       &lt;newline&gt;), and the &lt;control&gt;‐R command shall cause the editor to
       update the screen to correctly represent the edit buffer.

       Open and visual mode commands that set the current column set it
       to a column position in the display, and not a character position
       in the line. In this case, however, the column position in the
       display shall be calculated for an infinite width display; for
       example, the column related to a character that is part of a line
       that has been folded onto additional screen lines will be offset
       from the display line column where the buffer line begins, not
       from the beginning of a particular display line.

       The display cursor column in the display is based on the value of
       the current column, as follows, with each rule applied in turn:

        1. If the current column is after the last display line column
           used by the displayed line, the display cursor column shall
           be set to the last display line column occupied by the last
           non-&lt;newline&gt; in the current line; otherwise, the display
           cursor column shall be set to the current column.

        2. If the character of which some portion is displayed in the
           display line column specified by the display cursor column
           requires more than a single display line column:

            a. If in text input mode, the display cursor column shall be
               adjusted to the first display line column in which any
               portion of that character is displayed.

            b. Otherwise, the display cursor column shall be adjusted to
               the last display line column in which any portion of that

       If used as a motion command:

        1. If <i>count</i> is 1:

            a. It shall be an error if the line is empty.

            b. Otherwise, the text region shall consist of all
               characters from the starting cursor to the last

               to a buffer shall be in character mode.

        2. Otherwise, if the starting cursor position is at or before
           the first non-&lt;blank&gt; in the line, the text region shall
           consist of the current and the next <i>count</i> -1 lines, and any
           text saved to a buffer shall be in line mode.

        3. Otherwise, the text region shall consist of all characters
           from the starting cursor to the last non-&lt;newline&gt; in the
           line that is <i>count</i> -1 lines forward from the current line,
           and any text copied to a buffer shall be in character mode.

       If not used as a motion command:

       <i>Current line</i>: Set to the <i>current line</i> + <i>count</i>-1.

       <i>Current column</i>: The current column is set to the last display
       line column of the last non-&lt;newline&gt; in the line, or column
       position 1 if the line is empty.

       The current column shall be adjusted to be on the last display

   <b>Move to Matching Character</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     %

       If the character at the current position is not a parenthesis,
       bracket, or curly brace, search forward in the line to the first
       one of those characters. If no such character is found, it shall
       be an error.

       The matching character shall be the parenthesis, bracket, or
       curly brace matching the parenthesis, bracket, or curly brace,
       respectively, that was at the current position or that was found
       on the current line.

       Matching shall be determined as follows, for an open parenthesis:

        1. Set a counter to 1.

        2. Search forwards until a parenthesis is found or the end of
           the edit buffer is reached.

        3. If the end of the edit buffer is reached, it shall be an
           error.

        4. If an open parenthesis is found, increment the counter by 1.

        5. If a close parenthesis is found, decrement the counter by 1.

        6. If the counter is zero, the current character is the matching
           character.

       Matching for a close parenthesis shall be equivalent, except that
       the search shall be backwards, from the starting character to the
       beginning of the buffer, a close parenthesis shall increment the
       counter by 1, and an open parenthesis shall decrement the counter
       by 1.

       Matching for brackets and curly braces shall be equivalent,
       except that searching shall be done for open and close brackets
       or open and close curly braces. It is implementation-defined
       whether other characters are searched for and matched as well.

       If used as a motion command:

        1. If the matching cursor was after the starting cursor in the
           edit buffer, and the starting cursor position was at or
           before the first non-&lt;blank&gt; non-&lt;newline&gt; in the starting
           line, and the matching cursor position was at or after the
           last non-&lt;blank&gt; non-&lt;newline&gt; in the matching line, the text
           region shall consist of the current line to the matching
           line, inclusive, and any text copied to a buffer shall be in
           line mode.

        2. If the matching cursor was before the starting cursor in the
           edit buffer, and the starting cursor position was at or after
           the last non-&lt;blank&gt; non-&lt;newline&gt; in the starting line, and
           the matching cursor position was at or before the first
           non-&lt;blank&gt; non-&lt;newline&gt; in the matching line, the text
           region shall consist of the current line to the matching
           line, inclusive, and any text copied to a buffer shall be in
           line mode.

        3. Otherwise, the text region shall consist of the starting
           character to the matching character, inclusive, and any text
           copied to a buffer shall be in character mode.

       If not used as a motion command:

       <i>Current line</i>: Set to the line where the matching character is
       located.

       Repeated commands with associated motion commands shall repeat
       the motion command as well; however, any specified <i>count</i> shall

       If the input line contains no non-&lt;newline&gt; characters, it shall
       be equivalent to a line containing only the last regular
       expression encountered. The enhanced regular expressions
       supported by <i>vi</i> are described in <i>Regular Expressions in ex</i>.

       Otherwise, the line shall be interpreted as one or more regular
       expressions, optionally followed by an address offset or a <i>vi</i> <b>z</b>
       command.

       If the regular expression is not the last regular expression on
       the line, or if a line offset or <b>z </b>command is specified, the
       regular expression shall be terminated by an unescaped <b>'/'</b>
       character, which shall not be used as part of the regular
       expression.  If the regular expression is not the first regular
       expression on the line, it shall be preceded by zero or more
       &lt;blank&gt; characters, a &lt;semicolon&gt;, zero or more &lt;blank&gt;
       characters, and a leading <b>'/' </b>character, which shall not be
       interpreted as part of the regular expression. It shall be an
       error to precede any regular expression with any characters other
       than these.

       Each search shall begin from the character after the first
       character of the last match (or, if it is the first search, after
       the cursor). If the <b>wrapscan </b>edit option is set, the search shall
       continue to the character before the starting cursor character;
       otherwise, to the end of the edit buffer. It shall be an error if
       any search fails to find a match, and an informational message to
       this effect shall be displayed.

       An optional address offset (see <i>Addressing in ex</i>) can be
       specified after the last regular expression by including a
       trailing <b>'/' </b>character after the regular expression and
       specifying the address offset. This offset will be from the line
       containing the match for the last regular expression specified.
       It shall be an error if the line offset would indicate a line
       address less than 1 or greater than the last line in the edit
       buffer. An address offset of zero shall be supported. It shall be
       an error to follow the address offset with any other characters
       than &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       If not used as a motion command, an optional <b>z </b>command (see
       <i>Redraw Window</i>) can be specified after the last regular expression
       by including a trailing <b>'/' </b>character after the regular
       expression, zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters, a <b>'z'</b>, zero or more
       &lt;blank&gt; characters, an optional new <b>window </b>edit option value,
       zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters, and a location character. The
       effect shall be as if the <b>z </b>command was executed after the <b>/</b>
       command. It shall be an error to follow the <b>z </b>command with any
       other characters than &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       The remembered search direction shall be set to forward.

       If used as a motion command:

        1. It shall be an error if the last match references the same
           character in the edit buffer as the starting cursor.

        2. If any address offset is specified, the last match shall be
           adjusted by the specified offset as described previously.

        3. If the starting cursor is after the last match, then the
           locations of the starting cursor and the last match in the
           edit buffer shall be logically swapped.

        4. If any address offset is specified, the text region shall
           consist of all lines containing characters from the starting
           cursor to the last match line, inclusive, and any text copied
           to a buffer shall be in line mode.

        5. Otherwise, if the starting line is empty or the starting
           cursor is at or before the first non-&lt;blank&gt; non-&lt;newline&gt; of
           the starting line, and the last match line is empty or the
           last match starts at the first character of the last match
           line, the text region shall consist of all lines containing
           characters from the starting cursor to the line before the
           last match line, inclusive, and any text copied to a buffer
           shall be in line mode.

        6. Otherwise, if the last match line is empty or the last match
           begins at a character at or before the first non-&lt;blank&gt;
           non-&lt;newline&gt; of the last match line, the region of text
           shall be from the current cursor to the last non-&lt;newline&gt; of
           the line before the last match line, inclusive, and any text
           copied to a buffer shall be in character mode.

        7. Otherwise, the region of text shall be from the current
           cursor (inclusive), to the first character of the last match
           (exclusive), and any text copied to a buffer shall be in
           character mode.

       be used. If no previous buffer has been executed, it shall be an
       error.

       Behave as if the contents of the named buffer were entered as
       standard input. After each line of a line-mode buffer, and all
       but the last line of a character mode buffer, behave as if a
       &lt;newline&gt; were entered as standard input.

       If an error occurs during this process, an error message shall be
       written, and no more characters resulting from the execution of
       this command shall be processed.

       If a <i>count</i> is specified, behave as if that count were entered as

       &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;carriage-return&gt;
             Place the beginning of the line on the first line of the
             display.

       .     Place the beginning of the line in the center of the
             display. The middle line of the display shall be calculated
             as described for the <b>M </b>command.

       -     Place an unspecified portion of the line on the last line
             of the display.

       +     If <i>line</i> was specified, equivalent to the &lt;newline&gt; case. If
             <i>line</i> was not specified, display a screen where the first
             line of the display shall be (current last line) +1. If
             there are no lines after the last line in the display, it
             shall be an error.

       ^     If <i>line</i> was specified, display a screen where the last line
             of the display shall contain an unspecified portion of the
             first line of a display that had an unspecified portion of
             the specified line on the last line of the display. If this
             calculation results in a line before the beginning of the
             edit buffer, display the first screen of the edit buffer.

             Otherwise, display a screen where the last line of the
             display shall contain an unspecified portion of (current
             first line -1). If this calculation results in a line
             before the beginning of the edit buffer, it shall be an
             error.

       <i>Current line</i>: If <i>line</i> and the <b>'^' </b>character were specified:

        1. If the first screen was displayed as a result of the command
           attempting to display lines before the beginning of the edit
           buffer: if the first screen was already displayed, unchanged;
           otherwise, set to (current first line -1).

   <b>Exit</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     ZZ

       This command shall be equivalent to the <i>ex</i> <b>xit </b>command with no
       addresses, trailing <b>!</b>, or filename (see the <i>ex</i> <b>xit </b>command).

   <b>Input Mode Commands in vi</b>
       In text input mode, the current line shall consist of zero or
       more of the following categories, plus the terminating &lt;newline&gt;:

        1. Characters preceding the text input entry point

           Characters in this category shall not be modified during text
           input mode.

        2. <b>autoindent </b>characters

           <b>autoindent </b>characters shall be automatically inserted into
           each line that is created in text input mode, either as a
           result of entering a &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;carriage-return&gt; while in
           text input mode, or as an effect of the command itself; for
           example, <b>O </b>or <b>o </b>(see the <i>ex</i> <b>autoindent </b>command), as if
           entered by the user.

           It shall be possible to erase <b>autoindent </b>characters with the
           &lt;control&gt;‐D command; it is unspecified whether they can be
           erased by &lt;control&gt;‐H, &lt;control&gt;‐U, and &lt;control&gt;‐W
           characters. Erasing any <b>autoindent </b>character turns the glyph
           into erase-columns and deletes the character from the edit
           buffer, but does not change its representation on the screen.

        3. Text input characters

           Text input characters are the characters entered by the user.
           Erasing any text input character turns the glyph into erase-
           columns and deletes the character from the edit buffer, but
           does not change its representation on the screen.

           Each text input character entered by the user (that does not
           have a special meaning) shall be treated as follows:

            a. The text input character shall be appended to the last
               character in the edit buffer from the first, second, or
               third categories.

            b. If there are no erase-columns on the screen, the text
               input command was the <b>R </b>command, and characters in the
               fifth category from the original line follow the cursor,
               the next such character shall be deleted from the edit
               buffer. If the <b>slowopen </b>edit option is not set, the
               corresponding glyph on the screen shall become erase-
               columns.

            c. If there are erase-columns on the screen, as many columns
               as they occupy, or as are necessary, shall be overwritten
               to display the text input character. (If only part of a
               multi-column glyph is overwritten, the remainder shall be
               left on the screen, and continue to be treated as erase-
               columns; it is unspecified whether the remainder of the
               glyph is modified in any way.)

            d. If additional display line columns are needed to display
               the text input character:

                i.  If the <b>slowopen </b>edit option is set, the text input
                    characters shall be displayed on subsequent display
                    line columns, overwriting any characters displayed
                    in those columns.

               ii.  Otherwise, any characters currently displayed on or
                    after the column on the display line where the text
                    input character is to be displayed shall be pushed
                    ahead the number of display line columns necessary
                    to display the rest of the text input character.

        4. Erase-columns

           Erase-columns are not logically part of the edit buffer,
           appearing only on the screen, and may be overwritten on the
           screen by subsequent text input characters. When text input
           mode ends, all erase-columns shall no longer appear on the
           screen.

           Erase-columns are initially the region of text specified by
           the <b>c </b>command (see <i>Change</i>); however, erasing <b>autoindent </b>or
           text input characters causes the glyphs of the erased
           characters to be treated as erase-columns.

        5. Characters following the text region for the <b>c </b>command, or
           the text input entry point for all other commands

           Characters in this category shall not be modified during text
           input mode, except as specified in category 3.b. for the <b>R</b>
           text input command, or as &lt;blank&gt; characters deleted when a
           &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;carriage-return&gt; is entered.

       It is unspecified whether it is an error to attempt to erase past
       the beginning of a line that was created by the entry of a
       &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;carriage-return&gt; during text input mode. If it is
       not an error, the editor shall behave as if the erasing character
       was entered immediately after the last text input character
       entered on the previous line, and all of the non-&lt;newline&gt;
       characters on the current line shall be treated as erase-columns.

       When text input mode is entered, or after a text input mode
       character is entered (except as specified for the special
       characters below), the cursor shall be positioned as follows:

        1. On the first column that displays any part of the first
           erase-column, if one exists

        2. Otherwise, if the <b>slowopen </b>edit option is set, on the first
           display line column after the last character in the first,
           second, or third categories, if one exists

        3. Otherwise, the first column that displays any part of the
           first character in the fifth category, if one exists

        4. Otherwise, the display line column after the last character
           in the first, second, or third categories, if one exists

        5. Otherwise, on column position 1

       The characters that are updated on the screen during text input
       mode are unspecified, other than that the last text input
       character shall always be updated, and, if the <b>slowopen </b>edit
       option is not set, the current cursor character shall always be
       updated.

       The following specifications are for command characters entered
       during text input mode.

   <b>NUL</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     NUL

       If the first character of the text input is a NUL, the most
       recently input text shall be input as if entered by the user, and
       then text input mode shall be exited. The text shall be input
       literally; that is, characters are neither macro or abbreviation
       expanded, nor are any characters interpreted in any special
       manner. It is unspecified whether implementations shall support
       more than 256 bytes of remembered input text.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;-D</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     &lt;control&gt;-D

       The &lt;control&gt;‐D character shall have no special meaning when in
       text input mode for a line-oriented command (see <i>Command</i>
       <i>Descriptions in vi</i>).

       This command need not be supported on block-mode terminals.

       If the cursor does not follow an <b>autoindent </b>character, or an
       <b>autoindent </b>character and a <b>'0' </b>or <b>'^' </b>character:

        1. If the cursor is in column position 1, the &lt;control&gt;‐D
           character shall be discarded and no further action taken.

        2. Otherwise, the &lt;control&gt;‐D character shall have no special
           meaning.

       If the last input character was a <b>'0'</b>, the cursor shall be moved
       to column position 1.

       Otherwise, if the last input character was a <b>'^'</b>, the cursor
       shall be moved to column position 1. In addition, the <b>autoindent</b>
       level for the next input line shall be derived from the same line
       from which the <b>autoindent </b>level for the current input line was
       derived.

       Otherwise, the cursor shall be moved back to the column after the
       previous shiftwidth (see the <i>ex</i> <b>shiftwidth </b>command) boundary.

       All of the glyphs on columns between the starting cursor position
       and (inclusively) the ending cursor position shall become erase-
       columns as described in <i>Input Mode Commands in vi</i>.

       <i>Current line</i>: Unchanged.

       <i>Current column</i>: Set to 1 if the &lt;control&gt;‐D was preceded by a <b>'^'</b>
       or <b>'0'</b>; otherwise, set to (column -1) -((column -2) %
       <b>shiftwidth</b>).

   <b>&lt;control&gt;-H</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     &lt;control&gt;-H

       If in text input mode for a line-oriented command, and there are
       no characters to erase, text input mode shall be terminated, no
       further action shall be done for this command, and the current
       line and column shall be unchanged.

       If there are characters other than <b>autoindent </b>characters that
       have been input on the current line before the cursor, the cursor
       shall move back one character.

       Otherwise, if there are <b>autoindent </b>characters on the current line
       before the cursor, it is implementation-defined whether the
       &lt;control&gt;‐H command is an error or if the cursor moves back one
       <b>autoindent </b>character.

       Otherwise, if the cursor is in column position 1 and there are
       previous lines that have been input, it is implementation-defined
       whether the &lt;control&gt;‐H command is an error or if it is
       equivalent to entering &lt;control&gt;‐H after the last input character
       on the previous input line.

       Otherwise, it shall be an error.

       All of the glyphs on columns between the starting cursor position
       and (inclusively) the ending cursor position shall become erase-
       columns as described in <i>Input Mode Commands in vi</i>.

       The current erase character (see <i>stty</i>) shall cause an equivalent
       action to the &lt;control&gt;‐H command, unless the previously inserted
       character was a &lt;backslash&gt;, in which case it shall be as if the
       literal current erase character had been inserted instead of the
       &lt;backslash&gt;.

       <i>Current line</i>: Unchanged, unless previously input lines are
       erased, in which case it shall be set to line -1.

       <i>Current column</i>: Set to the first column that displays any portion
       of the character backed up over.

   <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     &lt;newline&gt;
                     &lt;carriage-return&gt;
                     &lt;control&gt;-J
                     &lt;control&gt;-M

       If input was part of a line-oriented command, text input mode
       shall be terminated and the command shall continue execution with
       the input provided.

       Otherwise, terminate the current line. If there are no characters
       other than <b>autoindent </b>characters on the line, all characters on
       the line shall be discarded.  Otherwise, it is unspecified
       whether the <b>autoindent </b>characters in the line are modified by
       entering these characters.

       Continue text input mode on a new line appended after the current
       line.  If the <b>slowopen </b>edit option is set, the lines on the
       screen below the current line shall not be pushed down, but the
       first of them shall be cleared and shall appear to be
       overwritten. Otherwise, the lines of the screen below the current
       line shall be pushed down.

       If the <b>autoindent </b>edit option is set, an appropriate number of
       <b>autoindent </b>characters shall be added as a prefix to the line as
       described by the <i>ex</i> <b>autoindent </b>edit option.

       All columns after the cursor that are erase-columns (as described
       in <i>Input Mode Commands in vi</i>) shall be discarded.

       If the <b>autoindent </b>edit option is set, all &lt;blank&gt; characters
       immediately following the cursor shall be discarded.

       All remaining characters after the cursor shall be transferred to
       the new line, positioned after any <b>autoindent </b>characters.

       <i>Current line</i>: Set to current line +1.

       <i>Current column</i>: Set to the first column that displays any portion
       of the first character after the <b>autoindent </b>characters on the new
       line, if any, or the first column position after the last
       <b>autoindent </b>character, if any, or column position 1.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;-T</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     &lt;control&gt;-T

       The &lt;control&gt;‐T character shall have no special meaning when in
       text input mode for a line-oriented command (see <i>Command</i>
       <i>Descriptions in vi</i>).

       This command need not be supported on block-mode terminals.

       Behave as if the user entered the minimum number of &lt;blank&gt;
       characters necessary to move the cursor forward to the column
       position after the next <b>shiftwidth </b>(see the <i>ex</i> <b>shiftwidth</b>
       command) boundary.

       <i>Current line</i>: Unchanged.

       <i>Current column</i>: Set to <i>column</i> + <b>shiftwidth </b>- ((column -1) %
       <b>shiftwidth</b>).

   <b>&lt;control&gt;-U</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     &lt;control&gt;-U

       If there are characters other than <b>autoindent </b>characters that
       have been input on the current line before the cursor, the cursor
       shall move to the first character input after the <b>autoindent</b>
       characters.

       Otherwise, if there are <b>autoindent </b>characters on the current line
       before the cursor, it is implementation-defined whether the
       &lt;control&gt;‐U command is an error or if the cursor moves to the
       first column position on the line.

       Otherwise, if the cursor is in column position 1 and there are
       previous lines that have been input, it is implementation-defined
       whether the &lt;control&gt;‐U command is an error or if it is
       equivalent to entering &lt;control&gt;‐U after the last input character
       on the previous input line.

       Otherwise, it shall be an error.

       All of the glyphs on columns between the starting cursor position
       and (inclusively) the ending cursor position shall become erase-
       columns as described in <i>Input Mode Commands in vi</i>.

       The current <i>kill</i> character (see <i>stty</i>) shall cause an equivalent
       action to the &lt;control&gt;‐U command, unless the previously inserted
       character was a &lt;backslash&gt;, in which case it shall be as if the
       literal current <i>kill</i> character had been inserted instead of the
       &lt;backslash&gt;.

       <i>Current line</i>: Unchanged, unless previously input lines are
       erased, in which case it shall be set to line -1.

       <i>Current column</i>: Set to the first column that displays any portion
       of the last character backed up over.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;-V</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     &lt;control&gt;-V
                     &lt;control&gt;-Q

       Allow the entry of any subsequent character, other than
       &lt;control&gt;‐J or the &lt;newline&gt;, as a literal character, removing
       any special meaning that it may have to the editor in text input
       mode. If a &lt;control&gt;‐V or &lt;control&gt;‐Q is entered before a
       &lt;control&gt;‐J or &lt;newline&gt;, the &lt;control&gt;‐V or &lt;control&gt;‐Q
       character shall be discarded, and the &lt;control&gt;‐J or &lt;newline&gt;
       shall behave as described in the &lt;newline&gt; command character
       during input mode.

       For purposes of the display only, the editor shall behave as if a
       <b>'^' </b>character was entered, and the cursor shall be positioned as
       if overwriting the <b>'^' </b>character. When a subsequent character is
       entered, the editor shall behave as if that character was entered
       instead of the original &lt;control&gt;‐V or &lt;control&gt;‐Q character.

       <i>Current line</i>: Unchanged.

       <i>Current column</i>: Unchanged.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;-W</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     &lt;control&gt;-W

       If there are characters other than <b>autoindent </b>characters that
       have been input on the current line before the cursor, the cursor
       shall move back over the last word preceding the cursor
       (including any &lt;blank&gt; characters between the end of the last
       word and the current cursor); the cursor shall not move to before
       the first character after the end of any <b>autoindent </b>characters.

       Otherwise, if there are <b>autoindent </b>characters on the current line
       before the cursor, it is implementation-defined whether the
       &lt;control&gt;‐W command is an error or if the cursor moves to the
       first column position on the line.

       Otherwise, if the cursor is in column position 1 and there are
       previous lines that have been input, it is implementation-defined
       whether the &lt;control&gt;‐W command is an error or if it is
       equivalent to entering &lt;control&gt;‐W after the last input character
       on the previous input line.

       Otherwise, it shall be an error.

       All of the glyphs on columns between the starting cursor position
       and (inclusively) the ending cursor position shall become erase-
       columns as described in <i>Input Mode Commands in vi</i>.

       <i>Current line</i>: Unchanged, unless previously input lines are
       erased, in which case it shall be set to line -1.

       <i>Current column</i>: Set to the first column that displays any portion
       of the last character backed up over.

   <b>&lt;ESC&gt;</b>
       <i>Synopsis</i>:

                     &lt;ESC&gt;

       If input was part of a line-oriented command:

        1. If <i>interrupt</i> was entered, text input mode shall be terminated
           and the editor shall return to command mode. The terminal
           shall be alerted.

        2. If &lt;ESC&gt; was entered, text input mode shall be terminated and
           the command shall continue execution with the input provided.

       Otherwise, terminate text input mode and return to command mode.

       Any <b>autoindent </b>characters entered on newly created lines that
       have no other non-&lt;newline&gt; characters shall be deleted.

       Any leading <b>autoindent </b>and &lt;blank&gt; characters on newly created
       lines shall be rewritten to be the minimum number of &lt;blank&gt;
       characters possible.

       The screen shall be redisplayed as necessary to match the
       contents of the edit buffer.

       <i>Current line</i>: Unchanged.

       <i>Current column</i>:

        1. If there are text input characters on the current line, the
           column shall be set to the last column where any portion of
           the last text input character is displayed.

        2. Otherwise, if a character is displayed in the current column,
           unchanged.

        3. Otherwise, set to column position 1.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       When any error is encountered and the standard input is not a

       Otherwise, when an unrecoverable error is encountered it shall be
       equivalent to a SIGHUP asynchronous event.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       See the RATIONALE for <a href="ex.1p.html">ex(1p)</a> for more information on <i>vi</i>.  Major
       portions of the <i>vi</i> utility specification point to <i>ex</i> to avoid
       inadvertent divergence. While <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> have historically been
       implemented as a single utility, this is not required by
       POSIX.1‐2008.

       It is recognized that portions of <i>vi</i> would be difficult, if not
       impossible, to implement satisfactorily on a block-mode terminal,
       or a terminal without any form of cursor addressing, thus it is
       not a mandatory requirement that such features should work on all
       terminals. It is the intention, however, that a <i>vi</i> implementation
       should provide the full set of capabilities on all terminals
       capable of supporting them.

       Historically, <i>vi</i> exited immediately if the standard input was not
       a terminal. POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not require, this
       behavior. An end-of-file condition is not equivalent to an end-
       of-file character. A common end-of-file character, &lt;control&gt;‐D,
       is historically a <i>vi</i> command.

       The text in the STDOUT section reflects the usage of the verb
       <i>display</i> in this section; some implementations of <i>vi</i> use standard
       output to write to the terminal, but POSIX.1‐2008 does not
       require that to be the case.

       Historically, implementations reverted to open mode if the
       terminal was incapable of supporting full visual mode.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires this behavior. Historically, the open mode
       of <i>vi</i> behaved roughly equivalently to the visual mode, with the
       exception that only a single line from the edit buffer (one
       ``buffer line'') was kept current at any time. This line was
       normally displayed on the next-to-last line of a terminal with
       cursor addressing (and the last line performed its normal visual
       functions for line-oriented commands and messages). In addition,
       some few commands behaved differently in open mode than in visual
       mode. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.

       Historically, <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> implementations have expected text to
       proceed in the usual European/Latin order of left to right, top
       to bottom. There is no requirement in POSIX.1‐2008 that this be
       the case. The specification was deliberately written using words
       like ``before'', ``after'', ``first'', and ``last'' in order to
       permit implementations to support the natural text order of the
       language.

       Historically, lines past the end of the edit buffer were marked
       with single &lt;tilde&gt; (<b>'~'</b>) characters; that is, if the one-based
       display was 20 lines in length, and the last line of the file was
       on line one, then lines 2-20 would contain only a single <b>'~'</b>
       character.

       Historically, the <i>vi</i> editor attempted to display only complete
       lines at the bottom of the screen (it did display partial lines
       at the top of the screen). If a line was too long to fit in its
       entirety at the bottom of the screen, the screen lines where the
       line would have been displayed were displayed as single <b>'@'</b>
       characters, instead of displaying part of the line. POSIX.1‐2008
       permits, but does not require, this behavior. Implementations are
       encouraged to attempt always to display a complete line at the
       bottom of the screen when doing scrolling or screen positioning
       by buffer lines.

       Historically, lines marked with <b>'@' </b>were also used to minimize
       output to dumb terminals over slow lines; that is, changes local
       to the cursor were updated, but changes to lines on the screen
       that were not close to the cursor were simply marked with an <b>'@'</b>
       sign instead of being updated to match the current text.
       POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not require this feature because
       it is used ever less frequently as terminals become smarter and
       connections are faster.

   <b>Initialization in ex and vi</b>
       Historically, <i>vi</i> always had a line in the edit buffer, even if
       the edit buffer was ``empty''. For example:

        1. The <i>ex</i> command <b>= </b>executed from visual mode wrote ``1'' when
           the buffer was empty.

        2. Writes from visual mode of an empty edit buffer wrote files
           of a single character (a &lt;newline&gt;), while writes from <i>ex</i>
           mode of an empty edit buffer wrote empty files.

        3. Put and read commands into an empty edit buffer left an empty
           line at the top of the edit buffer.

       For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit any of these
       behaviors.

       Historically, <i>vi</i> did not always return the terminal to its
       original modes; for example, ICRNL was modified if it was not
       originally set. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

       Motion commands are among the most complicated aspects of <i>vi</i> to
       describe. With some exceptions, the text region and buffer type
       effect of a motion command on a <i>vi</i> command are described on a
       case-by-case basis. The descriptions of text regions in
       POSIX.1‐2008 are not intended to imply direction; that is, an
       inclusive region from line <i>n</i> to line <i>n</i>+5 is identical to a region
       from line <i>n</i>+5 to line <i>n</i>.  This is of more than academic interest—
       movements to marks can be in either direction, and, if the
       <b>wrapscan </b>option is set, so can movements to search points.
       Historically, lines are always stored into buffers in text order;
       that is, from the start of the edit buffer to the end.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.

       Historically, command counts were applied to any associated
       motion, and were multiplicative to any supplied motion count. For
       example, <b>2cw </b>is the same as <b>c2w</b>, and <b>2c3w </b>is the same as <b>c6w</b>.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires this behavior. Historically, <i>vi</i> commands
       that used bigwords, words, paragraphs, and sentences as objects
       treated groups of empty lines, or lines that contained only
       &lt;blank&gt; characters, inconsistently. Some commands treated them as
       a single entity, while others treated each line separately. For
       example, the <b>w</b>, <b>W</b>, and <b>B </b>commands treated groups of empty lines
       as individual words; that is, the command would move the cursor
       to each new empty line. The <b>e </b>and <b>E </b>commands treated groups of
       empty lines as a single word; that is, the first use would move
       past the group of lines. The <b>b </b>command would just beep at the
       user, or if done from the start of the line as a motion command,
       fail in unexpected ways. If the lines contained only (or ended
       with) &lt;blank&gt; characters, the <b>w </b>and <b>W </b>commands would just beep at
       the user, the <b>E </b>and <b>e </b>commands would treat the group as a single
       word, and the <b>B </b>and <b>b </b>commands would treat the lines as
       individual words. For consistency and simplicity of
       specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that all <i>vi</i> commands treat
       groups of empty or blank lines as a single entity, and that
       movement through lines ending with &lt;blank&gt; characters be
       consistent with other movements.

       Historically, <i>vi</i> documentation indicated that any number of
       double-quotes were skipped after punctuation marks at sentence
       boundaries; however, implementations only skipped single-quotes.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires both to be skipped.

       Historically, the first and last characters in the edit buffer
       were word boundaries. This historical practice is required by
       POSIX.1‐2008.

       Historically, <i>vi</i> attempted to update the minimum number of
       columns on the screen possible, which could lead to misleading
       information being displayed.  POSIX.1‐2008 makes no requirements
       other than that the current character being entered is displayed
       correctly, leaving all other decisions in this area up to the
       implementation.

       Historically, lines were arbitrarily folded between columns of
       any characters that required multiple column positions on the
       screen, with the exception of tabs, which terminated at the
       right-hand margin. POSIX.1‐2008 permits the former and requires
       the latter. Implementations that do not arbitrarily break lines
       between columns of characters that occupy multiple column
       positions should not permit the cursor to rest on a column that
       does not contain any part of a character.

       The historical <i>vi</i> had a problem in that all movements were by
       buffer lines, not by display or screen lines. This is often the
       right thing to do; for example, single line movements, such as <b>j</b>
       or <b>k</b>, should work on buffer lines. Commands like <b>dj</b>, or <b>j.</b>, where
       <b>.  </b>is a change command, only make sense for buffer lines. It is
       not, however, the right thing to do for screen motion or
       scrolling commands like &lt;control&gt;‐D, &lt;control&gt;‐F, and <b>H</b>.  If the
       window is fairly small, using buffer lines in these cases can
       result in completely random motion; for example, <b>1</b>&lt;control&gt;<b>‐D </b>can
       result in a completely changed screen, without any overlap. This
       is clearly not what the user wanted. The problem is even worse in
       the case of the <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, and <b>M </b>commands—as they position the cursor
       at the first non-&lt;blank&gt; of the line, they may all refer to the
       same location in large lines, and will result in no movement at
       all.

       In addition, if the line is larger than the screen, using buffer
       lines can make it impossible to display parts of the line—there
       are not any commands that do not display the beginning of the
       line in historical <i>vi</i>, and if both the beginning and end of the
       line cannot be on the screen at the same time, the user suffers.
       Finally, the page and half-page scrolling commands historically
       moved to the first non-&lt;blank&gt; in the new line. If the line is
       approximately the same size as the screen, this is inadequate
       because the cursor before and after a &lt;control&gt;‐D command will
       refer to the same location on the screen.

       Implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> exist that do not have these
       problems because the relevant commands (&lt;control&gt;‐B, &lt;control&gt;‐D,
       &lt;control&gt;‐F, &lt;control&gt;‐U, &lt;control&gt;‐Y, &lt;control&gt;‐E, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, and <b>M)</b>
       operate on display (screen) lines, not (edit) buffer lines.

       POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior by default because the
       standard developers believed that users would find it too
       confusing. However, historical practice has been relaxed. For
       example, <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> historically attempted, albeit sometimes
       unsuccessfully, to never put part of a line on the last lines of
       a screen; for example, if a line would not fit in its entirety,
       no part of the line was displayed, and the screen lines
       corresponding to the line contained single <b>'@' </b>characters. This
       behavior is permitted, but not required by POSIX.1‐2008, so that
       it is possible for implementations to support long lines in small
       screens more reasonably without changing the commands to be
       oriented to the display (instead of oriented to the buffer).
       POSIX.1‐2008 also permits implementations to refuse to edit any
       edit buffer containing a line that will not fit on the screen in
       its entirety.

       The display area (for example, the value of the <b>window </b>edit
       option) has historically been ``grown'', or expanded, to display
       new text when local movements are done in displays where the
       number of lines displayed is less than the maximum possible.
       Expansion has historically been the first choice, when the target
       line is less than the maximum possible expansion value away.
       Scrolling has historically been the next choice, done when the
       target line is less than half a display away, and otherwise, the
       screen was redrawn. There were exceptions, however, in that <i>ex</i>
       commands generally always caused the screen to be redrawn.
       POSIX.1‐2008 does not specify a standard behavior because there
       may be external issues, such as connection speed, the number of
       characters necessary to redraw as opposed to scroll, or terminal
       capabilities that implementations will have to accommodate.

       The current line in POSIX.1‐2008 maps one-to-one to a buffer line
       in the file. The current column does not. There are two different
       column values that are described by POSIX.1‐2008. The first is
       the current column value as set by many of the <i>vi</i> commands. This
       value is remembered for the lifetime of the editor. The second
       column value is the actual position on the screen where the
       cursor rests. The two are not always the same. For example, when
       the cursor is backed by a multi-column character, the actual
       cursor position on the screen has historically been the last
       column of the character in command mode, and the first column of
       the character in input mode.

       Commands that set the current line, but that do not set the
       current cursor value (for example, <b>j </b>and <b>k</b>) attempt to get as
       close as possible to the remembered column position, so that the
       cursor tends to restrict itself to a vertical column as the user
       moves around in the edit buffer. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
       conformance to historical practice, requiring that the display
       location of the cursor on the display line be adjusted from the
       current column value as necessary to support this historical
       behavior.

       Historically, only a single line (and for some terminals, a
       single line minus 1 column) of characters could be entered by the
       user for the line-oriented commands; that is, <b>:</b>, <b>!</b>, <b>/</b>, or <b>?</b>.
       POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not require, this limitation.

       Historically, ``soft'' errors in <i>vi</i> caused the terminal to be
       alerted, but no error message was displayed.  As a general rule,
       no error message was displayed for errors in command execution in
       <i>vi</i>, when the error resulted from the user attempting an invalid
       or impossible action, or when a searched-for object was not
       found.  Examples of soft errors included <b>h </b>at the left margin,
       &lt;control&gt;‐B or <b>[[ </b>at the beginning of the file, <b>2G </b>at the end of
       the file, and so on. In addition, errors such as <b>%</b>, <b>]]</b>, <b>}</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>N</b>,
       <b>n</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>T </b>failing to find the searched-for object were
       soft as well. Less consistently, <b>/ </b>and <b>?  </b>displayed an error
       message if the pattern was not found, <b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>N</b>, and <b>n </b>displayed an
       error message if no previous regular expression had been
       specified, and <b>; </b>did not display an error message if no previous
       <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>t</b>, or <b>T </b>command had occurred. Also, behavior in this area
       might reasonably be based on a runtime evaluation of the speed of
       a network connection.  Finally, some implementations have
       provided error messages for soft errors in order to assist naive
       users, based on the value of a verbose edit option. POSIX.1‐2008
       does not list specific errors for which an error message shall be
       displayed. Implementations should conform to historical practice
       in the absence of any strong reason to diverge.

   <b>Page Backwards</b>
       The &lt;control&gt;‐B and &lt;control&gt;‐F commands historically considered
       it an error to attempt to page past the beginning or end of the
       file, whereas the &lt;control&gt;‐D and &lt;control&gt;‐U commands simply
       moved to the beginning or end of the file. For consistency,
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires the latter behavior for all four commands.
       All four commands still consider it an error if the current line
       is at the beginning (&lt;control&gt;‐B, &lt;control&gt;‐U) or end
       (&lt;control&gt;‐F, &lt;control&gt;‐D) of the file. Historically, the
       &lt;control&gt;‐B and &lt;control&gt;‐F commands skip two lines in order to
       include overlapping lines when a single command is entered. This
       makes less sense in the presence of a <i>count</i>, as there will be, by
       definition, no overlapping lines. The actual calculation used by
       historical implementations of the <i>vi</i> editor for &lt;control&gt;‐B was:

           ((current first line) - count x (window edit option)) +2

       and for &lt;control&gt;‐F was:

           ((current first line) + count x (window edit option)) -2

       This calculation does not work well when intermixing commands
       with and without counts; for example, <b>3</b>&lt;control&gt;‐F is not
       equivalent to entering the &lt;control&gt;‐F command three times, and
       is not reversible by entering the &lt;control&gt;‐B command three
       times. For consistency with other <i>vi</i> commands that take counts,
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires a different calculation.

   <b>Scroll Forward</b>
       The 4BSD and System V implementations of <i>vi</i> differed on the
       initial value used by the <b>scroll </b>command. 4BSD used:

           ((window edit option) +1) /2

       while System V used the value of the <b>scroll </b>edit option. The
       System V version is specified by POSIX.1‐2008 because the
       standard developers believed that it was more intuitive and
       permitted the user a method of setting the scroll value initially
       without also setting the number of lines that are displayed.

   <b>Scroll Forward by Line</b>
       Historically, the &lt;control&gt;‐E and &lt;control&gt;‐Y commands considered
       it an error if the last and first lines, respectively, were
       already on the screen. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
       historical practice. Historically, the &lt;control&gt;‐E and
       &lt;control&gt;‐Y commands had no effect in open mode. For simplicity
       and consistency of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that they
       behave as usual, albeit with a single line screen.

   <b>Clear and Redisplay</b>
       The historical &lt;control&gt;‐L command refreshed the screen exactly
       as it was supposed to be currently displayed, replacing any <b>'@'</b>
       characters for lines that had been deleted but not updated on the
       screen with refreshed <b>'@' </b>characters. The intent of the
       &lt;control&gt;‐L command is to refresh when the screen has been
       accidentally overwritten; for example, by a <b>write </b>command from
       another user, or modem noise.

   <b>Redraw Screen</b>
       The historical &lt;control&gt;‐R command redisplayed only when
       necessary to update lines that had been deleted but not updated
       on the screen and that were flagged with <b>'@' </b>characters. There is
       no requirement that the screen be in any way refreshed if no
       lines of this form are currently displayed. POSIX.1‐2008 permits
       implementations to extend this command to refresh lines on the
       screen flagged with <b>'@' </b>characters because they are too long to
       be displayed in the current framework; however, the current line
       and column need not be modified.

   <b>Search for tagstring</b>
       Historically, the first non-&lt;blank&gt; at or after the cursor was
       the first character, and all subsequent characters that were word
       characters, up to the end of the line, were included. For
       example, with the cursor on the leading &lt;space&gt; or on the <b>'#'</b>
       character in the text <b>"#bar@"</b>, the tag was <b>"#bar"</b>.  On the
       character <b>'b' </b>it was <b>"bar"</b>, and on the <b>'a' </b>it was <b>"ar"</b>.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires this behavior.

   <b>Replace Text with Results from Shell Command</b>
       Historically, the <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, and <b>!  </b>commands considered most cursor
       motions other than line-oriented motions an error; for example,
       the command <b>&gt;/foo&lt;CR&gt; </b>succeeded, while the command <b>&gt;l </b>failed,
       even though the text region described by the two commands might
       be identical. For consistency, all three commands only consider
       entire lines and not partial lines, and the region is defined as
       any line that contains a character that was specified by the
       motion.

   <b>Move to Matching Character</b>
       Other matching characters have been left implementation-defined
       in order to allow extensions such as matching <b>'&lt;' </b>and <b>'&gt;' </b>for
       searching HTML, or <b>#ifdef</b>, <b>#else</b>, and <b>#endif </b>for searching C
       source.

   <b>Repeat Substitution</b>
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires that any <b>c </b>and <b>g </b>flags specified to the
       previous substitute command be ignored; however, the <b>r </b>flag may
       still apply, if supported by the implementation.

   <b>Return to Previous (Context or Section)</b>
       The <b>[[</b>, <b>]]</b>, <b>(</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>{</b>, and <b>} </b>commands are all affected by ``section
       boundaries'', but in some historical implementations not all of
       the commands recognize the same section boundaries. This is a
       bug, not a feature, and a unique section-boundary algorithm was
       not described for each command. One special case that is
       preserved is that the sentence command moves to the end of the
       last line of the edit buffer while the other commands go to the
       beginning, in order to preserve the traditional character cut
       semantics of the sentence command. Historically, <i>vi</i> section
       boundaries at the beginning and end of the edit buffer were the
       first non-&lt;blank&gt; on the first and last lines of the edit buffer
       if one exists; otherwise, the last character of the first and
       last lines of the edit buffer if one exists. To increase
       consistency with other section locations, this has been
       simplified by POSIX.1‐2008 to the first character of the first
       and last lines of the edit buffer, or the first and the last
       lines of the edit buffer if they are empty.

       Sentence boundaries were problematic in the historical <i>vi</i>.  They
       were not only the boundaries as defined for the section and
       paragraph commands, but they were the first non-&lt;blank&gt; that
       occurred after those boundaries, as well. Historically, the <i>vi</i>
       section commands were documented as taking an optional window
       size as a <i>count</i> preceding the command. This was not implemented
       in historical versions, so POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the <i>count</i>
       repeat the command, for consistency with other <i>vi</i> commands.

   <b>Repeat</b>
       Historically, mapped commands other than text input commands
       could not be repeated using the <b>period </b>command. POSIX.1‐2008
       requires conformance to historical practice.

       The restrictions on the interpretation of special characters (for
       example, &lt;control&gt;‐H) in the repetition of text input mode
       commands is intended to match historical practice. For example,
       given the input sequence:

           iab&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-Hdef&lt;escape&gt;

       the user should be informed of an error when the sequence is
       first entered, but not during a command repetition. The character
       &lt;control&gt;‐T is specifically exempted from this restriction.
       Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> ignored &lt;control&gt;‐T characters
       that were input in the original command during command
       repetition. POSIX.1‐2008 prohibits this behavior.

   <b>Find Regular Expression</b>
       Historically, commands did not affect the line searched to or
       from if the motion command was a search (<b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>n</b>) and the
       final position was the start/end of the line. There were some
       special cases and <i>vi</i> was not consistent. POSIX.1‐2008 does not
       permit this behavior, for consistency. Historical implementations
       permitted but were unable to handle searches as motion commands
       that wrapped (that is, due to the edit option <b>wrapscan</b>) to the
       original location. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that this behavior be
       treated as an error.

       Historically, the syntax <b>"/RE/0" </b>was used to force the command to
       cut text in line mode. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
       historical practice.

       Historically, in open mode, a <b>z </b>specified to a search command
       redisplayed the current line instead of displaying the current
       screen with the current line highlighted. For consistency and
       simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
       behavior.

       Historically, trailing <b>z </b>commands were permitted and ignored if
       entered as part of a search used as a motion command. For
       consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does
       not permit this behavior.

   <b>Execute an ex Command</b>
       Historically, <i>vi</i> implementations restricted the commands that
       could be entered on the colon command line (for example, <b>append</b>
       and <b>change</b>), and some other commands were known to cause them to
       fail catastrophically. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does not
       permit these restrictions. When executing an <i>ex</i> command by
       entering <b>:</b>, it is not possible to enter a &lt;newline&gt; as part of
       the command because it is considered the end of the command.  A
       different approach is to enter <i>ex</i> command mode by using the <i>vi</i> <b>Q</b>
       command (and later resuming visual mode with the <i>ex</i> <b>vi </b>command).
       In <i>ex</i> command mode, the single-line limitation does not exist.
       So, for example, the following is valid:

           Q
           s/break here/break\
           here/
           vi

       POSIX.1‐2008 requires that, if the <i>ex</i> command overwrites any part
       of the screen that would be erased by a refresh, <i>vi</i> pauses for a
       character from the user. Historically, this character could be
       any character; for example, a character input by the user before
       the message appeared, or even a mapped character. This is
       probably a bug, but implementations that have tried to be more
       rigorous by requiring that the user enter a specific character,
       or that the user enter a character after the message was
       displayed, have been forced by user indignation back into
       historical behavior. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
       historical practice.

   <b>Shift Left (Right)</b>
       Refer to the Rationale for the <b>!  </b>and <b>/ </b>commands. Historically,
       the <b>&lt; </b>and <b>&gt; </b>commands sometimes moved the cursor to the first
       non-&lt;blank&gt; (for example if the command was repeated or with <b>_ </b>as
       the motion command), and sometimes left it unchanged.
       POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this inconsistency, requiring
       instead that the cursor always move to the first non-&lt;blank&gt;.
       Historically, the <b>&lt; </b>and <b>&gt; </b>commands did not support buffer
       arguments, although some implementations allow the specification
       of an optional buffer. This behavior is neither required nor
       disallowed by POSIX.1‐2008.

   <b>Execute</b>
       Historically, buffers could execute other buffers, and loops,
       infinite and otherwise, were possible. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
       conformance to historical practice. The *<i>buffer</i> syntax of <i>ex</i> is
       not required in <i>vi</i>, because it is not historical practice and has
       been used in some <i>vi</i> implementations to support additional
       scripting languages.

   <b>Reverse Case</b>
       Historically, the <b>~ </b>command ignored any associated <i>count</i>, and
       acted only on the characters in the current line. For consistency
       with other <i>vi</i> commands, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that an associated
       <i>count</i> act on the next <i>count</i> characters, and that the command move
       to subsequent lines if warranted by <i>count</i>, to make it possible to
       modify large pieces of text in a reasonably efficient manner.
       There exist <i>vi</i> implementations that optionally require an
       associated motion command for the <b>~ </b>command. Implementations
       supporting this functionality are encouraged to base it on the
       <b>tildedop </b>edit option and handle the text regions and cursor
       positioning identically to the <b>yank </b>command.

   <b>Append</b>
       Historically, <i>count</i>s specified to the <b>A</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>i </b>commands
       repeated the input of the first line <i>count</i> times, and did not
       repeat the subsequent lines of the input text. POSIX.1‐2008
       requires that the entire text input be repeated <i>count</i> times.

   <b>Move Backward to Preceding Word</b>
       Historically, <i>vi</i> became confused if word commands were used as
       motion commands in empty files. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that this
       be an error. Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> had a large number
       of bugs in the word movement commands, and they varied greatly in
       behavior in the presence of empty lines, ``words'' made up of a
       single character, and lines containing only &lt;blank&gt; characters.
       For consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008
       does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Change to End-of-Line</b>
       Some historical implementations of the <b>C </b>command did not behave
       as described by POSIX.1‐2008 when the <b>$ </b>key was remapped because
       they were implemented by pushing the <b>$ </b>key onto the input queue
       and reprocessing it. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.
       Historically, the <b>C</b>, <b>S</b>, and <b>s </b>commands did not copy replaced text
       into the numeric buffers. For consistency and simplicity of
       specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that they behave like their
       respective <b>c </b>commands in all respects.

   <b>Delete</b>
       Historically, lines in open mode that were deleted were scrolled
       up, and an <b>@ </b>glyph written over the beginning of the line. In the
       case of terminals that are incapable of the necessary cursor
       motions, the editor erased the deleted line from the screen.
       POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice; that
       is, if the terminal cannot display the <b>'@' </b>character, the line
       cannot remain on the screen.

   <b>Delete to End-of-Line</b>
       Some historical implementations of the <b>D </b>command did not behave
       as described by POSIX.1‐2008 when the <b>$ </b>key was remapped because
       they were implemented by pushing the <b>$ </b>key onto the input queue
       and reprocessing it. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Join</b>
       An historical oddity of <i>vi</i> is that the commands <b>J</b>, <b>1J</b>, and <b>2J </b>are
       all equivalent. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
       practice.  The <i>vi</i> <b>J </b>command is specified in terms of the <i>ex</i> <b>join</b>
       command with an <i>ex</i> command <i>count</i> value. The address correction
       for a <i>count</i> that is past the end of the edit buffer is necessary
       for historical compatibility for both <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>.

   <b>Mark Position</b>
       Historical practice is that only lowercase letters, plus
       backquote and single-quote, could be used to mark a cursor
       position. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
       practice, but encourages implementations to support other
       characters as marks as well.

   <b>Repeat Regular Expression Find (Forward and Reverse)</b>
       Historically, the <b>N </b>and <b>n </b>commands could not be used as motion
       components for the <b>c </b>command. With the exception of the <b>cN</b>
       command, which worked if the search crossed a line boundary, the
       text region would be discarded, and the user would not be in text
       input mode. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
       POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

   <b>Insert Empty Line (Below and Above)</b>
       Historically, counts to the <b>O </b>and <b>o </b>commands were used as the
       number of physical lines to open, if the terminal was dumb and
       the <b>slowopen </b>option was not set. This was intended to minimize
       traffic over slow connections and repainting for dumb terminals.
       POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior, requiring that a
       <i>count</i> to the open command behave as for other text input
       commands. This change to historical practice was made for
       consistency, and because a superset of the functionality is
       provided by the <b>slowopen </b>edit option.

   <b>Put from Buffer (Following and Before)</b>
       Historically, <i>count</i>s to the <b>p </b>and <b>P </b>commands were ignored if the
       buffer was a line mode buffer, but were (mostly) implemented as
       described in POSIX.1‐2008 if the buffer was a character mode
       buffer. Because implementations exist that do not have this
       limitation, and because pasting lines multiple times is generally
       useful, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that <i>count</i> be supported for all <b>p</b>
       and <b>P </b>commands.

       Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> were widely known to have major
       problems in the <b>p </b>and <b>P </b>commands, particularly when unusual
       regions of text were copied into the edit buffer. The standard
       developers viewed these as bugs, and they are not permitted for
       consistency and simplicity of specification.

       Historically, a <b>P </b>or <b>p </b>command (or an <i>ex</i> <b>put </b>command executed
       from open or visual mode) executed in an empty file, left an
       empty line as the first line of the file. For consistency and
       simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
       behavior.

   <b>Replace Character</b>
       Historically, the <b>r </b>command did not correctly handle the <i>erase</i>
       and <i>word erase</i> characters as arguments, nor did it handle an
       associated <i>count</i> greater than 1 with a &lt;carriage-return&gt;
       argument, for which it replaced <i>count</i> characters with a single
       &lt;newline&gt;.  POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit these inconsistencies.

       Historically, the <b>r </b>command permitted the &lt;control&gt;‐V escaping of
       entered characters, such as &lt;ESC&gt; and the &lt;carriage-return&gt;;
       however, it required two leading &lt;control&gt;‐V characters instead
       of one. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that this be changed for
       consistency with the other text input commands of <i>vi</i>.

       Historically, it is an error to enter the <b>r </b>command if there are
       less than <i>count</i> characters at or after the cursor in the line.
       While a reasonable and unambiguous extension would be to permit
       the <b>r </b>command on empty lines, it would require that too large a
       <i>count</i> be adjusted to match the number of characters at or after
       the cursor for consistency, which is sufficiently different from
       historical practice to be avoided. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
       conformance to historical practice.

   <b>Replace Characters</b>
       Historically, if there were <b>autoindent </b>characters in the line on
       which the <b>R </b>command was run, and <b>autoindent </b>was set, the first
       &lt;newline&gt; would be properly indented and no characters would be
       replaced by the &lt;newline&gt;.  Each additional &lt;newline&gt; would
       replace <i>n</i> characters, where <i>n</i> was the number of characters that
       were needed to indent the rest of the line to the proper
       indentation level. This behavior is a bug and is not permitted by
       POSIX.1‐2008.

   <b>Undo</b>
       Historical practice for cursor positioning after undoing commands
       was mixed. In most cases, when undoing commands that affected a
       single line, the cursor was moved to the start of added or
       changed text, or immediately after deleted text. However, if the
       user had moved from the line being changed, the column was either
       set to the first non-&lt;blank&gt;, returned to the origin of the
       command, or remained unchanged. When undoing commands that
       affected multiple lines or entire lines, the cursor was moved to
       the first character in the first line restored. As an example of
       how inconsistent this was, a search, followed by an <b>o </b>text input
       command, followed by an <b>undo </b>would return the cursor to the
       location where the <b>o </b>command was entered, but a <b>cw </b>command
       followed by an <b>o </b>command followed by an <b>undo </b>would return the
       cursor to the first non-&lt;blank&gt; of the line. POSIX.1‐2008
       requires the most useful of these behaviors, and discards the
       least useful, in the interest of consistency and simplicity of
       specification.

   <b>Yank</b>
       Historically, the <b>yank </b>command did not move to the end of the
       motion if the motion was in the forward direction. It moved to
       the end of the motion if the motion was in the backward
       direction, except for the <b>_ </b>command, or for the <b>G </b>and <b>' </b>commands
       when the end of the motion was on the current line. This was
       further complicated by the fact that for a number of motion
       commands, the <b>yank </b>command moved the cursor but did not update
       the screen; for example, a subsequent command would move the
       cursor from the end of the motion, even though the cursor on the
       screen had not reflected the cursor movement for the <b>yank</b>
       command. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that all <b>yank </b>commands associated
       with backward motions move the cursor to the end of the motion
       for consistency, and specifically, to make <b>' </b>commands as motions
       consistent with search patterns as motions.

   <b>Yank Current Line</b>
       Some historical implementations of the <b>Y </b>command did not behave
       as described by POSIX.1‐2008 when the <b>'_' </b>key was remapped
       because they were implemented by pushing the <b>'_' </b>key onto the
       input queue and reprocessing it. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit
       this behavior.

   <b>Redraw Window</b>
       Historically, the <b>z </b>command always redrew the screen. This is
       permitted but not required by POSIX.1‐2008, because of the
       frequent use of the <b>z </b>command in macros such as <b>map n nz.  </b>for
       screen positioning, instead of its use to change the screen size.
       The standard developers believed that expanding or scrolling the
       screen offered a better interface for users. The ability to
       redraw the screen is preserved if the optional new window size is
       specified, and in the &lt;control&gt;‐L and &lt;control&gt;‐R commands.

       The semantics of <b>z^ </b>are confusing at best. Historical practice is
       that the screen before the screen that ended with the specified
       line is displayed. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
       historical practice.

       Historically, the <b>z </b>command would not display a partial line at
       the top or bottom of the screen. If the partial line would
       normally have been displayed at the bottom of the screen, the
       command worked, but the partial line was replaced with <b>'@'</b>
       characters. If the partial line would normally have been
       displayed at the top of the screen, the command would fail. For
       consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does
       not permit this behavior.

       Historically, the <b>z </b>command with a line specification of 1
       ignored the command. For consistency and simplicity of
       specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.

       Historically, the <b>z </b>command did not set the cursor column to the
       first non-&lt;blank&gt; for the character if the first screen was to be
       displayed, and was already displayed. For consistency and
       simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
       behavior.

   <b>Input Mode Commands in vi</b>
       Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> did not permit the user to erase
       more than a single line of input, or to use normal erase
       characters such as <i>line erase</i>, <i>worderase</i>, and <i>erase</i> to erase
       <b>autoindent </b>characters. As there exist implementations of <i>vi</i> that
       do not have these limitations, both behaviors are permitted, but
       only historical practice is required. In the case of these
       extensions, <i>vi</i> is required to pause at the <b>autoindent </b>and
       previous line boundaries.

       Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> updated only the portion of the
       screen where the current cursor character was displayed. For
       example, consider the <i>vi</i> input keystrokes:

           iabcd&lt;escape&gt;0C&lt;tab&gt;

       Historically, the &lt;tab&gt; would overwrite the characters <b>"abcd"</b>
       when it was displayed. Other implementations replace only the <b>'a'</b>
       character with the &lt;tab&gt;, and then push the rest of the
       characters ahead of the cursor. Both implementations have
       problems. The historical implementation is probably visually
       nicer for the above example; however, for the keystrokes:

           iabcd&lt;ESC&gt;0R&lt;tab&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;

       the historical implementation results in the string <b>"bcd"</b>
       disappearing and then magically reappearing when the &lt;ESC&gt;
       character is entered. POSIX.1‐2008 requires the former behavior
       when overwriting erase-columns—that is, overwriting characters
       that are no longer logically part of the edit buffer—and the
       latter behavior otherwise.

       Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> discarded the &lt;control&gt;‐D and
       &lt;control&gt;‐T characters when they were entered at places where
       their command functionality was not appropriate. POSIX.1‐2008
       requires that the &lt;control&gt;‐T functionality always be available,
       and that &lt;control&gt;‐D be treated as any other key when not
       operating on <b>autoindent </b>characters.

   <b>NUL</b>
       Some historical implementations of <i>vi</i> limited the number of
       characters entered using the NUL input character to 256 bytes.
       POSIX.1‐2008 permits this limitation; however, implementations
       are encouraged to remove this limit.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;‐D</b>
       See also Rationale for the input mode command &lt;newline&gt;.  The
       hidden assumptions in the &lt;control&gt;‐D command (and in the <i>vi</i>
       <b>autoindent </b>specification in general) is that &lt;space&gt; characters
       take up a single column on the screen and that &lt;tab&gt; characters
       are comprised of an integral number of &lt;space&gt; characters.

   <b>&lt;newline&gt;</b>
       Implementations are permitted to rewrite <b>autoindent </b>characters in
       the line when &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;carriage-return&gt;, &lt;control&gt;‐D, and
       &lt;control&gt;‐T are entered, or when the <b>shift </b>commands are used,
       because historical implementations have both done so and found it
       necessary to do so. For example, a &lt;control&gt;‐D when the cursor is
       preceded by a single &lt;tab&gt;, with <b>tabstop </b>set to 8, and <b>shiftwidth</b>
       set to 3, will result in the &lt;tab&gt; being replaced by several
       &lt;space&gt; characters.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;‐T</b>
       See also the Rationale for the input mode command &lt;newline&gt;.
       Historically, &lt;control&gt;‐T only worked if no non-&lt;blank&gt;
       characters had yet been input in the current input line. In
       addition, the characters inserted by &lt;control&gt;‐T were treated as
       <b>autoindent </b>characters, and could not be erased using normal user
       erase characters.  Because implementations exist that do not have
       these limitations, and as moving to a column boundary is
       generally useful, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that both limitations be
       removed.

   <b>&lt;control&gt;‐V</b>
       Historically, <i>vi</i> used <b>^V</b>, regardless of the value of the literal-
       next character of the terminal.  POSIX.1‐2008 requires
       conformance to historical practice.

       The uses described for &lt;control&gt;‐V can also be accomplished with
       &lt;control&gt;‐Q, which is useful on terminals that use &lt;control&gt;‐V
       for the down-arrow function. However, most historical
       implementations use &lt;control&gt;‐Q for the <i>termios</i> START character,
       so the editor will generally not receive the &lt;control&gt;‐Q unless
       <b>stty ixon </b>mode is set to off. (In addition, some historical
       implementations of <i>vi</i> explicitly set <b>ixon </b>mode to on, so it was
       difficult for the user to set it to off.) Any of the command
       characters described in POSIX.1‐2008 can be made ineffective by
       their selection as <i>termios</i> control characters, using the <i>stty</i>
       utility or other methods described in the System Interfaces
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

   <b>&lt;ESC&gt;</b>
       Historically, SIGINT alerted the terminal when used to end input
       mode. This behavior is permitted, but not required, by
       POSIX.1‐2008.
