</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Output the contents or other properties such as size, type or
       delta information of one or more objects.

       This command can operate in two modes, depending on whether an
       option from the <b>--batch </b>family is specified.

       In non-batch mode, the command provides information on an object
       named on the command line.

       In batch mode, arguments are read from standard input.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;object&gt;
           The name of the object to show. For a more complete list of
           ways to spell object names, see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS"
           section in <a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>.

       -t
           Instead of the content, show the object type identified by
           <b>&lt;object&gt;</b>.

       -s
           Instead of the content, show the object size identified by
           <b>&lt;object&gt;</b>. If used with <b>--use-mailmap </b>option, will show the
           size of updated object after replacing idents using the
           mailmap mechanism.

       -e
           Exit with zero status if <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>exists and is a valid
           object. If <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>is of an invalid format, exit with
           non-zero status and emit an error on stderr.

       -p
           Pretty-print the contents of <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>based on its type.

       &lt;type&gt;
           Typically this matches the real type of <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>but asking
           for a type that can trivially be dereferenced from the given
           <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>is also permitted. An example is to ask for a "tree"
           with <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>being a commit object that contains it, or to
           ask for a "blob" with <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>being a tag object that points
           at it.

       --[no-]mailmap, --[no-]use-mailmap
           Use mailmap file to map author, committer and tagger names
           and email addresses to canonical real names and email
           addresses. See <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a>.

       --textconv
           Show the content as transformed by a textconv filter. In this
           case, <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>has to be of the form <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;:&lt;path&gt;</b>, or
           <b>:&lt;path&gt; </b>in order to apply the filter to the content recorded
           in the index at <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>.

       --filters
           Show the content as converted by the filters configured in
           the current working tree for the given <b>&lt;path&gt; </b>(i.e. smudge
           filters, end-of-line conversion, etc). In this case, <b>&lt;object&gt;</b>
           has to be of the form <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;:&lt;path&gt;</b>, or <b>:&lt;path&gt;</b>.

       --path=&lt;path&gt;
           For use with <b>--textconv </b>or <b>--filters</b>, to allow specifying an
           object name and a path separately, e.g. when it is difficult
           to figure out the revision from which the blob came.

       --batch, --batch=&lt;format&gt;
           Print object information and contents for each object
           provided on stdin. May not be combined with any other options
           or arguments except <b>--textconv</b>, <b>--filters</b>, or <b>--use-mailmap</b>.

           •   When used with <b>--textconv </b>or <b>--filters</b>, the input lines
               must specify the path, separated by whitespace. See the
               section <b>BATCH OUTPUT </b>below for details.

           •   When used with <b>--use-mailmap</b>, for commit and tag objects,
               the contents part of the output shows the identities
               replaced using the mailmap mechanism, while the
               information part of the output shows the size of the
               object as if it actually recorded the replacement
               identities.

       --batch-check, --batch-check=&lt;format&gt;
           Print object information for each object provided on stdin.
           May not be combined with any other options or arguments
           except <b>--textconv</b>, <b>--filters </b>or <b>--use-mailmap</b>.

           •   When used with <b>--textconv </b>or <b>--filters</b>, the input lines
               must specify the path, separated by whitespace. See the
               section <b>BATCH OUTPUT </b>below for details.

           •   When used with <b>--use-mailmap</b>, for commit and tag objects,
               the printed object information shows the size of the
               object as if the identities recorded in it were replaced
               by the mailmap mechanism.

       --batch-command, --batch-command=&lt;format&gt;
           Enter a command mode that reads commands and arguments from
           stdin. May only be combined with <b>--buffer</b>, <b>--textconv</b>,
           <b>--use-mailmap </b>or <b>--filters</b>.

           •   When used with <b>--textconv </b>or <b>--filters</b>, the input lines
               must specify the path, separated by whitespace. See the
               section <b>BATCH OUTPUT </b>below for details.

           •   When used with <b>--use-mailmap</b>, for commit and tag objects,
               the <b>contents </b>command shows the identities replaced using
               the mailmap mechanism, while the <b>info </b>command shows the
               size of the object as if it actually recorded the
               replacement identities.

           <b>--batch-command </b>recognizes the following commands:

           contents &lt;object&gt;
               Print object contents for object reference <b>&lt;object&gt;</b>. This
               corresponds to the output of <b>--batch</b>.

           info &lt;object&gt;
               Print object info for object reference <b>&lt;object&gt;</b>. This
               corresponds to the output of <b>--batch-check</b>.

           flush
               Used with <b>--buffer </b>to execute all preceding commands that
               were issued since the beginning or since the last flush
               was issued. When <b>--buffer </b>is used, no output will come
               until a <b>flush </b>is issued. When <b>--buffer </b>is not used,
               commands are flushed each time without issuing <b>flush</b>.

       --batch-all-objects
           Instead of reading a list of objects on stdin, perform the
           requested batch operation on all objects in the repository
           and any alternate object stores (not just reachable objects).
           Requires <b>--batch </b>or <b>--batch-check </b>be specified. By default,
           the objects are visited in order sorted by their hashes; see
           also <b>--unordered </b>below. Objects are presented as-is, without
           respecting the "replace" mechanism of <a href="git-replace.1.html">git-replace(1)</a>.

       --buffer
           Normally batch output is flushed after each object is output,
           so that a process can interactively read and write from
           <b>cat-file</b>. With this option, the output uses normal stdio
           buffering; this is much more efficient when invoking
           <b>--batch-check </b>or <b>--batch-command </b>on a large number of
           objects.

       --unordered
           When <b>--batch-all-objects </b>is in use, visit objects in an order
           which may be more efficient for accessing the object contents
           than hash order. The exact details of the order are
           unspecified, but if you do not require a specific order, this
           should generally result in faster output, especially with
           <b>--batch</b>. Note that <b>cat-file </b>will still show each object only
           once, even if it is stored multiple times in the repository.

       --allow-unknown-type
           Allow <b>-s </b>or <b>-t </b>to query broken/corrupt objects of unknown
           type.

       --follow-symlinks
           With <b>--batch </b>or <b>--batch-check</b>, follow symlinks inside the
           repository when requesting objects with extended SHA-1
           expressions of the form tree-ish:path-in-tree. Instead of
           providing output about the link itself, provide output about
           the linked-to object. If a symlink points outside the
           tree-ish (e.g. a link to <b>/foo </b>or a root-level link to
           <b>../foo</b>), the portion of the link which is outside the tree
           will be printed.

           This option does not (currently) work correctly when an
           object in the index is specified (e.g.  <b>:link </b>instead of
           <b>HEAD:link</b>) rather than one in the tree.

           This option cannot (currently) be used unless <b>--batch </b>or
           <b>--batch-check </b>is used.

           For example, consider a git repository containing:

               f: a file containing "hello\n"
               link: a symlink to f
               dir/link: a symlink to ../f
               plink: a symlink to ../f
               alink: a symlink to /etc/passwd

           For a regular file <b>f</b>, <b>echo HEAD:f | git cat-file --batch</b>
           would print

               ce013625030ba8dba906f756967f9e9ca394464a blob 6

           And <b>echo HEAD:link | git cat-file --batch --follow-symlinks</b>
           would print the same thing, as would <b>HEAD:dir/link</b>, as they
           both point at <b>HEAD:f</b>.

           Without <b>--follow-symlinks</b>, these would print data about the
           symlink itself. In the case of <b>HEAD:link</b>, you would see

               4d1ae35ba2c8ec712fa2a379db44ad639ca277bd blob 1

           Both <b>plink </b>and <b>alink </b>point outside the tree, so they would
           respectively print:

               symlink 4
               ../f

               symlink 11
               /etc/passwd

       -Z
           Only meaningful with <b>--batch</b>, <b>--batch-check</b>, or
           <b>--batch-command</b>; input and output is NUL-delimited instead of
           newline-delimited.

       -z
           Only meaningful with <b>--batch</b>, <b>--batch-check</b>, or
           <b>--batch-command</b>; input is NUL-delimited instead of
           newline-delimited. This option is deprecated in favor of <b>-Z</b>
           as the output can otherwise be ambiguous.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       If <b>-t </b>is specified, one of the <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>.

       If <b>-s </b>is specified, the size of the <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>in bytes.

       If <b>-e </b>is specified, no output, unless the <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>is malformed.

       If <b>-p </b>is specified, the contents of <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>are pretty-printed.

       If <b>&lt;type&gt; </b>is specified, the raw (though uncompressed) contents of
       the <b>&lt;object&gt; </b>will be returned.
</pre> <h2>
BATCH OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       If <b>--batch </b>or <b>--batch-check </b>is given, <b>cat-file </b>will read objects
       from stdin, one per line, and print information about them. By
       default, the whole line is considered as an object, as if it were
       fed to <a href="git-rev-parse.1.html">git-rev-parse(1)</a>.

       When <b>--batch-command </b>is given, <b>cat-file </b>will read commands from
       stdin, one per line, and print information based on the command
       given. With <b>--batch-command</b>, the <b>info </b>command followed by an
       object will print information about the object the same way
       <b>--batch-check </b>would, and the <b>contents </b>command followed by an
       object prints contents in the same way <b>--batch </b>would.

       You can specify the information shown for each object by using a
       custom <b>&lt;format&gt;</b>. The <b>&lt;format&gt; </b>is copied literally to stdout for
       each object, with placeholders of the form <b>%(atom) </b>expanded,
       followed by a newline. The available atoms are:

       <b>objectname</b>
           The full hex representation of the object name.

       <b>objecttype</b>
           The type of the object (the same as <b>cat-file -t </b>reports).

       <b>objectsize</b>
           The size, in bytes, of the object (the same as <b>cat-file -s</b>
           reports).

       <b>objectsize:disk</b>
           The size, in bytes, that the object takes up on disk. See the
           note about on-disk sizes in the <b>CAVEATS </b>section below.

       <b>deltabase</b>
           If the object is stored as a delta on-disk, this expands to
           the full hex representation of the delta base object name.
           Otherwise, expands to the null OID (all zeroes). See <b>CAVEATS</b>
           below.

       <b>rest</b>
           If this atom is used in the output string, input lines are
           split at the first whitespace boundary. All characters before
           that whitespace are considered to be the object name;
           characters after that first run of whitespace (i.e., the
           "rest" of the line) are output in place of the <b>%(rest) </b>atom.

       If no format is specified, the default format is <b>%(objectname)</b>
       <b>%(objecttype) %(objectsize)</b>.

       If <b>--batch </b>is specified, or if <b>--batch-command </b>is used with the
       <b>contents </b>command, the object information is followed by the
       object contents (consisting of <b>%(objectsize) </b>bytes), followed by
       a newline.

       For example, <b>--batch </b>without a custom format would produce:

           &lt;oid&gt; SP &lt;type&gt; SP &lt;size&gt; LF
           &lt;contents&gt; LF

       Whereas <b>--batch-check='%(objectname) %(objecttype)' </b>would
       produce:

           &lt;oid&gt; SP &lt;type&gt; LF

       If a name is specified on stdin that cannot be resolved to an
       object in the repository, then <b>cat-file </b>will ignore any custom
       format and print:

           &lt;object&gt; SP missing LF

       If a name is specified that might refer to more than one object
       (an ambiguous short sha), then <b>cat-file </b>will ignore any custom
       format and print:

           &lt;object&gt; SP ambiguous LF

       If <b>--follow-symlinks </b>is used, and a symlink in the repository
       points outside the repository, then <b>cat-file </b>will ignore any
       custom format and print:

           symlink SP &lt;size&gt; LF
           &lt;symlink&gt; LF

       The symlink will either be absolute (beginning with a <b>/</b>), or
       relative to the tree root. For instance, if dir/link points to
       <b>../../foo</b>, then <b>&lt;symlink&gt; </b>will be <b>../foo</b>. <b>&lt;size&gt; </b>is the size of
       the symlink in bytes.

       If <b>--follow-symlinks </b>is used, the following error messages will
       be displayed:

           &lt;object&gt; SP missing LF

       is printed when the initial symlink requested does not exist.

           dangling SP &lt;size&gt; LF
           &lt;object&gt; LF

       is printed when the initial symlink exists, but something that it
       (transitive-of) points to does not.

           loop SP &lt;size&gt; LF
           &lt;object&gt; LF

       is printed for symlink loops (or any symlinks that require more
       than 40 link resolutions to resolve).

           notdir SP &lt;size&gt; LF
           &lt;object&gt; LF

       is printed when, during symlink resolution, a file is used as a
       directory name.

       Alternatively, when <b>-Z </b>is passed, the line feeds in any of the
       above examples are replaced with NUL terminators. This ensures
       that output will be parsable if the output itself would contain a
       linefeed and is thus recommended for scripting purposes.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       Note that the sizes of objects on disk are reported accurately,
       but care should be taken in drawing conclusions about which refs
       or objects are responsible for disk usage. The size of a packed
       non-delta object may be much larger than the size of objects
       which delta against it, but the choice of which object is the
       base and which is the delta is arbitrary and is subject to change
       during a repack.

       Note also that multiple copies of an object may be present in the
       object database; in this case, it is undefined which copy’s size
       or delta base will be reported.
