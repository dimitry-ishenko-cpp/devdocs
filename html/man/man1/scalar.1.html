DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Scalar is a repository management tool that optimizes Git for use
       in large repositories. Scalar improves performance by configuring
       advanced Git settings, maintaining repositories in the
       background, and helping to reduce data sent across the network.

       An important Scalar concept is the enlistment: this is the
       top-level directory of the project. It usually contains the
       subdirectory <b>src/ </b>which is a Git worktree. This encourages the
       separation between tracked files (inside <b>src/</b>) and untracked
       files, such as build artifacts (outside <b>src/</b>). When registering
       an existing Git worktree with Scalar whose name is not <b>src</b>, the
       enlistment will be identical to the worktree.

       The <b>scalar </b>command implements various subcommands, and different
       options depending on the subcommand. With the exception of <b>clone</b>,
       <b>list </b>and <b>reconfigure --all</b>, all subcommands expect to be run in
       an enlistment.

       The following options can be specified <i>before</i> the subcommand:

       -C &lt;directory&gt;
           Before running the subcommand, change the working directory.
           This option imitates the same option of <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>.

       -c &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
           For the duration of running the specified subcommand,
           configure this setting. This option imitates the same option
           of <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>.

COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Clone</b>
       clone [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;url&gt; [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           Clones the specified repository, similar to <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>. By
           default, only commit and tree objects are cloned. Once
           finished, the worktree is located at <b>&lt;enlistment&gt;/src</b>.

           The sparse-checkout feature is enabled (except when run with
           <b>--full-clone</b>) and the only files present are those in the
           top-level directory. Use <b>git sparse-checkout set </b>to expand
           the set of directories you want to see, or <b>git</b>
           <b>sparse-checkout disable </b>to expand to all files (see
           <a href="git-sparse-checkout.1.html">git-sparse-checkout(1)</a> for more details). You can explore the
           subdirectories outside your sparse-checkout by using <b>git</b>
           <b>ls-tree HEAD[:&lt;directory&gt;]</b>.

       -b &lt;name&gt;, --branch &lt;name&gt;
           Instead of checking out the branch pointed to by the cloned
           repository’s HEAD, check out the <b>&lt;name&gt; </b>branch instead.

       --[no-]single-branch
           Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single branch,
           either specified by the <b>--branch </b>option or the primary branch
           remote’s <b>HEAD </b>points at.

           Further fetches into the resulting repository will only
           update the remote-tracking branch for the branch this option
           was used for the initial cloning. If the HEAD at the remote
           did not point at any branch when <b>--single-branch </b>clone was
           made, no remote-tracking branch is created.

       --[no-]src
           By default, <b>scalar clone </b>places the cloned repository within
           a <b>&lt;entlistment&gt;/src </b>directory. Use <b>--no-src </b>to place the
           cloned repository directly in the <b>&lt;enlistment&gt; </b>directory.

       --[no-]full-clone
           A sparse-checkout is initialized by default. This behavior
           can be turned off via <b>--full-clone</b>.

   <b>List</b>
       list
           List enlistments that are currently registered by Scalar.
           This subcommand does not need to be run inside an enlistment.

   <b>Register</b>
       register [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           Adds the enlistment’s repository to the list of registered
           repositories and starts background maintenance. If
           <b>&lt;enlistment&gt; </b>is not provided, then the enlistment associated
           with the current working directory is registered.

           Note: when this subcommand is called in a worktree that is
           called <b>src/</b>, its parent directory is considered to be the
           Scalar enlistment. If the worktree is <i>not</i> called <b>src/</b>, it
           itself will be considered to be the Scalar enlistment.

   <b>Unregister</b>
       unregister [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           Remove the specified repository from the list of repositories
           registered with Scalar and stop the scheduled background
           maintenance.

   <b>Run</b>
       scalar run ( all | config | commit-graph | fetch | loose-objects
       | pack-files ) [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           Run the given maintenance task (or all tasks, if <b>all </b>was
           specified). Except for <b>all </b>and <b>config</b>, this subcommand simply
           hands off to <a href="git-maintenance.1.html">git-maintenance(1)</a> (mapping <b>fetch </b>to <b>prefetch</b>
           and <b>pack-files </b>to <b>incremental-repack</b>).

           These tasks are run automatically as part of the scheduled
           maintenance, as soon as the repository is registered with
           Scalar. It should therefore not be necessary to run this
           subcommand manually.

           The <b>config </b>task is specific to Scalar and configures all
           those opinionated default settings that make Git work more
           efficiently with large repositories. As this task is run as
           part of <b>scalar clone </b>automatically, explicit invocations of
           this task are rarely needed.

   <b>Reconfigure</b>
       After a Scalar upgrade, or when the configuration of a Scalar
       enlistment was somehow corrupted or changed by mistake, this
       subcommand allows to reconfigure the enlistment.

       With the <b>--all </b>option, all enlistments currently registered with
       Scalar will be reconfigured. Use this option after each Scalar
       upgrade.

   <b>Diagnose</b>
       diagnose [&lt;enlistment&gt;]
           When reporting issues with Scalar, it is often helpful to
           provide the information gathered by this command, including
           logs and certain statistics describing the data shape of the
           current enlistment.

           The output of this command is a <b>.zip </b>file that is written
           into a directory adjacent to the worktree in the <b>src</b>
           directory.

   <b>Delete</b>
       delete &lt;enlistment&gt;
           This subcommand lets you delete an existing Scalar enlistment
           from your local file system, unregistering the repository.
