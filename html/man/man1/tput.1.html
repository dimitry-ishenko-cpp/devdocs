</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>@TPUT@ </b>utility uses the <b>terminfo </b>database to make the values
       of terminal-dependent capabilities and information available to
       the shell (see <b>sh</b>(1)), to initialize or reset the terminal, or
       return the long name of the requested terminal type.  The result
       depends upon the capability's type:

          string
               <b>@TPUT@ </b>writes the string to the standard output.  No
               trailing newline is supplied.

          integer
               <b>@TPUT@ </b>writes the decimal value to the standard output,
               with a trailing newline.

          boolean
               <b>@TPUT@ </b>simply sets the exit code (<b>0 </b>for TRUE if the
               terminal has the capability, <b>1 </b>for FALSE if it does not),
               and writes nothing to the standard output.

       Before using a value returned on the standard output, the
       application should test the exit code (e.g., <b>$?</b>, see <b>sh</b>(1)) to be
       sure it is <b>0</b>.  (See the <b>EXIT CODES </b>and <b>DIAGNOSTICS </b>sections.)
       For a complete list of capabilities and the <i>capname</i> associated
       with each, see <a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a>.

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>-S     </b>allows more than one capability per invocation of <b>@TPUT@</b>.
              The capabilities must be passed to <b>@TPUT@ </b>from the
              standard input instead of from the command line (see
              example).  Only one <i>capname</i> is allowed per line.  The <b>-S</b>
              option changes the meaning of the <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>boolean and
              string exit codes (see the EXIT CODES section).

              Because some capabilities may use <i>string</i> parameters rather
              than <i>numbers</i>, <b>@TPUT@ </b>uses a table and the presence of
              parameters in its input to decide whether to use
              <b>tparm</b>(3X), and how to interpret the parameters.

       <b>-T</b><i>type</i> indicates the <i>type</i> of terminal.  Normally this option is
              unnecessary, because the default is taken from the
              environment variable <b>TERM</b>.  If <b>-T </b>is specified, then the
              shell variables <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS </b>will also be ignored.

       <b>-V     </b>reports the version of ncurses which was used in this
              program, and exits.

       <b>-x     </b>do not attempt to clear the terminal's scrollback buffer
              using the extended “E3” capability.

   <b>Commands</b>
       A few commands (<b>init</b>, <b>reset </b>and <b>longname</b>) are special; they are
       defined by the <b>@TPUT@ </b>program.  The others are the names of
       <i>capabilities</i> from the terminal database (see <a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a> for a
       list).  Although <b>init </b>and <b>reset </b>resemble capability names, <b>@TPUT@</b>
       uses several capabilities to perform these special functions.

       <i>capname</i>
              indicates the capability from the terminal database.

              If the capability is a string that takes parameters, the
              arguments following the capability will be used as
              parameters for the string.

              Most parameters are numbers.  Only a few terminal
              capabilities require string parameters; <b>@TPUT@ </b>uses a
              table to decide which to pass as strings.  Normally <b>@TPUT@</b>
              uses <b>tparm</b>(3X) to perform the substitution.  If no
              parameters are given for the capability, <b>@TPUT@ </b>writes the
              string without performing the substitution.

       <b>init   </b>If the terminal database is present and an entry for the
              user's terminal exists (see <b>-T</b><i>type</i>, above), the following
              will occur:

              (1)  first, <b>@TPUT@ </b>retrieves the current terminal mode
                   settings for your terminal.  It does this by
                   successively testing

                   •   the standard error,

                   •   standard output,

                   •   standard input and

                   •   ultimately “/dev/tty”

                   to obtain terminal settings.  Having retrieved these
                   settings, <b>@TPUT@ </b>remembers which file descriptor to
                   use when updating settings.

              (2)  if the window size cannot be obtained from the
                   operating system, but the terminal description (or
                   environment, e.g., <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS </b>variables
                   specify this), update the operating system's notion
                   of the window size.

              (3)  the terminal modes will be updated:

                   •   any delays (e.g., newline) specified in the entry
                       will be set in the tty driver,

                   •   tabs expansion will be turned on or off according
                       to the specification in the entry, and

                   •   if tabs are not expanded, standard tabs will be
                       set (every 8 spaces).

              (4)  if present, the terminal's initialization strings
                   will be output as detailed in the <a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a> section
                   on <i>Tabs and Initialization</i>,

              (5)  output is flushed.

              If an entry does not contain the information needed for
              any of these activities, that activity will silently be
              skipped.

       <b>reset  </b>This is similar to <b>init</b>, with two differences:

              (1)  before any other initialization, the terminal modes
                   will be reset to a “sane” state:

                   •   set cooked and echo modes,

                   •   turn off cbreak and raw modes,

                   •   turn on newline translation and

                   •   reset any unset special characters to their
                       default values

              (2)  Instead of putting out <i>initialization</i> strings, the
                   terminal's <i>reset</i> strings will be output if present
                   (<b>rs1</b>, <b>rs2</b>, <b>rs3</b>, <b>rf</b>).  If the <i>reset</i> strings are not
                   present, but <i>initialization</i> strings are, the
                   <i>initialization</i> strings will be output.

              Otherwise, <b>reset </b>acts identically to <b>init</b>.

       <b>longname</b>
              If the terminal database is present and an entry for the
              user's terminal exists (see <b>-T</b><i>type</i> above), then the long
              name of the terminal will be put out.  The long name is
              the last name in the first line of the terminal's
              description in the <b>terminfo </b>database [see <a href="../man5/term.5.html">term(5)</a>].

   <b>Aliases</b>
       <b>@TPUT@ </b>handles the <b>clear</b>, <b>init </b>and <b>reset </b>commands specially: it
       allows for the possibility that it is invoked by a link with
       those names.

       If <b>@TPUT@ </b>is invoked by a link named <b>reset</b>, this has the same
       effect as <b>@TPUT@ reset</b>.  The <b>@TSET@</b>(1) utility also treats a link
       named <b>reset </b>specially.

       Before ncurses 6.1, the two utilities were different from each
       other:

       •   <b>@TSET@ </b>utility reset the terminal modes and special
           characters (not done with <b>@TPUT@</b>).

       •   On the other hand, <b>@TSET@</b>'s repertoire of terminal
           capabilities for resetting the terminal was more limited,
           i.e., only <b>reset_1string</b>, <b>reset_2string </b>and <b>reset_file </b>in
           contrast to the tab-stops and margins which are set by this
           utility.

       •   The <b>reset </b>program is usually an alias for <b>@TSET@</b>, because of
           this difference with resetting terminal modes and special
           characters.

       With the changes made for ncurses 6.1, the <i>reset</i> feature of the
       two programs is (mostly) the same.  A few differences remain:

       •   The <b>@TSET@ </b>program waits one second when resetting, in case
           it happens to be a hardware terminal.

       •   The two programs write the terminal initialization strings to
           different streams (i.e., the standard error for <b>@TSET@ </b>and
           the standard output for <b>@TPUT@</b>).

           <b>Note: </b>although these programs write to different streams,
           redirecting their output to a file will capture only part of
           their actions.  The changes to the terminal modes are not
           affected by redirecting the output.

       If <b>@TPUT@ </b>is invoked by a link named <b>init</b>, this has the same
       effect as <b>@TPUT@ init</b>.  Again, you are less likely to use that
       link because another program named <b>init </b>has a more well-
       established use.

   <b>Terminal Size</b>
       Besides the special commands (e.g., <b>clear</b>), @TPUT@ treats certain
       terminfo capabilities specially: <b>lines </b>and <b>cols</b>.  @TPUT@ calls
       <b>setupterm</b>(3X) to obtain the terminal size:

       •   first, it gets the size from the terminal database (which
           generally is not provided for terminal emulators which do not
           have a fixed window size)

       •   then it asks the operating system for the terminal's size
           (which generally works, unless connecting via a serial line
           which does not support <i>NAWS</i>: negotiations about window size).

       •   finally, it inspects the environment variables <b>LINES </b>and
           <b>COLUMNS </b>which may override the terminal size.

       If the <b>-T </b>option is given @TPUT@ ignores the environment
       variables by calling <b>use_tioctl(TRUE)</b>, relying upon the operating
       system (or finally, the terminal database).

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>@TPUT@ init</b>
            Initialize the terminal according to the type of terminal in
            the environmental variable <b>TERM</b>.  This command should be
            included in everyone's .profile after the environmental
            variable <b>TERM </b>has been exported, as illustrated on the
            <a href="../man5/profile.5.html">profile(5)</a> manual page.

       <b>@TPUT@ -T5620 reset</b>
            Reset an AT&amp;T 5620 terminal, overriding the type of terminal
            in the environmental variable <b>TERM</b>.

       <b>@TPUT@ cup 0 0</b>
            Send the sequence to move the cursor to row <b>0</b>, column <b>0 </b>(the
            upper left corner of the screen, usually known as the “home”
            cursor position).

       <b>@TPUT@ clear</b>
            Echo the clear-screen sequence for the current terminal.

       <b>@TPUT@ cols</b>
            Print the number of columns for the current terminal.

       <b>@TPUT@ -T450 cols</b>
            Print the number of columns for the 450 terminal.

       <b>bold=`@TPUT@ smso` offbold=`@TPUT@ rmso`</b>
            Set the shell variables <b>bold</b>, to begin stand-out mode
            sequence, and <b>offbold</b>, to end standout mode sequence, for
            the current terminal.  This might be followed by a prompt:
            <b>echo "${bold}Please type in your name: ${offbold}\c"</b>

       <b>@TPUT@ hc</b>
            Set exit code to indicate if the current terminal is a hard
            copy terminal.

       <b>@TPUT@ cup 23 4</b>
            Send the sequence to move the cursor to row 23, column 4.

       <b>@TPUT@ cup</b>
            Send the terminfo string for cursor-movement, with no
            parameters substituted.

       <b>@TPUT@ longname</b>
            Print the long name from the <b>terminfo </b>database for the type
            of terminal specified in the environmental variable <b>TERM</b>.

            <b>@TPUT@ -S &lt;&lt;!</b>
            <b>&gt; clear</b>
            <b>&gt; cup 10 10</b>
            <b>&gt; bold</b>
            <b>&gt; !</b>

            This example shows <b>@TPUT@ </b>processing several capabilities in
            one invocation.  It clears the screen, moves the cursor to
            position 10, 10 and turns on bold (extra bright) mode.  The
            list is terminated by an exclamation mark (<b>!</b>) on a line by
            itself.

              tab settings for some terminals, in a format appropriate
              to be output to the terminal (escape sequences that set
              margins and tabs); for more information, see the <i>Tabs and</i>
              <i>Initialization</i>, section of <a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</a>
</pre> <h2>
EXIT CODES </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>-S </b>option is used, <b>@TPUT@ </b>checks for errors from each
       line, and if any errors are found, will set the exit code to 4
       plus the number of lines with errors.  If no errors are found,
       the exit code is <b>0</b>.  No indication of which line failed can be
       given so exit code <b>1 </b>will never appear.  Exit codes <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>
       retain their usual interpretation.  If the <b>-S </b>option is not used,
       the exit code depends on the type of <i>capname</i>:

          <i>boolean</i>
                 a value of <b>0 </b>is set for TRUE and <b>1 </b>for FALSE.

          <i>string</i> a value of <b>0 </b>is set if the <i>capname</i> is defined for this
                 terminal <i>type</i> (the value of <i>capname</i> is returned on
                 standard output); a value of <b>1 </b>is set if <i>capname</i> is not
                 defined for this terminal <i>type</i> (nothing is written to
                 standard output).

          <i>integer</i>
                 a value of <b>0 </b>is always set, whether or not <i>capname</i> is
                 defined for this terminal <i>type</i>.  To determine if
                 <i>capname</i> is defined for this terminal <i>type</i>, the user
                 must test the value written to standard output.  A
                 value of <b>-1 </b>means that <i>capname</i> is not defined for this
                 terminal <i>type</i>.

          <i>other</i>  <b>reset </b>or <b>init </b>may fail to find their respective files.
                 In that case, the exit code is set to 4 + <b>errno</b>.

       Any other exit code indicates an error; see the DIAGNOSTICS
       section.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>tput </b>command was begun by Bill Joy in 1980.  The initial
       version only cleared the screen.

       AT&amp;T System V provided a different <b>tput </b>command:

       •   SVr2 provided a rudimentary <b>tput </b>which checked the parameter
           against each predefined capability and returned the
           corresponding value.  This version of <b>tput </b>did not use
           <b>tparm</b>(3X) for the capabilities which are parameterized.

       •   SVr3 replaced that, a year later, by a more extensive program
           whose <b>init </b>and <b>reset </b>subcommands (more than half the program)
           were incorporated from the <b>reset </b>feature of BSD <b>tset </b>written
           by Eric Allman.

       •   SVr4 added color initialization using the <b>orig_colors </b>and
           <b>orig_pair </b>capabilities in the <b>init </b>subcommand.

       Keith Bostic replaced the BSD <b>tput </b>command in 1989 with a new
       implementation based on the AT&amp;T System V program <b>tput</b>.  Like the
       AT&amp;T program, Bostic's version accepted some parameters named for
       <i>terminfo</i> capabilities (<b>clear</b>, <b>init</b>, <b>longname </b>and <b>reset</b>).  However
       (because he had only <i>termcap</i> available), it accepted <i>termcap</i>
       names for other capabilities.  Also, Bostic's BSD <b>tput </b>did not
       modify the terminal I/O modes as the earlier BSD <b>tset </b>had done.

       At the same time, Bostic added a shell script named “clear”,
       which used <b>tput </b>to clear the screen.

       Both of these appeared in 4.4BSD, becoming the “modern” BSD
       implementation of <b>tput</b>.

       This implementation of <b>tput </b>began from a different source than
       AT&amp;T or BSD: Ross Ridge's <i>mytinfo</i> package, published on
       <i>comp.sources.unix</i> in December 1992.  Ridge's program made more
       sophisticated use of the terminal capabilities than the BSD
       program.  Eric Raymond used that <b>tput </b>program (and other parts of
       <i>mytinfo</i>) in ncurses in June 1995.  Using the portions dealing
       with terminal capabilities almost without change, Raymond made
       improvements to the way the command-line parameters were handled.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       This implementation of <b>tput </b>differs from AT&amp;T <b>tput </b>in two
       important areas:

       •   <b>@TPUT@ </b><i>capname</i> writes to the standard output.  That need not
           be a regular terminal.  However, the subcommands which
           manipulate terminal modes may not use the standard output.

           The AT&amp;T implementation's <b>init </b>and <b>reset </b>commands use the BSD
           (4.1c) <b>tset </b>source, which manipulates terminal modes.  It
           successively tries standard output, standard error, standard
           input before falling back to “/dev/tty” and finally just
           assumes a 1200Bd terminal.  When updating terminal modes, it
           ignores errors.

           Until changes made after ncurses 6.0, <b>@TPUT@ </b>did not modify
           terminal modes.  <b>@TPUT@ </b>now uses a similar scheme, using
           functions shared with <b>@TSET@ </b>(and ultimately based on the
           4.4BSD <b>tset</b>).  If it is not able to open a terminal, e.g.,
           when running in <b>cron</b>(1), <b>@TPUT@ </b>will return an error.

       •   AT&amp;T <b>tput </b>guesses the type of its <i>capname</i> operands by seeing
           if all of the characters are numeric, or not.

           Most implementations which provide support for <i>capname</i>
           operands use the <b>tparm </b>function to expand parameters in it.
           That function expects a mixture of numeric and string
           parameters, requiring <b>@TPUT@ </b>to know which type to use.

           This implementation uses a table to determine the parameter
           types for the standard <i>capname</i> operands, and an internal
           library function to analyze nonstandard <i>capname</i> operands.

           Besides providing more reliable operation than AT&amp;T's
           utility, a portability problem is introduced by this
           analysis: An OpenBSD developer adapted the internal library
           function from ncurses to port NetBSD's termcap-based <b>tput </b>to
           terminfo.  That had been modified to interpret multiple
           commands on a line.  Portable applications should not rely
           upon this feature; ncurses provides it to support
           applications written specifically for OpenBSD.

       This implementation (unlike others) can accept both <i>termcap</i> and
       <i>terminfo</i> names for the <i>capname</i> feature, if <i>termcap</i> support is
       compiled in.  However, the predefined <i>termcap</i> and <i>terminfo</i> names
       have two ambiguities in this case (and the <i>terminfo</i> name is
       assumed):

       •   The <i>termcap</i> name <b>dl </b>corresponds to the <i>terminfo</i> name <b>dl1</b>
           (delete one line).
           The <i>terminfo</i> name <b>dl </b>corresponds to the <i>termcap</i> name <b>DL</b>
           (delete a given number of lines).

       •   The <i>termcap</i> name <b>ed </b>corresponds to the <i>terminfo</i> name <b>rmdc</b>
           (end delete mode).
           The <i>terminfo</i> name <b>ed </b>corresponds to the <i>termcap</i> name <b>cd</b>
           (clear to end of screen).

       The <b>longname </b>and <b>-S </b>options, and the parameter-substitution
       features used in the <b>cup </b>example, were not supported in BSD
       curses before 4.3reno (1989) or in AT&amp;T/USL curses before SVr4
       (1988).

       IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open Group  Base Specifications Issue 7
       (POSIX.1-2008) documents only the operands for <b>clear</b>, <b>init </b>and
       <b>reset</b>.  There are a few interesting observations to make
       regarding that:

       •   In this implementation, <b>clear </b>is part of the <i>capname</i> support.
           The others (<b>init </b>and <b>longname</b>) do not correspond to terminal
           capabilities.

       •   Other implementations of <b>tput </b>on SVr4-based systems such as
           Solaris, IRIX64 and HPUX as well as others such as AIX and
           Tru64 provide support for <i>capname</i> operands.

       •   A few platforms such as FreeBSD recognize termcap names
           rather than terminfo capability names in their respective
           <b>tput </b>commands.  Since 2010, NetBSD's <b>tput </b>uses terminfo
           names.  Before that, it (like FreeBSD) recognized termcap
           names.

           Beginning in 2021, FreeBSD uses the ncurses <b>tput</b>, configured
           for both terminfo (tested first) and termcap (as a fallback).

       Because (apparently) <i>all</i> of the certified Unix systems support
       the full set of capability names, the reasoning for documenting
       only a few may not be apparent.

       •   X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents <b>tput </b>differently, with
           <i>capname</i> and the other features used in this implementation.

       •   That is, there are two standards for <b>tput</b>: POSIX (a subset)
           and X/Open Curses (the full implementation).  POSIX documents
           a subset to avoid the complication of including X/Open Curses
           and the terminal capabilities database.

       •   While it is certainly possible to write a <b>tput </b>program
           without using curses, none of the systems which have a curses
           implementation provide a <b>tput </b>utility which does not provide
           the <i>capname</i> feature.

       X/Open Curses Issue 7 (2009) is the first version to document
       utilities.  However that part of X/Open Curses does not follow
       existing practice (i.e., Unix features documented in SVID 3):

       •   It assigns exit code 4 to “invalid operand”, which may be the
           same as <i>unknown capability</i>.  For instance, the source code
           for Solaris' xcurses uses the term “invalid” in this case.

       •   It assigns exit code 255 to a numeric variable that is not
           specified in the terminfo database.  That likely is a
           documentation error, confusing the <b>-1 </b>written to the standard
           output for an absent or cancelled numeric value versus an
           (unsigned) exit code.

       The various Unix systems (AIX, HPUX, Solaris) use the same exit-
       codes as ncurses.

       NetBSD curses documents different exit codes which do not
       correspond to either ncurses or X/Open.
