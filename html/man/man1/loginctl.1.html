SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>loginctl </b>[OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>loginctl </b>may be used to introspect and control the state of the
       <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> login manager <a href="../man8/systemd-logind.service.8.html">systemd-logind.service(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are understood:

   <b>Session Commands</b>
       <b>list-sessions</b>
           List current sessions. The JSON format output can be toggled
           using <b>--json= </b>or <b>-j </b>option.

       <b>session-status </b>[<i>ID</i>...]
           Show terse runtime status information about one or more
           sessions, followed by the most recent log data from the
           journal. Takes one or more session identifiers as parameters.
           If no session identifiers are passed, the status of the
           caller's session is shown. This function is intended to
           generate human-readable output. If you are looking for
           computer-parsable output, use <b>show-session </b>instead.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>show-session </b>[<i>ID</i>...]
           Show properties of one or more sessions or the manager
           itself. If no argument is specified, properties of the
           manager will be shown. If a session ID is specified,
           properties of the session are shown. Specially, if the given
           ID is "self", the session to which the <b>loginctl </b>process
           belongs is used. If "auto", the current session is used as
           with "self" if exists, and falls back to the current user's
           graphical session. By default, empty properties are
           suppressed. Use <b>--all </b>to show those too. To select specific
           properties to show, use <b>--property=</b>. This command is intended
           to be used whenever computer-parsable output is required. Use
           <b>session-status </b>if you are looking for formatted
           human-readable output.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>activate </b>[<i>ID</i>]
           Activate a session. This brings a session into the foreground
           if another session is currently in the foreground on the
           respective seat. Takes a session identifier as argument. If
           no argument is specified, the session of the caller is put
           into foreground.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>lock-session </b>[<i>ID</i>...], <b>unlock-session </b>[<i>ID</i>...]
           Activates/deactivates the screen lock on one or more
           sessions, if the session supports it. Takes one or more
           session identifiers as arguments. If no argument is
           specified, the session of the caller is locked/unlocked.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>lock-sessions</b>, <b>unlock-sessions</b>
           Activates/deactivates the screen lock on all current sessions
           supporting it.

           Added in version 188.

       <b>terminate-session </b><i>ID</i>...
           Terminates a session. This kills all processes of the session
           and deallocates all resources attached to the session. If the
           argument is specified as empty string the session invoking
           the command is terminated.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>kill-session </b><i>ID</i>...
           Send a signal to one or more processes of the session. Use
           <b>--kill-whom= </b>to select which process to kill. Use <b>--signal=</b>
           to select the signal to send. If the argument is specified as
           empty string the signal is sent to the session invoking the
           command.

           Added in version 233.

   <b>User Commands</b>
       <b>list-users</b>
           List currently logged in users. The JSON format output can be
           toggled using <b>--json= </b>or <b>-j </b>option.

       <b>user-status </b>[<i>USER</i>...]
           Show terse runtime status information about one or more
           logged in users, followed by the most recent log data from
           the journal. Takes one or more user names or numeric user IDs
           as parameters. If no parameters are passed, the status is
           shown for the user of the session of the caller. This
           function is intended to generate human-readable output. If
           you are looking for computer-parsable output, use <b>show-user</b>
           instead.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>show-user </b>[<i>USER</i>...]
           Show properties of one or more users or the manager itself.
           If no argument is specified, properties of the manager will
           be shown. If a user is specified, properties of the user are
           shown. By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use <b>--all</b>
           to show those too. To select specific properties to show, use
           <b>--property=</b>. This command is intended to be used whenever
           computer-parsable output is required. Use <b>user-status </b>if you
           are looking for formatted human-readable output.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>enable-linger </b>[<i>USER</i>...], <b>disable-linger </b>[<i>USER</i>...]
           Enable/disable user lingering for one or more users. If
           enabled for a specific user, a user manager is spawned for
           the user at boot and kept around after logouts. This allows
           users who are not logged in to run long-running services.
           Takes one or more user names or numeric UIDs as argument. If
           no argument is specified, enables/disables lingering for the
           user of the session of the caller.

           See also <i>KillUserProcesses=</i> setting in <a href="../man5/logind.conf.5.html">logind.conf(5)</a>.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>terminate-user </b><i>USER</i>...
           Terminates all sessions of a user. This kills all processes
           of all sessions of the user and deallocates all runtime
           resources attached to the user. If the argument is specified
           as empty string the sessions of the user invoking the command
           are terminated.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>kill-user </b><i>USER</i>...
           Send a signal to all processes of a user. Use <b>--signal= </b>to
           select the signal to send. If the argument is specified as
           empty string the signal is sent to the sessions of the user
           invoking the command.

           Added in version 233.

   <b>Seat Commands</b>
       <b>list-seats</b>
           List currently available seats on the local system. The JSON
           format output can be toggled using <b>--json= </b>or <b>-j </b>option.

       <b>seat-status </b>[<i>NAME</i>...]
           Show terse runtime status information about one or more
           seats. Takes one or more seat names as parameters. If no seat
           names are passed the status of the caller's session's seat is
           shown. This function is intended to generate human-readable
           output. If you are looking for computer-parsable output, use
           <b>show-seat </b>instead.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>show-seat </b>[<i>NAME</i>...]
           Show properties of one or more seats or the manager itself.
           If no argument is specified, properties of the manager will
           be shown. If a seat is specified, properties of the seat are
           shown. By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use <b>--all</b>
           to show those too. To select specific properties to show, use
           <b>--property=</b>. This command is intended to be used whenever
           computer-parsable output is required. Use <b>seat-status </b>if you
           are looking for formatted human-readable output.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>attach </b><i>NAME DEVICE</i>...
           Persistently attach one or more devices to a seat. The
           devices should be specified via device paths in the /sys/
           file system. To create a new seat, attach at least one
           graphics card to a previously unused seat name. Seat names
           may consist only of a–z, A–Z, 0–9, "-" and "_" and must be
           prefixed with "seat". To drop assignment of a device to a
           specific seat, just reassign it to a different seat, or use
           <b>flush-devices</b>.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>flush-devices</b>
           Removes all device assignments previously created with
           <b>attach</b>. After this call, only automatically generated seats
           will remain, and all seat hardware is assigned to them.

       <b>terminate-seat </b><i>NAME</i>...
           Terminates all sessions on a seat. This kills all processes
           of all sessions on the seat and deallocates all runtime
           resources attached to them.

           Added in version 233.

           operations.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--property=</b>
           When showing session/user/seat properties, limit display to
           certain properties as specified as argument. If not
           specified, all set properties are shown. The argument should
           be a property name, such as "Sessions". If specified more
           than once, all properties with the specified names are shown.

       <b>--value</b>
           When showing session/user/seat properties, only print the
           value, and skip the property name and "=".

           Added in version 230.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
           When showing session/user/seat properties, show all
           properties regardless of whether they are set or not.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--full</b>
           Do not ellipsize process tree entries.

           Added in version 198.

       <b>--kill-whom=</b>
           When used with <b>kill-session</b>, choose which processes to kill.
           Takes one of "leader" or "all", to select whether to kill
           only the leader process of the session or all processes of
           the session. If omitted, defaults to <b>all</b>.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--signal=</b>
           When used with <b>kill-session </b>or <b>kill-user</b>, choose which signal
           to send to selected processes. Must be one of the well known
           signal specifiers, such as <b>SIGTERM</b>, <b>SIGINT </b>or <b>SIGSTOP</b>. If
           omitted, defaults to <b>SIGTERM</b>.

           The special value "help" will list the known values and the
           program will exit immediately, and the special value "list"
           will list known values along with the numerical signal
           numbers and the program will exit immediately.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--lines=</b>
           When used with <b>user-status </b>and <b>session-status</b>, controls the
           number of journal lines to show, counting from the most
           recent ones. Takes a positive integer argument. Defaults to
           10.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output=</b>
           When used with <b>user-status </b>and <b>session-status</b>, controls the
           formatting of the journal entries that are shown. For the
           available choices, see <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a>. Defaults to "short".

           Added in version 219.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
           username and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The
           hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is
           listening on, separated by ":", and then a container name,
           separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific
           container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to
           the remote machine manager instance. Container names may be
           enumerated with <b>machinectl -H </b><i>HOST</i>. Put IPv6 addresses in
           brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
           name to connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to
           connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special
           string ".host" is used in place of the container name, a
           connection to the local system is made (which is useful to
           connect to a specific user's user bus: "--user
           --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
           connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used
           either the left hand side or the right hand side may be
           omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and
           ".host" are implied.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer
           with hints.

       <b>--json=</b><i>MODE</i>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for
           the shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace
           or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same,
           with indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON
           output, the default).

       <b>-j</b>
           Equivalent to <b>--json=pretty </b>if running on a terminal, and
           <b>--json=short </b>otherwise.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
</pre> <h2>

       There are two sessions, 3 and 5. Session 3 is a graphical
       session, marked with a star. The tree of processing including the
       two corresponding scope units and the user manager unit are
       shown.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</i>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a
           higher log level, i.e. less important ones, will be
           suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value
           may be either one of (in order of decreasing importance)
           <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an
           integer in the range 0...7. See <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a> for more
           information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with one
           of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg </b>or <b>journal </b>followed by a colon to
           set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.
           <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info </b>specifies to log at
           debug level except when logging to the console which should
           be at info level). Note that the global maximum log level
           takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be
           colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and other
           tools that display logs will color messages based on the log
           level on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</i>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed
           with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal or a file, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and
           other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on
           the entry metadata on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename
           and line number in the source code where the message
           originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to
           journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
           text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the
           current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to
           journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
           text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</i>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console </b>(log to the
           attached tty), <b>console-prefixed </b>(log to the attached tty but
           with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see
           <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>, <b>kmsg </b>(log to the kernel circular log buffer),
           <b>journal </b>(log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg </b>(log to the
           journal if available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto </b>(determine
           the appropriate log target automatically, the default), <b>null</b>
           (disable log output).

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</i>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults
           to "true". If disabled, systemd will not ratelimit messages
           written to kmsg.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager </b>is not given; overrides <i>$PAGER</i>.
           If neither <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> nor <i>$PAGER</i> are set, a set of
           well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including
           <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> and <a href="more.1.html">more(1)</a>, until one is found. If no pager
           implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting
           this environment variable to an empty string or the value
           "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> (as
           well as <i>$PAGER</i>) will be silently ignored.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i>
           Override the options passed to <b>less </b>(by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when
               Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less </b>to handle Ctrl+C itself
               to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this
               option.

               If the value of <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i> does not include "K", and
               the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C will be ignored
               by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap
               initialization and deinitialization strings to the
               terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to
               remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
               exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager
               functionality from working, in particular paged output
               cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESS</i> environment variable has
           no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

           See <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> for more discussion.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</i>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less </b>(by default "utf-8", if
           the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESSCHARSET</i> environment
           variable has no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the
           pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective
           UID is not the same as the owner of the login session, see
           <a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid(2)</a> and <a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid(3)</a>. In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1 </b>will be set when invoking the pager, and the
           pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or
           start new subprocesses. When <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set
           at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode
           will not be used. (Currently only <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for
           example under <a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo(8)</a> or <b>pkexec</b>(1), care must be taken to
           ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled.
           "Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as
           describe above. Setting <i>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</i> or not removing
           it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke
           arbitrary commands. Note that if the <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> or <i>$PAGER</i>
           variables are to be honoured, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> must be
           set too. It might be reasonable to completely disable the
           pager using <b>--no-pager </b>instead.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd </b>and related
           utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the
           output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can
           take one of the following special values: "16", "256" to
           restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic
           decision based on <i>$TERM</i> and what the console is connected to.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</i>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links
           should be generated in the output for terminal emulators
           supporting this. This can be specified to override the
           decision that <b>systemd </b>makes based on <i>$TERM</i> and other
           conditions.
