SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       c99 <b>[</b><i>options</i>...<b>] </b><i>pathname</i> <b>[[</b><i>pathname</i><b>] [</b>-I <i>directory</i><b>]</b>
           <b>[</b>-L <i>directory</i><b>] [</b>-l <i>library</i><b>]]</b>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>c99</i> utility is an interface to the standard C compilation
       system; it shall accept source code conforming to the ISO C
       standard. The system conceptually consists of a compiler and link
       editor. The input files referenced by <i>pathname</i> operands and <b>-l</b>
       option-arguments shall be compiled and linked to produce an
       executable file. (It is unspecified whether the linking occurs
       entirely within the operation of <i>c99</i>; some implementations may
       produce objects that are not fully resolved until the file is
       executed.)

       If the <b>-c </b>option is specified, for all pathname operands of the
       form <i>file</i><b>.c</b>, the files:

           $(basename <i>pathname</i> .c).o

       shall be created as the result of successful compilation. If the
       <b>-c </b>option is not specified, it is unspecified whether such <b>.o</b>
       files are created or deleted for the <i>file</i><b>.c </b>operands.

       If there are no options that prevent link editing (such as <b>-c </b>or
       <b>-E</b>), and all input files compile and link without error, the
       resulting executable file shall be written according to the <b>-o</b>
       <i>outfile</i> option (if present) or to the file <b>a.out</b>.

       The executable file shall be created as specified in <i>Section</i>
       <i>1.1.1.4</i>, <i>File Read</i>, <i>Write</i>, <i>and Creation</i>, except that the file
       permission bits shall be set to: S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU

       and the bits specified by the <i>umask</i> of the process shall be
       cleared.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>c99</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       that:

        *  Options can be interspersed with operands.

        *  The order of specifying the <b>-L </b>and <b>-l </b>options, and the order
           of specifying <b>-l </b>options with respect to <i>pathname</i> operands is
           significant.

        *  Conforming applications shall specify each option separately;
           that is, grouping option letters (for example, <b>-cO</b>) need not
           be recognized by all implementations.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c        </b>Suppress the link-edit phase of the compilation, and do
                 not remove any object files that are produced.

       <b>-D </b><i>name</i><b>[=</b><i>value</i><b>]</b>
                 Define <i>name</i> as if by a C-language <b>#define </b>directive. If
                 no =<i>value</i> is given, a value of 1 shall be used. The <b>-D</b>
                 option has lower precedence than the <b>-U </b>option. That
                 is, if <i>name</i> is used in both a <b>-U </b>and a <b>-D </b>option, <i>name</i>
                 shall be undefined regardless of the order of the
                 options. Additional implementation-defined <i>name</i>s may be
                 provided by the compiler. Implementations shall support
                 at least 2048 bytes of <b>-D </b>definitions and 256 <i>names</i>.

       <b>-E        </b>Copy C-language source files to standard output,
                 executing all preprocessor directives; no compilation
                 shall be performed. If any operand is not a text file,
                 the effects are unspecified.

       <b>-g        </b>Produce symbolic information in the object or
                 executable files; the nature of this information is
                 unspecified, and may be modified by implementation-
                 defined interactions with other options.

       <b>-I </b><i>directory</i>
                 Change the algorithm for searching for headers whose
                 names are not absolute pathnames to look in the
                 directory named by the <i>directory</i> pathname before
                 looking in the usual places. Thus, headers whose names
                 are enclosed in double-quotes (<b>""</b>) shall be searched
                 for first in the directory of the file with the
                 <b>#include </b>line, then in directories named in <b>-I </b>options,
                 and last in the usual places. For headers whose names
                 are enclosed in angle brackets (<b>"&lt;&gt;"</b>), the header shall
                 be searched for only in directories named in <b>-I </b>options
                 and then in the usual places. Directories named in <b>-I</b>
                 options shall be searched in the order specified. If
                 the <b>-I </b>option is used to specify a directory that is
                 one of the usual places searched by default, the
                 results are unspecified. Implementations shall support
                 at least ten instances of this option in a single <i>c99</i>
                 command invocation.

       <b>-L </b><i>directory</i>
                 Change the algorithm of searching for the libraries
                 named in the <b>-l </b>objects to look in the directory named
                 by the <i>directory</i> pathname before looking in the usual
                 places. Directories named in <b>-L </b>options shall be
                 searched in the order specified. If the <b>-L </b>option is
                 used to specify a directory that is one of the usual
                 places searched by default, the results are
                 unspecified. Implementations shall support at least ten
                 instances of this option in a single <i>c99</i> command
                 invocation. If a directory specified by a <b>-L </b>option
                 contains files with names starting with any of the
                 strings <b>"libc."</b>, <b>"libl."</b>, <b>"libpthread."</b>, <b>"libm."</b>,
                 <b>"librt."</b>, <b>"libtrace."</b>, <b>"libxnet."</b>, or <b>"liby."</b>, the
                 results are unspecified.

       <b>-l </b><i>library</i>
                 Search the library named <b>liblibrary.a</b>.  A library shall
                 be searched when its name is encountered, so the
                 placement of a <b>-l </b>option is significant. Several
                 standard libraries can be specified in this manner, as
                 described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
                 Implementations may recognize implementation-defined
                 suffixes other than <b>.a </b>as denoting libraries.

       <b>-O </b><i>optlevel</i>
                 Specify the level of code optimization. If the <i>optlevel</i>
                 option-argument is the digit <b>'0'</b>, all special code
                 optimizations shall be disabled. If it is the digit
                 <b>'1'</b>, the nature of the optimization is unspecified. If
                 the <b>-O </b>option is omitted, the nature of the system's
                 default optimization is unspecified. It is unspecified
                 whether code generated in the presence of the <b>-O </b>0
                 option is the same as that generated when <b>-O </b>is
                 omitted. Other <i>optlevel</i> values may be supported.

       <b>-o </b><i>outfile</i>
                 Use the pathname <i>outfile</i>, instead of the default <b>a.out</b>,
                 for the executable file produced. If the <b>-o </b>option is
                 present with <b>-c </b>or <b>-E</b>, the result is unspecified.

       <b>-s        </b>Produce object or executable files, or both, from which
                 symbolic and other information not required for proper
                 execution using the <i>exec</i> family defined in the System
                 Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 has been removed
                 (stripped). If both <b>-g </b>and <b>-s </b>options are present, the
                 action taken is unspecified.

       <b>-U </b><i>name</i>   Remove any initial definition of <i>name</i>.

       Multiple instances of the <b>-D</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-l</b>, and <b>-U </b>options can be
       specified.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The application shall ensure that at least one <i>pathname</i> operand
       is specified. The following forms for <i>pathname</i> operands shall be
       supported:

       <i>file.</i><b>c    </b>A C-language source file to be compiled and optionally
                 linked. The application shall ensure that the operand
                 is of this form if the <b>-c </b>option is used.

       <i>file.</i><b>a    </b>A library of object files typically produced by the <i>ar</i>
                 utility, and passed directly to the link editor.
                 Implementations may recognize implementation-defined
                 suffixes other than <b>.a </b>as denoting object file
                 libraries.

       <i>file.</i><b>o    </b>An object file produced by <i>c99</i> <b>-c </b>and passed directly
                 to the link editor. Implementations may recognize
                 implementation-defined suffixes other than <b>.o </b>as
                 denoting object files.

       The processing of other files is implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Each input file shall be one of the following: a text file
       containing a C-language source program, an object file in the
       format produced by <i>c99</i> <b>-c</b>, or a library of object files, in the
       format produced by archiving zero or more object files, using <i>ar</i>.
       Implementations may supply additional utilities that produce
       files in these formats. Additional input file formats are
       implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>c99</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TMPDIR</i>    Provide a pathname that should override the default
                 directory for temporary files, if any.  On XSI-
                 conforming systems, provide a pathname that shall
                 override the default directory for temporary files, if
                 any.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If more than one <i>pathname</i> operand ending in <b>.c </b>(or possibly other
       unspecified suffixes) is given, for each such file:

           "%s:\n", &lt;<i>pathname</i>&gt;

       may be written. These messages, if written, shall precede the
       processing of each input file; they shall not be written to the
       standard output if they are written to the standard error, as
       described in the STDERR section.

       If the <b>-E </b>option is specified, the standard output shall be a
       text file that represents the results of the preprocessing stage
       of the language; it may contain extra information appropriate for
       subsequent compilation passes.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
       If more than one <i>pathname</i> operand ending in <b>.c </b>(or possibly other
       unspecified suffixes) is given, for each such file:

           "%s:\n", &lt;<i>pathname</i>&gt;

       may be written to allow identification of the diagnostic and
       warning messages with the appropriate input file. These messages,
       if written, shall precede the processing of each input file; they
       shall not be written to the standard error if they are written to
       the standard output, as described in the STDOUT section.

       This utility may produce warning messages about certain
       conditions that do not warrant returning an error (non-zero) exit
       value.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Object files or executable files or both are produced in
       unspecified formats. If the pathname of an object file or
       executable file to be created by <i>c99</i> resolves to an existing
       directory entry for a file that is not a regular file, it is
       unspecified whether <i>c99</i> shall attempt to create the file or shall
       issue a diagnostic and exit with a non-zero exit status.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Standard Libraries</b>
       The <i>c99</i> utility shall recognize the following <b>-l </b>options for
       standard libraries:

       <b>-l c      </b>This option shall make available all interfaces
                 referenced in the System Interfaces volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, with the possible exception of those
                 interfaces listed as residing in <i>&lt;aio.h&gt;</i>,
                 <i>&lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;complex.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;math.h&gt;</i>,

                 <i>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;sched.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;semaphore.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</i>,
                 <i>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</i>, <i>pthread_kill</i>(), and <i>pthread_sigmask</i>()
                 in <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i>, interfaces marked as optional
                 in <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i>, interfaces marked as ADV (Advisory
                 Information) in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, and interfaces beginning
                 with the prefix clock_ or timer_ in <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.  This
                 option shall not be required to be present to cause a
                 search of this library.

       <b>-l l      </b>This option shall make available all interfaces
                 required by the C-language output of <i>lex</i> that are not
                 made available through the <b>-l c </b>option.

       <b>-l pthread</b>
                 This option shall make available all interfaces
                 referenced in <i>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</i> and <i>pthread_kill</i>() and
                 <i>pthread_sigmask</i>() referenced in <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>.  An
                 implementation may search this library in the absence
                 of this option.

       <b>-l m      </b>This option shall make available all interfaces
                 referenced in <i>&lt;math.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;complex.h&gt;</i>, and <i>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</i>.  An
                 implementation may search this library in the absence
                 of this option.

       <b>-l rt     </b>This option shall make available all interfaces
                 referenced in <i>&lt;aio.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;mqueue.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;sched.h&gt;</i>,
                 <i>&lt;semaphore.h&gt;</i>, and <i>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</i>, interfaces marked as
                 optional in <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i>, interfaces marked as ADV
                 (Advisory Information) in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, and interfaces
                 beginning with the prefix clock_ and timer_ in
                 <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.  An implementation may search this library in
                 the absence of this option.

       <b>-l trace  </b>This option shall make available all interfaces
                 referenced in <i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i>.  An implementation may search
                 this library in the absence of this option.

       <b>-l xnet   </b>This option shall make available all interfaces
                 referenced in <i>&lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;netdb.h&gt;</i>, <i>&lt;net/if.h&gt;</i>,
                 <i>&lt;netinet/in.h&gt;</i>, and <i>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</i>.  An implementation
                 may search this library in the absence of this option.

       <b>-l y      </b>This option shall make available all interfaces
                 required by the C-language output of <i>yacc</i> that are not
                 made available through the <b>-l c </b>option.

       In the absence of options that inhibit invocation of the link
       editor, such as <b>-c </b>or <b>-E</b>, the <i>c99</i> utility shall cause the
       equivalent of a <b>-l c </b>option to be passed to the link editor after
       the last <i>pathname</i> operand or <b>-l </b>option, causing it to be searched
       after all other object files and libraries are loaded.

       It is unspecified whether the libraries <b>libc.a</b>, <b>libl.a</b>, <b>libm.a</b>,
       <b>libpthread.a</b>, <b>librt.a</b>, <b>libtrace.a</b>, <b>libxnet.a</b>, or <b>liby.a </b>exist as
       regular files. The implementation may accept as <b>-l </b>option-
       arguments names of objects that do not exist as regular files.

   <b>External Symbols</b>
       The C compiler and link editor shall support the significance of
       external symbols up to a length of at least 31 bytes; the action
       taken upon encountering symbols exceeding the implementation-
       defined maximum symbol length is unspecified.

       The compiler and link editor shall support a minimum of 511
       external symbols per source or object file, and a minimum of 4095
       external symbols in total. A diagnostic message shall be written
       to the standard output if the implementation-defined limit is
       exceeded; other actions are unspecified.

   <b>Header Search</b>
       If a file with the same name as one of the standard headers
       defined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter</i>
       <i>13</i>, <i>Headers</i>, not provided as part of the implementation, is
       placed in any of the usual places that are searched by default
       for headers, the results are unspecified.

   <b>Programming Environments</b>
       All implementations shall support one of the following
       programming environments as a default. Implementations may
       support more than one of the following programming environments.
       Applications can use <i>sysconf</i>() or <i>getconf</i> to determine which
       programming environments are supported.

       All implementations shall support one or more environments where
       the widths of the following types are no greater than the width
       of type <b>long</b>:
                      <b>blksize_t   ptrdiff_t     tcflag_t</b>
                      <b>cc_t        size_t        wchar_t</b>

                      <b>pid_t       suseconds_t</b>

       The executable files created when these environments are selected
       shall be in a proper format for execution by the <i>exec</i> family of
       functions. Each environment may be one of the ones in <i>Table 4-4,</i>
       <i>Programming Environments: Type Sizes</i>, or it may be another
       environment. The names for the environments that meet this
       requirement shall be output by a <i>getconf</i> command using the
       POSIX_V7_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS argument, as a &lt;newline&gt;-separated
       list of names suitable for use with the <i>getconf</i> <b>-v </b>option. If
       more than one environment meets the requirement, the names of all
       such environments shall be output on separate lines. Any of these
       names can then be used in a subsequent <i>getconf</i> command to obtain
       the flags specific to that environment with the following
       suffixes added as appropriate:

       _CFLAGS   To get the C compiler flags.

       _LDFLAGS  To get the linker/loader flags.

       _LIBS     To get the libraries.

       This requirement may be removed in a future version.

       When this utility processes a file containing a function called
       <i>main</i>(), it shall be defined with a return type equivalent to <b>int</b>.
       Using return from the initial call to <i>main</i>() shall be equivalent
       (other than with respect to language scope issues) to calling
       <i>exit</i>() with the returned value. Reaching the end of the initial
       call to <i>main</i>() shall be equivalent to calling <b>exit</b>(0).  The
       implementation shall not declare a prototype for this function.

       Implementations provide configuration strings for C compiler
       flags, linker/loader flags, and libraries for each supported
       environment.  When an application needs to use a specific
       programming environment rather than the implementation default
       programming environment while compiling, the application shall
       first verify that the implementation supports the desired
       environment. If the desired programming environment is supported,
       the application shall then invoke <i>c99</i> with the appropriate C
       compiler flags as the first options for the compile, the
       appropriate linker/loader flags after any other options except <b>-l</b>
       but before any operands or <b>-l </b>options, and the appropriate
       libraries at the end of the operands and <b>-l </b>options.

       Conforming applications shall not attempt to link together object
       files compiled for different programming models. Applications
       shall also be aware that binary data placed in shared memory or
       in files might not be recognized by applications built for other
       programming models.

       In addition to the type size programming environments above, all
       implementations also support a multi-threaded programming
       environment that is orthogonal to all of the programming
       environments listed above.  The <i>getconf</i> utility can be used to
       get flags for the threaded programming environment, as indicated

       These programming environment flags may be used in conjunction
       with any of the type size programming environments supported by
       the implementation.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful compilation or link edit.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       When <i>c99</i> encounters a compilation error that causes an object
       file not to be created, it shall write a diagnostic to standard
       error and continue to compile other source code operands, but it
       shall not perform the link phase and it shall return a non-zero
       exit status. If the link edit is unsuccessful, a diagnostic
       message shall be written to standard error and <i>c99</i> exits with a
       non-zero status. A conforming application shall rely on the exit
       status of <i>c99</i>, rather than on the existence or mode of the
       executable file.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since the <i>c99</i> utility usually creates files in the current
       directory during the compilation process, it is typically
       necessary to run the <i>c99</i> utility in a directory in which a file
       can be created.

       On systems providing POSIX Conformance (see the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 2</i>, <i>Conformance</i>), <i>c99</i> is required
       only with the C-Language Development option; XSI-conformant
       systems always provide <i>c99</i>.

       Some historical implementations have created <b>.o </b>files when <b>-c </b>is
       not specified and more than one source file is given. Since this
       area is left unspecified, the application cannot rely on <b>.o </b>files
       being created, but it also must be prepared for any related <b>.o</b>
       files that already exist being deleted at the completion of the
       link edit.

       There is the possible implication that if a user supplies
       versions of the standard functions (before they would be
       encountered by an implicit <b>-l c </b>or explicit <b>-l m</b>), that those
       versions would be used in place of the standard versions.  There
       are various reasons this might not be true (functions defined as
       macros, manipulations for clean name space, and so on), so the
       existence of files named in the same manner as the standard
       libraries within the <b>-L </b>directories is explicitly stated to
       produce unspecified behavior.

       All of the functions specified in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 may be made visible by implementations when the
       Standard C Library is searched. Conforming applications must
       explicitly request searching the other standard libraries when
       functions made visible by those libraries are used.

       In the ISO C standard the mapping from physical source characters
       to the C source character set is implementation-defined.
       Implementations may strip white-space characters before the
       terminating &lt;newline&gt; of a (physical) line as part of this
       mapping and, as a consequence of this, one or more white-space
       characters (and no other characters) between a &lt;backslash&gt;
       character and the &lt;newline&gt; character that terminates the line
       produces implementation-defined results. Portable applications
       should not use such constructs.

       Some <i>c99</i> compilers not conforming to POSIX.1‐2008 do not support
       trigraphs by default.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. The following usage example compiles <b>foo.c </b>and creates the
           executable file <b>foo</b>:

               c99 -o foo foo.c

           The following usage example compiles <b>foo.c </b>and creates the
           object file <b>foo.o</b>:

               c99 -c foo.c

           The following usage example compiles <b>foo.c </b>and creates the
           executable file <b>a.out</b>:

               c99 foo.c

           The following usage example compiles <b>foo.c</b>, links it with
           <b>bar.o</b>, and creates the executable file <b>a.out</b>.  It may also
           create and leave <b>foo.o</b>:

               c99 foo.c bar.o

        2. The following example shows how an application using threads
           interfaces can test for support of and use a programming
           environment supporting 32-bit <b>int</b>, <b>long</b>, and <b>pointer </b>types
           and an <b>off_t </b>type using at least 64 bits:

               offbig_env=$(getconf _POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG)
               if [ $offbig_env != "-1" ] &amp;&amp; [ $offbig_env != "undefined" ]
               then
                   c99 $(getconf POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG_CFLAGS) \
                   $(getconf POSIX_V7_THREADS_CFLAGS) -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=700 \
                   $(getconf POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS) \
                   $(getconf POSIX_V7_THREADS_LDFLAGS) foo.c -o foo \
                   $(getconf POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFFBIG_LIBS) \
                   -l pthread
               else
                   echo ILP32_OFFBIG programming environment not supported
                   exit 1
               fi

        3. The following examples clarify the use and interactions of <b>-L</b>
           and <b>-l </b>options.

           Consider the case in which module <b>a.c </b>calls function <i>f</i>() in
           library <b>libQ.a</b>, and module <b>b.c </b>calls function <i>g</i>() in library
           <b>libp.a</b>.  Assume that both libraries reside in <b>/a/b/c</b>.  The
           command line to compile and link in the desired way is:

               c99 -L /a/b/c main.o a.c -l Q b.c -l p

           In this case the <b>-L </b>option need only precede the first <b>-l</b>
           option, since both <b>libQ.a </b>and <b>libp.a </b>reside in the same
           directory.

           Multiple <b>-L </b>options can be used when library name collisions
           occur. Building on the previous example, suppose that the
           user wants to use a new <b>libp.a</b>, in <b>/a/a/a</b>, but still wants
           <i>f</i>() from <b>/a/b/c/libQ.a</b>:

               c99 -L /a/a/a -L /a/b/c main.o a.c -l Q b.c -l p

           In this example, the linker searches the <b>-L </b>options in the
           order specified, and finds <b>/a/a/a/libp.a </b>before <b>/a/b/c/libp.a</b>
           when resolving references for <b>b.c</b>.  The order of the <b>-l</b>
           options is still important, however.

        4. The following example shows how an application can use a
           programming environment where the widths of the following
           types: <b>blksize_t</b>, <b>cc_t</b>, <b>mode_t</b>, <b>nfds_t</b>, <b>pid_t</b>, <b>ptrdiff_t</b>,
           <b>size_t</b>, <b>speed_t</b>, <b>ssize_t</b>, <b>suseconds_t</b>, <b>tcflag_t</b>, <b>wchar_t</b>,
           <b>wint_t</b>

           are no greater than the width of type <b>long</b>:

               # First choose one of the listed environments ...

               # ... if there are no additional constraints, the first one will do:
               CENV=$(getconf POSIX_V7_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS | head -n l)

               # ... or, if an environment that supports large files is preferred,
               # look for names that contain "OFF64" or "OFFBIG". (This chooses
               # the last one in the list if none match.)
               for CENV in $(getconf POSIX_V7_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS)
               do
                   case $CENV in
                   *OFF64*|*OFFBIG*) break ;;
                   esac
               done

               # The chosen environment name can now be used like this:

               c99 $(getconf ${CENV}_CFLAGS) -D _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L \
               $(getconf ${CENV}_LDFLAGS) foo.c -o foo \
               $(getconf ${CENV}_LIBS)
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>c99</i> utility is based on the <i>c89</i> utility originally introduced
       in the ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard.

       Some of the changes from <i>c89</i> include the ability to intersperse
       options and operands (which many <i>c89</i> implementations allowed
       despite it not being specified), the description of <b>-l </b>as an
       option instead of an operand, and the modification to the
       contents of the Standard Libraries section to account for new
       headers and options; for example, <i>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</i> added to the
       description of <b>-l rt</b>, and <b>-l trace </b>added for the Tracing option.

       POSIX.1‐2008 specifies that the <i>c99</i> utility must be able to use
       regular files for <b>*.o </b>files and for <b>a.out </b>files. Implementations
       are free to overwrite existing files of other types when
       attempting to create object files and executable files, but are
       not required to do so. If something other than a regular file is
       specified and using it fails for any reason, <i>c99</i> is required to
       issue a diagnostic message and exit with a non-zero exit status.
       But for some file types, the problem may not be noticed for a
       long time. For example, if a FIFO named <b>a.out </b>exists in the
       current directory, <i>c99</i> may attempt to open <b>a.out </b>and will hang in
       the <i>open</i>() call until another process opens the FIFO for reading.
       Then <i>c99</i> may write most of the <b>a.out </b>to the FIFO and fail when it
       tries to seek back close to the start of the file to insert a
       timestamp (FIFOs are not seekable files). The <i>c99</i> utility is also
       allowed to issue a diagnostic immediately if it encounters an
       <b>a.out </b>or <b>*.o </b>file that is not a regular file. For portable use,
       applications should ensure that any <b>a.out</b>, <b>-o </b>option-argument, or
       <b>*.o </b>files corresponding to any <b>*.c </b>files do not conflict with
       names already in use that are not regular files or symbolic links
       that point to regular files.

       On many systems, multi-threaded applications run in a programming
       environment that is distinct from that used by single-threaded
       applications. This multi-threaded programming environment (in
       addition to needing to specify <b>-l pthread </b>at link time) may
       require additional flags to be set when headers are processed at
       compile time (<b>-D_REENTRANT </b>being common). This programming
       environment is orthogonal to the type size programming
       environments discussed above and listed in <i>Table 4-4, Programming</i>
       <i>Environments: Type Sizes</i>.  This version of the standard adds
       <i>getconf</i> utility calls to provide the C compiler flags and
       linker/loader flags needed to support multi-threaded
       applications. Note that on a system where single-threaded
       applications are a special case of a multi-threaded application,
       both of these <i>getconf</i> calls may return NULL strings; on other
       implementations both of these strings may be non-NULL strings.

       The C standardization committee invented trigraphs (e.g., <b>"??!"</b>
       to represent <b>'|'</b>) to address character portability problems in
       development environments based on national variants of the 7-bit
       ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard character set. However, these
       environments were already obsolete by the time the first ISO C
       standard was published, and in practice trigraphs have not been
       used for their intended purpose, and usually are intended to have
       their original meaning in K&amp;R C.  For example, in practice a C-
       language source string like <b>"What??!" </b>is usually intended to end
       in two &lt;question-mark&gt; characters and an &lt;exclamation-mark&gt;, not
       in <b>'|'</b>.

       When the <b>-E </b>option is used, execution of some <b>#pragma</b>
       preprocessor directives may simply result in a copy of the
       directive being included in the output as part of the allowed
       extra information used by subsequent compilation passes (see
       STDOUT).
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Unlike all of the other non-OB-shaded utilities in this standard,
       a utility by this name probably will not appear in the next
       version of this standard.  This utility's name is tied to the
       current revision of the ISO C standard at the time this standard
       is approved. Since the ISO C standard and this standard are
       maintained by different organizations on different schedules, we
       cannot predict what the compiler will be named in the next
       version of the standard.
