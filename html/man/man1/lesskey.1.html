</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lesskey - customize key bindings for less
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS (deprecated) </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lesskey [-o output] [--] [input]</b>
       <b>lesskey [--output=output] [--] [input]</b>
       <b>lesskey -V</b>
       <b>lesskey --version</b>
</pre> <h2>
SCOPE </h2>
<pre>
       This document describes the format of the <b>lesskey </b>source file,
       which is used by <b>less </b>version 582 and later.  In previous
       versions of <b>less</b>, a separate program called <b>lesskey </b>was used to
       compile the <b>lesskey </b>source file into a format understood by <b>less</b>.
       This compilation step is no longer required and the <b>lesskey</b>
       program is therefore deprecated, although the file format remains
       supported by <b>less </b>itself.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A <b>lesskey </b>file specifies a set of key bindings and environment
       variables to be used by subsequent invocations of <b>less</b>.
</pre> <h2>
FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The input file consists of one or more <i>sections</i>.  Each section
       starts with a line that identifies the type of section.  Possible
       sections are:

       #command
              Customizes command key bindings.

       #line-edit
              Customizes line-editing key bindings.

       #env   Defines environment variables.

       Blank lines and lines which start with a hash mark (#) are
       ignored, except as noted below.
</pre> <h2>
COMMAND SECTION </h2>
<pre>
       The command section begins with the line

       #command

       If the command section is the first section in the file, this
       line may be omitted.  The command section consists of lines of
       the form:

            <i>string</i> &lt;whitespace&gt; <i>action</i> [extra-string] &lt;newline&gt;

       Whitespace is any sequence of one or more spaces and/or tabs.
       The <i>string</i> is the command key(s) which invoke the action.  The
       <i>string</i> may be a single command key, or a sequence of up to 15
       keys.  The <i>action</i> is the name of the less action, from the list
       below.  The characters in the <i>string</i> may appear literally, or be
       prefixed by a caret to indicate a control key.  A backslash
       followed by one to three octal digits may be used to specify a
       character by its octal value.  A backslash followed by certain
       characters specifies input characters as follows:
            \b   BACKSPACE   (0x08)
            \e   ESCAPE      (0x1B)
            \n   NEWLINE     (0x0A)
            \r   RETURN      (0x0D)
            \t   TAB         (0x09)

            \k followed by a single character represents the char(s)
            produced when one of these keys is pressed:
            \kb   BACKSPACE (the BACKSPACE key)
            \kB   ctrl-BACKSPACE
            \kd   DOWN ARROW
            \kD   PAGE DOWN
            \ke   END
            \kh   HOME
            \ki   INSERT
            \kl   LEFT ARROW
            \kL   ctrl-LEFT ARROW
            \kr   RIGHT ARROW
            \kR   ctrl-RIGHT ARROW
            \kt   BACKTAB
            \ku   UP ARROW
            \kU   PAGE UP
            \kx   DELETE
            \kX   ctrl-DELETE
            \k1   F1

            A backslash followed by any other character indicates that
            character is to be taken literally.  Characters which must
            be preceded by backslash include caret, space, tab, hash
            mark and the backslash itself.

            An action may be followed by an "extra" string.  When such a
            command is entered while running <b>less</b>, the action is
            performed, and then the extra string is parsed, just as if
            it were typed in to <b>less</b>.  This feature can be used in
            certain cases to extend the functionality of a command.  For
            example, see the "{" and ":t" commands in the example below.
            The extra string has a special meaning for the "quit"
            action: when <b>less </b>quits, the first character of the extra
            string is used as its exit status.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       The following input file describes the set of default command
       keys used by <b>less</b>.  Documentation on each command can be found in
       the man page, under the key sequence which invokes the command.

</pre> <h2>
PRECEDENCE </h2>
<pre>
       Commands specified by <b>lesskey </b>take precedence over the default
       commands.  A default command key may be disabled by including it
       in the input file with the action "invalid".  Alternatively, a
       key may be defined to do nothing by using the action "noaction".
       "noaction" is similar to "invalid", but <b>less </b>will give an error
       beep for an "invalid" command, but not for a "noaction" command.
       In addition, ALL default commands may be disabled by adding this
       control line to the input file:

       #stop

       This will cause all default commands to be ignored.  The #stop
       line should be the last line in that section of the file.

       Be aware that #stop can be dangerous.  Since all default commands
       are disabled, you must provide sufficient commands before the
       #stop line to enable all necessary actions.  For example, failure
       to provide a "quit" command can lead to frustration.
</pre> <h2>
LINE EDITING SECTION </h2>
<pre>
       The line-editing section begins with the line:

       #line-edit

       This section specifies new key bindings for the line editing
       commands, in a manner similar to the way key bindings for
       ordinary commands are specified in the #command section.  The
       line-editing section consists of a list of keys and actions, one
       per line as in the example below.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       The following input file describes the set of default line-
       editing keys used by <b>less</b>:

            #line-edit
            \t           forw-complete
            \17          back-complete
            \e\t         back-complete
            ^L           expand
            ^V           literal
            ^A           literal
            \el          right
            \kr          right
            \eh          left
            \kl          left
            \eb          word-left
            \e\kl        word-left
            \ew          word-right
            \e\kr        word-right
            \ei          insert
            \ex          delete
            \kx          delete
            \eX          word-delete
            \ekx         word-delete
            \e\b         word-backspace
            \e0          home
            \kh          home
            \e$          end
            \ke          end
            \ek          up
            \ku          up
            \ej          down
            ^G           abort
</pre> <h2>
LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The environment variable section begins with the line

       #env

       Following this line is a list of environment variable
       assignments.  Each line consists of an environment variable name,
       an equals sign (=) and the value to be assigned to the
       environment variable.  White space before and after the equals
       sign is ignored.  Variables assigned in this way are visible only
       to <b>less</b>.  If a variable is specified in the system environment
       and also in a lesskey file, the value in the lesskey file takes
       precedence.

       If the variable name is followed by += rather than =, the string
       is appended to the variable's existing value.  This currently
       works only if any += lines immediately follow the same variable's
       original definition (with an = line), without any intervening
       definitions of other variables.  It can append only to a variable
       defined earlier in the file; it cannot append to a variable in
       the system environment.  The string is appended literally,
       without any extra whitespace added, so if whitespace is desired,
       it should be appended to the end of the preceding line.  (It
       cannot be added to the beginning of the += string because space
       after the equals sign is ignored, as noted above.)
</pre> <h2>
CONDITIONAL CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       If a line begins with #version followed by a relational operator
       and a version number, the remainder of the line is parsed if and
       only if the running version of <b>less </b>(or <b>lesskey</b>) matches the
       operator.  This can be helpful if a lesskey file is used by
       different versions of <b>less</b>.

       For example, suppose that a new command named 'sideways-search'
       is added in <b>less </b>version 777.  Then the following line would
       assign the command to the Q key, but only in versions of <b>less</b>
       which support it. The line would be ignored by versions earlier
       than 777.

            #version &gt;= 777  Q sideways-search

       These six operators are supported:
             &gt;    Greater than
             &lt;    Less than
             &gt;=   Greater than or equal to
             &lt;=   Less than or equal to
             =    Equal to
             !=   Not equal to

       The #version feature is not supported in <b>less </b>and <b>lesskey </b>before
       version 594.  In those older versions, all #version lines are
       ignored.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       The following input file sets the -i and -S options when is run
       and, on version 595 and higher, adds a --color option.

            #env
            ## (Note that there must be a space at the end of the next line,
            ##  to separate the --color option from the -S option.)
            LESS = -i -S
            #version &gt;= 595  LESS += --color=Hkc

WARNINGS </h2>
<pre>
       On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, certain keys send a sequence of
       characters which start with a NUL character (0).  This NUL
       character should be represented as \340 in a lesskey file.
