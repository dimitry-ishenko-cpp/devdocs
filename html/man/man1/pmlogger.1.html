DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogger </b>creates the archives of performance metric values that
       may be ``played back'' by other Performance Co-Pilot (see
       <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) tools.  These logs form the basis of the VCR
       paradigm and retrospective performance analysis services common
       to the PCP toolkit.

       The mandatory argument <i>archive</i> is the base name for the physical
       files that constitute an archive.  The <i>archive</i> argument may
       contain <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a> meta-characters, which will be substituted
       prior to creating the archive files.  When <b>pmlogger </b>is run as a
       service (see <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>), the standard archive base name
       template is <b>%Y%m%d.%H.%M</b>.

       The <b>-V </b>option specifies the version for the archive that is
       generated.  By default the archive version <b>$PCP_ARCHIVE_VERSION</b>
       (set to 3 in current PCP releases) is used, and the only values
       currently supported for <i>version</i> are 2 or 3.

       Unless directed to another host by the <b>-h </b>option or when directly
       using PMDAs via the <b>-o </b>option, <b>pmlogger </b>will contact the
       Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the local host and
       use that as the source of the metric values to be logged.

       To support the required flexibility and control over what is
       logged and when, <b>pmlogger </b>maintains an independent two level
       logging state for each instance of each performance metric.  At
       the first (mandatory) level, logging is allowed to be <b>on </b>(with an
       associated interval between samples), or <b>off </b>or <b>maybe</b>.  In the
       latter case, the second (advisory) level logging is allowed to be
       <b>on </b>(with an associated interval between samples), or <b>off</b>.

       The mandatory level allows universal specification that some
       metrics must be logged, or must <b>not </b>be logged.  The default state
       for all instances of all metrics when <b>pmlogger </b>starts is
       mandatory maybe and advisory off.

       Use <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> to interrogate and change the logging state once
       <b>pmlogger </b>is running.

       If a metric's state is mandatory (on or off) and a request is
       made to change it to mandatory maybe, the new state is mandatory
       maybe and advisory off.  If a metric's state is already advisory
       (on or off) and a request is made to change it to mandatory
       maybe, the current state is retained.

       It is not possible for <b>pmlogger </b>to log specific instances of a
       metric and all instances of the same metric concurrently.  If
       specific instances are being logged and a request to log all
       instances is made, then all instances of the metric will be
       logged according to the new request, superseding any prior
       logging request for the metric.  A request to log all instances
       of a metric will supersede any previous request to log all
       instances.  A request to log specific instances of a metric when
       all instances are already being logged is refused.  To do this
       one must turn off logging for all instances of the metric first.
       In each case, the validity of the request is checked first; for
       example a request to change a metric's logging state to advisory
       on when it is currently mandatory off is never permitted (it is
       necessary to change the state to mandatory maybe first).

       Optionally, each system running <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> may also be configured to
       run a ``primary'' <b>pmlogger </b>instance.  This <b>pmlogger </b>instance is
       launched by <b>$PCP_RC_DIR/pmlogger</b>, and is affected by the files
       <b>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/control</b>,
       <b>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/control.d/*</b>, (use <b>chkconfig</b>(8),
       <a href="systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> or similar platform-specific commands to activate or
       disable the primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance),
       <b>$PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmlogger </b>(environment variable settings for
       the primary <b>pmlogger</b>) <b>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger.options</b>
       (command line options passed to the primary <b>pmlogger</b>) and
       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.default </b>(the default initial
       configuration file for the primary <b>pmlogger</b>).

       The primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance is identified by the <b>-P </b>option.
       There may be at most one ``primary'' <b>pmlogger </b>instance on each
       system.  The primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance (if any) must be running
       on the same host as the <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to which it connects (if any), so
       the <b>-h </b>and <b>-P </b>options are mutually exclusive.

       Logging of some metrics is possible even in the absence of a
       local <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, using the "local context" mode of operation.  This
       is activated using the <b>-o </b>option, and causes <b>pmlogger </b>to make use
       of local DSO PMDAs instead of communicating with <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  When
       operating using a local context, the <b>-K </b>option may be used to
       control the DSO PMDAs that should be made accessible.  The <i>spec</i>
       argument conforms to the syntax described in <a href="../man3/pmspeclocalpmda.3.html">pmSpecLocalPMDA(3)</a>.
       More than one <b>-K </b>option may be used.

       When launched as a non-primary instance, <b>pmlogger </b>will exit
       immediately if the configuration file causes no metric logging to
       be scheduled.  The <b>-L </b>option overrides this behavior, and causes
       a non-primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance to ``linger'', presumably pending
       some future dynamic re-configuration and state change via
       <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a>.  <b>pmlogger </b>will also linger without the <b>-L </b>option being
       used if all the metrics to be logged are logged as once only
       metrics.  When the once only metrics have been logged, a warning
       message will be generated stating that the event queue is empty
       and no more events will be scheduled.

       By default all diagnostics and errors from <b>pmlogger </b>are written
       to the file <b>pmlogger.log </b>in the directory where <b>pmlogger </b>is
       launched.  The <b>-l </b>option may be used to override the default
       behavior.  If the log file cannot be created or is not writable,
       output is written to standard error instead.  If the <i>logfile</i> for
       the <b>-l </b>option is "<b>-</b>" (i.e.  <b>-l-</b>) then log messages are written to
       the standard output stream.  This can be particularly useful when
       running <b>pmlogger </b>manually, rather than as a service daemon.

       The <b>-N </b>option directs <b>pmlogger </b>to notify a service manager,
       typically <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>, when it has started and is about to begin
       writing PCP archives.  This option would only normally be used
       when <b>pmlogger </b>is run as a daemon service under the control of a
       service manager.  For more details, see
       <a href="../man3/__pmservernotifyservicemanagerready.3.html">__pmServerNotifyServiceManagerReady(3)</a> and <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>.  On
       platforms that do not use a service manager that supports
       notifications, the <b>-N </b>option is basically a no-op.

       If specified, the <b>-s </b>option instructs <b>pmlogger </b>to terminate after
       a certain size in records, bytes or time units has been
       accumulated.  If <i>endsize</i> is an integer then <i>endsize</i> records will
       be written to the archive.  If <i>endsize</i> is an integer suffixed by
       <b>b </b>or <b>bytes </b>then <i>endsize</i> bytes of the archive data will be written
       out (note, however, that archive record boundaries will not be
       broken and so this limit may be slightly surpassed).  Other
       viable file size units include: <b>K</b>, <b>Kb</b>, <b>KiB</b>, <b>Kbyte</b>, <b>Kilobyte </b>for
       kilobytes and <b>M</b>, <b>Mb</b>, <b>MiB</b>, <b>Mbyte</b>, <b>Megabyte </b>for megabytes and <b>G</b>,
       <b>Gb</b>, <b>GiB</b>, <b>Gbyte</b>, <b>Gigabyte </b>for gigabytes.  These units may be
       optionally suffixed by an <b>s </b>and may be of mixed case.
       Alternatively <i>endsize</i> may be an integer or a floating point
       number suffixed using a time unit as described in <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for
       the <i>interval</i> argument (to the standard PCP <b>-t </b>command line
       option).
       Some examples of different formats:
          <b>-s 100</b>
          <b>-s 100bytes</b>
          <b>-s 100K</b>
          <b>-s 100Mb</b>
          <b>-s 10Gbyte</b>
          <b>-s 10mins</b>
          <b>-s 1.5hours</b>
       The default is for <b>pmlogger </b>to run forever.

       The <b>-r </b>option causes the size of the physical record(s) for each
       group of metrics and the expected contribution of the group to
       the size of the PCP archive for one full day of collection to be
       reported in the log file.  This information is reported the first
       time each group is successfully written to the archive.

       The <b>-U </b>option specifies the user account under which to run
       <b>pmlogger</b>.  The default is the current user account for
       interactive use.  When run as a daemon, the unprivileged "pcp"
       account is used in current versions of PCP, but in older versions
       the superuser account ("root") was used by default.

       The archive is potentially a multi-volume data set, and the <b>-v</b>
       option causes <b>pmlogger </b>to start a new volume after a certain size
       in records, bytes, or time units has been accumulated for the
       current volume.  The format of this size specification is
       identical to that of the <b>-s </b>option (see above).  The default is
       for <b>pmlogger </b>to create a single volume archive.  Additional
       volume switches can also be forced asynchronously by either using
       <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> or sending <b>pmlogger </b>a SIGHUP signal (see below).  Note,
       if a scheduled volume switch is in operation due to the <b>-v</b>
       option, then its counters will be reset after an asynchronous
       switch.

       Independent of any <b>-v </b>option, each volume of an archive is
       limited to no more than 2^31 bytes, so <i>pmlogger</i> will
       automatically create a new volume for the archive before this
       limit is reached.

       Normally <b>pmlogger </b>operates on the distributed Performance Metrics
       Name Space (PMNS), however if the <b>-n </b>option is specified an
       alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       Under normal circumstances, <b>pmlogger </b>will run forever (except for
       a <b>-s </b>option or a termination signal).  The <b>-T </b>option may be used
       to limit the execution time using the format of time as
       prescribed by <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>.  The time is interpreted within the
       time zone of the PMCD server, unless the <b>-y </b>option is given,
       within which case the time zone at this logger host is used.
       Some examples of different formats:
          <b>-T 10mins</b>
          <b>-T '@ 11:30'</b>
       From this it can be seen that <b>-T 10mins </b>and <b>-s 10mins </b>perform
       identical actions.

       Alternatively, <b>pmlogger </b>runtime may be limited to the lifetime of
       another process by using the <b>-p </b>or <b>--PID </b>option to nominate the
       PID of the process of interest.  In this case the <b>pmlogger </b>will
       exit when the other process no longer exists.

       When <b>pmlogger </b>receives a <b>SIGHUP </b>signal, the current volume of the
       archive is closed, and a new volume is opened.  This mechanism
       (or the alternative mechanism via <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a>) may be used to manage
       the growth of the archive files - once a log volume is closed,
       that file may be archived without ill-effect on the continued
       operation of <b>pmlogger</b>.  See also the <b>-v </b>option above.

       When <b>pmlogger </b>receives a <b>SIGUSR2 </b>signal, the current archive is
       closed, and a new archive is opened.  For this to succeed, the
       original <i>archive</i> argument must include <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a> meta
       characters (e.g.  <b>%Y%m%d.%H.%M</b>), otherwise <b>pmlogger </b>will exit
       because the archive files will already exist and <b>pmlogger </b>will
       not over-write existing archive files.  Note that <b>SIGUSR2</b>
       triggers <b>pmlogger </b>to re-exec itself and re-parse all original
       arguments.  This means that any relative time limits placed on
       it's termination time or sampling limit are reset and begin
       again.  This only affects relative termination times, not
       absolute times e.g.  <b>-T 5s </b>is affected, but <b>-T 5pm </b>is not.

       Historically the buffers for the current archive may be flushed
       to disk using the <b>flush </b>command of <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a>, or by using the <b>-u</b>
       option.  The current version of <i>pmlogger</i> and the <i>libpcp</i> routines
       that underpin <i>pmlogger</i> unconditionally use unbuffered writes and
       a single <a href="../man3/fwrite.3.html">fwrite(3)</a> for each logical record written, and so
       ``flushing'' does not force any additional data to be written to
       the file system.  The <b>-u </b>option and the <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> <b>flush </b>command are
       retained for backwards compatibility.

       When launched with the <b>-x </b>option, pmlogger will accept
       asynchronous control requests on the file descriptor <i>fd</i>.  This
       option is only expected to be used internally by PCP applications
       that support ``live record mode''.

       The <b>-m </b>option allows the string <i>note</i> to be appended to the map
       file for this instance of <b>pmlogger </b>in the <b>$PCP_TMP_DIR/pmlogger</b>
       directory.  This is currently used internally to document the
       file descriptor (<i>fd</i>) when the <b>-x </b>option is used, or to indicate
       that this <b>pmlogger </b>instance was started under the control of
       <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>, (<b>-m pmlogger_check</b>) or was re-exec'd (see
       <a href="../man3/execvp.3.html">execvp(3)</a>) due to a <b>SIGUSR2 </b>signal being received as described
       above (<b>-m reexec</b>).

       The <b>-H </b>option allows the hostname written into the archive label
       to be overridden.  This mirrors the <b>-H </b>option of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> , but
       allows it to be specified on the <b>pmlogger </b>process.  Without this
       option, the value returned from the logged <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> is used.

       The <b>-C </b>option will cause the configuration file to be parsed and
       <i>pmlogger</i> will then exit without creating an output archive, so
       when <b>-C </b>is specified, the <i>archive</i> command line argument is not
       required.  Any errors in the configuration file are reported.

       The <b>-d </b>or <b>--directory </b>option may be used to specify the directory
       where the <i>archive</i> should be created.  <i>directory</i> may include <b>sh</b>(1)
       metacharacters, like <b>$(</b><i>...</i><b>)  </b>or <b>`</b>...<b>` </b>or <b>$</b><i>var</i> and <b>pmlogger </b>will
       expand these to produce a final directory path.  The resultant
       path must be absolute, not relative.  The <b>-d </b>option is intended
       primarily for use by <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> and normal users would not
       typically need to use the option, as the directory for <i>archive</i> is
       either implied by <i>archive</i> if it contains directory components
       else the current directory by default.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration file may be specified with the <b>-c </b>option.  If
       it is not, configuration specifications are read from standard
       input.

       If <i>conffile</i> does not exist, then a search is made in the
       directory <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger </b>for a file of the same
       name, and if found that file is used, e.g. if <b>config.mumble </b>does
       not exist in the current directory and the file
       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.mumble </b>does exist, then <b>-c</b>
       <b>config.mumble </b>and <b>-c $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.mumble</b>
       are equivalent.

       The syntax for the configuration file is as follows.

       1.   Words are separated by white space (space, tab or newline).

       2.   The symbol ``#'' (hash) introduces a comment, and all text
            up to the next newline is ignored.

       3.   Keywords (shown in <b>bold </b>below) must appear literally (i.e.
            in lower case).

       4.   Each specification begins with the optional keyword <b>log</b>,
            followed by one of the states <b>mandatory on</b>, <b>mandatory off</b>,
            <b>mandatory maybe</b>, <b>advisory on </b>or <b>advisory off</b>.

       5.   For the <b>on </b>states, a logging interval must follow using the
            syntax ``<b>once</b>'', or ``<b>default</b>'', or ``<b>every </b><i>N timeunits</i>'',
            or simply ``<i>N timeunits</i>'' - <i>N</i> is an unsigned integer, and
            <i>timeunits</i> is one of the keywords <b>msec</b>, <b>millisecond</b>, <b>sec</b>,
            <b>second</b>, <b>min</b>, <b>minute</b>, <b>hour </b>or the plural form of one of the
            above.
            Internal limitations require the interval to be smaller than
            (approximately) 74 hours.  An interval value of zero is a
            synonym for <b>once</b>.  An interval of <b>default </b>means to use the
            default logging interval of 60 seconds; this default value
            may be changed to <i>interval</i> with the <b>-t </b>command line option.

            The <i>interval</i> argument follows the syntax described in
            <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>, and in the simplest form may be an unsigned
            integer (the implied units in this case are seconds).

       6.   Following the state and possible interval specifications
            comes a ``{'', followed by a list of one or more metric
            specifications and a closing ``}''.  The list is white space
            (or comma) separated.  If there is only one metric
            specification in the list, the braces are optional.

       7.   A metric specification consists of a metric name optionally
            followed by a set of instance names.  The metric name
            follows the standard PCP naming conventions, see <a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>,
            and if the metric name is a non-leaf node in the PMNS (see
            <a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>), then <b>pmlogger </b>will recursively descend the PMNS
            and apply the logging specification to all descendent metric
            names that are leaf nodes in the PMNS.  The set of instance
            names is a ``['', followed by a list of one or more space
            (or comma) separated names, numbers or strings, and a
            closing ``]''.  Elements in the list that are numbers are
            assumed to be internal instance identifiers, other elements
            are assumed to be external instance identifiers - see
            <a href="../man3/pmgetindom.3.html">pmGetInDom(3)</a> for more information.

            If no instances are given, then the logging specification is
            applied to all instances of the associated metric.

       8.   There may be an arbitrary number of logging specifications.

       9.   As of PCP version 4.0 and later, any metric name
            specification that does not resolve to a leaf node in the
            PMNS is added to an internal list of possible <i>dynamic</i>
            <i>subtree roots</i>.  PMDAs can dynamically create new metrics
            below a dynamic root node in their PMNS, and send a
            notification to clients that the PMNS has changed, see
            <a href="../man3/pmdaextsetflags.3.html">pmdaExtSetFlags(3)</a> and in particular the <b>METRIC CHANGES</b>
            section for API details.  This mechanism is currently
            supported by <a href="pmdaopenmetrics.1.html">pmdaopenmetrics(1)</a> and <a href="pmdammv.1.html">pmdammv(1)</a>.  When a
            fetch issued by <b>pmlogger </b>returns with the
            <b>PMDA_EXT_NAMES_CHANGE </b>flag set, <b>pmlogger </b>will traverse the
            internal list of possible dynamic subtree nodes and
            dynamically discover any new metrics.  In effect, as of PCP
            version 4.0 and later, <b>pmlogger </b>can be configured to
            dynamically log new metrics that appear in the future, after
            the configuration file is initially parsed.

       10.  Following all of the logging specifications, there may be an
            optional access control section, introduced by the literal
            token <b>[access]</b>.  Thereafter come access control rules that
            allow or disallow operations from particular hosts or groups
            of hosts.

            The operations may be used to interrogate or control a
            running <b>pmlogger </b>using <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> and fall into the following
            classes:

            <b>enquire</b>
                   interrogate the status of <b>pmlogger </b>and the metrics it
                   is logging
            <b>advisory</b>
                   Change advisory logging.
            <b>mandatory</b>
                   Change mandatory logging.
            <b>all    </b>All of the above.

            Access control rules are of the form ``<b>allow </b><i>hostlist</i> <b>:</b>
            <i>operationslist</i> <b>;</b>'' and ``<b>disallow </b><i>hostlist</i> <b>: </b><i>operationslist</i>
            <b>;</b>''.

            The <i>hostlist</i> follows the syntax and semantics for the access
            control mechanisms used by PMCD and are fully documented in
            <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  An <i>operationslist</i> is a comma separated list of the
            operations <b>advisory</b>, <b>mandatory</b>, <b>enquire </b>and <b>all</b>.

            A missing <b>[access] </b>section allows all access and is
            equivalent to <b>allow * : all;</b>.

       The configuration (either from standard input or <i>conffile</i>) is
       initially scanned by <a href="pmcpp.1.html">pmcpp(1)</a> with the options <b>-rs </b>and <b>-I</b>
       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger</b>.  This extends the configuration
       file syntax with include file processing (<b>%include</b>), a common
       location to search for include files
       (<b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger</b>), macro definitions (<b>%define</b>),
       macro expansion (<b>%</b><i>name</i> and <b>%{</b><i>name</i><b>}</b>) and conditional inclusion of
       lines (<b>%ifdef </b><i>name</i> ... <b>%else </b>... <b>%endif </b>and <b>%ifndef </b><i>name</i> ...
       <b>%else </b>... <b>%endif</b>).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-c </b><i>conffile</i>, <b>--config</b>=<i>conffile</i>
            Specify the <i>conffile</i> file to use.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--check</b>
            Parse configuration and exit.

       <b>-h </b><i>host</i>, <b>--host</b>=<i>host</i>
            Fetch performance metrics from <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on <i>host</i>, rather than
            from the default localhost.

       <b>-H </b><i>hostname</i>, <b>--labelhost</b>=<i>hostname</i>
            Specify the <i>hostname</i> to use instead of the one returned by
            <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.

       <b>-I </b><i>version</i>, <b>--pmlc-ipc-version</b>=<i>version</i>
            Normally, <b>pmlogger </b>and <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> will autonegotiate a mutually
            acceptable version for their private IPC channel.  Use <b>-I </b>to
            force <b>pmlogger </b>to offer (at most) <i>version</i> as the version to
            be used.  This option may be required if <b>pmlogger </b>needs to
            be managed by an older version of <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> that fails to
            autonegotiate correctly.

       <b>-K </b><i>spec</i>, <b>--spec-local</b>=<i>spec</i>
            When fetching metrics from a local context (see <b>-o</b>), the <b>-K</b>
            option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
            made accessible.  The <i>spec</i> argument conforms to the syntax
            described in <a href="../man3/pmspeclocalpmda.3.html">pmSpecLocalPMDA(3)</a>.  More than one <b>-K </b>option
            may be used.

       <b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>, <b>--log</b>=<i>logfile</i>
            Write all diagnostics to <b>logfile </b>instead of the default
            <b>pmlogger.log</b>.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--linger</b>
            Run even if not the primary logger instance and nothing to
            log.

       <b>-m </b><i>note</i>, <b>--note</b>=<i>note</i>
            Append <i>note</i> to the port map file for this instance.

       <b>-n </b><i>pmnsfile</i>, <b>--namespace</b>=<i>pmnsfile</i>
            Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (<a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>)
            from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--notify</b>
            Notify service manager such as <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> as needed.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--local-PMDA</b>
            Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the
            local host without PMCD.  See also <b>-K</b>.

       <b>-p </b><i>PID</i>, <b>--PID</b>=<i>PID</i>
            Log specified metrics for the lifetime of the pid <i>PID</i>.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--primary</b>
            Run as primary logger instance.  See above for more detailed
            description of this.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--report</b>
            Report record sizes and archive growth rate.

       <b>-s </b><i>endsize</i>, <b>--size</b>=<i>endsize</i>
            Terminate after archive size exceeds <i>endsize</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>interval</i>, <b>--interval</b>=<i>interval</i>
            Specify the logging <i>interval</i>.  The default value is 60
            seconds.  Please refer to the <b>ENVIRONMENT </b>and <b>FILES </b>sections
            below regarding the <b>PMLOGGER_INTERVAL </b>environment variable
            and its impact on the default logging interval.

       <b>-T </b><i>endtime</i>, <b>--finish</b>=<i>endtime</i>
            Specify the <i>endtime</i> when to end logging.

       <b>-u   </b>Use unbuffered output.  This is the default (so this option
            does nothing).

       <b>-U </b><i>username</i>, <b>--username</b>=<i>username</i>
            When in daemon mode, run as user <i>username</i>.

       <b>-v </b><i>volsize</i>, <b>--volsize</b>=<i>volsize</i>
            Switch volumes after reaching archive volume size <i>volsize</i>.

       <b>-V </b><i>version</i>, <b>--version</b>=<i>version</i>
            Specify archive <i>version</i>.  The default and the only accepted
            value is 2.

       <b>-x </b><i>fd</i>
            Allow asynchronous control requests on the file descriptor
            <i>fd</i>.

       <b>-y   </b>Use local timezone instead of the timezone from the <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            host.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       For each PCP utility, there is a sample <b>pmlogger </b>configuration
       file that could be used to create an archive suitable for
       replaying with that tool (i.e. includes all of the performance
       metrics used by the tool).  For a tool named <i>foo</i> this
       configuration file is located in
       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.foo</b>.

       The following is a simple default configuration file for a
       primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance, and demonstrates most of the
       capabilities of the configuration specification language.

            log mandatory on once { hinv.ncpu hinv.ndisk }
            log mandatory on every 10 minutes {
                disk.all.write
                disk.all.read
                network.interface.in.packets [ "et0" ]
                network.interface.out.packets [ "et0" ]
                nfs.server.reqs [ "lookup" "getattr" "read" "write" ]
            }

            log advisory on every 30 minutes {
                environ.temp
                pmcd.pdu_in.total
                pmcd.pdu_out.total
            }

            %include "macros.default"

            %ifdef %disk_detail
            log mandatory on %disk_detail_freq {
                disk.dev
            }
            %endif

            [access]
            disallow * : all except enquire;
            allow localhost : mandatory, advisory;
</pre> <h2>
HOSTNAME CHANGES </h2>
<pre>
       The hostname of the PMCD that is providing metrics to <b>pmlogger </b>is
       used in several ways.

       PMCD's hostname (or the argument from the <b>-H </b>option) is included
       in the archive label and may be used to ensure that subsequent
       operations on multiple archives, e.g. <a href="pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a>, are only
       applied to archives from the same host.

       For <b>pmlogger </b>instances using a local PMCD that are launched and
       managed by <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> and <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>, (or the
       <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> or <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> services that use these scripts), the local
       hostname may also be used to construct the name of a directory
       where all the archives for the one host are stored, e.g.
       <b>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/</b><i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i>.

       And PMCD's hostname is also stored in the archive via the
       <b>pmcd.pmlogger.hostname </b>metric that is used as part of the checks
       to ensure that there is continuity of performance data after the
       nightly archive rotation by <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>.

       The hostname of the PMCD host may change during boot time when
       the system transitions from a temporary hostname to a persistent
       hostname, or by explicit administrative action anytime after the
       system has been booted.  When this happens, <b>pmlogger </b>may need to
       take special action, specifically if the <b>pmlogger </b>instance was
       launched from <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> or <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>, then
       <b>pmlogger </b>must exit.  Under normal circumstances <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> or
       <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> will launch a new <b>pmlogger </b>shortly thereafter, and this
       new <b>pmlogger </b>instance will be operating in the context of the new
       hostname for the host where PMCD is running.
</pre> <h2>
DERIVED METRICS </h2>
<pre>
       As described in <a href="../man3/pmregisterderived.3.html">pmRegisterDerived(3)</a>, derived metrics provide a
       mechanism for extending the PMNS with new metrics defined at the
       PCP client-side using expressions over the existing performance
       metrics.  Derived metrics may be included in a <b>pmlogger</b>
       configuration file, but they come with some special handling
       rules.

       First, the values of a derived metric, <b>not </b>the operand metrics in
       the derived metric's expression, are stored in the archive.  This
       is because the definition of a derived metric exists independent
       of <b>pmlogger </b>and <i>archive</i> and may be different, or not exist at
       all, when <i>archive</i> is replayed.

       To avoid ambiguity during archive replay each derived metric's
       Performance Metric Identifier (PMID) is rewritten (or
       ``remapped'') to indicate that this was, but now is <i>not</i>, a
       derived metric; refer to <a href="../man3/pmregisterderived.3.html">pmRegisterDerived(3)</a> for a detailed
       description of the PMID remapping.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       The archives are sufficiently precious that <b>pmlogger </b>will not
       truncate an existing physical file.  A message of the form
        ...: "foo.index" already exists, not over-written
        ...: File exists
       indicates this situation has arisen.  You must explicitly remove
       the files and launch <b>pmlogger </b>again.

       There may be at most one primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance per monitored
       host; attempting to bend this rule produces the error:
        pmlogger: there is already a primary pmlogger running

       Various other messages relating to the creation and/or deletion
       of files in <b>$PCP_TMP_DIR/pmlogger </b>suggest a permission problem on
       this directory, or some feral files have appeared therein.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>archive</i><b>.meta</b>
            metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for
            the archive

       <i>archive</i><b>.0</b>
            initial volume of metrics values (subsequent volumes have
            suffixes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, ...)

       <i>archive</i><b>.index</b>
            temporal index to support rapid random access to the other
            files in the archive

       <b>$PCP_TMP_DIR/pmlogger</b>
            <b>pmlogger </b>maintains the files in this directory as the map
            between the process id of the <b>pmlogger </b>instance and the IPC
            port that may be used to control each <b>pmlogger </b>instance (as
            used by <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a>)

       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.default</b>
            default configuration file for the primary logger instance
            launched from <b>$PCP_RC_DIR/pmlogger</b>

       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.*</b>
            assorted configuration files suitable for creating logs that
            may be subsequently replayed with the PCP visualization and
            monitoring tools

       <b>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/</b><i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i>
            Default directory for PCP archive files for performance
            metric values collected from the host <i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i>.

       <b>$PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmlogger</b>
            additional environment variables that will be set when the
            primary <b>pmlogger </b>instance executes.  Only settings of the
            form "PMLOGGER_VARIABLE=value" will be honoured.

       <b>./pmlogger.log</b>
            (or <b>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/</b><i>&lt;hostname&gt;</i><b>/pmlogger.log </b>when started
            automatically by either <b>$PCP_RC_DIR/pmlogger </b>or one of the
            <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> monitoring scripts such as <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>)
            all messages and diagnostics are directed here
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Normally <b>pmlogger </b>creates a socket to receive control messages
       from <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> on the first available TCP/IP port numbered 4330 or
       higher.  The environment variable <b>PMLOGGER_PORT </b>may be used to
       specify an alternative starting port number.

       If set to the value 1, the <b>PMLOGGER_LOCAL </b>environment variable
       will cause <b>pmlogger </b>to run in a localhost-only mode of operation,
       where it binds only to the loopback interface.

       The <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT </b>variable may be set by applications
       such as <a href="pmlc.1.html">pmlc(1)</a> to specify a timeout in seconds for connection
       requests to the <b>pmlogger </b>control port.  If not set, connections
       may block indefinitely.  This variable would not normally be set
       by <b>pmlogger </b>itself.

       The <b>PMLOGGER_MAXPENDING </b>variable can be set to indicate the
       maximum length to which the queue of pending <b>pmlc </b>connections may
       grow.

       The default sampling interval used by <b>pmlogger </b>can be set using
       the <b>PMLOGGER_INTERVAL </b>variable (if not set, 60 seconds will be
       used).  Both the command line and directives in the configuration
       file will override this value.  It is an integer in units of
       seconds.

       On platforms using <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>, and when the <b>-N </b>option is given,
       the <b>NOTIFY_SOCKET </b>environment variable would normally be set by
       the service manager prior to launching <b>pmlogger</b>.

       Two additional environment variables are used as part of the
       hand-off from one <b>pmlogger </b>instance to the next during a re-exec
       operation, namely <b>__PMLOGGER_REEXEC </b>and <b>__PMLOGGER_TZ</b>.  The
       details of how these are used is an internal implementation
       detail, but end-users should avoid using variables of these names
       in their shell's environment.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
