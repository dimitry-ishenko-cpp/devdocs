Description </h2>
<pre>
       <i>indxbib</i> makes an inverted index for the bibliographic databases
       in each <i>file</i> for use with <i>refer</i>(1), <i>lookbib</i>(1), and <i>lkbib</i>(1).
       Each created index is named file<i>.i</i>; writing is done to a
       temporary file which is then renamed to this.  If no <i>file</i>
       operands are present and no <b>-o </b>option is given, <i>refer</i> names the
       index <i>Ind.i</i>.

       Bibliographic databases are divided into records by blank lines.
       Within a record, each field starts with a <b>% </b>character at the
       beginning of a line.  Fields have a one letter name that follows
       the <b>% </b>character.

       The values set by the <b>-c</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-t </b>options are stored in
       the index: when the index is searched, keys will be discarded and
       truncated in a manner appropriate to these options; the original
       keys will be used for verifying that any record found using the
       index actually contains the keys.  This means that a user of an
       index need not know whether these options were used in the
       creation of the index, provided that not all the keys to be
       searched for would have been discarded during indexing and that
       the user supplies at least the part of each key that would have
       remained after being truncated during indexing.  The value set by
       the <b>-i </b>option is also stored in the index and will be used in
       verifying records found using the index.

Options </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b>displays a usage message, while <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>show
       version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-c </b><i>common-words-file</i>
              Read the list of common words from <i>common-words-file</i>
              instead of <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/eign</i>.

       <b>-d </b><i>dir</i> Use <i>dir</i> as the name of the directory to store in the
              index, instead of that returned by <i>getcwd</i>(2).  Typically,
              <i>dir</i> will be a symbolic link whose target is the current
              working directory.

       <b>-f </b><i>list-file</i>
              Read the files to be indexed from <i>list-file</i>.  If <i>list-file</i>
              is <b>-</b>, files will be read from the standard input stream.
              The <b>-f </b>option can be given at most once.

       <b>-h </b><i>min-hash-table-size</i>
              Use the first prime number greater than or equal to the
              argument for the size of the hash table.  Larger values
              will usually make searching faster, but will make the
              index file larger and cause <i>indxbib</i> to use more memory.
              The default hash table size is 997.

       <b>-i </b><i>excluded-fields</i>
              Don't index the contents of fields whose names are in
              <i>excluded-fields</i>.  Field names are one character each.  If
              this option is not present, <i>indxbib</i> excludes fields <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>,
              and <b>Z</b>.

       <b>-k </b><i>max-keys-per-record</i>
              Use no more keys per input record than specified in the
              argument.  If this option is not present, the maximum is
              100.

       <b>-l </b><i>min-key-length</i>
              Discard any key whose length in characters is shorter than
              the value of the argument.  If this option is not present,
              the minimum key length is 3.

       <b>-n </b><i>threshold</i>
              Discard the <i>threshold</i> most common words from the common
              words file.  If this option is not present, the 100 most
              common words are discarded.

       <b>-o </b><i>basename</i>
              Name the index basename<i>.i</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>max-key-length</i>
              Truncate keys to <i>max-key-length</i> in characters.  If this
              option is not present, keys are truncated to 6 characters.

       <b>-w     </b>Index whole files.  Each file is a separate record.

Files </h2>
<pre>
       file<i>.i</i> index for <i>file</i>

       <i>Ind.i</i>  default index name

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/eign</i>
              contains the list of common words.  The traditional name,
              “<i>eign</i>”, is an abbreviation of “English ignored [word
              list]”.

       <i>indxbib</i>XXXXXX
