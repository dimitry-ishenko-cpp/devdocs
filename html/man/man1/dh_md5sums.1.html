NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_md5sums - generate DEBIAN/md5sums file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_md5sums </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-x</b>] [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>]
       [<b>--include-conffiles</b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_md5sums </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       generating a <i>DEBIAN/md5sums</i> file, which lists the md5sums of each
       file in the package.  These files are used by <b>dpkg --verify </b>or
       the <b>debsums</b>(1) program.

       All files in <i>DEBIAN/</i> are omitted from the <i>md5sums</i> file, as are
       all conffiles (unless you use the <b>--include-conffiles </b>switch).

       The md5sums file is installed with proper permissions and
       ownerships.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-x</b>, <b>--include-conffiles</b>
           Include conffiles in the md5sums list. Note that this
           information is redundant since it is included in
           <i>/var/lib/dpkg/status</i> in Debian packages.

       <b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude files that contain <i>item</i> anywhere in their filename
           from being listed in the md5sums file.
