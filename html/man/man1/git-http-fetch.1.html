NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-http-fetch - Download from a remote Git repository via HTTP
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git http-fetch</i> [-c] [-t] [-a] [-d] [-v] [-w &lt;filename&gt;] [--recover] [--stdin | --packfile=&lt;hash&gt; | &lt;commit&gt;] &lt;URL&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Downloads a remote Git repository via HTTP.

       This command always gets all objects. Historically, there were
       three options <b>-a</b>, <b>-c </b>and <b>-t </b>for choosing which objects to
       download. They are now silently ignored.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       commit-id
           Either the hash or the filename under [URL]/refs/ to pull.

       -a, -c, -t
           These options are ignored for historical reasons.

       -v
           Report what is downloaded.

       -w &lt;filename&gt;
           Writes the commit-id into the specified filename under
           $GIT_DIR/refs/&lt;filename&gt; on the local end after the transfer
           is complete.

       --stdin
           Instead of a commit id on the command line (which is not
           expected in this case), <i>git http-fetch</i> expects lines on stdin
           in the format

               &lt;commit-id&gt;['\t'&lt;filename-as-in--w&gt;]

       --packfile=&lt;hash&gt;
           For internal use only. Instead of a commit id on the command
           line (which is not expected in this case), <i>git http-fetch</i>
           fetches the packfile directly at the given URL and uses
           index-pack to generate corresponding .idx and .keep files.
           The hash is used to determine the name of the temporary file
           and is arbitrary. The output of index-pack is printed to
           stdout. Requires --index-pack-args.

       --index-pack-args=&lt;args&gt;
           For internal use only. The command to run on the contents of
           the downloaded pack. Arguments are URL-encoded separated by
           spaces.

       --recover
           Verify that everything reachable from target is fetched. Used
           after an earlier fetch is interrupted.
