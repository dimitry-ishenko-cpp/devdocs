NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-buildflags - returns build flags to use during package build
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-buildflags </b>[<i>option</i>...] [<i>command</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-buildflags </b>is a tool to retrieve compilation flags to use
       during build of Debian packages.

       The default flags are defined by the vendor but they can be
       extended/overridden in several ways:

       1.  system-wide with <b>/usr/local/etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf</b>;

       2.  for the current user with
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf </b>where <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b>
           defaults to <b>$HOME/.config</b>;

       3.  temporarily by the user with environment variables (see
           section "ENVIRONMENT");

       4.  dynamically by the package maintainer with environment
           variables set via <b>debian/rules </b>(see section "ENVIRONMENT").

       The configuration files can contain four types of directives:

       <b>SET </b><i>flag value</i>
           Override the flag named <i>flag</i> to have the value <i>value</i>.

       <b>STRIP </b><i>flag value</i>
           Strip from the flag named <i>flag</i> all the build flags listed in
           <i>value</i>.  Since dpkg 1.16.1.

       <b>APPEND </b><i>flag value</i>
           Extend the flag named <i>flag</i> by appending the options given in
           <i>value</i>.  A space is prepended to the appended value if the
           flag's current value is non-empty.

       <b>PREPEND </b><i>flag value</i>
           Extend the flag named <i>flag</i> by prepending the options given in
           <i>value</i>.  A space is appended to the prepended value if the
           flag's current value is non-empty.  Since dpkg 1.16.1.

       The configuration files can contain comments on lines starting
       with a hash (#).  Empty lines are also ignored.

       This program was introduced in dpkg 1.15.7.

COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--dump</b>
           Print to standard output all compilation flags and their
           values.  It prints one flag per line separated from its value
           by an equal sign (“<i>flag</i>=<i>value</i>”).  This is the default action.

       <b>--list</b>
           Print the list of flags supported by the current vendor (one
           per line).  See the "SUPPORTED FLAGS" section for more
           information about them.

       <b>--status</b>
           Display any information that can be useful to explain the
           behavior of <b>dpkg-buildflags </b>(since dpkg 1.16.5): relevant
           environment variables, current vendor, state of all feature
           flags.  Also print the resulting compiler flags with their
           origin.

           This is intended to be run from <b>debian/rules</b>, so that the
           build log keeps a clear trace of the build flags used.  This
           can be useful to diagnose problems related to them.

       <b>--export=</b><i>format</i>
           Print to standard output commands that can be used to export
           all the compilation flags for some particular tool.  If the
           <i>format</i> value is not given, <b>sh </b>is assumed.  Only compilation
           flags starting with an upper case character are included,
           others are assumed to not be suitable for the environment.
           Supported formats:

           <b>sh  </b>Shell commands to set and export all the compilation
               flags in the environment.  The flag values are quoted so
               the output is ready for evaluation by a shell.

           <b>cmdline</b>
               Arguments to pass to a build program's command line to
               use all the compilation flags (since dpkg 1.17.0).  The
               flag values are quoted in shell syntax.

           <b>configure</b>
               This is a legacy alias for <b>cmdline</b>.

           <b>make</b>
               Make directives to set and export all the compilation
               flags in the environment.  Output can be written to a
               Makefile fragment and evaluated using an <b>include</b>
               directive.

       <b>--get </b><i>flag</i>
           Print the value of the flag on standard output.  Exits with 0
           if the flag is known otherwise exits with 1.

       <b>--origin </b><i>flag</i>
           Print the origin of the value that is returned by <b>--get</b>.
           Exits with 0 if the flag is known otherwise exits with 1.
           The origin can be one of the following values:

           <b>vendor</b>
               the original flag set by the vendor is returned;

           <b>system</b>
               the flag is set/modified by a system-wide configuration;

           <b>user</b>
               the flag is set/modified by a user-specific
               configuration;

           <b>env </b>the flag is set/modified by an environment-specific
               configuration.

       <b>--query</b>
           Print any information that can be useful to explain the
           behavior of the program: current vendor, relevant environment
           variables, feature areas, state of all feature flags, whether
           a feature is handled as a builtin default by the compiler
           (since dpkg 1.21.14), and the compiler flags with their
           origin (since dpkg 1.19.0).

           For example:

            Vendor: Debian
            Environment:
             DEB_CFLAGS_SET=-O0 -Wall

            Area: qa
            Features:
             bug=no
             canary=no
            Builtins:

            Area: hardening
            Features:
             pie=no
            Builtins:
             pie=yes

            Area: reproducible
            Features:
             timeless=no
            Builtins:

            Flag: CFLAGS
            Value: -O0 -Wall
            Origin: env

            Flag: CPPFLAGS
            Value: -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
            Origin: vendor

       <b>--query-features </b><i>area</i>
           Print the features enabled for a given area (since dpkg
           1.16.2).  If the feature is handled (even if only on some
           architectures) as a builtin default by the compiler, then a
           <b>Builtin </b>field is printed (since dpkg 1.21.14).  See the
           "FEATURE AREAS" section for more details about the currently
           recognized areas.  Exits with 0 if the area is known
           otherwise exits with 1.

           The output is in RFC822 format, with one section per feature.
           For example:

            Feature: pie
            Enabled: yes
            Builtin: yes

            Feature: stackprotector
            Enabled: yes

       <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.

FEATURE AREAS </h2>
<pre>
       Feature areas are currently vendor specific, and the ones
       described below are only recognized on Debian and derivatives.

       Each area feature can be enabled and disabled in the
       <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS </b>and <b>DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS </b>environment
       variable's area value with the ‘<b>+</b>’ and ‘<b>-</b>’ modifier.  Following
       the general syntax of these variables (described in
       <a href="dpkg-buildpackage.1.html">dpkg-buildpackage(1)</a>), multiple feature areas can be specified
       separated by spaces, where each get feature specifiers as
       mandatory parameters after an equal sign (‘<b>=</b>’).  The feature
       specifiers are comma-separated and parsed from left to right,
       where the settings within the same feature specifier override
       previous ones, even if the feature specifiers are split across
       multiple space-separated feature area settings for the same area.

       For example, to enable the <b>hardening </b>“pie” feature and disable
       the “fortify” feature you can do this in <b>debian/rules</b>:

           export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=+pie,-fortify

       The special feature <b>all </b>(valid in any area) can be used to enable
       or disable all area features at the same time.  Thus disabling
       everything in the <b>hardening </b>area and enabling only “format” and
       “fortify” can be achieved with:

           export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=-all,+format,+fortify

       Multiple feature areas can be set:

           export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=+pie abi=+lfs

       The override behavior applies as much to the <b>all </b>special feature,
       as to specific features, which should allow for composition.
       Thus to enable “lfs” in the <b>abi </b>area, and only “pie” and
       “fortify” in the <b>hardening </b>area, but “format” only when CONDITION
       is defined, this could be done with:

           export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=-all,+pie,+format abi=+lfs
           …
           DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS += hardening=+fortify
           ifdef CONDITION
           DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS += hardening=-format
           endif

   <b>abi</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to
       enable features that can change the ABI of a package, but cannot
       be enabled by default due to backwards compatibility reasons
       unless coordinated or checked individually.

       <b>lfs </b>This setting (since dpkg 1.22.0; disabled by default) enables
           Large File Support on 32-bit architectures where their ABI
           does not include LFS by default, by adding
           <b>-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 </b>to <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.

           When this feature is enabled it will override the value from
           the same feature in the <b>future </b>feature area.

       <b>time64</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.22.0; enabled by default except
           for i386, hurd-i386 and kfreebsd-i386 since dpkg 1.22.5)
           enables 64-bit time_t support on 32-bit architectures where
           their ABI does not include it by default, by adding
           <b>-D_TIME_BITS=64 </b>to <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.  This setting automatically
           enables the <b>lfs </b>feature from the <b>abi </b>feature area.

           If the setting is enabled explicitly then it gets enabled on
           all architectures including i386 but not hurd-i386 nor
           kfreebsd-i386 (where the kernel does not have time64
           interfaces), ignoring the binary backwards compatibility
           default.

           It is also enabled by default by gcc on the armel, armhf,
           hppa, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc and sh4 Debian
           architectures, where disabling the feature will add instead
           <b>-U_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -U_FILE_OFFSET_BITS -U_TIME_BITS </b>to
           <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.

   <b>future</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to
       enable features that should be enabled by default, but cannot due
       to backwards compatibility reasons.

       <b>lfs </b>This setting (since dpkg 1.19.0; disabled by default) is now
           an alias for the <b>lfs </b>feature in the <b>abi </b>area, use that
           instead.  The feature from the <b>abi </b>area overrides this
           setting.

   <b>qa</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to help
       detect problems in the source code or build system.

       <b>bug-implicit-func</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.22.3; enabled by default since
           dpkg 1.22.6) adds <b>-Werror=implicit-function-declaration </b>to
           <b>CFLAGS</b>.

       <b>bug </b>This setting (since dpkg 1.17.4; disabled by default) adds
           any warning option that reliably detects problematic source
           code.  The warnings are fatal.  The only currently supported
           flags are <b>CFLAGS </b>and <b>CXXFLAGS </b>with flags set to
           <b>-Werror=array-bounds</b>, <b>-Werror=clobbered</b>,
           <b>-Werror=implicit-function-declaration </b>and
           <b>-Werror=volatile-register-var</b>.

           This feature handles <b>-Werror=implicit-function-declaration</b>
           via the <b>bug-implicit-func </b>feature, if that has not been
           specified.

       <b>canary</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.17.14; disabled by default) adds
           dummy canary options to the build flags, so that the build
           logs can be checked for how the build flags propagate and to
           allow finding any omission of normal build flag settings.
           The only currently supported flags are <b>CPPFLAGS</b>, <b>CFLAGS</b>,
           <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS </b>and <b>OBJCXXFLAGS </b>with flags set to
           <b>-D__DEB_CANARY_</b><i>flag</i>_<i>random-id</i><b>__</b>, and <b>LDFLAGS </b>set to
           <b>-Wl,-z,deb-canary-</b><i>random-id</i>.

   <b>optimize</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to help
       optimize a resulting binary (since dpkg 1.21.0).  <b>Note</b>: enabling
       <b>all </b>these options can result in unreproducible binary artifacts.

       <b>lto </b>This setting (since dpkg 1.21.0; disabled by default) enables
           Link Time Optimization by adding <b>-flto=auto -ffat-lto-objects</b>
           to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS</b>, <b>FCFLAGS</b>
           and <b>LDFLAGS</b>.

   <b>sanitize</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to help
       sanitize a resulting binary against memory corruptions, memory
       leaks, use after free, threading data races and undefined
       behavior bugs.  <b>Note</b>: these options should <b>not </b>be used for
       production builds as they can reduce reliability for conformant
       code, reduce security or even functionality.

       <b>address</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.18.0; disabled by default) adds
           <b>-fsanitize=address </b>to <b>LDFLAGS </b>and <b>-fsanitize=address</b>
           <b>-fno-omit-frame-pointer </b>to <b>CFLAGS </b>and <b>CXXFLAGS</b>.

       <b>thread</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.18.0; disabled by default) adds
           <b>-fsanitize=thread </b>to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS </b>and <b>LDFLAGS</b>.

       <b>leak</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.18.0; disabled by default) adds
           <b>-fsanitize=leak </b>to <b>LDFLAGS</b>.  It gets automatically disabled
           if either the <b>address </b>or the <b>thread </b>features are enabled, as
           they imply it.

       <b>undefined</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.18.0; disabled by default) adds
           <b>-fsanitize=undefined </b>to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS </b>and <b>LDFLAGS</b>.

   <b>hardening</b>
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to help
       harden a resulting binary against memory corruption attacks, or
       provide additional warning messages during compilation.  Except
       as noted below, these are enabled by default for architectures
       that support them.

       <b>format</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; enabled by default) adds
           <b>-Wformat -Werror=format-security </b>to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>,
           <b>OBJCFLAGS </b>and <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>.  This will warn about improper
           format string uses, and will fail when format functions are
           used in a way that represent possible security problems.  At
           present, this warns about calls to <b>printf </b>and <b>scanf </b>functions
           where the format string is not a string literal and there are
           no format arguments, as in <b>printf(foo); </b>instead of
           <b>printf("%s", foo); </b>This may be a security hole if the format
           string came from untrusted input and contains ‘%n’.

       <b>fortify</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; enabled by default) adds
           <b>-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 </b>to <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.  During code generation the
           compiler knows a great deal of information about buffer sizes
           (where possible), and attempts to replace insecure unlimited
           length buffer function calls with length-limited ones.  This
           is especially useful for old, crufty code.  Additionally,
           format strings in writable memory that contain ‘%n’ are
           blocked.  If an application depends on such a format string,
           it will need to be worked around.

           Note that for this option to have any effect, the source must
           also be compiled with <b>-O1 </b>or higher.  If the environment
           variable <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS </b>contains <i>noopt</i>, then <b>fortify</b>
           support will be disabled, due to new warnings being issued by
           glibc 2.16 and later.

       <b>stackprotector</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; enabled by default if
           stackprotectorstrong is not in use) adds <b>-fstack-protector</b>
           <b>--param=ssp-buffer-size=4 </b>to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>,
           <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS </b>and <b>FCFLAGS</b>.  This adds safety checks
           against stack overwrites.  This renders many potential code
           injection attacks into aborting situations.  In the best case
           this turns code injection vulnerabilities into denial of
           service or into non-issues (depending on the application).

           This feature requires linking against glibc (or another
           provider of <b>__stack_chk_fail</b>), so needs to be disabled when
           building with <b>-nostdlib </b>or <b>-ffreestanding </b>or similar.

       <b>stackprotectorstrong</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.17.11; enabled by default) adds
           <b>-fstack-protector-strong </b>to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>,
           <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS </b>and <b>FCFLAGS</b>.  This is a stronger variant
           of <b>stackprotector</b>, but without significant performance
           penalties.

           Disabling <b>stackprotector </b>will also disable this setting.

           This feature has the same requirements as <b>stackprotector</b>, and
           in addition also requires gcc 4.9 and later.

       <b>stackclash</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.22.0; enabled by default) adds
           <b>-fstack-clash-protection </b>on <b>amd64</b>, <b>arm64</b>, <b>armhf </b>and <b>armel </b>to
           <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS </b>and <b>FCFLAGS</b>.
           This adds code to prevent stack clash style attacks.

       <b>branch</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.22.0; enabled by default) adds
           <b>-fcf-protection </b>on <b>amd64 </b>and <b>-mbranch-protection=standard </b>on
           <b>arm64 </b>to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS </b>and
           <b>FCFLAGS</b>.  This adds branch protection to indirect calls,
           jumps and returns to check whether these are valid at run-
           time.

       <b>relro</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; enabled by default) adds
           <b>-Wl,-z,relro </b>to <b>LDFLAGS</b>.  During program load, several ELF
           memory sections need to be written to by the linker.  This
           flags the loader to turn these sections read-only before
           turning over control to the program.  Most notably this
           prevents GOT overwrite attacks.  If this option is disabled,
           <b>bindnow </b>will become disabled as well.

       <b>bindnow</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; disabled by default) adds
           <b>-Wl,-z,now </b>to <b>LDFLAGS</b>.  During program load, all dynamic
           symbols are resolved, allowing for the entire PLT to be
           marked read-only (due to <b>relro </b>above).  The option cannot
           become enabled if <b>relro </b>is not enabled.

       <b>pie </b>This setting (since dpkg 1.16.1; with no global default since
           dpkg 1.18.23, as it is enabled by default now by gcc on the
           amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, hurd-i386, i386, kfreebsd-amd64,
           kfreebsd-i386, mips, mipsel, mips64el, powerpc, ppc64,
           ppc64el, riscv64, s390x, sparc and sparc64 Debian
           architectures) adds the required options to enable or disable
           PIE via gcc specs files, if needed, depending on whether gcc
           injects on that architecture the flags by itself or not.
           When the setting is enabled and gcc injects the flags, it
           adds nothing.  When the setting is enabled and gcc does not
           inject the flags, it adds <b>-fPIE </b>(via
           <i>/usr/local/share/dpkg/pie-compiler.specs</i>) to <b>CFLAGS</b>,
           <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS </b>and <b>FCFLAGS</b>, and
           <b>-fPIE -pie </b>(via <i>/usr/local/share/dpkg/pie-link.specs</i>) to
           <b>LDFLAGS</b>.  When the setting is disabled and gcc injects the
           flags, it adds <b>-fno-PIE </b>(via
           <i>/usr/local/share/dpkg/no-pie-compile.specs</i>) to <b>CFLAGS</b>,
           <b>CXXFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS </b>and <b>FCFLAGS</b>, and
           <b>-fno-PIE -no-pie </b>(via
           <i>/usr/local/share/dpkg/no-pie-link.specs</i>) to <b>LDFLAGS</b>.

           Position Independent Executable (PIE) is needed to take
           advantage of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR),
           supported by some kernel versions.  While ASLR can already be
           enforced for data areas in the stack and heap (brk and mmap),
           the code areas must be compiled as position-independent.
           Shared libraries already do this (<b>-fPIC</b>), so they gain ASLR
           automatically, but binary .text regions need to be built as
           PIE to gain ASLR.  When this happens, ROP (Return Oriented
           Programming) attacks are much harder since there are no
           static locations to bounce off of during a memory corruption
           attack.

           PIE is not compatible with <b>-fPIC</b>, so in general care must be
           taken when building shared objects.  But because the PIE
           flags emitted get injected via gcc specs files, it should
           always be safe to unconditionally set them regardless of the
           object type being compiled or linked.

           Static libraries can be used by programs or other shared
           libraries.  Depending on the flags used to compile all the
           objects within a static library, these libraries will be
           usable by different sets of objects:

           none
               Cannot be linked into a PIE program, nor a shared
               library.

           <b>-fPIE</b>
               Can be linked into any program, but not a shared library
               (recommended).

           <b>-fPIC</b>
               Can be linked into any program and shared library.

           If there is a need to set these flags manually, bypassing the
           gcc specs injection, there are several things to take into
           account.  Unconditionally and explicitly passing <b>-fPIE</b>, <b>-fpie</b>
           or <b>-pie </b>to a build-system using libtool is safe as these
           flags will get stripped when building shared libraries.
           Otherwise on projects that build both programs and shared
           libraries you might need to make sure that when building the
           shared libraries <b>-fPIC </b>is always passed last (so that it
           overrides any previous <b>-PIE</b>) to compilation flags such as
           <b>CFLAGS</b>, and <b>-shared </b>is passed last (so that it overrides any
           previous <b>-pie</b>) to linking flags such as <b>LDFLAGS</b>.  <b>Note</b>: This
           should not be needed with the default gcc specs machinery.

           Additionally, since PIE is implemented via a general
           register, some register starved architectures (but not
           including i386 anymore since optimizations implemented in gcc
           &gt;= 5) can see performance losses of up to 15% in very text-
           segment-heavy application workloads; most workloads see less
           than 1%.  Architectures with more general registers (e.g.
           amd64) do not see as high a worst-case penalty.

   <b>reproducible</b>
       The compile-time options detailed below can be used to help
       improve build reproducibility or provide additional warning
       messages during compilation.  Except as noted below, these are
       enabled by default for architectures that support them.

       <b>timeless</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.17.14; enabled by default) adds
           <b>-Wdate-time </b>to <b>CPPFLAGS</b>.  This will cause warnings when the
           <b>__TIME__</b>, <b>__DATE__ </b>and <b>__TIMESTAMP__ </b>macros are used.

       <b>fixfilepath</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.19.1; enabled by default) adds
           <b>-ffile-prefix-map=</b><i>BUILDPATH</i><b>=.  </b>to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>,
           <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS </b>and <b>FCFLAGS </b>where <b>BUILDPATH </b>is
           set to the top-level directory of the package being built.
           This has the effect of removing the build path from any
           generated file.

           If both <b>fixdebugpath </b>and <b>fixfilepath </b>are set, this option
           takes precedence, because it is a superset of the former.

           <b>Note</b>: If the build process captures the build flags into the
           resulting built objects, that will make the package
           unreproducible.  And while disabling this option might make
           some of the objects reproducible again this would also
           require disabling <b>fixdebugpath</b>, which might make any
           generated debug symbols objects unreproducible.  The ideal
           fix is to stop capturing build flags.

       <b>fixdebugpath</b>
           This setting (since dpkg 1.18.5; enabled by default) adds
           <b>-fdebug-prefix-map=</b><i>BUILDPATH</i><b>=.  </b>to <b>CFLAGS</b>, <b>CXXFLAGS</b>,
           <b>OBJCFLAGS</b>, <b>OBJCXXFLAGS</b>, <b>FFLAGS </b>and <b>FCFLAGS </b>where <b>BUILDPATH </b>is
           set to the top-level directory of the package being built.
           This has the effect of removing the build path from any
           generated debug symbols.

           <b>Note</b>: This feature has similar reproducible properties as
           <b>fixfilepath</b>.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       There are 2 sets of environment variables doing the same
       operations, the first one (DEB_<i>flag</i>_<i>op</i>) should never be used
       within <b>debian/rules</b>.  It's meant for any user that wants to
       rebuild the source package with different build flags.  The
       second set (DEB_<i>flag</i>_MAINT_<i>op</i>) should only be used in
       <b>debian/rules </b>by package maintainers to change the resulting build
       flags.

       <b>DEB_</b><i>flag</i><b>_SET</b>
       <b>DEB_</b><i>flag</i><b>_MAINT_SET </b>(since dpkg 1.16.1)
           This variable can be used to force the value returned for the
           given <i>flag</i>.

       <b>DEB_</b><i>flag</i><b>_STRIP </b>(since dpkg 1.16.1)
       <b>DEB_</b><i>flag</i><b>_MAINT_STRIP </b>(since dpkg 1.16.1)
           This variable can be used to provide a space separated list
           of options that will be stripped from the set of flags
           returned for the given <i>flag</i>.

       <b>DEB_</b><i>flag</i><b>_APPEND</b>
       <b>DEB_</b><i>flag</i><b>_MAINT_APPEND </b>(since dpkg 1.16.1)
           This variable can be used to append supplementary options to
           the value returned for the given <i>flag</i>.

       <b>DEB_</b><i>flag</i><b>_PREPEND </b>(since dpkg 1.16.1)
       <b>DEB_</b><i>flag</i><b>_MAINT_PREPEND </b>(since dpkg 1.16.1)
           This variable can be used to prepend supplementary options to
           the value returned for the given <i>flag</i>.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>
       <b>DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS </b>(since dpkg 1.16.1)
           These variables can be used by a user or maintainer to
           disable/enable various area features that affect build flags.
           The <b>DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS </b>variable overrides any setting in
           the <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS </b>feature areas.  See the "FEATURE AREAS"
           section for details.

       <b>DEB_VENDOR</b>
           This setting defines the current vendor.  If not set, it will
           discover the current vendor by reading
           <b>/usr/local/etc/dpkg/origins/default</b>.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_PATH</b>
           This variable sets the build path (since dpkg 1.18.8) to use
           in features such as <b>fixdebugpath </b>so that they can be
           controlled by the caller.  This variable is currently Debian
           and derivatives-specific.

       <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH</b>
           Sets the host architecture.  This affects the build flags
           that are emitted, which is typically relevant when cross-
           compiling, where <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH </b>is different to
           <b>DEB_BUILD_ARCH</b>.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are:
           <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>(default).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Configuration files</b>
       <b>/usr/local/etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf</b>
           System wide configuration file.

       <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf </b>or
       <b>$HOME/.config/dpkg/buildflags.conf</b>
           User configuration file.

   <b>Packaging support</b>
       <b>/usr/local/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk</b>
           Makefile snippet that will load (and optionally export) all
           flags supported by <b>dpkg-buildflags </b>into variables (since dpkg
           1.16.1).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To pass build flags to a build command in a Makefile:

        $(MAKE) $(shell dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)

        ./configure $(shell dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)

       To set build flags in a shell script or shell fragment, <b>eval </b>can
       be used to interpret the output and to export the flags in the
       environment:

        eval "$(dpkg-buildflags --export=sh)" &amp;&amp; make

       or to set the positional parameters to pass to a command:

        eval "set -- $(dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)"
        for dir in a b c; do (cd $dir &amp;&amp; ./configure "$@" &amp;&amp; make); done

   <b>Usage in debian/rules</b>
       You should call <b>dpkg-buildflags </b>or include <b>buildflags.mk </b>from the
       <b>debian/rules </b>file to obtain the needed build flags to pass to the
       build system.  Note that older versions of <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b>
       (before dpkg 1.16.1) exported these flags automatically.
       However, you should not rely on this, since this breaks manual
       invocation of <b>debian/rules</b>.

       For packages with autoconf-like build systems, you can pass the
       relevant options to configure or <a href="make.1.html">make(1)</a> directly, as shown
       above.

       For other build systems, or when you need more fine-grained
       control about which flags are passed where, you can use <b>--get</b>.
       Or you can include <b>buildflags.mk </b>instead, which takes care of
       calling <b>dpkg-buildflags </b>and storing the build flags in make
       variables.

       If you want to export all buildflags into the environment (where
       they can be picked up by your build system):

        DPKG_EXPORT_BUILDFLAGS = 1
        include /usr/local/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk

       For some extra control over what is exported, you can manually
       export the variables (as none are exported by default):

        include /usr/local/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk
        export CPPFLAGS CFLAGS LDFLAGS

       And you can of course pass the flags to commands manually:

        include /usr/local/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk
        build-arch:
               $(CC) -o hello hello.c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
