NAME </h2>
<pre>
       opannotate - produce source or assembly annotated with profile
       data
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>opannotate </b>[ <i>options</i> ] [profile specification]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>opannotate </b>outputs annotated source and/or assembly from profile
       data of an OProfile session. See oprofile(1) for how to write
       profile specifications.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--assembly / -a</b>
              Output annotated assembly. The binary file to be annotated
              does not need full debugging information to use this
              option, but symbol information <i>is</i> required. Without symbol
              information, <b>opannotate </b>will silently refuse to annotate
              the binary.  If this option is combined with --source,
              then mixed source / assembly annotations are output.

       <b>--demangle / -D none|smart|normal</b>
              none: no demangling. normal: use default demangler
              (default) smart: use pattern-matching to make C++ symbol
              demangling more readable.

       <b>--exclude-dependent / -x</b>
              Do not include application-specific images for libraries,
              kernel modules and the kernel. This option only makes
              sense if the profile session used --separate.

       <b>--exclude-file [files]</b>
              Exclude all files in the given comma-separated list of
              glob patterns. This option is supported solely with the
              <i>--source</i> option. It can be used to filter out source files
              in the output using the following types of specifications:

              • filenames (basename -- i.e., no path)

              • filename glob specifications (all files whose base
                filename matches the given pattern)

              • directory segments (all source files located in the
                specified directory; e.g. "libio")

              • directory segment glob specifications (e.g., "libi*")

       <b>--exclude-symbols / -e [symbols]</b>
              Exclude all the symbols in the given comma-separated list.

       <b>--help / -? / --usage</b>
              Show help message.

       <b>--image-path / -p [paths]</b>
              Comma-separated list of additional paths to search for
              binaries.  This is needed to find modules in kernels 2.6
              and upwards.

       <b>--root / -R [path]</b>
              A path to a filesystem to search for additional binaries.

       <b>--include-file [files]</b>
              Only include files in the given comma-separated list of
              glob patterns.  The same rules apply for this option as
              for the <i>--exclude-file</i> option.

       <b>--merge / -m [lib,cpu,tid,tgid,unitmask,all]</b>
              Merge any profiles separated in a --separate session.

       <b>--include-symbols / -i [symbols]</b>
              Only include symbols in the given comma-separated list.

       <b>--objdump-params [params]</b>
              Pass the given parameters as extra values when calling
              objdump.  If more than one option is to be passed to
              objdump, the parameters must be enclosed in a quoted
              string.

              An example of where this option is useful is when your
              toolchain does not automatically recognize instructions
              that are specific to your processor.  For example, on IBM
              POWER7/RHEL 6, objdump must be told that a binary file may
              have POWER7-specific instructions. The opannotate option
              to show the POWER7-specific instructions is:
                 --objdump-params=-Mpower7

              The opannotate option to show the POWER7-specific
              instructions, the source code (--source) and the line
              numbers (-l) would be:
                 --objdump-params="-Mpower7 -l --source"

       <b>--output-dir / -o [dir]</b>
              Output directory. This makes opannotate output one
              annotated file for each source file. This option can't be
              used in conjunction with --assembly.

       <b>--search-dirs / -d [paths]</b>
              Comma-separated list of paths to search for source files.
              You may need to use this option when the debug information
              for an image contains relative paths.

       <b>--base-dirs / -b [paths]</b>
              Comma-separated list of paths to strip from debug source
              files, prior to looking for them in --search-dirs.

       <b>--session-dir=</b><i>dir_path</i>
              Use sample database from the specified directory <i>dir_path</i>
              instead of the default location. If <i>--session-dir</i> is not
              specified, then <b>opannotate </b>will search for samples in
              &lt;current_dir&gt;/oprofile_data first. If that directory does
              not exist, the standard session-dir of /var/lib/oprofile
              is used.

       <b>--source / -s</b>
              Output annotated source. This requires debugging
              information to be available for the binaries.

       <b>--threshold / -t [percentage]</b>
              For annotated assembly, only output data for symbols that
              have more than the given percentage of total samples. For
              profiles using multiple events, if the threshold is
              reached for any event, then all sample data for the symbol
              is shown.

              For annotated source, only output data for source files
              that have more than the given percentage of total samples.
              For profiles using multiple events, if the threshold is
              reached for any event, then all sample data for the source
              file is shown.

       <b>--verbose / -V [options]</b>
              Give verbose debugging output.

       <b>--version / -v</b>
              Show version.
