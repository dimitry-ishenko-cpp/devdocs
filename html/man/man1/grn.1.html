Description </h2>
<pre>
       <i>grn</i> is a preprocessor for including <i>gremlin</i> pictures in <i>troff</i>(1)
       input.  <i>grn</i> writes to standard output, processing only input
       lines between two that start with <b>.GS </b>and <b>.GE</b>.  Those lines must
       contain <i>grn</i> commands (see below).  These macros request a <i>gremlin</i>
       file; the picture in that file is converted and placed in the
       <i>troff</i> input stream.  <b>.GS </b>may be called with a <b>C</b>, <b>L</b>, or <b>R </b>argument
       to center, left-, or right-justify the whole <i>gremlin</i> picture (the
       default is to center).  If no <i>file</i> is mentioned, the standard
       input is read.  At the end of the picture, the position on the
       page is the bottom of the <i>gremlin</i> picture.  If the <i>grn</i> entry is
       ended with <b>.GF </b>instead of <b>.GE</b>, the position is left at the top of
       the picture.

       Currently only the <i>me</i> macro package has support for <b>.GS</b>, <b>.GE</b>, and
       <b>.GF</b>.

       <i>grn</i> produces drawing escape sequences that use <i>groff</i>'s color
       scheme extension (<b>\D'F </b>...<b>'</b>), and thus may not work with other
       <i>troff</i>s.

   [1mgrn[24m commands
       Each input line between <b>.GS </b>and <b>.GE </b>may have one <i>grn</i> command.
       Commands consist of one or two strings separated by whitespace,
       the first string being the command and the second its operand.
       Commands may be upper- or lowercase and abbreviated down to one
       character.

       Commands that affect a picture's environment (those listed before
       “<b>default</b>”, see below) are only in effect for the current picture:
       the environment is reinitialized to the defaults at the start of
       the next picture.  The commands are as follows.

       <b>1 </b><i>N</i>
       <b>2 </b><i>N</i>
       <b>3 </b><i>N</i>
       <b>4 </b><i>N</i>    Set <i>gremlin</i>'s text size number 1 (2, 3, or 4) to <i>N</i> points.
              The default is 12 (16, 24, and 36, respectively).

       <b>roman </b><i>f</i>
       <b>italics </b><i>f</i>
       <b>bold </b><i>f</i>
       <b>special </b><i>f</i>
              Set the roman (italics, bold, or special) font to <i>troff</i>'s
              font <i>f</i> (either a name or number).  The default is R (I, B,
              and S, respectively).

       <b>l </b><i>f</i>
       <b>stipple </b><i>f</i>
              Set the stipple font to <i>troff</i>'s stipple font <i>f</i> (name or
              number).  The command <b>stipple </b>may be abbreviated down as
              far as “<b>st</b>” (to avoid confusion with “<b>special</b>”).  There is
              <i>no</i> default for stipples (unless one is set by the
              “<b>default</b>” command), and it is invalid to include a <i>gremlin</i>
              picture with polygons without specifying a stipple font.

       <b>x </b><i>N</i>
       <b>scale </b><i>N</i>
              Magnify the picture (in addition to any default
              magnification) by <i>N</i>, a floating-point number larger than
              zero.  The command <b>scale </b>may be abbreviated down to “<b>sc</b>”.

       <b>narrow </b><i>N</i>
       <b>medium </b><i>N</i>
       <b>thick </b><i>N</i>
              Set the thickness of <i>gremlin</i>'s narrow (medium and thick,
              respectively) lines to <i>N</i> times 0.15pt (this value can be
              changed at compile time).  The default is 1.0 (3.0 and
              5.0, respectively), which corresponds to 0.15pt (0.45pt
              and 0.75pt, respectively).  A thickness value of zero
              selects the smallest available line thickness.  Negative
              values cause the line thickness to be proportional to the
              current point size.

       <b>pointscale </b>[<b>off</b>|<b>on</b>]
              Scale text to match the picture.  Gremlin text is usually
              printed in the point size specified with the commands <b>1</b>,
              <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, or <b>4</b>, regardless of any scaling factors in the
              picture.  Setting <b>pointscale </b>will cause the point sizes to
              scale with the picture (within <i>troff</i>'s limitations, of
              course).  An operand of anything but <b>off </b>will turn text
              scaling on.

       <b>default</b>
              Reset the picture environment defaults to the settings in
              the current picture.  This is meant to be used as a global
              parameter setting mechanism at the beginning of the <i>troff</i>
              input file, but can be used at any time to reset the
              default settings.

       <b>width </b><i>N</i>
              Force the picture to be <i>N</i> inches wide.  This overrides any
              scaling factors present in the same picture.  “<b>width 0</b>” is
              ignored.

       <b>height </b><i>N</i>
              Force the picture to be <i>N</i> inches high, overriding other
              scaling factors.  If both <b>width </b>and <b>height </b>are specified,
              the tighter constraint will determine the scale of the
              picture.  <b>height </b>and <b>width </b>commands are not saved with a
              “<b>default</b>” command.  They will, however, affect point size
              scaling if that option is set.

       <b>file </b><i>name</i>
              Get picture from <i>gremlin</i> file <i>name</i> located the current
              directory (or in the library directory; see the <b>-M </b>option
              above).  If multiple <b>file </b>commands are given, the last one
              controls.  If <i>name</i> doesn't exist, an error message is
              reported and processing continues from the <b>.GE </b>line.

   [1mUsage with <i>groff</i>
       Since <i>grn</i> is a preprocessor, it has no access to elements of
       formatter state, such as indentation, line length, type size, or
       register values.  Consequently, no <i>troff</i> input can be placed
       between the <b>.GS </b>and <b>.GE </b>macros.  However, <i>gremlin</i> text elements
       are subsequently processed by <i>troff</i>, so anything valid in a
       single line of <i>troff</i> input is valid in a line of <i>gremlin</i> text
       (barring the dot control character “.” at the beginning of a
       line).  Thus, it is possible to have equations within a <i>gremlin</i>
       figure by including in the <i>gremlin</i> file <i>eqn</i> expressions enclosed
       by previously defined delimiters (e.g., “$$”).

       When using <i>grn</i> along with other preprocessors, it is best to run
       <i>tbl</i>(1) before <i>grn</i>, <i>pic</i>(1), and/or <i>ideal</i> to avoid overworking <i>tbl</i>.
       <i>eqn</i>(1) should always be run last.  <i>groff</i>(1) will automatically
       run preprocessors in the correct order.

       A picture is considered an entity, but that doesn't stop <i>troff</i>
       from trying to break it up if it falls off the end of a page.
       Placing the picture between “keeps” in the <i>me</i> macros will ensure
       proper placement.

       <i>grn</i> uses <i>troff</i>'s registers <b>g1 </b>through <b>g9 </b>and sets registers <b>g1</b>
       and <b>g2 </b>to the width and height of the <i>gremlin</i> figure (in device
       units) before entering the <b>.GS </b>macro (this is for those who want
       to rewrite these macros).

   <b>Gremlin file format</b>
       There exist two distinct <i>gremlin</i> file formats: the original
       format for AED graphic terminals, and the Sun or X11 version.  An
       extension used by the Sun/X11 version allowing reference points
       with negative coordinates is <i>not</i> compatible with the AED version.
       As long as a <i>gremlin</i> file does not contain negative coordinates,
       either format will be read correctly by either version of <i>gremlin</i>
       or <i>grn</i>.  The other difference in Sun/X11 format is the use of
       names for picture objects (e.g., <b>POLYGON</b>, <b>CURVE</b>) instead of
       numbers.  Files representing the same picture are shown below.

                     sungremlinfile        gremlinfile

       •  The first line of each <i>gremlin</i> file contains either the string
          “<b>gremlinfile</b>” (AED) or “<b>sungremlinfile</b>” (Sun/X11).

       •  The second line of the file contains an orientation and <i>x</i> and
          <i>y</i> values for a positioning point, separated by spaces.  The
          orientation, either <b>0 </b>or <b>1</b>, is ignored by the Sun/X11 version.
          <b>0 </b>means that <i>gremlin</i> will display things in horizontal format
          (a drawing area wider than it is tall, with a menu across the
          top).  <b>1 </b>means that <i>gremlin</i> will display things in vertical
          format (a drawing area taller than it is wide, with a menu on
          the left side).  <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are floating-point values giving a
          positioning point to be used when this file is read into
          another file.  The stuff on this line really isn't all that
          important; a value of “<b>1 0.00 0.00</b>” is suggested.

       •  The rest of the file consists of zero or more element
          specifications.  After the last element specification is a
          line containing the string “<b>-1</b>”.

       •  Lines longer than 127 characters are truncated to that length.

   <b>Element specifications</b>
       •  The first line of each element contains a single decimal
          number giving the type of the element (AED) or its name
          (Sun/X11).

       •  Each line after the object type specifies a point used to
          display the element.  It contains an <i>x</i> and a <i>y</i> coordinate in
          floating-point format, separated by spaces.  The list of
          points is terminated by a line containing the string “<b>-1.0</b>
          <b>-1.0</b>” (AED) or a single asterisk, “<b>*</b>” (Sun/X11).

       •  After the points comes a line containing two decimal values,
          giving the brush and size for the element.  The brush
          determines the style in which things are drawn.  For vectors,
          arcs, and curves there are six valid brush values.

                            <b>1   </b>thin dotted lines
                            <b>2   </b>thin dot-dashed lines
                            <b>3   </b>thick solid lines
                            <b>4   </b>thin dashed lines
                            <b>5   </b>thin solid lines
                            <b>6   </b>medium solid lines

          For polygons, 0 is also valid: it specifies an invisible
          border.  For text, the brush selects a font as follows.

                          <b>1   </b>roman (R font in <i>troff</i>)
                          <b>2   </b>italics (I font in <i>troff</i>)
                          <b>3   </b>bold (B font in <i>troff</i>)
                          <b>4   </b>special (S font in <i>troff</i>)

          If you're using <i>grn</i> to run your pictures through <i>groff</i>, the
          font is really just a starting font.  The text string can
          contain formatting sequences like “\fI” or “\d” which may
          change the font (as well as do many other things).  For text,
          the size field is a decimal value between 1 and 4.  It selects
          the size of the font in which the text will be drawn.  For
          polygons, this size field is interpreted as a stipple number
          to fill the polygon with.  The number is used to index into a
          stipple font at print time.

       •  The last line of each element contains a decimal number and a
          string of characters, separated by a single space.  The number
          is a count of the number of characters in the string.  This
          information is used only for text elements, and contains the
          text string.  There can be spaces inside the text.  For arcs,
          curves, and vectors, the character count is zero (<b>0</b>), followed
          by exactly one space before the newline.

   <b>Coordinates</b>
       <i>gremlin</i> was designed for AED terminals, and its coordinates
       reflect the AED coordinate space.  For vertical pictures,
       <i>x</i> values range 116 to 511, and <i>y</i> values from 0 to 483.  For
       horizontal pictures, <i>x</i> values range from 0 to 511, and <i>y</i> values
       from 0 to 367.  Although you needn't absolutely stick to this
       range, you'll get better results if you at least stay in this
       vicinity.  Also, point lists are terminated by a point of (-1,
       -1), so you shouldn't ever use negative coordinates.  <i>gremlin</i>
       writes out coordinates using the <i>printf</i>(3) format “%f1.2”; it's
       probably a good idea to use the same format if you want to modify
       the <i>grn</i> code.

   <b>Sun/X11 coordinates</b>
       There is no restriction on the range of coordinates used to
       create objects in the Sun/X11 version of <i>gremlin</i>.  However, files
       with negative coordinates <i>will</i> cause problems if displayed on the
       AED.
