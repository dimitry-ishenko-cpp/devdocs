</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>telnet-probe </b>- lightweight telnet-like port probe
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/telnet-probe </b>[<b>-cv?</b>]  <i>host port</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>telnet-probe </b>allows the <a href="pmdashping.1.html">pmdashping(1)</a> daemons to establish
       connections to arbitrary local and remote service-providing
       daemons so that response time and service availability
       information can be obtained.

       The required <i>host</i> and <i>port</i> number arguments have the same meaning
       as their <b>telnet</b>(1) equivalents.

       The <b>-c </b>option causes <b>telnet-probe </b>to perform a <a href="../man2/connect.2.html">connect(2)</a> only.
       This skips the <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> and <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> exercise that would otherwise
       be done after connecting (see below).

       Once the telnet connection has been established, <b>telnet-probe</b>
       reads from <i>stdin</i> until end-of-file, and writes all the input data
       to the telnet connection.  Next, <b>telnet-probe </b>will read from the
       telnet connection until end-of-file, discarding whatever data it
       receives.  Then <b>telnet-probe </b>exits.

       To operate successfully, the input passed via <b>telnet-probe </b>to the
       remote service must be sufficient to cause the remote service to
       close the connection when the last line of input has been
       processed, e.g. ending with ``quit'' when probing SMTP on port
       25.

       By default <b>telnet-probe </b>will not produce any output, unless there
       is an error in which case a diagnostic message can be displayed
       (in verbose mode only) and the exit status will be non-zero
       indicating a failure.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-c   </b>Connect only, do not read or write.

       <b>-v   </b>Enable verbose mode.

       <b>-?   </b>Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       If <b>telnet-probe </b>succeeds, then 0 will be returned.  If the
       attempt to establish a connection fails or is terminated, then a
       non-zero exit status is returned.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
