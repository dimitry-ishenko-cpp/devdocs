NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-http-push - Push objects over HTTP/DAV to another repository
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git http-push</i> [--all] [--dry-run] [--force] [--verbose] &lt;URL&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [&lt;ref&gt;...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Sends missing objects to the remote repository, and updates the
       remote branch.

       <b>NOTE</b>: This command is temporarily disabled if your libcurl is
       older than 7.16, as the combination has been reported not to work
       and sometimes corrupts the repository.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --all
           Do not assume that the remote repository is complete in its
           current state, and verify all objects in the entire local
           ref’s history exist in the remote repository.

       --force
           Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is
           not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. This
           flag disables the check. What this means is that the remote
           repository can lose commits; use it with care.

       --dry-run
           Do everything except actually send the updates.

       --verbose
           Report the list of objects being walked locally and the list
           of objects successfully sent to the remote repository.

       -d, -D
           Remove &lt;ref&gt; from remote repository. The specified branch
           cannot be the remote HEAD. If -d is specified, the following
           other conditions must also be met:

           •   Remote HEAD must resolve to an object that exists locally

           •   Specified branch resolves to an object that exists
               locally

           •   Specified branch is an ancestor of the remote HEAD

       &lt;ref&gt;...
           The remote refs to update.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING THE REFS </h2>
<pre>
       A <i>&lt;ref&gt;</i> specification can be either a single pattern, or a pair
       of such patterns separated by a colon ":" (this means that a ref
       name cannot have a colon in it). A single pattern <i>&lt;name&gt;</i> is just
       a shorthand for <i>&lt;name&gt;:&lt;name&gt;</i>.

       Each pattern pair <i>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</i> consists of the source side (before
       the colon) and the destination side (after the colon). The ref to
       be pushed is determined by finding a match that matches the
       source side, and where it is pushed is determined by using the
       destination side.

       •   It is an error if <i>&lt;src&gt;</i> does not match exactly one of the
           local refs.

       •   If <i>&lt;dst&gt;</i> does not match any remote ref, either

           •   it has to start with "refs/"; &lt;dst&gt; is used as the
               destination literally in this case.

           •   &lt;src&gt; == &lt;dst&gt; and the ref that matched the &lt;src&gt; must
               not exist in the set of remote refs; the ref matched
               &lt;src&gt; locally is used as the name of the destination.

       Without ‘--force`, the &lt;src&gt; ref is stored at the remote only if
       &lt;dst&gt; does not exist, or &lt;dst&gt; is a proper subset (i.e. an
       ancestor) of &lt;src&gt;. This check, known as "fast-forward check", is
       performed to avoid accidentally overwriting the remote ref and
       losing other peoples’ commits from there.

       With <b>--force</b>, the fast-forward check is disabled for all refs.

       Optionally, a &lt;ref&gt; parameter can be prefixed with a plus <i>+</i> sign
       to disable the fast-forward check only on that ref.
