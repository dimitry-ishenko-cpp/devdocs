</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-revert - Revert some existing commits
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git revert</i> [--[no-]edit] [-n] [-m &lt;parent-number&gt;] [-s] [-S[&lt;keyid&gt;]] &lt;commit&gt;...
       <i>git revert</i> (--continue | --skip | --abort | --quit)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the
       related patches introduce, and record some new commits that
       record them. This requires your working tree to be clean (no
       modifications from the HEAD commit).

       Note: <i>git revert</i> is used to record some new commits to reverse
       the effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one). If
       you want to throw away all uncommitted changes in your working
       directory, you should see <a href="git-reset.1.html">git-reset(1)</a>, particularly the <b>--hard</b>
       option. If you want to extract specific files as they were in
       another commit, you should see <a href="git-restore.1.html">git-restore(1)</a>, specifically the
       <b>--source </b>option. Take care with these alternatives as both will
       discard uncommitted changes in your working directory.

       See "Reset, restore and revert" in <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> for the differences
       between the three commands.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;commit&gt;...
           Commits to revert. For a more complete list of ways to spell
           commit names, see <a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>. Sets of commits can also
           be given but no traversal is done by default, see
           <a href="git-rev-list.1.html">git-rev-list(1)</a> and its <b>--no-walk </b>option.

       -e, --edit
           With this option, <i>git revert</i> will let you edit the commit
           message prior to committing the revert. This is the default
           if you run the command from a terminal.

       -m parent-number, --mainline parent-number
           Usually you cannot revert a merge because you do not know
           which side of the merge should be considered the mainline.
           This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of
           the mainline and allows revert to reverse the change relative
           to the specified parent.

           Reverting a merge commit declares that you will never want
           the tree changes brought in by the merge. As a result, later
           merges will only bring in tree changes introduced by commits
           that are not ancestors of the previously reverted merge. This
           may or may not be what you want.

           See the <b>revert-a-faulty-merge How-To</b>[1] for more details.

       --no-edit
           With this option, <i>git revert</i> will not start the commit
           message editor.

       --cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;
           This option determines how the commit message will be cleaned
           up before being passed on to the commit machinery. See
           <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> for more details. In particular, if the <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i>
           is given a value of <b>scissors</b>, scissors will be appended to
           <b>MERGE_MSG </b>before being passed on in the case of a conflict.

       -n, --no-commit
           Usually the command automatically creates some commits with
           commit log messages stating which commits were reverted. This
           flag applies the changes necessary to revert the named
           commits to your working tree and the index, but does not make
           the commits. In addition, when this option is used, your
           index does not have to match the HEAD commit. The revert is
           done against the beginning state of your index.

           This is useful when reverting more than one commits' effect
           to your index in a row.

       -S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], --no-gpg-sign
           GPG-sign commits. The <b>keyid </b>argument is optional and defaults
           to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to
           the option without a space.  <b>--no-gpg-sign </b>is useful to
           countermand both <b>commit.gpgSign </b>configuration variable, and
           earlier <b>--gpg-sign</b>.

       -s, --signoff
           Add a <b>Signed-off-by </b>trailer at the end of the commit message.
           See the signoff option in <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> for more information.

       --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;
           Use the given merge strategy. Should only be used once. See
           the MERGE STRATEGIES section in <a href="git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a> for details.

       -X&lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;
           Pass the merge strategy-specific option through to the merge
           strategy. See <a href="git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a> for details.

       --rerere-autoupdate, --no-rerere-autoupdate
           After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution on
           the current conflict to update the files in the working tree,
           allow it to also update the index with the result of
           resolution.  <b>--no-rerere-autoupdate </b>is a good way to
           double-check what <b>rerere </b>did and catch potential mismerges,
           before committing the result to the index with a separate <b>git</b>
           <b>add</b>.

       --reference
           Instead of starting the body of the log message with "This
           reverts &lt;full-object-name-of-the-commit-being-reverted&gt;.",
           refer to the commit using "--pretty=reference" format (cf.
           <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>). The <b>revert.reference </b>configuration variable can
           be used to enable this option by default.
</pre> <h2>
SEQUENCER SUBCOMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       --continue
           Continue the operation in progress using the information in
           <b>.git/sequencer</b>. Can be used to continue after resolving
           conflicts in a failed cherry-pick or revert.

       --skip
           Skip the current commit and continue with the rest of the
           sequence.

       --quit
           Forget about the current operation in progress. Can be used
           to clear the sequencer state after a failed cherry-pick or
           revert.

       --abort
           Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence state.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git revert HEAD~3</b>
           Revert the changes specified by the fourth last commit in
           HEAD and create a new commit with the reverted changes.

       <b>git revert -n master~5..master~2</b>
           Revert the changes done by commits from the fifth last commit
           in master (included) to the third last commit in master
           (included), but do not create any commit with the reverted
           changes. The revert only modifies the working tree and the
           index.
</pre> <h2>
DISCUSSION </h2>
<pre>
       While git creates a basic commit message automatically, it is
       <i>strongly</i> recommended to explain why the original commit is being
       reverted. In addition, repeatedly reverting reverts will result
       in increasingly unwieldy subject lines, for example <i>Reapply</i>
       <i>"Reapply "&lt;original-subject&gt;""</i>. Please consider rewording these
       to be shorter and more unique.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively
       included from the <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> documentation. The content is the
       same as what’s found there:

       revert.reference
           Setting this variable to true makes <b>git revert </b>behave as if
           the <b>--reference </b>option is given.
