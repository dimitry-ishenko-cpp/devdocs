       ipcs — report XSI interprocess communication facilities status
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ipcs <b>[</b>-qms<b>] [</b>-a|-bcopt<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ipcs</i> utility shall write information about active
       interprocess communication facilities.

       Without options, information shall be written in short format for
       message queues, shared memory segments, and semaphore sets that
       are currently active in the system. Otherwise, the information
       that is displayed is controlled by the options specified.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ipcs</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The <i>ipcs</i> utility accepts the following options:

       <b>-q        </b>Write information about active message queues.

       <b>-m        </b>Write information about active shared memory segments.

       <b>-s        </b>Write information about active semaphore sets.

       If <b>-q</b>, <b>-m</b>, or <b>-s </b>are specified, only information about those
       facilities shall be written. If none of these three are
       specified, information about all three shall be written subject
       to the following options:

       <b>-a        </b>Use all print options. (This is a shorthand notation
                 for <b>-b</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-o</b>, <b>-p</b>, and <b>-t</b>.)

       <b>-b        </b>Write information on maximum allowable size. (Maximum
                 number of bytes in messages on queue for message
                 queues, size of segments for shared memory, and number
                 of semaphores in each set for semaphores.)

       <b>-c        </b>Write creator's user name and group name; see below.

       <b>-o        </b>Write information on outstanding usage. (Number of
                 messages on queue and total number of bytes in messages
                 on queue for message queues, and number of processes
                 attached to shared memory segments.)

       <b>-p        </b>Write process number information. (Process ID of the
                 last process to send a message and process ID of the
                 last process to receive a message on message queues,
                 process ID of the creating process, and process ID of
                 the last process to attach or detach on shared memory
                 segments.)

       <b>-t        </b>Write time information. (Time of the last control
                 operation that changed the access permissions for all
                 facilities, time of the last <i>msgsnd</i>() and <i>msgrcv</i>()
                 operations on message queues, time of the last <i>shmat</i>()
                 and <i>shmdt</i>() operations on shared memory, and time of
                 the last <i>semop</i>() operation on semaphores.)

</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>ipcs</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone for the date and time strings
                 written by <i>ipcs</i>.  If <i>TZ</i> is unset or null, an
                 unspecified default timezone shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       An introductory line shall be written with the format:

           "IPC status from %s as of %s\n", &lt;<i>source</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>date</i>&gt;

       where &lt;<i>source</i>&gt; indicates the source used to gather the statistics
       and &lt;<i>date</i>&gt; is the information that would be produced by the <i>date</i>
       command when invoked in the POSIX locale.

       The <i>ipcs</i> utility then shall create up to three reports depending
       upon the <b>-q</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-s </b>options. The first report shall indicate
       the status of message queues, the second report shall indicate
       the status of shared memory segments, and the third report shall
       indicate the status of semaphore sets.

       If the corresponding facility is not installed or has not been
       used since the last reboot, then the report shall be written out
       in the format:

           "%s facility not in system.\n", &lt;<i>facility</i>&gt;

       where &lt;<i>facility</i>&gt; is <i>Message Queue</i>, <i>Shared Memory</i>, or <i>Semaphore</i>,
       as appropriate. If the facility has been installed and has been
       used since the last reboot, column headings separated by one or
       more &lt;space&gt; characters and followed by a &lt;newline&gt; shall be
       written as indicated below followed by the facility name written
       out using the format:

           "%s:\n", &lt;<i>facility</i>&gt;

       where &lt;<i>facility</i>&gt; is <i>Message Queues</i>, <i>Shared Memory</i>, or <i>Semaphores</i>,
       as appropriate. On the second and third reports the column
       headings need not be written if the last column headings written
       already provide column headings for all information in that
       report.

       The column headings provided in the first column below and the
       meaning of the information in those columns shall be given in
       order below; the letters in parentheses indicate the options that
       shall cause the corresponding column to appear; ``all'' means
       that the column shall always appear. Each column is separated by
       one or more &lt;space&gt; characters. Note that these options only
       determine what information is provided for each report; they do
       not determine which reports are written.

       T (all)     Type of facility:

                   q       Message queue.

                   m       Shared memory segment.

                   s       Semaphore.

                   This field is a single character written using the
                   format <b>%c</b>.

       ID (all)    The identifier for the facility entry. This field
                   shall be written using the format <b>%d</b>.

       KEY (all)   The key used as an argument to <i>msgget</i>(), <i>semget</i>(), or
                   <i>shmget</i>() to create the facility entry.

                   <b>Note:  </b>The key of a shared memory segment is changed
                          to IPC_PRIVATE when the segment has been
                          removed until all processes attached to the
                          segment detach it.

                   This field shall be written using the format 0x%x.

       MODE (all)  The facility access modes and flags. The mode shall
                   consist of 11 characters that are interpreted as
                   follows.

                   The first character shall be:

                   S       If a process is waiting on a <i>msgsnd</i>()
                           operation.

                   -       If the above is not true.

                   The second character shall be:

                   R       If a process is waiting on a <i>msgrcv</i>()
                           operation.

                   C or -  If the associated shared memory segment is to
                           be cleared when the first attach operation is
                           executed.

                   -       If none of the above is true.

                   The next nine characters shall be interpreted as
                   three sets of three bits each. The first set refers
                   to the owner's permissions; the next to permissions
                   of others in the usergroup of the facility entry; and
                   the last to all others. Within each set, the first
                   character indicates permission to read, the second
                   character indicates permission to write or alter the
                   facility entry, and the last character is a &lt;hyphen-
                   minus&gt; (<b>'-'</b>).

                   The permissions shall be indicated as follows:

                   <i>r</i>       If read permission is granted.

                   <i>w</i>       If write permission is granted.

                   <i>a</i>       If alter permission is granted.

                   -       If the indicated permission is not granted.

                   The first character following the permissions
                   specifies if there is an alternate or additional
                   access control method associated with the facility.
                   If there is no alternate or additional access control
                   method associated with the facility, a single &lt;space&gt;
                   shall be written; otherwise, another printable
                   character is written.

       OWNER (all) The user name of the owner of the facility entry. If
                   the user name of the owner is found in the user
                   database, at least the first eight column positions
                   of the name shall be written using the format <b>%s</b>.
                   Otherwise, the user ID of the owner shall be written
                   using the format <b>%d</b>.

       GROUP (all) The group name of the owner of the facility entry. If
                   the group name of the owner is found in the group
                   database, at least the first eight column positions
                   of the name shall be written using the format <b>%s</b>.
                   Otherwise, the group ID of the owner shall be written
                   using the format <b>%d</b>.

       The following nine columns shall be only written out for message
       queues:
