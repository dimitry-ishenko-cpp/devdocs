NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-mergechangelogs - 3-way merge of debian/changelog files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-mergechangelogs </b>[<i>option</i>...] <i>old new-a new-b</i> [<i>out</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This program will use the 3 provided versions of the Debian
       changelog to generate a merged changelog file.  The resulting
       changelog is stored in the file <i>out</i> or output to the standard
       output if that parameter is not given.

       Each entry is identified by its version number and they are
       assumed to be not conflicting, they are simply merged in the
       right order (by decreasing version number).  When
       <b>--merge-prereleases </b>is used, the part of the version number after
       the last tilde is dropped so that 1.0-1~exp1 and 1.0-1~exp5 are
       considered to be the same entry.  When the same version is
       available in both <i>new-a</i> and <i>new-b</i>, a standard line-based 3-way
       merge is attempted (provided that the module Algorithm::Merge is
       available — it's part of the package libalgorithm-merge-perl —
       otherwise you get a global conflict on the content of the entry).

       This program was introduced in dpkg 1.15.7.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--merge-unreleased</b>
           Ignore the version number when the entries are marked as
           <b>UNRELEASED </b>(since dpkg 1.21.0).

           This is useful when you have diverging development for
           versions that have not yet been released.  For instance 2.1-1
           is released, then development happens for the new 2.2-1 and
           then for 2.3-1, where it makes sense to just end with a
           coalesced entry for 2.3-1 including all the development done
           in 2.2-1.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--merge-prereleases</b>
           Drop the part after the last tilde in the version number when
           doing version comparison to identify if two entries are
           supposed to be the same or not.

           This is useful when you keep using the same changelog entry
           but you increase its version number regularly.  For instance,
           you might have 2.3-1~exp1, 2.3-1~exp2, ... until the official
           release 2.3-1 and they are all the same changelog entry that
           has evolved over time.

       <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are:
           <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>(default).
</pre> <h2>
LIMITATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Anything that is not parsed by Dpkg::Changelog is lost during the
       merge.  This might include stuff like comments which were not
       supposed to be there, etc.
</pre> <h2>
INTEGRATION WITH GIT </h2>
<pre>
       If you want to use this program to merge Debian changelog files
       in a git repository, you have first to register a new merge
       driver in <b>.git/config </b>or <b>~/.gitconfig</b>:

        [merge "dpkg-mergechangelogs"]
           name = debian/changelog merge driver
           driver = dpkg-mergechangelogs -m %O %A %B %A

       Then you have to setup the merge attribute for the
       debian/changelog file either in <b>.gitattributes </b>in the repository
       itself, or in <b>.git/info/attributes</b>:

        debian/changelog merge=dpkg-mergechangelogs
