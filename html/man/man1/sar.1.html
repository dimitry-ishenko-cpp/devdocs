</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sar </b>command writes to standard output the contents of
       selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system.
       The accounting system, based on the values in the <i>count</i> and
       <i>interval</i> parameters, writes information the specified number of
       times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds.  If the
       <i>interval</i> parameter is set to zero, the <b>sar </b>command displays the
       average statistics for the time since the system was started. If
       the <i>interval</i> parameter is specified without the <i>count</i> parameter,
       then reports are generated continuously.  The collected data can
       also be saved in the file specified by the <b>-o </b><i>filename</i> flag, in
       addition to being displayed onto the screen. If <i>filename</i> is
       omitted, <b>sar </b>uses the standard system activity daily data file
       (see below).  By default all the data available from the kernel
       are saved in the data file.

       The <b>sar </b>command extracts and writes to standard output records
       previously saved in a file. This file can be either the one
       specified by the <b>-f </b>flag or, by default, the standard system
       activity daily data file.  It is also possible to enter <b>-1</b>, <b>-2</b>
       etc. as an argument to <b>sar </b>to display data of that days ago. For
       example, <b>-1 </b>will point at the standard system activity file of
       yesterday.

       Standard system activity daily data files are named <i>saDD</i> or
       <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, where <i>YYYY</i> stands for the current year, <i>MM</i> for the
       current month and <i>DD</i> for the current day. They are the default
       files used by <b>sar </b>only when no filename has been explicitly
       specified.  When used to write data to files (with its option
       <b>-o</b>), <b>sar </b>will use <i>saYYYYMMDD</i> if option <b>-D </b>has also been
       specified, else it will use <i>saDD</i>.  When used to display the
       records previously saved in a file, <b>sar </b>will look for the most
       recent of <i>saDD</i> and <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, and use it.

       Standard system activity daily data files are located in the
       <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory by default. Yet it is possible to specify
       an alternate location for them: If a directory (instead of a
       plain file) is used with options <b>-f </b>or <b>-o </b>then it will be
       considered as the directory containing the data files.

       Without the <b>-P </b>flag, the <b>sar </b>command reports system-wide (global
       among all processors) statistics, which are calculated as
       averages for values expressed as percentages, and as sums
       otherwise. If the <b>-P </b>flag is given, the <b>sar </b>command reports
       activity which relates to the specified processor or processors.
       If <b>-P ALL </b>is given, the <b>sar </b>command reports statistics for each
       individual processor and global statistics among all processors.
       Offline processors are not displayed.

       You can select information about specific system activities using
       flags. Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
       Specifying the <b>-A </b>flag selects all possible activities.

       The default version of the <b>sar </b>command (CPU utilization report)
       might be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin
       system activity investigation, because it monitors major system
       resources. If CPU utilization is near 100 percent (user + nice +
       system), the workload sampled is CPU-bound.

       If multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is
       convenient to specify an output file for the <b>sar </b>command. Run the
       <b>sar </b>command as a background process. The syntax for this is:

       <b>sar -o </b><i>datafile interval count</i> <b>&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</b>

       All data are captured in binary form and saved to a file
       (<i>datafile</i>).  The data can then be selectively displayed with the
       <b>sar </b>command using the <b>-f </b>option. Set the <i>interval</i> and <i>count</i>
       parameters to select <i>count</i> records at <i>interval</i> second intervals.
       If the <i>count</i> parameter is not set, all the records saved in the
       file will be selected.  Collection of data in this manner is
       useful to characterize system usage over a period of time and
       determine peak usage hours.

       Note: The <b>sar </b>command only reports on local activities.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-A     </b>This is equivalent to specifying <b>-bBdFHISvwWy -m ALL -n</b>
              <b>ALL -q ALL -r ALL -u ALL</b>.  This option also implies
              specifying <b>-I ALL -P ALL </b>unless these options are
              explicitly set on the command line.

       <b>-B     </b>Report paging statistics.  The following values are
              displayed:

              pgpgin/s
                     Total number of kilobytes the system paged in from
                     disk per second.

              pgpgout/s
                     Total number of kilobytes the system paged out to
                     disk per second.

              fault/s
                     Number of page faults (major + minor) made by the
                     system per second.  This is not a count of page
                     faults that generate I/O, because some page faults
                     can be resolved without I/O.

              majflt/s
                     Number of major faults the system has made per
                     second, those which have required loading a memory
                     page from disk.

              pgfree/s
                     Number of pages placed on the free list by the
                     system per second.

              pgscank/s
                     Number of pages scanned by the kswapd daemon per
                     second.

              pgscand/s
                     Number of pages scanned directly per second.

              pgsteal/s
                     Number of pages the system has reclaimed from cache
                     (pagecache and swapcache) per second to satisfy its
                     memory demands.

              pgprom/s
                     Number of pages promoted (i.e. migrated from slow
                     to fast memory types) by the system per second.

              pgdem/s
                     Number of pages demoted (i.e. migrated from fast to
                     slow memory types) by the system per second.

       <b>-b     </b>Report I/O and transfer rate statistics. The following
              values are displayed:

              tps    Total number of transfers per second that were
                     issued to physical devices.  A transfer is an I/O
                     request to a physical device. Multiple logical
                     requests can be combined into a single I/O request
                     to the device.  A transfer is of indeterminate
                     size.

              rtps   Total number of read requests per second issued to
                     physical devices.

              wtps   Total number of write requests per second issued to
                     physical devices.

              dtps   Total number of discard requests per second issued
                     to physical devices.

              bread/s
                     Total amount of data read from the devices in
                     blocks per second.  Blocks are equivalent to
                     sectors and therefore have a size of 512 bytes.

              bwrtn/s
                     Total amount of data written to devices in blocks
                     per second.

              bdscd/s
                     Total amount of data discarded for devices in
                     blocks per second.

       <b>-C     </b>When reading data from a file, tell <b>sar </b>to display
              comments that have been inserted by <b>sadc</b>.

       <b>-D     </b>Use <i>saYYYYMMDD</i> instead of <i>saDD</i> as the standard system
              activity daily data file name. This option works only when
              used in conjunction with option <b>-o </b>to save data to file.

       <b>-d     </b>Report activity for each block device.  When data are
              displayed, the device name is displayed as it (should)
              appear in <i>/dev</i>.  <b>sar </b>uses data in <i>/sys</i> to determine the
              device name based on its major and minor numbers.  If this
              name resolution fails, <b>sar </b>will use name mapping
              controlled by <i>/etc/sysconfig/sysstat.ioconf</i> file.
              Persistent device names can also be printed if option <b>-j</b>
              is used (see below). Statistics for all devices are
              displayed unless a restricted list is specified using
              option <b>--dev= </b>(see corresponding option entry).  Note that
              disk activity depends on <b>sadc</b>'s options <b>-S DISK </b>and <b>-S</b>
              <b>XDISK </b>to be collected. The following values are displayed:

              tps    Total number of transfers per second that were
                     issued to physical devices.  A transfer is an I/O
                     request to a physical device. Multiple logical
                     requests can be combined into a single I/O request
                     to the device.  A transfer is of indeterminate
                     size.

              rkB/s  Number of kilobytes read from the device per
                     second.

              wkB/s  Number of kilobytes written to the device per
                     second.

              dkB/s  Number of kilobytes discarded for the device per
                     second.

              areq-sz
                     The average size (in kilobytes) of the I/O requests
                     that were issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as
                     avgrq-sz and was expressed in sectors.

              aqu-sz The average queue length of the requests that were
                     issued to the device.
                     Note: In previous versions, this field was known as
                     avgqu-sz.

              await  The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests
                     issued to the device to be served. This includes
                     the time spent by the requests in queue and the
                     time spent servicing them.

              %util  Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O
                     requests were issued to the device (bandwidth
                     utilization for the device). Device saturation
                     occurs when this value is close to 100% for devices
                     serving requests serially. But for devices serving
                     requests in parallel, such as RAID arrays and
                     modern SSDs, this number does not reflect their
                     performance limits.

       <b>--dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 }</b>
              Specify the number of decimal places to use (0 to 2,
              default value is 2).

       <b>--dev=</b><i>dev_list</i>
              Specify the block devices for which statistics are to be
              displayed by <b>sar</b>.  <i>dev_list</i> is a list of comma-separated
              device names.

       <b>-e [ </b><i>hh</i><b>:</b><i>mm</i><b>[:</b><i>ss</i><b>] ]</b>
       <b>-e [ </b><i>seconds_since_the_epoch</i> <b>]</b>
              Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time
              is 18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format, or as
              the number of seconds since the epoch (given as a 10 digit
              number).  This option can be used when data are read from
              or written to a file (options <b>-f </b>or <b>-o</b>).

       <b>-F [ MOUNT ]</b>
              Display statistics for currently mounted filesystems.
              Pseudo-filesystems are ignored. At the end of the report,
              <b>sar </b>will display a summary of all those filesystems. Use
              of the <b>MOUNT </b>parameter keyword indicates that mountpoint
              will be reported instead of filesystem device. Statistics
              for all filesystems are displayed unless a restricted list
              is specified using option <b>--fs= </b>(see corresponding option
              entry).  Note that filesystems statistics depend on <b>sadc</b>'s
              option <b>-S XDISK </b>to be collected.

              The following values are displayed:

              MBfsfree
                     Total amount of free space in megabytes (including
                     space available only to privileged user).

              MBfsused
                     Total amount of space used in megabytes.

              %fsused
                     Percentage of filesystem space used, as seen by a
                     privileged user.

              %ufsused
                     Percentage of filesystem space used, as seen by an
                     unprivileged user.

              Ifree  Total number of free file nodes in filesystem.

              Iused  Total number of file nodes used in filesystem.

              %Iused Percentage of file nodes used in filesystem.

       <b>-f [ </b><i>filename</i> <b>]</b>
              Extract records from <i>filename</i> (created by the <b>-o </b><i>filename</i>
              flag). The default value of the <i>filename</i> parameter is the
              current standard system activity daily data file. If
              <i>filename</i> is a directory instead of a plain file then it is
              considered as the directory where the standard system
              activity daily data files are located. Option <b>-f </b>is
              exclusive of option <b>-o</b>.

       <b>--fs=</b><i>fs_list</i>
              Specify the filesystems for which statistics are to be
              displayed by <b>sar</b>.  <i>fs_list</i> is a list of comma-separated
              filesystem names or mountpoints.

       <b>-H     </b>Report hugepages utilization statistics.  The following
              values are displayed:

              kbhugfree
                     Amount of hugepages memory in kilobytes that is not
                     yet allocated.

              kbhugused
                     Amount of hugepages memory in kilobytes that has
                     been allocated.

              %hugused
                     Percentage of total hugepages memory that has been
                     allocated.

              kbhugrsvd
                     Amount of reserved hugepages memory in kilobytes.

              kbhugsurp
                     Amount of surplus hugepages memory in kilobytes.

       <b>-h     </b>This option is equivalent to specifying <b>--pretty --human</b>.

       <b>--help </b>Display a short help message then exit.

       <b>--human</b>
              Print sizes in human readable format (e.g. 1.0k, 1.2M,
              etc.)  The units displayed with this option supersede any
              other default units (e.g.  kilobytes, sectors...)
              associated with the metrics.

       <b>-I [ SUM | ALL ]</b>
              Report statistics for interrupts. The values displayed are
              the number of interrupts per second for the given
              processor or among all processors.  A list of interrupts
              can be specified using <b>--int= </b>(see this option). The <b>SUM</b>
              keyword indicates that the total number of interrupts
              received per second is to be displayed. The <b>ALL </b>keyword
              indicates that statistics from all interrupts are to be
              reported (this is the default).  Note that interrupts
              statistics depend on <b>sadc</b>'s option <b>-S INT </b>to be collected.

       <b>-i </b><i>interval</i>
              Select data records at seconds as close as possible to the
              number specified by the <i>interval</i> parameter.

       <b>--iface=</b><i>iface_list</i>
              Specify the network interfaces for which statistics are to
              be displayed by <b>sar</b>.  <i>iface_list</i> is a list of comma-
              separated interface names.

       <b>--int=</b><i>int_list</i>
              Specify the interrupts names for which statistics are to
              be displayed by <b>sar</b>.  <i>int_list</i> is a list of comma-
              separated values or range of values (e.g., <b>0-16,35,40-</b>).

       <b>-j { SID | ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... }</b>
              Display persistent device names. Use this option in
              conjunction with option <b>-d</b>. Keywords <b>ID</b>, <b>LABEL</b>, etc.
              specify the type of the persistent name. These keywords
              are not limited, only prerequisite is that directory with
              required persistent names is present in <i>/dev/disk</i>.
              Keyword <b>SID </b>tries to get a stable identifier to use as the
              device name. A stable identifier won't change across
              reboots for the same physical device. If it exists, this
              identifier is normally the WWN (World Wide Name) of the
              device, as read from the <i>/dev/disk/by-id</i> directory.

              MEM keywords together and therefore all the pressure-stall
              statistics are reported.

              The <b>ALL </b>keyword is equivalent to specifying all the
              keywords above and therefore all the statistics are
              reported.

       <b>-r [ ALL ]</b>
              Report memory utilization statistics. The <b>ALL </b>keyword
              indicates that all the memory fields should be displayed.
              The following values may be displayed:

              kbmemfree
                     Amount of free memory available in kilobytes.

              kbavail
                     Estimate of how much memory in kilobytes is
                     available for starting new applications, without
                     swapping.  The estimate takes into account that the
                     system needs some page cache to function well, and
                     that not all reclaimable slab will be reclaimable,
                     due to items being in use. The impact of those
                     factors will vary from system to system.

              kbmemused
                     Amount of used memory in kilobytes (calculated as
                     total installed memory - kbmemfree - kbbuffers -
                     kbcached - kbslab).

              %memused
                     Percentage of used memory.

              kbbuffers
                     Amount of memory used as buffers by the kernel in
                     kilobytes.

              kbcached
                     Amount of memory used to cache data by the kernel
                     in kilobytes.

              kbcommit
                     Amount of memory in kilobytes needed for current
                     workload.  This is an estimate of how much RAM/swap
                     is needed to guarantee that there never is out of
                     memory.

              %commit
                     Percentage of memory needed for current workload in
                     relation to the total amount of memory (RAM+swap).
                     This number may be greater than 100% because the
                     kernel usually overcommits memory.

              kbactive
                     Amount of active memory in kilobytes (memory that
                     has been used more recently and usually not
                     reclaimed unless absolutely necessary).

              kbinact
                     Amount of inactive memory in kilobytes (memory
                     which has been less recently used. It is more
                     eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes).

              kbdirty
                     Amount of memory in kilobytes waiting to get
                     written back to the disk.

              kbanonpg
                     Amount of non-file backed pages in kilobytes mapped
                     into userspace page tables.

              kbslab Amount of memory in kilobytes used by the kernel to
                     cache data structures for its own use.

              kbkstack
                     Amount of memory in kilobytes used for kernel stack
                     space.

              kbpgtbl
                     Amount of memory in kilobytes dedicated to the
                     lowest level of page tables.

              kbvmused
                     Amount of memory in kilobytes of used virtual
                     address space.

       <b>-S     </b>Report swap space utilization statistics.  The following
              values are displayed:

              kbswpfree
                     Amount of free swap space in kilobytes.

              kbswpused
                     Amount of used swap space in kilobytes.

              %swpused
                     Percentage of used swap space.

              kbswpcad
                     Amount of cached swap memory in kilobytes.  This is
                     memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back
                     in but still also is in the swap area (if memory is
                     needed it doesn't need to be swapped out again
                     because it is already in the swap area. This saves
                     I/O).

              %swpcad
                     Percentage of cached swap memory in relation to the
                     amount of used swap space.

       <b>-s [ </b><i>hh</i><b>:</b><i>mm</i><b>[:</b><i>ss</i><b>] ]</b>
       <b>-s [ </b><i>seconds_since_the_epoch</i> <b>]</b>
              Set the starting time of the data, causing the <b>sar </b>command
              to extract records time-tagged at, or following, the time
              specified. The default starting time is 08:00:00.  Hours
              must be given in 24-hour format, or as the number of
              seconds since the epoch (given as a 10 digit number). This
              option can be used only when data are read from a file
              (option <b>-f</b>).

       <b>--sadc </b>Indicate which data collector is called by <b>sar</b>.  If the
              data collector is sought in <b>PATH </b>then enter "which sadc"
              to know where it is located.

       <b>-t     </b>When reading data from a daily data file, indicate that
              <b>sar </b>should display the timestamps in the original local
              time of the data file creator. Without this option, the
              <b>sar </b>command displays the timestamps in the user's local
              time.

       <b>-u [ ALL ]</b>
              Report CPU utilization. The <b>ALL </b>keyword indicates that all
              the CPU fields should be displayed.  The report may show
              the following fields:

              %user  Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
                     executing at the user level (application). Note
                     that this field includes time spent running virtual

                     Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
                     executing at the system level (kernel). Note that
                     this field includes time spent servicing hardware
                     and software interrupts.

              %sys   Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while
                     executing at the system level (kernel). Note that
                     this field does NOT include time spent servicing
                     hardware or software interrupts.

              %iowait
                     Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle
                     during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O
                     request.

              %steal Percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by the

</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sar </b>command takes into account the following environment
       variables:

       <b>S_COLORS</b>
              By default statistics are displayed in color when the
              output is connected to a terminal.  Use this variable to
              change the settings. Possible values for this variable are
              <i>never</i>, <i>always</i> or <i>auto</i> (the latter is equivalent to the
              default settings).
              Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some
              other color) used to display a value is not indicative of
              any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only
              indicates different ranges of values.

       <b>S_COLORS_SGR</b>
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display
              statistics on the terminal.  Its value is a colon-
              separated list of capabilities that defaults to
              <b>C=33;22:I=32;22:N=34;1:R=31;22:W=35;1:X=31;1:Z=34;22</b>.
              Supported capabilities are:

              <b>C=     </b>SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for
                     comments inserted in the binary daily data files.

              <b>I=     </b>SGR substring for item names or values (eg. network
                     interfaces, CPU number...)

              <b>N=     </b>SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

              <b>R=     </b>SGR substring for restart messages.

              <b>W= </b>(or <b>M=</b>)
                     SGR substring for percentage values in the range
                     from 75% to 90% (or in the range 10% to 25%
                     depending on the metric's meaning).  It is also
                     used for negative values in the range from -10 to
                     -5.

              <b>X= </b>(or <b>H=</b>)
                     SGR substring for percentage values greater than or
                     equal to 90% (or lower than or equal to 10%
                     depending on the metric's meaning).  It is also
                     used for negative values lower than or equal to
                     -10.

              <b>Z=     </b>SGR substring for zero values.

       <b>S_REPEAT_HEADER</b>
              This variable contains the maximum number of lines after
              which a header has to be displayed by <b>sar </b>when the output
              is not a terminal.

       <b>S_TIME_DEF_TIME</b>
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>UTC </b>then <b>sar </b>will
              save its data in UTC time (data will still be displayed in
              local time).  <b>sar </b>will also use UTC time instead of local
              time to determine the current daily data file located in
              the <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory. This variable may be useful for
              servers with users located across several timezones.

       <b>S_TIME_FORMAT</b>
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>ISO </b>then the
              current locale will be ignored when printing the date in
              the report header.  The <b>sar </b>command will use the ISO 8601
              format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp will also be
              compliant with ISO 8601 format.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sar -u 2 5</b>
              Report CPU utilization for each 2 seconds. 5 lines are
              displayed.

       <b>sar -I --int=14 -o int14.file 2 10</b>
              Report statistics on IRQ 14 for each 2 seconds. 10 lines
              are displayed.  Data are stored in a file called
              <i>int14.file</i>.

       <b>sar -r -n DEV -f /var/log/sa/sa16</b>
              Display memory and network statistics saved in daily data
              file <i>sa16</i>.

       <b>sar -A </b>Display all the statistics saved in current daily data
              file.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc</i> filesystem must be mounted for the <b>sar </b>command to work.

       All the statistics are not necessarily available, depending on
       the kernel version used.  <b>sar </b>assumes that you are using at least
       a 2.6 kernel.

       Although <b>sar </b>speaks of kilobytes (kB), megabytes (MB)..., it
       actually uses kibibytes (kiB), mebibytes (MiB)...  A kibibyte is
       equal to 1024 bytes, and a mebibyte is equal to 1024 kibibytes.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/var/log/sa/saDD</i>
       <i>/var/log/sa/saYYYYMMDD</i>
              The standard system activity daily data files and their
              default location.  <i>YYYY</i> stands for the current year, <i>MM</i>
              for the current month and <i>DD</i> for the current day.

       <i>/proc</i> and <i>/sys</i> contain various files with system statistics.
