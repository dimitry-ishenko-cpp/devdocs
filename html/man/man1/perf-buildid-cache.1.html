NAME </h2>
<pre>
       perf-buildid-cache - Manage build-id cache.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>perf buildid-cache &lt;options&gt;</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This command manages the build-id cache. It can add, remove,
       update and purge files to/from the cache. In the future it should
       as well set upper limits for the space used by the cache, etc.
       This also scans the target binary for SDT (Statically Defined
       Tracing) and record it along with the buildid-cache, which will
       be used by perf-probe. For more details, see <a href="perf-probe.1.html">perf-probe(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -a, --add=
           Add specified file to the cache.

       -f, --force
           Don’t complain, do it.

       -k, --kcore
           Add specified kcore file to the cache. For the current host
           that is /proc/kcore which requires root permissions to read.
           Be aware that running <i>perf buildid-cache</i> as root may update
           root’s build-id cache not the user’s. Use the -v option to
           see where the file is created. Note that the copied file
           contains only code sections not the whole core image. Note
           also that files "kallsyms" and "modules" must also be in the
           same directory and are also copied. All 3 files are created
           with read permissions for root only. kcore will not be added
           if there is already a kcore in the cache (with the same
           build-id) that has the same modules at the same addresses.
           Use the -v option to see if a copy of kcore is actually made.

       -r, --remove=
           Remove a cached binary which has same build-id of specified
           file from the cache.

       -p, --purge=
           Purge all cached binaries including older caches which have
           specified path from the cache.

       -P, --purge-all
           Purge all cached binaries. This will flush out entire cache.

       -M, --missing=
           List missing build ids in the cache for the specified file.

       -u, --update=
           Update specified file of the cache. Note that this doesn’t
           remove older entries since those may be still needed for
           annotating old (or remote) perf.data. Only if there is
           already a cache which has exactly same build-id, that is
           replaced by new one. It can be used to update kallsyms and
           kernel dso to vmlinux in order to support annotation.

       -l, --list
           List all valid binaries from cache.

       -v, --verbose
           Be more verbose.

       --target-ns=PID: Obtain mount namespace information from the
       target pid. This is used when creating a uprobe for a process
       that resides in a different mount namespace from the perf(1)
       utility.

       --debuginfod[=URLs]
           Specify debuginfod URL to be used when retrieving perf.data
           binaries, it follows the same syntax as the DEBUGINFOD_URLS
           variable, like:

               buildid-cache.debuginfod=http://192.168.122.174:8002

               If the URLs is not specified, the value of DEBUGINFOD_URLS
               system environment variable is used.
