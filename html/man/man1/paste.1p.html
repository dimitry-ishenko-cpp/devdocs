PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       paste — merge corresponding or subsequent lines of files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       paste <b>[</b>-s<b>] [</b>-d <i>list</i><b>] </b><i>file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>paste</i> utility shall concatenate the corresponding lines of
       the given input files, and write the resulting lines to standard
       output.

       The default operation of <i>paste</i> shall concatenate the
       corresponding lines of the input files. The &lt;newline&gt; of every
       line except the line from the last input file shall be replaced
       with a &lt;tab&gt;.

       If an end-of-file condition is detected on one or more input
       files, but not all input files, <i>paste</i> shall behave as though
       empty lines were read from the files on which end-of-file was
       detected, unless the <b>-s </b>option is specified.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>paste</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-d </b><i>list</i>   Unless a &lt;backslash&gt; character appears in <i>list</i>, each
                 character in <i>list</i> is an element specifying a delimiter
                 character. If a &lt;backslash&gt; character appears in <i>list</i>,
                 the &lt;backslash&gt; character and one or more characters
                 following it are an element specifying a delimiter
                 character as described below. These elements specify
                 one or more delimiters to use, instead of the default
                 &lt;tab&gt;, to replace the &lt;newline&gt; of the input lines. The
                 elements in <i>list</i> shall be used circularly; that is,
                 when the list is exhausted the first element from the
                 list is reused. When the <b>-s </b>option is specified:

                  *  The last &lt;newline&gt; in a file shall not be modified.

                  *  The delimiter shall be reset to the first element
                     of <i>list</i> after each <i>file</i> operand is processed.

                 When the <b>-s </b>option is not specified:

                  *  The &lt;newline&gt; characters in the file specified by
                     the last <i>file</i> operand shall not be modified.

                  *  The delimiter shall be reset to the first element
                     of list each time a line is processed from each
                     file.

                 If a &lt;backslash&gt; character appears in <i>list</i>, it and the
                 character following it shall be used to represent the
                 following delimiter characters:

                 \n    &lt;newline&gt;.

                 \t    &lt;tab&gt;.

                 \\    &lt;backslash&gt; character.

                 \0    Empty string (not a null character). If <b>'\0' </b>is
                       immediately followed by the character <b>'x'</b>, the
                       character <b>'X'</b>, or any character defined by the
                       <i>LC_CTYPE</i> <b>digit </b>keyword (see the Base Definitions
                       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 7</i>, <i>Locale</i>), the
                       results are unspecified.

                 If any other characters follow the &lt;backslash&gt;, the
                 results are unspecified.

       <b>-s        </b>Concatenate all of the lines from each input file into
                 one line of output per file, in command line order. The
                 &lt;newline&gt; of every line except the last line in each
                 input file shall be replaced with a &lt;tab&gt;, unless
                 otherwise specified by the <b>-d </b>option. If an input file
                 is empty, the output line corresponding to that file
                 shall consist of only a &lt;newline&gt; character.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of an input file. If <b>'-' </b>is specified for
                 one or more of the <i>file</i>s, the standard input shall be
                 used; the standard input shall be read one line at a
                 time, circularly, for each instance of <b>'-'</b>.
                 Implementations shall support pasting of at least 12
                 <i>file</i> operands.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if one or more <i>file</i>
       operands is <b>'-'</b>.  See the INPUT FILES section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be text files, except that line lengths
       shall be unlimited.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>paste</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Concatenated lines of input files shall be separated by the &lt;tab&gt;
       (or other characters under the control of the <b>-d </b>option) and
       terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If one or more input files cannot be opened when the <b>-s </b>option is
       not specified, a diagnostic message shall be written to standard
       error, but no output is written to standard output. If the <b>-s</b>
       option is specified, the <i>paste</i> utility shall provide the default
       behavior described in <i>Section 1.4</i>, <i>Utility Description Defaults</i>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       When the escape sequences of the <i>list</i> option-argument are used in
       a shell script, they must be quoted; otherwise, the shell treats
       the &lt;backslash&gt; as a special character.

       Conforming applications should only use the specific
       &lt;backslash&gt;-escaped delimiters presented in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. Historical implementations treat <b>'\x'</b>, where <b>'x' </b>is
       not in this list, as <b>'x'</b>, but future implementations are free to
       expand this list to recognize other common escapes similar to
       those accepted by <i>printf</i> and other standard utilities.

       Most of the standard utilities work on text files. The <i>cut</i>
       utility can be used to turn files with arbitrary line lengths
       into a set of text files containing the same data. The <i>paste</i>
       utility can be used to create (or recreate) files with arbitrary
       line lengths. For example, if <i>file</i> contains long lines:

           cut -b 1-500 -n file &gt; file1
           cut -b 501- -n file &gt; file2

       creates <b>file1 </b>(a text file) with lines no longer than 500 bytes
       (plus the &lt;newline&gt;) and <b>file2 </b>that contains the remainder of the
       data from <i>file</i>.  Note that <b>file2 </b>is not a text file if there are
       lines in <i>file</i> that are longer than 500 + {LINE_MAX} bytes. The
       original file can be recreated from <b>file1 </b>and <b>file2 </b>using the
       command:

           paste -d "\0" file1 file2 &gt; file

       The commands:

           paste -d "\0" ...
           paste -d "" ...

       are not necessarily equivalent; the latter is not specified by
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 and may result in an error. The
       construct <b>'\0' </b>is used to mean ``no separator'' because
       historical versions of <i>paste</i> did not follow the syntax
       guidelines, and the command:

           paste -d"" ...

       could not be handled properly by <i>getopt</i>().
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. Write out a directory in four columns:

               ls | paste - - - -

        2. Combine pairs of lines from a file into single lines:

               paste -s -d "\t\n" file
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
