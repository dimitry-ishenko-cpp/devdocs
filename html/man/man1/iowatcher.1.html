NAME </h2>
<pre>
       iowatcher - Create visualizations from blktrace results
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>iowatcher </b><i>[options]</i> [--] <i>[program arguments ...]</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       iowatcher graphs the results of a blktrace run.  It can graph the
       result of an existing blktrace, start a new blktrace, or start a
       new blktrace and a benchmark run.  It can then create an image or
       movie of the IO from a given trace.  iowatcher can produce either
       SVG files or movies in mp4 format (with ffmpeg) or ogg format
       (with png2theora).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b>Print a brief usage summary.

       <b>-d, --device </b><i>device</i>
              Controls which device you are tracing.  You can only trace
              one device at a time for now.  It is sent directly to
              blktrace, and only needed when you are making a new trace.

       <b>-D, --blktrace-destination </b><i>destination</i>
              Destination for blktrace.

       <b>-p, --prog</b>
              Run a program while blktrace is run. The program and its
              arguments must be specified after all other options.  Note
              that this option previously required the program to be
              given as a single argument but it now tells <b>iowatcher </b>to
              expect extra arguments which it should be run during the
              trace.

       <b>--     </b>End option parsing. If <b>--prog </b>is specified, everything
              after <b>-- </b>is the program to be run. This can be useful if
              the program name could otherwise be mistaken for an
              option.

       <b>-K, --keep-movie-svgs</b>
              Keep the SVG files generated for movie mode.

       <b>-t, --trace </b><i>path</i>
              Specify the name of the file or directory in which
              blktrace output is located.  <b>iowatcher </b>uses a dump from
              blkparse, so this option tries to guess the name of the
              corresponding per-CPU blktrace data files if the dump file
              doesn't already exist.  To add multiple traces to a given
              graph, you can specify <b>--trace </b>more than once.  If <i>path</i> is
              a directory, <b>iowatcher </b>will use the name of the directory
              as the base name of the dump file and all trace files
              found inside the directory will be processed.

       <b>-l, --label </b><i>label</i>
              Sets a label in the graph for a trace file.  The labels
              are added in the same order as the trace files.

       <b>-m, --movie </b><i>[style]</i>
              Create a movie.  The file format depends on the extension
              used in the <b>-o </b><i>file</i> option.  If you specify an .ogv or
              .ogg extension, the result will be Ogg Theora video, if
              png2theora is available.  If you use an .mp4 extension,
              the result will be an mp4 video if ffmpeg is available.
              You can use any other extension, but the end result will
              be an mp4.  The accepted <i>style</i> values are <b>spindle </b>for a
              circular disc-like effect (default) or <b>rect </b>for a
              rectangular graph style.

       <b>-T, --title </b><i>title</i>
              Set a <i>title</i> to be placed at the top of the graph.

       <b>-o, --output </b><i>file</i>
              Output filename for the SVG image or video. The video
              format used will depend on the file name extension. See
              <b>--movie </b>for details.

       <b>-r, --rolling </b><i>seconds</i>
              Control the duration for the rolling average.  <b>iowatcher</b>
              tries to smooth out bumpy graphs by averaging the current
              second with seconds from the past.  Larger numbers here
              give you flatter graphs.

       <b>-h, --height </b><i>height</i>
              Set the height of each graph

       <b>-w, --width </b><i>width</i>
              Set the width of each graph

       <b>-c, --columns </b><i>columns</i>
              Number of columns in graph output

       <b>-x, --xzoom </b><i>min:max</i>
              Limit processed time range to <i>min:max</i>.

       <b>-y, --yzoom </b><i>min:max</i>
              Limit processed sectors to <i>min:max</i>.

       <b>-a, --io-plot-action </b><i>action</i>
              Plot <i>action</i> (one of Q, D, or C) in the IO graph.

       <b>-P, --per-process-io</b>
              Distinguish between processes in the IO graph.

       <b>-O, --only-graph </b><i>graph</i>
              Add a single graph to the output (see section <b>GRAPHS </b>for
              options).  By default all graphs are included. Use <b>-O </b>to
              generate only the required graphs.  <b>-O </b>may be used more
              than once.

       <b>-N, --no-graph </b><i>type</i>
              Remove a single graph from the output (see section <b>GRAPHS</b>
              for options).  This option may be used more than once.
</pre> <h2>
GRAPHS </h2>
<pre>
       Values accepted by the <b>-O </b>and <b>-N </b>options are:

          io, tput, latency, queue_depth, iops, cpu-sys, cpu-io, cpu-
       irq, cpu-user, cpu-soft
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Generate graph from the existing trace.dump:

              # iowatcher -t trace

       Skip the IO graph:

              # iowatcher -t trace.dump -o trace.svg -N io

       Only graph tput and latency:

              # iowatcher -t trace.dump -o trace.svg -O tput -O latency

       Generate a graph from two runs, and label them:

              # iowatcher -t ext4.dump -t xfs.dump -l Ext4 -l XFS -o
              trace.svg

       Run a fio benchmark and store the trace in trace.dump, add a
       title to the top, use /dev/sda for blktrace:

              # iowatcher -d /dev/sda -t trace.dump -T 'Fio Benchmark'
              -p fio some_job_file

       Make a movie from an existing trace:

              # iowatcher -t trace --movie -o trace.mp4
