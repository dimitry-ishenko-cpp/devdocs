NAME </h2>
<pre>
       yum verify plugin
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum </b>[options] verify [package ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This plugin extends <b>yum </b>with some commands that give verification
       information on the installed system, much like rpm -V. You can
       change how the verification is done and which files it applies
       to. In case any mismatches are found, the exit status is set to
       1.

       added yum <i>command</i>s are:
        * verify
        * verify-rpm
        * verify-all

       all of which take the same arguments as the list yum command. You
       can only verify packages that are installed on the system.

       <b>verify </b>Is the generic verification command, and is intended to
              give the most useful output. It removes all false matches
              due to multilib and ignores changes to configuration files
              by default.

       <b>verify-rpm</b>
              Does the same checks as rpm -V.

       <b>verify-all</b>
              Is used to list all the differences, including some that
              rpm itself will ignore.
</pre> <h2>
GENERAL OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       These are the options added to yum that are available in the
       verify commands.  They are:

       <b>--verify-filenames</b>
              This option is used to limit the filenames that the
              packages will perform verification.

       <b>--verify-configuration-files</b>
              This option is only useful in the generic verify command,
              and will enable/disable verification of files that are
              tagged as configuration files.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To do the same as rpm -Va, use:

              yum verify-rpm

       To verify the packages starting with the name yum, use:

              yum verify 'yum*'

       To verify the binaries that are in a bin directory, use:

              yum verify --verify-filenames='*bin/*'

       To verify all include files, Eg. for multilib problems, use:

              yum verify-all --verify-filenames='/usr/include/*'

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Currently yum-verify does not do verify-script checking or dependency checking,
       only file checking.
