DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) includes a number of core
       components that are likely to be pre-configured and operational,
       but it also includes a larger number of components that are not
       active by default.  In the context of <b>pmcheck </b>these components
       cover services that are typically started as part of the system
       boot procedure, e.g.  <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>, <a href="pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a>, etc. or
       optional Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs) that augment
       the available performance metrics exported by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.

       <b>pmcheck </b>allows the interrogation of the state of components with
       the <b>-s</b>, <b>--state </b>option.  Components can be activated with the <b>-a</b>,
       <b>--activate </b>option, or deactivated with the <b>-d</b>, <b>--deactivate</b>
       option.  These three options are clearly mutually exclusive for
       any single execution of <b>pmcheck</b>, and in the absence of any of
       them <b>-s </b>is assumed to be the default.

       The set of components to be interrogated or configured are
       specified by the <i>component</i> name(s) from the command line, else
       all known components in the absence of any <i>component</i> arguments.
       When one or more <i>component</i> arguments are specified, these may
       optionally be <b>sh</b>(1) (glob) patterns that are matched against the
       names of the known components.

       The <b>-l</b>, <b>--list </b>option reports on known components.  With one or
       more <i>components</i> each is reported.  Without any <i>component</i>
       arguments the <i>-l</i> option lists all known components, which is
       simply all the component scripts (see the <b>COMPONENT SCRIPTS</b>
       section below) stored in the <i>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/pmcheck</i>
       directory.  If the <b>-v </b>option is also used, a short description of
       each requested component is also displayed.

       Additional components can be integrated into the <b>pmcheck</b>
       framework, and the <b>-c</b>, <b>--file </b>option allows an alternate <b>sh</b>(1)
       <i>script</i> to be used instead of a script associated with a known
       <i>component</i>.

       In concert with the <b>-a </b>or <b>-d </b>options, the <b>-n</b>, <b>--show-me </b>option
       performs a dry run, showing the <b>sh</b>(1) commands that would be
       needed to perform the reconfiguration, but no reconfiguration is
       done.  Commands that need to be run as ``root'' are prefixed with
       <b># </b>and other commands are prefixed with <b>$</b>.

       The <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose </b>option increases reporting verbosity.

       The <b>-x</b>, <b>--trace </b>option may be used specify that the component
       scripts are run with <b>-x </b>option to <b>sh</b>(1).  This can assist with
       debugging the failure of a component script or during the
       development of a new component script, probably also involving
       the <b>-c </b>option to <b>pmcheck</b>.

       The <b>-?</b>, <b>--help </b>option displays a usage message.

       As a convience, <b>pmcheck .  </b>is an alias for <b>pcp-check</b>.
</pre> <h2>
COMPONENT SCRIPTS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pmcheck </b>framework is extensible, as the set of known
       components is defined by the names of the component scripts in
       the <i>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/pmcheck</i> directory.

       Each component script needs to abide by the following rules for
       correct integration with <b>pmcheck</b>:

       • The script will be run with <b>sh</b>(1), if you need some other
         scripting language then you must provide a <b>sh</b>(1) wrapper.
       • Since each script is responsible for one component, the name of
         the component is implied, however the name of the component is
         also passed from <b>pmcheck </b>as the sole argument after the
         options.  This allows generic component scripts to be
         implemented as hard links below <i>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/pmcheck</i>.
       • When called with a <b>-l</b>, <b>--list </b>option the script does nothing,
         unless it is also called with a <b>-v </b>option in which case a short
         description of the component is displayed on standard output.
       • When called with a <b>-s</b>, <b>--state </b>option, the script must exit
         with the an exit code that indicates the component's state,
         namely 0 (active), 1 (inactive, but <i>could</i> be activated by
         <b>pmcheck</b>), 2 (inactive and <i>cannot</i> be activated by <b>pmcheck</b>).  The
         distinction between exit codes 1 and 2 is based on many
         factors, but 1 usually means all of the required software
         packages (PCP and other) are installed, required prerequisite
         services are running or could be safely started, and any
         component configuration can assume default settings or can be
         reliably deduced, e.g. a port number for communications.
         Conversely, 2 means automatic activation of the component is
         not possible and some end-user intervention is required.
       • When called with a <b>-a</b>, <b>--activate </b>option the script must
         activate the component.  This means making any required
         configuration change so that it <i>is</i> restarted at the next system
         reboot or <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> restart, and starting the component if it is
         currently inactive,
       • When called with a <b>-d</b>, <b>--deactivate </b>option the script must
         deactivate the component.  This means stopping the component if
         it is currently active, and making any required configuration
         change so that it <i>is not</i> restarted at the next system reboot or
         <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> restart.
       • When called with a <b>-n</b>, <b>--show-me </b>option the script must perform
         a dry run and echo any required commands on standard output as
         per the rules described above for the <b>-n </b>option of <b>pmcheck</b>.
       • If a <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose </b>option is also specified, the script should
         provide explanatory text on standard output to help explain,
         particularly in cases where the component is not active or the
         reconfiguration failed.

       To assist with component script development, the file
       <i>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/checkproc.sh</i> may be sourced (after sourcing
       <i>$PCP_DIR/etc/pcp.env</i>).  <i>checkproc.sh</i> provides the following
       services:

       • A temporary directory is created and the shell variable <b>$tmp </b>is
         assigned to the full pathname of the directory.
       • The shell variable <b>$status </b>is used to return the exit status
         from the script [defaults to 0].
       • The shell variable <b>$component </b>is assigned to the associated
         component name.
       • The shell variable <b>$prog </b>is assigned to the script's basename
         (so the component name in the default case).
       • A <b>trap </b>is installed to cleanup <b>$tmp </b>and exit with <b>$status</b>.
       • A <b>_do_args </b>shell procedure that handles all command argument
         parsing.
       • Shell variables <b>$aflag</b>, <b>$dflag</b>, <b>$lflag </b>or <b>$sflag </b>have default
         values of <b>false </b>and are set to <b>true </b>by <b>_do_args </b>when the <b>-a</b>,
         <b>-d</b>, <b>-l </b>or <b>-s </b>options are parsed.
       • The shell variable <b>$show_me </b>has the default value of <b>false </b>and
         is set to <b>true </b>by <b>_do_args </b>when the <b>-n </b>option is parsed.
       • The shell variable <b>$verbose </b>counts number of <b>-v </b>options parsed
         by <b>_do_args</b>.
       • A <b>_ctl_svc </b>shell procedure that handles status requests and all
         reconfiguration operations for services that are managed by
         <a href="systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> or <a href="init.1.html">init(1)</a> or similar infrastructure layers.
         <b>_ctl_svc </b>takes 2 arguments, the first is an <i>action</i> (one of
         <b>state</b>, <b>start</b>, <b>stop</b>, <b>activate </b>(enable and start), or <b>deactivate</b>
         (stop and disable), and the second is the <i>name</i> of the
         component; for <a href="systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> managed components, <i>name</i> should be
         the basename of the service, e.g.  <b>pmcd </b>for the <b>pmcd.service</b>
         <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> unit, otherwise <i>name</i> is the name of the <a href="init.1.html">init(1)</a> or
         similar ``rc'' script.
       • <b>_ctl_svc </b>will return a value (via <b>$?  </b>when called from a shell
         script) that matches the exit codes defined above for each
         action.
       • A <b>_ctl_pmda </b>shell procedure that handles status requests and
         all reconfiguration operations for a PMDA that is connected to
         <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>.  <b>_ctl_pmda </b>takes at least 2 arguments, the first is an
         action (one of <b>state</b>, <b>activate </b>or <b>deactivate</b>, and the second
         argument is the name of the PMDA.  For the <b>install </b>action,
         there is a third argument for the name of the PMDA's executable
         or DSO and an optional fourth argument is the name of a file
         providing the input required for the PMDA's <i>Install</i> script
         (defaults to /dev/null).
       • <b>_ctl_pmda </b>will return a value (via <b>$?  </b>when called from a shell
         script) that matches the exit codes defined above for each
         action.

       So the following is the simplest possible component script for a
       system service.

       #!/bin/sh
       . $PCP_DIR/etc/pcp.env || exit 1
       . $PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/checkproc.sh
       _do_args "$@"
       if $lflag
       then
           [ $verbose -gt 0 ] &amp;&amp; echo "my description"
       elif $sflag
       then
           _ctl_svc state $component
           status=$?
       elif $aflag
       then
           _ctl_svc activate $component || status=1
       elif $dflag
       then
           _ctl_svc deactivate $component || status=1
       fi

       And the following is the simplest possible component script for a
       PMDA.

       #!/bin/sh
       . $PCP_DIR/etc/pcp.env || exit 1
       . $PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/checkproc.sh
       _do_args "$@"
       if $lflag
       then
           [ $verbose -gt 0 ] &amp;&amp; echo "my description"
       elif $sflag
       then
           _ctl_pmda state $component
           status=$?
       elif $aflag
       then
           _ctl_pmda activate $component || status=1
       elif $dflag
       then
           _ctl_pmda deactivate $component || status=1
       fi
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       For <b>pmcheck </b>(not the component scripts) the exit status is
       typically 0, but values of 9 or 99 indicate serious internal
       botches.

       When the <b>-a </b>or <b>-d </b>options are used, the success or failure of the
       reconfiguration is reported on standard output.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       Some components have prerequisites that demand additional non-PCP
       services be installed, configured and operational, e.g. a
       database server or a key-value server.  In these cases, probing
       the status of the non-PCP service may be subject to some access
       controls and if <b>pmcheck </b>is run as a non-root user, then the
       output from <b>-s </b>(the default) may be incomplete or misleading; in
       these circumstances, running <b>pmcheck </b>as root should provide a
       more accurate report.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
