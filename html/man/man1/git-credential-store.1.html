NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-credential-store - Helper to store credentials on disk
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       git config credential.helper 'store [&lt;options&gt;]'
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
           <b>Note</b>

           Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on
           disk, protected only by filesystem permissions. If this is
           not an acceptable security tradeoff, try
           <a href="git-credential-cache.1.html">git-credential-cache(1)</a>, or find a helper that integrates
           with secure storage provided by your operating system.

       This command stores credentials indefinitely on disk for use by
       future Git programs.

       You probably don’t want to invoke this command directly; it is
       meant to be used as a credential helper by other parts of git.
       See <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> or <b>EXAMPLES </b>below.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --file=&lt;path&gt;
           Use <b>&lt;path&gt; </b>to lookup and store credentials. The file will
           have its filesystem permissions set to prevent other users on
           the system from reading it, but it will not be encrypted or
           otherwise protected. If not specified, credentials will be
           searched for from <b>~/.git-credentials </b>and
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials</b>, and credentials will be
           written to <b>~/.git-credentials </b>if it exists, or
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials </b>if it exists and the former
           does not. See also the section called “FILES”.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       If not set explicitly with <b>--file</b>, there are two files where
       git-credential-store will search for credentials in order of
       precedence:

       ~/.git-credentials
           User-specific credentials file.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/credentials
           Second user-specific credentials file. If <i>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</i> is
           not set or empty, <b>$HOME/.config/git/credentials </b>will be used.
           Any credentials stored in this file will not be used if
           <b>~/.git-credentials </b>has a matching credential as well. It is a
           good idea not to create this file if you sometimes use older
           versions of Git that do not support it.

       For credential lookups, the files are read in the order given
       above, with the first matching credential found taking precedence
       over credentials found in files further down the list.

       Credential storage will by default write to the first existing
       file in the list. If none of these files exist,
       <b>~/.git-credentials </b>will be created and written to.

       When erasing credentials, matching credentials will be erased
       from all files.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you
       must type your username or password. For example:

           $ git config credential.helper store
           $ git push <a href="http://example.com/repo.git">http://example.com/repo.git</a>
           Username: &lt;type your username&gt;
           Password: &lt;type your password&gt;

           [several days later]
           $ git push <a href="http://example.com/repo.git">http://example.com/repo.git</a>
           [your credentials are used automatically]
</pre> <h2>
STORAGE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>.git-credentials </b>file is stored in plaintext. Each credential
       is stored on its own line as a URL like:

           https://user:pass@example.com

       No other kinds of lines (e.g. empty lines or comment lines) are
       allowed in the file, even though some may be silently ignored. Do
       not view or edit the file with editors.

       When Git needs authentication for a particular URL context,
       credential-store will consider that context a pattern to match
       against each entry in the credentials file. If the protocol,
       hostname, and username (if we already have one) match, then the
       password is returned to Git. See the discussion of configuration
       in <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> for more information.
