NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-edit - Edit a patch
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg edit</i> [OPTIONS] [patch]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Edit a patch. Various aspects of a patch may be edited, including
       the message, author, patch name, or even the patch’s diff.

       By default, the topmost patch is edited.

       With no options or when <i>--edit</i> is specified, the patch details
       are edited interactively. Alternatively, command line options may
       be used to modify the patch non-interactively.

       The <i>--diff</i> option causes the patch’s diff to be appended to the
       patch description when editing interactively. This diff may be
       edited interactively (or just used as a reference when editing
       the patch’s message). The StGit attempts to apply the modified
       diff to the patch’s parent tree. If the updated diff does not
       apply, no changes are made to the patch and the edited patch is
       saved to a file which may be corrected and then fed-back into <b>stg</b>
       <b>edit --file</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -e, --edit
           Invoke editor for patch description

       -d, --diff
           Show diff when editing patch description

       -m &lt;message&gt;, --message=&lt;message&gt;
           Use message instead of invoking the editor

       -f &lt;path&gt;, --file=&lt;path&gt;
           Use the contents of file instead of invoking the editor. Use
           "-" to read from stdin.

       --no-verify
           Disable commit-msg hook

       -s[=&lt;value&gt;], --signoff[=&lt;value&gt;]
           Add "Signed-off-by" message trailer.

           The value is optional and defaults to the committer name and
           email. This option may be provided multiple times.

       --ack[=&lt;value&gt;]
           Add "Acked-by" message trailer.

           The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
           and email. This option may be provided multiple times.

       --review[=&lt;value&gt;]
           Add "Reviewed-by" message trailer.

           The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
           and email. This option may be provided multiple times.

       --author=&lt;name-and-email&gt;
           Set the author "name &lt;email&gt;"

       --authname=&lt;name&gt;
           Set the author name

       --authemail=&lt;email&gt;
           Set the author email

       --authdate=&lt;date&gt;
           Set the date the patch was authored.

           Use "now" to use the current time and date.

       --committer-date-is-author-date
           Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
           the author date of the commit as the committer date.

       --save-template=&lt;file&gt;
           Instead of running the command, just write the patch
           description to FILE, and exit. (If FILE is "-", write to
           stdout.)

           When driving StGit from another program, it may be useful to
           first call a command with <i>--save-template</i>, then let the user
           edit the message, and then call the same command with <i>--file</i>.

       -t &lt;treeish&gt;, --set-tree=&lt;treeish&gt;
           Set the patch’s git tree to the specified treeish without
           changing the tree of any other patches. When used on the top
           patch, the index and work tree will be updated to match the
           new tree. This low-level option is primarily meant to be used
           by tools built on top of StGit, such as the Emacs mode. See
           also the <i>--set-tree</i> flag of <a href="stg-push.1.html">stg-push(1)</a>.
