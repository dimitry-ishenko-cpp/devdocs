NAME </h2>
<pre>
       patch — apply changes to files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       patch <b>[</b>-blNR<b>] [</b>-c|-e|-n|-u<b>] [</b>-d <i>dir</i><b>] [</b>-D <i>define</i><b>] [</b>-i <i>patchfile</i><b>]</b>
           <b>[</b>-o <i>outfile</i><b>] [</b>-p <i>num</i><b>] [</b>-r <i>rejectfile</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>patch</i> utility shall read a source (patch) file containing any
       of four forms of difference (diff) listings produced by the <i>diff</i>
       utility (normal, copied context, unified context, or in the style
       of <i>ed</i>) and apply those differences to a file. By default, <i>patch</i>
       shall read from the standard input.

       The <i>patch</i> utility shall attempt to determine the type of the <i>diff</i>
       listing, unless overruled by a <b>-c</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-n</b>, or <b>-u </b>option.

       If the patch file contains more than one patch, <i>patch</i> shall
       attempt to apply each of them as if they came from separate patch
       files. (In this case, the application shall ensure that the name
       of the patch file is determinable for each <i>diff</i> listing.)
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>patch</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-b        </b>Save a copy of the original contents of each modified
                 file, before the differences are applied, in a file of
                 the same name with the suffix <b>.orig </b>appended to it. If
                 the file already exists, it shall be overwritten; if
                 multiple patches are applied to the same file, the
                 <b>.orig </b>file shall be written only for the first patch.
                 When the <b>-o </b><i>outfile</i> option is also specified, <i>file</i><b>.orig</b>
                 shall not be created but, if <i>outfile</i> already exists,
                 <i>outfile</i><b>.orig </b>shall be created.

       <b>-c        </b>Interpret the patch file as a copied context difference
                 (the output of the utility <i>diff</i> when the <b>-c </b>or <b>-C</b>
                 options are specified).

       <b>-d </b><i>dir</i>    Change the current directory to <i>dir</i> before processing
                 as described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       <b>-D </b><i>define</i> Mark changes with one of the following C preprocessor
                 constructs:

                     #ifdef define
                     ...
                     #endif

                     #ifndef define
                     ...
                     #endif

                 optionally combined with the C preprocessor construct
                 <b>#else</b>.  If the patched file is processed with the C
                 preprocessor, where the macro <i>define</i> is defined, the
                 output shall contain the changes from the patch file;
                 otherwise, the output shall not contain the patches
                 specified in the patch file.

       <b>-e        </b>Interpret the patch file as an <i>ed</i> script, rather than a
                 <i>diff</i> script.

       <b>-i </b><i>patchfile</i>
                 Read the patch information from the file named by the
                 pathname <i>patchfile</i>, rather than the standard input.

       <b>-l        </b>(The letter ell.) Cause any sequence of &lt;blank&gt;
                 characters in the difference script to match any
                 sequence of &lt;blank&gt; characters in the input file. Other
                 characters shall be matched exactly.

       <b>-n        </b>Interpret the script as a normal difference.

       <b>-N        </b>Ignore patches where the differences have already been
                 applied to the file; by default, already-applied
                 patches shall be rejected.

       <b>-o </b><i>outfile</i>
                 Instead of modifying the files (specified by the <i>file</i>
                 operand or the difference listings) directly, write a
                 copy of the file referenced by each patch, with the
                 appropriate differences applied, to <i>outfile</i>.  Multiple
                 patches for a single file shall be applied to the
                 intermediate versions of the file created by any
                 previous patches, and shall result in multiple,
                 concatenated versions of the file being written to
                 <i>outfile</i>.

       <b>-p </b><i>num</i>    For all pathnames in the patch file that indicate the
                 names of files to be patched, delete <i>num</i> pathname
                 components from the beginning of each pathname. If the
                 pathname in the patch file is absolute, any leading
                 &lt;slash&gt; characters shall be considered the first
                 component (that is, <b>-p 1 </b>shall remove the leading
                 &lt;slash&gt; characters). Specifying <b>-p 0 </b>shall cause the
                 full pathname to be used. If <b>-p </b>is not specified, only
                 the basename (the final pathname component) shall be
                 used.

       <b>-R        </b>Reverse the sense of the patch script; that is, assume
                 that the difference script was created from the new
                 version to the old version.  The <b>-R </b>option cannot be
                 used with <i>ed</i> scripts. The <i>patch</i> utility shall attempt
                 to reverse each portion of the script before applying
                 it. Rejected differences shall be saved in swapped
                 format. If this option is not specified, and until a
                 portion of the patch file is successfully applied,
                 <i>patch</i> attempts to apply each portion in its reversed
                 sense as well as in its normal sense. If the attempt is
                 successful, the user shall be prompted to determine
                 whether the <b>-R </b>option should be set.

       <b>-r </b><i>rejectfile</i>
                 Override the default reject filename. In the default
                 case, the reject file shall have the same name as the
                 output file, with the suffix <b>.rej </b>appended to it; see
                 <i>Patch Application</i>.

       <b>-u        </b>Interpret the patch file as a unified context
                 difference (the output of the <i>diff</i> utility when the <b>-u</b>
                 or <b>-U </b>options are specified).
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       Input files shall be text files.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>patch</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                 elements used in the extended regular expression
                 defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale keyword in the
                 <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files), and the
                 behavior of character classes used in the extended
                 regular expression defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale
                 keyword in the <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale used to process affirmative
                 responses, and the locale used to affect the format and
                 contents of diagnostic messages and prompts written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Determine the locale for recognizing the format of file
                 timestamps written by the <i>diff</i> utility in a context-
                 difference input file.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A patch file may contain patching instructions for more than one
       file; filenames shall be determined as specified in <i>Filename</i>
       <i>Determination</i>.  When the <b>-b </b>option is specified, for each patched
       file, the original shall be saved in a file of the same name with
       the suffix <b>.orig </b>appended to it.

       For each patched file, a reject file may also be created as noted
       in <i>Patch Application</i>.  In the absence of a <b>-r </b>option, the name of
       this file shall be formed by appending the suffix <b>.rej </b>to the
       original filename.

   <b>Patch File Format</b>
       The patch file shall contain zero or more lines of header
       information followed by one or more patches. Each patch shall
       contain zero or more lines of filename identification in the
       format produced by the <b>-c</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>-u</b>, or <b>-U </b>options of the <i>diff</i>
       utility, and one or more sets of <i>diff</i> output, which are
       customarily called <i>hunks</i>.

       The <i>patch</i> utility shall recognize the following expression in the
       header information:

       <b>Index: </b><i>pathname</i>
             The file to be patched is named <i>pathname</i>.

       If all lines (including headers) within a patch begin with the
       same leading sequence of &lt;blank&gt; characters, the <i>patch</i> utility
       shall remove this sequence before proceeding. Within each patch,
       if the type of difference is common context, the <i>patch</i> utility
       shall recognize the following expressions:

       *** <i>filename timestamp</i>
             The patches arose from <i>filename</i>.

       --- <i>filename timestamp</i>
             The patches should be applied to <i>filename</i>.

       If the type of difference is unified context, the <i>patch</i> utility
       shall recognize the following expressions:

       --- <i>filename timestamp</i>
             The patches arose from <i>filename</i>.

       +++ <i>filename timestamp</i>
             The patches should be applied to <i>filename</i>.

       Each hunk within a patch shall be the <i>diff</i> output to change a
       line range within the original file. The line numbers for
       successive hunks within a patch shall occur in ascending order.

   <b>Filename Determination</b>
       If no <i>file</i> operand is specified, <i>patch</i> shall perform the
       following steps to determine the filename to use:

        1. If the type of <i>diff</i> is context, the <i>patch</i> utility shall
           delete pathname components (as specified by the <b>-p </b>option)
           from the filename on the line beginning with <b>"***" </b>(if copied
           context) or <b>"---" </b>(if unified context), then test for the
           existence of this file relative to the current directory (or
           the directory specified with the <b>-d </b>option). If the file
           exists, the <i>patch</i> utility shall use this filename.

        2. If the type of <i>diff</i> is context, the <i>patch</i> utility shall
           delete the pathname components (as specified by the <b>-p</b>
           option) from the filename on the line beginning with <b>"---"</b>
           (if copied context) or <b>"+++" </b>(if unified context), then test
           for the existence of this file relative to the current
           directory (or the directory specified with the <b>-d </b>option). If
           the file exists, the <i>patch</i> utility shall use this filename.

        3. If the header information contains a line beginning with the
           string <b>Index:</b>, the <i>patch</i> utility shall delete pathname
           components (as specified by the <b>-p </b>option) from this line,
           then test for the existence of this file relative to the
           current directory (or the directory specified with the <b>-d</b>
           option). If the file exists, the <i>patch</i> utility shall use this
           filename.

        4. If an <b>SCCS </b>directory exists in the current directory, <i>patch</i>
           shall attempt to perform a <i>get</i> <b>-e SCCS/s.</b><i>filename</i> command to
           retrieve an editable version of the file. If the file exists,
           the <i>patch</i> utility shall use this filename.

        5. The <i>patch</i> utility shall write a prompt to standard output and
           request a filename interactively from the controlling
           terminal (for example, <b>/dev/tty</b>).

   <b>Patch Application</b>
       If the <b>-c</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-n</b>, or <b>-u </b>option is present, the <i>patch</i> utility
       shall interpret information within each hunk as a copied context
       difference, an <i>ed</i> difference, a normal difference, or a unified
       context difference, respectively. In the absence of any of these
       options, the <i>patch</i> utility shall determine the type of difference
       based on the format of information within the hunk.

       For each hunk, the <i>patch</i> utility shall begin to search for the
       place to apply the patch at the line number at the beginning of
       the hunk, plus or minus any offset used in applying the previous
       hunk. If lines matching the hunk context are not found, <i>patch</i>
       shall scan both forwards and backwards at least 1000 bytes for a
       set of lines that match the hunk context.

       If no such place is found and it is a context difference, then
       another scan shall take place, ignoring the first and last line
       of context. If that fails, the first two and last two lines of
       context shall be ignored and another scan shall be made.
       Implementations may search more extensively for installation
       locations.

       If no location can be found, the <i>patch</i> utility shall append the
       hunk to the reject file. A rejected hunk that is a copied context
       difference, an <i>ed</i> difference, or a normal difference shall be
       written in copied-context-difference format regardless of the
       format of the patch file. It is implementation-defined whether a
       rejected hunk that is a unified context difference is written in
       copied-context-difference format or in unified-context-difference
       format.  If the input was a normal or <i>ed</i>-style difference, the
       reject file may contain differences with zero lines of context.
       The line numbers on the hunks in the reject file may be different
       from the line numbers in the patch file since they shall reflect
       the approximate locations for the failed hunks in the new file
       rather than the old one.

       If the type of patch is an <i>ed</i> diff, the implementation may
       accomplish the patching by invoking the <i>ed</i> utility.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

        1    One or more lines were written to a reject file.

       &gt;1    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Patches that cannot be correctly placed in the file shall be
       written to a reject file.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-R </b>option does not work with <i>ed</i> scripts because there is too
       little information to reconstruct the reverse operation.

       The <b>-p </b>option makes it possible to customize a patch file to
       local user directory structures without manually editing the
       patch file. For example, if the filename in the patch file was:

           /curds/whey/src/blurfl/blurfl.c

       Setting <b>-p 0 </b>gives the entire pathname unmodified; <b>-p 1 </b>gives:

           curds/whey/src/blurfl/blurfl.c

       without the leading &lt;slash&gt;, <b>-p 4 </b>gives:

           blurfl/blurfl.c

       and not specifying <b>-p </b>at all gives:

           blurfl.c .
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Some of the functionality in historical <i>patch</i> implementations was
       not specified. The following documents those features present in
       historical implementations that have not been specified.

       A deleted piece of functionality was the <b>'+' </b>pseudo-option
       allowing an additional set of options and a patch file operand to
       be given. This was seen as being insufficiently useful to
       standardize.

       In historical implementations, if the string <b>"Prereq:" </b>appeared
       in the header, the <i>patch</i> utility would search for the
       corresponding version information (the string specified in the
       header, delimited by &lt;blank&gt; characters or the beginning or end
       of a line or the file) anywhere in the original file. This was
       deleted as too simplistic and insufficiently trustworthy a
       mechanism to standardize. For example, if:

           Prereq: 1.2

       were in the header, the presence of a delimited 1.2 anywhere in
       the file would satisfy the prerequisite.

       The following options were dropped from historical
       implementations of <i>patch</i> as insufficiently useful to standardize:

       <b>-b        </b>The <b>-b </b>option historically provided a method for
                 changing the name extension of the backup file from the
                 default <b>.orig</b>.  This option has been modified and
                 retained in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       <b>-F        </b>The <b>-F </b>option specified the number of lines of a
                 context diff to ignore when searching for a place to
                 install a patch.

       <b>-f        </b>The <b>-f </b>option historically caused <i>patch</i> not to request
                 additional information from the user.

       <b>-r        </b>The <b>-r </b>option historically provided a method of
                 overriding the extension of the reject file from the
                 default <b>.rej</b>.

       <b>-s        </b>The <b>-s </b>option historically caused <i>patch</i> to work
                 silently unless an error occurred.

       <b>-x        </b>The <b>-x </b>option historically set internal debugging
                 flags.

       In some file system implementations, the saving of a <b>.orig </b>file
       may produce unwanted results. In the case of 12, 13, or
       14-character filenames (on file systems supporting 14-character
       maximum filenames), the <b>.orig </b>file overwrites the new file. The
       reject file may also exceed this filename limit. It was
       suggested, due to some historical practice, that a &lt;tilde&gt; (<b>'~'</b>)
       suffix be used instead of <b>.orig </b>and some other character instead
       of the <b>.rej </b>suffix. This was rejected because it is not obvious
       to the user which file is which. The suffixes <b>.orig </b>and <b>.rej </b>are
       clearer and more understandable.

       The <b>-b </b>option has the opposite sense in some historical
       implementations—do not save the <b>.orig </b>file. The default case here
       is not to save the files, making <i>patch</i> behave more consistently
       with the other standard utilities.

       The <b>-w </b>option in early proposals was changed to <b>-l </b>to match
       historical practice.

       The <b>-N </b>option was included because without it, a non-interactive
       application cannot reject previously applied patches. For
       example, if a user is piping the output of <i>diff</i> into the <i>patch</i>
       utility, and the user only wants to patch a file to a newer
       version non-interactively, the <b>-N </b>option is required.

       Changes to the <b>-l </b>option description were proposed to allow
       matching across &lt;newline&gt; characters in addition to just &lt;blank&gt;
       characters. Since this is not historical practice, and since some
       ambiguities could result, it is suggested that future
       developments in this area utilize another option letter, such as
       <b>-L</b>.

       The <b>-u </b>option of GNU <i>patch</i> has been added, along with support for
       unified context formats.
