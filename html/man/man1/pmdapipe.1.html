SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pmdapipe </b>[<b>-c </b><i>configfile</i>] [<b>-d </b><i>domain</i>] [<b>-l</b>
       <i>logfile</i>] [<b>-m </b><i>memory</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdapipe </b>is a configurable command output monitoring Performance
       Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA).  It can be seen as analogous to a
       restricted shell, where options can be passed to preset commands,
       and each line of their output is converted into a performance
       event.  These events can be consumed by client tools like
       <a href="pmval.1.html">pmval(1)</a>.

       The <b>pipe </b>PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting
       timestamped event records for text-oriented command output, as
       well as the more orthodox sample-style metrics such as event
       counts and throughput size values.

       The PMDA is configured via a <i>configfile</i> which contains one line
       for each process from which output can be captured, as described
       in the ``CONFIGURATION'' section below.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdapipe </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-c   </b>specifies an alternate configuration file for the PMDA.  By
            default, a file named <i>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pipe.conf</i> and any
            files below the <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pipe.conf.d/</i> directory are
            used.

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>pipe.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdapipe </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.

       <b>-m   </b>Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event
            records to <i>maxsize</i> bytes.  As log events arrive at the PMDA,
            they must be buffered until individual client tools request
            the next batch since their previous batch of events.  The
            default maximum is 2 megabytes.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The set of allowed pipe commands is configured by simple text
       file(s).  The format is a single line for each command followed
       by an optional access control section.

       Blank lines and comments are permitted (even encouraged) in the
       configuration file.  A comment begins with a ``#'' character and
       finishes at the end of the line.

       Each command configuration line is of the form:

              <i>instance username command options</i>

       Where,

       <i>instance</i>
              is a string identifying the pipe command, also exported as
              the metric instance identifier.
       <i>username</i>
              is the name of the user account under which the command
              should run (e.g. "root")
       <i>command</i>
              is the path to the binary which will be run to generate
              piped output
       <i>options</i>
              is an optional space-separated list of parameters to pass
              to the <i>command</i>

                     This <i>options</i> list may contain numeric parameters
                     prefixed by the dollar-sign, and these will be
                     substituted with user-supplied values at the time
                     the <i>command</i> is run (similar to shell parameter
                     substitution).

       Parameters are passed as a single space-separated or comma-
       separated string to the <i>pipe.firehose</i> metric, using the
       <a href="../man3/pmstore.3.html">pmStore(3)</a> interface.  The <b>pmval </b>command provides store access
       via its <b>-x </b>option.  User-supplied parameters are restricted to
       containing alphanumeric characters.

       The access control section of the file must start with a line of
       the form:

       <b>[access]</b>

       Leading and trailing whitespace may appear around and within the
       brackets and the case of the <b>access </b>keyword is ignored.  No other
       text may appear on the line except a trailing comment.

       Following this line, the remainder of the configuration file
       should contain lines that allow or disallow use of <i>commands</i> from
       particular users or groups.

       User names and group names will be verified using the local
       <b>/etc/passwd </b>and <b>/etc/groups </b>files (or an alternative directory
       service), using the <a href="../man3/getpwent.3.html">getpwent(3)</a> and <a href="../man3/getgrent.3.html">getgrent(3)</a> routines.

       Access for users or groups are allowed or disallowed by
       specifying statements of the form:

              <b>allow user </b><i>username</i> <b>: </b><i>instance</i>
              <b>disallow user </b><i>username</i> <b>: </b><i>instance</i>
              <b>allow group </b><i>groupname</i> <b>: </b><i>instance</i>
              <b>disallow group </b><i>groupname</i> <b>: </b><i>instance</i>

       The <i>username</i> and <i>groupname</i> names will be verified using the local
       <b>/etc/passwd </b>and <b>/etc/groups </b>files (or an alternative directory
       service), using the <a href="../man3/getpwent.3.html">getpwent(3)</a> and <a href="../man3/getgrent.3.html">getgrent(3)</a> routines.

       The wildcard ``*'' can be used to refer to all <i>instance</i> names.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
       pipe performance metrics, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe
            # ./Install

       This is an interactive installation process which prompts for
       each log file path to be monitored (or command to be run), a
       metric instance name to identify it, and whether access should be
       restricted (refer to the <b>-x </b>option to <a href="pmval.1.html">pmval(1)</a> for further
       details).

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdapipe </b>is launched by <b>pmcd </b>and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <b>pmcd </b>when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Following is a simple example of <b>pmdapipe </b>configuration and use
       of the pipe metrics to run the <b>btrace </b>command, by user <b>bob</b>:

            bob&gt; cat $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pipe.conf
            # instance      user      command
            rw_syscalls     root      perf script rw-by-file $1
            bdev_trace      root      btrace -w $1 /dev/$2

            [access]
            allow user bob : *;
            allow user jane : bdev_trace;
            allow group perf : rw_syscalls;

            bob&gt; pmval -i bdev_trace -x '5 sda' pipe.firehose

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
