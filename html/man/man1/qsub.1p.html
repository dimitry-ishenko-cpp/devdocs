</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       To submit a script is to create a batch job that executes the
       script. A script is submitted by a request to a batch server. The
       <i>qsub</i> utility is a user-accessible batch client that submits a
       script.

       Upon successful completion, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall have created a
       batch job that will execute the submitted script.

       The <i>qsub</i> utility shall submit a script by sending a <i>Queue Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> to a batch server.

       The <i>qsub</i> utility shall place the value of the following
       environment variables in the <i>Variable_List</i> attribute of the batch
       job: <i>HOME</i>, <i>LANG</i>, <i>LOGNAME</i>, <i>PATH</i>, <i>MAIL</i>, <i>SHELL</i>, and <i>TZ</i>.  The name of
       the environment variable shall be the current name prefixed with
       the string PBS_O_.

       <b>Note:  </b>If the current value of the <i>HOME</i> variable in the
              environment space of the <i>qsub</i> utility is <b>/aa/bb/cc</b>, then
              <i>qsub</i> shall place <i>PBS_O_HOME</i>=<b>/aa/bb/cc </b>in the <i>Variable_List</i>
              attribute of the batch job.

       In addition to the variables described above, the <i>qsub</i> utility
       shall add the following variables with the indicated values to
       the variable list:

       <i>PBS_O_WORKDIR</i> The absolute path of the current working directory
                     of the <i>qsub</i> utility process.

       <i>PBS_O_HOST</i>    The name of the host on which the <i>qsub</i> utility is
                     running.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qsub</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-a </b><i>date_time</i>
                 Define the time at which a batch job becomes eligible
                 for execution.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept an option-argument that
                 conforms to the syntax of the <i>time</i> operand of the <i>touch</i>
                 utility.

                 <b>Note:  </b>The server that initiates execution of the batch
                        job will add other variables to the batch job's
                        environment; see <i>Section 3.2.2.1</i>, <i>Batch Job</i>
                        <i>Execution</i>.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute
                 of the batch job to the number of seconds since the
                 Epoch that is equivalent to the local time expressed by
                 the value of the <i>date_time</i> option-argument. The Epoch
                 is defined in the Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.150</i>, <i>Epoch</i>.

                 If the <b>-a </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to a time (number of seconds since the
                 Epoch) that is earlier than the time at which the
                 utility exits.

       <b>-A </b><i>account_string</i>
                 Define the account to which the resource consumption of
                 the batch job should be charged.

                 The syntax of the <i>account_string</i> option-argument is
                 unspecified.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the <i>Account_Name</i> attribute
                 of the batch job to the value of the <i>account_string</i>
                 option-argument.

                 If the <b>-A </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall omit the <i>Account_Name</i> attribute from
                 the attributes of the batch job.

       <b>-c </b><i>interval</i>
                 Define whether the batch job should be checkpointed,
                 and if so, how often.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a value for the interval
                 option-argument that is one of the following:

                 n         No checkpointing shall be performed on the
                           batch job (NO_CHECKPOINT).

                 s         Checkpointing shall be performed only when
                           the batch server is shut down
                           (CHECKPOINT_AT_SHUTDOWN).

                 c         Automatic periodic checkpointing shall be
                           performed at the <i>Minimum_Cpu_Interval</i>
                           attribute of the batch queue, in units of CPU
                           minutes (CHECKPOINT_AT_MIN_CPU_INTERVAL).

                 c=<i>minutes</i> Automatic periodic checkpointing shall be
                           performed every <i>minutes</i> of CPU time, or every
                           <i>Minimum_Cpu_Interval</i> minutes, whichever is
                           greater. The <i>minutes</i> argument shall conform
                           to the syntax for unsigned integers and shall
                           be greater than zero.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the value of the <i>interval</i> option-
                 argument.

                 If the <b>-c </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to the single character <b>'u'</b>
                 (CHECKPOINT_UNSPECIFIED).

       <b>-C </b><i>directive_prefix</i>
                 Define the prefix that declares a directive to the <i>qsub</i>
                 utility within the script.

                 The <i>directive_prefix</i> is not a batch job attribute; it
                 affects the behavior of the <i>qsub</i> utility.

                 If the <b>-C </b>option is presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility, and
                 the value of the <i>directive_prefix</i> option-argument is
                 the null string, the utility shall not scan the script
                 file for directives. If the <b>-C </b>option is not presented
                 to the <i>qsub</i> utility, then the value of the <i>PBS_DPREFIX</i>
                 environment variable is used. If the environment
                 variable is not defined, then #PBS encoded in the
                 portable character set is the default.

       <b>-e </b><i>path_name</i>
                 Define the path to be used for the standard error
                 stream of the batch job.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a <i>path_name</i> option-
                 argument which can be preceded by a host name element
                 of the form <i>hostname</i>:.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes an
                 absolute pathname, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the
                 <i>Error_Path</i> attribute of the batch job to the value of
                 the <i>path_name</i> option-argument.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes a relative
                 pathname and no host name element is specified, the
                 <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the <i>Error_Path</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to the value of the absolute pathname derived
                 by expanding the <i>path_name</i> option-argument relative to
                 the current directory of the process executing <i>qsub</i>.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes a relative
                 pathname and a host name element is specified, the <i>qsub</i>
                 utility shall set the <i>Error_Path</i> attribute of the batch
                 job to the value of the <i>path_name</i> option-argument
                 without expansion. The host name element shall be
                 included.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument does not include a
                 host name element, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall prefix the
                 pathname with <i>hostname</i>:, where <i>hostname</i> is the name of
                 the host upon which the <i>qsub</i> utility is being executed.

                 If the <b>-e </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>Error_Path</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to the host name and path of the current
                 directory of the submitting process and the default
                 filename.

                 The default filename for standard error has the
                 following format:

                     <i>job_name</i>.e<i>sequence_number</i>

       <b>-h        </b>Specify that a USER hold is applied to the batch job.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the value of the <i>Hold_Types</i>
                 attribute of the batch job to the value USER.

                 If the <b>-h </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to the value NO_HOLD.

       <b>-j </b><i>join_list</i>
                 Define which streams of the batch job are to be merged.
                 The <i>qsub</i> <b>-j </b>option shall accept a value for the
                 <i>join_list</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                 (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <i>Section 6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>).

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a <i>join_list</i> option-
                 argument that consists of one or more of the characters
                 <b>'e' </b>and <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 All of the other batch job output streams specified
                 will be merged into the output stream represented by
                 the character listed first in the <i>join_list</i> option-
                 argument.

                 For each unique character in the <i>join_list</i> option-
                 argument, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall add a value to the
                 <i>Join_Path</i> attribute of the batch job as follows, each
                 representing a different batch job stream to join:

                 e     The standard error of the batch job
                       (JOIN_STD_ERROR).

                 o     The standard output of the batch job
                       (JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).

                 An existing <i>Join_Path</i> attribute can be cleared by the
                 following join type:

                 n     NO_JOIN

                 If <b>'n' </b>is specified, then no files are joined. The <i>qsub</i>
                 utility shall consider it an error if any join type
                 other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with join type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                 of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the <i>join_list</i>
                 option-argument. The <i>qsub</i> utility shall permit the
                 repetition of characters, but shall not assign
                 additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other join types. The
                 conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe any additional batch job streams, how they are
                 specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                 the behavior of the utility.

                 If the <b>-j </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the value of the <i>Join_Path</i>
                 attribute of the batch job to NO_JOIN.

       <b>-k </b><i>keep_list</i>
                 Define which output of the batch job to retain on the
                 execution host.

                 The <i>qsub</i> <b>-k </b>option shall accept a value for the
                 <i>keep_list</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                 (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <i>Section 6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>).

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a <i>keep_list</i> option-
                 argument that consists of one or more of the characters
                 <b>'e' </b>and <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 For each unique character in the <i>keep_list</i> option-
                 argument, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall add a value to the
                 <i>Keep_Files</i> attribute of the batch job as follows, each
                 representing a different batch job stream to keep:

                 e     The standard error of the batch job
                       (KEEP_STD_ERROR).

                 o     The standard output of the batch job
                       (KEEP_STD_OUTPUT).

                 If both <b>'e' </b>and <b>'o' </b>are specified, then both files are
                 retained. An existing <i>Keep_Files</i> attribute can be
                 cleared by the following keep type:

                 n     NO_KEEP

                 If <b>'n' </b>is specified, then no files are retained. The
                 <i>qsub</i> utility shall consider it an error if any keep
                 type other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with keep type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                 of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the <i>keep_list</i>
                 option-argument. The <i>qsub</i> utility shall permit the
                 repetition of characters, but shall not assign
                 additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other keep types. The
                 conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe any additional keep types, how they are
                 specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                 the behavior of the utility. If the <b>-k </b>option is not
                 presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility, the utility shall set
                 the <i>Keep_Files</i> attribute of the batch job to the value
                 NO_KEEP.

       <b>-m </b><i>mail_options</i>
                 Define the points in the execution of the batch job at
                 which the batch server that manages the batch job shall
                 send mail about a change in the state of the batch job.

                 The <i>qsub</i> <b>-m </b>option shall accept a value for the
                 <i>mail_options</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                 (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <i>Section 6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>).

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a value for the
                 <i>mail_options</i> option-argument that is a string of one or
                 more of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, and <b>'a'</b>, or the single
                 character <b>'n'</b>.

                 For each unique character in the <i>mail_options</i> option-
                 argument, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall add a value to the
                 <i>Mail_Users</i> attribute of the batch job as follows, each
                 representing a different time during the life of a
                 batch job at which to send mail:

                 e     MAIL_AT_EXIT

                 b     MAIL_AT_BEGINNING

                 a     MAIL_AT_ABORT

                 If any of these characters are duplicated in the
                 <i>mail_options</i> option-argument, the duplicates shall be
                 ignored.

                 An existing <i>Mail_Points</i> attribute can be cleared by the
                 following mail type:

                 n     NO_MAIL

                 If <b>'n' </b>is specified, then mail is not sent. The <i>qsub</i>
                 utility shall consider it an error if any mail type
                 other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with mail type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                 of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, <b>'a'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the
                 <i>mail_options</i> option-argument.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall permit the repetition of
                 characters, but shall not assign additional meaning to
                 the repeated characters. An implementation may define
                 other mail types. The conformance document for an
                 implementation shall describe any additional mail
                 types, how they are specified, their internal behavior,
                 and how they affect the behavior of the utility.

                 If the <b>-m </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>Mail_Points</i> attribute to the
                 value MAIL_AT_ABORT.

       <b>-M </b><i>mail_list</i>
                 Define the list of users to which a batch server that
                 executes the batch job shall send mail, if the server
                 sends mail about the batch job.

                 The syntax of the <i>mail_list</i> option-argument is
                 unspecified.

                 If the implementation of the <i>qsub</i> utility uses a name
                 service to locate users, the utility should accept the
                 syntax used by the name service.

                 If the implementation of the <i>qsub</i> utility does not use
                 a name service to locate users, the implementation
                 should accept the following syntax for user names:

                     <i>mail_address</i><b>[</b>,,<i>mail_address</i>,, ...<b>]</b>

                 The interpretation of <i>mail_address</i> is implementation-
                 defined.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the <i>Mail_Users</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the value of the <i>mail_list</i> option-
                 argument.

                 If the <b>-M </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall place only the user name and host
                 name for the current process in the <i>Mail_Users</i>
                 attribute of the batch job.

       <b>-N </b><i>name</i>   Define the name of the batch job.

                 The <i>qsub</i> <b>-N </b>option shall accept a value for the <i>name</i>
                 option-argument that is a string of up to 15
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                 (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <i>Section 6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>) where the first
                 character is alphabetic.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the value of the <i>Job_Name</i>
                 attribute of the batch job to the value of the <i>name</i>
                 option-argument.

                 If the <b>-N </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>Job_Name</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to the name of the <i>script</i> argument from which
                 the directory specification if any, has been removed.

                 If the <b>-N </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 and the script is read from standard input, the utility
                 shall set the <i>Job_Name</i> attribute of the batch job to
                 the value STDIN.

       <b>-o </b><i>path_name</i>
                 Define the path for the standard output of the batch
                 job.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a <i>path_name</i> option-
                 argument that conforms to the syntax of the <i>path_name</i>
                 element defined in the System Interfaces volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, which can be preceded by a host name
                 element of the form <i>hostname</i>:.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes an
                 absolute pathname, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the
                 <i>Output_Path</i> attribute of the batch job to the value of
                 the <i>path_name</i> option-argument without expansion.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes a relative
                 pathname and no host name element is specified, the
                 <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the <i>Output_Path</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to the pathname derived by expanding the
                 value of the <i>path_name</i> option-argument relative to the
                 current directory of the process executing the <i>qsub</i>.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes a relative
                 pathname and a host name element is specified, the <i>qsub</i>
                 utility shall set the <i>Output_Path</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to the value of the <i>path_name</i> option-argument
                 without expansion.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument does not specify a
                 host name element, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall prefix the
                 pathname with <i>hostname</i>:, where <i>hostname</i> is the name of
                 the host upon which the <i>qsub</i> utility is executing.

                 If the <b>-o </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>Output_Path</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to the host name and path of the current
                 directory of the submitting process and the default
                 filename.

                 The default filename for standard output has the
                 following format:

                     <i>job_name</i>.o<i>sequence_number</i>

       <b>-p </b><i>priority</i>
                 Define the priority the batch job should have relative
                 to other batch jobs owned by the batch server.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the <i>Priority</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the value of the <i>priority</i> option-
                 argument.

                 If the <b>-p </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the value of the <i>Priority</i> attribute is implementation-
                 defined.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a value for the <i>priority</i>
                 option-argument that conforms to the syntax for signed
                 decimal integers, and which is not less than -1024 and
                 not greater than 1023.

       <b>-q </b><i>destination</i>
                 Define the destination of the batch job.

                 The destination is not a batch job attribute; it
                 determines the batch server, and possibly the batch
                 queue, to which the <i>qsub</i> utility batch queues the batch
                 job.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall submit the script to the batch
                 server named by the <i>destination</i> option-argument or the
                 server that owns the batch queue named in the
                 <i>destination</i> option-argument.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept an option-argument for
                 the <b>-q </b>option that conforms to the syntax for a
                 destination (see <i>Section 3.3.2</i>, <i>Destination</i>).

                 If the <b>-q </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the <i>qsub</i> utility shall submit the batch job to the
                 default destination. The mechanism for determining the
                 default destination is implementation-defined.

       <b>-r </b><i>y</i>|<i>n</i>    Define whether the batch job is rerunnable.

                 If the value of the option-argument is <i>y</i>, the <i>qsub</i>
                 utility shall set the <i>Rerunable</i> attribute of the batch
                 job to TRUE.

                 If the value of the option-argument is <i>n</i>, the <i>qsub</i>
                 utility shall set the <i>Rerunable</i> attribute of the batch
                 job to FALSE.

                 If the <b>-r </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>Rerunable</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to TRUE.

       <b>-S </b><i>path_name_list</i>
                 Define the pathname to the shell under which the batch
                 job is to execute.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a <i>path_name_list</i> option-
                 argument that conforms to the following syntax:

                     <i>pathname</i><b>[</b>@<i>host</i><b>][</b>,,<i>pathname</i><b>[</b>@<i>host</i><b>]</b>,, ...<b>]</b>

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall allow only one pathname for a
                 given host name. The <i>qsub</i> utility shall allow only one
                 pathname that is missing a corresponding host name.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall add a value to the
                 <i>Shell_Path_List</i> attribute of the batch job for each
                 entry in the <i>path_name_list</i> option-argument.

                 If the <b>-S </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>Shell_Path_List</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the null string.

                 The conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe the mechanism used to set the default shell
                 and determine the current value of the default shell.
                 An implementation shall provide a means for the
                 installation to set the default shell to the login
                 shell of the user under which the batch job is to
                 execute. See <i>Section 3.3.3</i>, <i>Multiple Keyword-Value</i>
                 <i>Pairs</i> for a means of removing <i>keyword</i>=<i>value</i> (and
                 <i>value</i>@<i>keyword</i>) pairs and other general rules for list-
                 oriented batch job attributes.

       <b>-u </b><i>user_list</i>
                 Define the user name under which the batch job is to
                 execute.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a <i>user_list</i> option-
                 argument that conforms to the following syntax:

                     <i>username</i><b>[</b>@<i>host</i><b>][</b>,,<i>username</i><b>[</b>@<i>host</i><b>]</b>,, ...<b>]</b>

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept only one user name that
                 is missing a corresponding host name. The <i>qsub</i> utility
                 shall accept only one user name per named host.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall add a value to the <i>User_List</i>
                 attribute of the batch job for each entry in the
                 <i>user_list</i> option-argument.

                 If the <b>-u </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall set the <i>User_List</i> attribute of the
                 batch job to the user name from which the utility is
                 executing. See <i>Section 3.3.3</i>, <i>Multiple Keyword-Value</i>
                 <i>Pairs</i> for a means of removing <i>keyword</i>=<i>value</i> (and
                 <i>value</i>@<i>keyword</i>) pairs and other general rules for list-
                 oriented batch job attributes.

       <b>-v </b><i>variable_list</i>
                 Add to the list of variables that are exported to the
                 session leader of the batch job.

                 A <i>variable_list</i> is a set of strings of either the form
                 &lt;<i>variable</i>&gt; or &lt;<i>variable</i>=<i>value</i>&gt;, delimited by &lt;comma&gt;
                 characters.

                 If the <b>-v </b>option is presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility, the
                 utility shall also add, to the environment
                 <i>Variable_List</i> attribute of the batch job, every
                 variable named in the environment <i>variable_list</i> option-
                 argument and, optionally, values of specified
                 variables.

                 If a value is not provided on the command line, the
                 <i>qsub</i> utility shall set the value of each variable in
                 the environment <i>Variable_List</i> attribute of the batch
                 job to the value of the corresponding environment
                 variable for the process in which the utility is
                 executing; see <i>Table 4-19, Environment Variable Values</i>
                 <i>(Utilities)</i>.

                 A conforming application shall not repeat a variable in
                 the environment <i>variable_list</i> option-argument.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall not repeat a variable in the
                 environment <i>Variable_List</i> attribute of the batch job.
                 See <i>Section 3.3.3</i>, <i>Multiple Keyword-Value Pairs</i> for a
                 means of removing <i>keyword</i>=<i>value</i> (and <i>value</i>@<i>keyword</i>)
                 pairs and other general rules for list-oriented batch
                 job attributes.

       <b>-V        </b>Specify that all of the environment variables of the
                 process are exported to the context of the batch job.

                 The <i>qsub</i> utility shall place every environment variable
                 in the process in which the utility is executing in the
                 list and shall set the value of each variable in the
                 attribute to the value of that variable in the process.

       <b>-z        </b>Specify that the utility does not write the batch
                 <i>job_identifier</i> of the created batch job to standard
                 output.

                 If the <b>-z </b>option is presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility, the
                 utility shall not write the batch <i>job_identifier</i> of the
                 created batch job to standard output.

                 If the <b>-z </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility,
                 the utility shall write the identifier of the created
                 batch job to standard output.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qsub</i> utility shall accept a <i>script</i> operand that indicates the
       path to the script of the batch job.

       If the <i>script</i> operand is not presented to the <i>qsub</i> utility, or if
       the operand is the single-character string <b>'-'</b>, the utility shall
       read the script from standard input.

       If the script represents a partial path, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall
       expand the path relative to the current directory of the process
       executing the utility.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qsub</i> utility reads the script of the batch job from standard
       input if the script operand is omitted or is the single character
       <b>'-'</b>.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to binding the file indicated by the <i>script</i> operand
       to the batch job, the <i>qsub</i> utility reads the script file and acts
       on directives in the script.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>qsub</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LOGNAME</i>   Determine the login name of the user.

       <i>PBS_DPREFIX</i>
                 Determine the default prefix for directives within the
                 script.

       <i>SHELL</i>     Determine the pathname of the preferred command
                 language interpreter of the user.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone used to interpret the <i>date-time</i>
                 option-argument. If <i>TZ</i> is unset or null, an unspecified
                 default timezone shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Once created, a batch job exists until it exits, aborts, or is

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Script Preservation</b>
       The <i>qsub</i> utility shall make the script available to the server
       executing the batch job in such a way that the server executes
       the script as it exists at the time of submission.

       The <i>qsub</i> utility can send a copy of the script to the server with
       the <i>Queue Job Request</i> or store a temporary copy of the script in
       a location specified to the server.

   <b>Option Specification</b>
       A script can contain directives to the <i>qsub</i> utility.

       The <i>qsub</i> utility shall scan the lines of the script for
       directives, skipping blank lines, until the first line that
       begins with a string other than the directive string; if
       directives occur on subsequent lines, the utility shall ignore
       those directives.

       Lines are separated by a &lt;newline&gt;.  If the first line of the
       script begins with <b>"#!" </b>or a &lt;colon&gt; (<b>':'</b>), then it is skipped.
       The <i>qsub</i> utility shall process a line in the script as a
       directive if and only if the string of characters from the first
       non-white-space character on the line until the first &lt;space&gt; or
       &lt;tab&gt; on the line match the directive prefix. If a line in the
       script contains a directive and the final characters of the line
       are &lt;backslash&gt; and &lt;newline&gt;, then the next line shall be
       interpreted as a continuation of that directive.

       The <i>qsub</i> utility shall process the options and option-arguments
       contained on the directive prefix line using the same syntax as
       if the options were input on the <i>qsub</i> utility.

       The <i>qsub</i> utility shall continue to process a directive prefix
       line until after a &lt;newline&gt; is encountered. An implementation
       may ignore lines which, according to the syntax of the shell that
       will interpret the script, are comments.  An implementation shall
       describe in the conformance document the format of any shell
       comments that it will recognize.

       If an option is present in both a directive and the arguments to
       the <i>qsub</i> utility, the utility shall ignore the option and the
       corresponding option-argument, if any, in the directive.

       If an option that is present in the directive is not present in
       the arguments to the <i>qsub</i> utility, the utility shall process the
       option and the option-argument, if any.

       In order of preference, the <i>qsub</i> utility shall select the
       directive prefix from one of the following sources:

        *  If the <b>-C </b>option is presented to the utility, the value of
           the <i>directive_prefix</i> option-argument

        *  If the environment variable <i>PBS_DPREFIX</i> is defined, the value
           of that variable

        *  The four-character string <b>"#PBS" </b>encoded in the portable
           character set

       If the <b>-C </b>option is present in the script file it shall be
       ignored.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qsub</i> utility allows users to create a batch job that will
       process the script specified as the operand of the utility.

       The options of the <i>qsub</i> utility allow users to control many
       aspects of the queuing and execution of a batch job.

       The <b>-a </b>option allows users to designate the time after which the
       batch job will become eligible to run. By specifying an execution
       time, users can take advantage of resources at off-peak hours,
       synchronize jobs with chronologically predictable events, and
       perhaps take advantage of off-peak pricing of computing time. For
       these reasons and others, a timing option is existing practice on
       the part of almost every batch system, including NQS.

       The <b>-A </b>option allows users to specify the account that will be
       charged for the batch job. Support for account is not mandatory
       for conforming batch servers.

       The <b>-C </b>option allows users to prescribe the prefix for directives
       within the script file. The default prefix <b>"#PBS" </b>may be
       inappropriate if the script will be interpreted with an alternate
       shell, as specified by the <b>-S </b>option.

       The <b>-c </b>option allows users to establish the checkpointing
       interval for their jobs. A checkpointing system, which is not
       defined by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, allows recovery of a
       batch job at the most recent checkpoint in the event of a crash.
       Checkpointing is typically used for jobs that consume expensive
       computing time or must meet a critical schedule. Users should be
       allowed to make the tradeoff between the overhead of
       checkpointing and the risk to the timely completion of the batch
       job; therefore, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 provides the
       checkpointing interval option. Support for checkpointing is
       optional for batch servers.

       The <b>-e </b>option allows users to redirect the standard error streams
       of their jobs to a non-default path. For example, if the
       submitted script generally produces a great deal of useless error
       output, a user might redirect the standard error output to the
       null device. Or, if the file system holding the default location
       (the home directory of the user) has too little free space, the
       user might redirect the standard error stream to a file in
       another file system.

       The <b>-h </b>option allows users to create a batch job that is held
       until explicitly released. The ability to create a held job is
       useful when some external event must complete before the batch
       job can execute. For example, the user might submit a held job
       and release it when the system load has dropped.

       The <b>-j </b>option allows users to merge the standard error of a batch
       job into its standard output stream, which has the advantage of
       showing the sequential relationship between output and error
       messages.

       The <b>-m </b>option allows users to designate those points in the
       execution of a batch job at which mail will be sent to the
       submitting user, or to the account(s) indicated by the <b>-M </b>option.
       By requesting mail notification at points of interest in the life
       of a job, the submitting user, or other designated users, can
       track the progress of a batch job.

       The <b>-N </b>option allows users to associate a name with the batch
       job. The job name in no way affects the processing of the batch
       job, but rather serves as a mnemonic handle for users. For
       example, the batch job name can help the user distinguish between
       multiple jobs listed by the <i>qstat</i> utility.

       The <b>-o </b>option allows users to redirect the standard output
       stream. A user might, for example, wish to redirect to the null
       device the standard output stream of a job that produces copious
       yet superfluous output.

       The <b>-P </b>option allows users to designate the relative priority of
       a batch job for selection from a queue.

       The <b>-q </b>option allows users to specify an initial queue for the
       batch job. If the user specifies a routing queue, the batch
       server routes the batch job to another queue for execution or
       further routing. If the user specifies a non-routing queue, the
       batch server of the queue eventually executes the batch job.

       The <b>-r </b>option allows users to control whether the submitted job
       will be rerun if the controlling batch node fails during
       execution of the batch job.  The <b>-r </b>option likewise allows users
       to indicate whether or not the batch job is eligible to be rerun
       by the <i>qrerun</i> utility. Some jobs cannot be correctly rerun
       because of changes they make in the state of databases or other
       aspects of their environment.  This volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       specifies that the default, if the <b>-r </b>option is not presented to
       the utility, will be that the batch job cannot be rerun, since
       the result of rerunning a non-rerunnable job might be
       catastrophic.

       The <b>-S </b>option allows users to specify the program (usually a
       shell) that will be invoked to process the script of the batch
       job. This option has been modified to allow a list of shell names
       and locations associated with different hosts.

       The <b>-u </b>option is useful when the submitting user is authorized to
       use more than one account on a given host, in which case the <b>-u</b>
       option allows the user to select from among those accounts. The
       option-argument is a list of user-host pairs, so that the
       submitting user can provide different user identifiers for
       different nodes in the event the batch job is routed. The <b>-u</b>
       option provides a lot of flexibility to accommodate sites with
       complex account structures. Users that have the same user
       identifier on all the hosts they are authorized to use will not
       need to use the <b>-u </b>option.

       The <b>-V </b>option allows users to export all their current
       environment variables, as of the time the batch job is submitted,
       to the context of the processes of the batch job.

       The <b>-v </b>option allows users to export specific environment
       variables from their current process to the processes of the
       batch job.

       The <b>-z </b>option allows users to suppress the writing of the batch
       job identifier to standard output. The <b>-z </b>option is an existing
       NQS practice that has been standardized.

       Historically, the <i>qsub</i> utility has served the batch job-
       submission function in the NQS system, the existing practice on
       which it is based. Some changes and additions have been made to
       the <i>qsub</i> utility in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>vis-a-vis</i> NQS,
       as a result of the growing pool of experience with distributed
       batch systems.

       The set of features of the <i>qsub</i> utility as defined in this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 appears to incorporate all the common existing
       practice on potentially conforming platforms.
