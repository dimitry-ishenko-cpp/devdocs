DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The script reads a configuration file that may contain so-called
       guards, file names, and comments, and writes those file names
       that satisfy all guards to standard output. The script takes a
       list of symbols as its arguments. Each line in the configuration
       file is processed separately. Lines may start with a number of
       guards. The following guards are defined:

           +<i>xxx</i> Include the file(s) on this line if the symbol <i>xxx</i> is
           defined.

           -<i>xxx</i> Exclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol <i>xxx</i> is
           defined.

           +!<i>xxx</i> Include the file(s) on this line if the symbol <i>xxx</i> is
           not defined.

           -!<i>xxx</i> Exclude the file(s) on this line if the symbol <i>xxx</i> is
           not defined.

           - Exclude this file. Used to avoid spurious <i>--check</i> messages.

       The guards are processed left to right. The last guard that
       matches determines if the file is included. If no guard is
       specified, the <i>--default</i> setting determines if the file is
       included.

       If no configuration file is specified, the script reads from
       standard input.

       The <i>--check</i> option is used to compare the specification file
       against the file system. If files are referenced in the
       specification that do not exist, or if files are not enlisted in
       the specification file warnings are printed. The <i>--path</i> option
       can be used to specify which directory or directories to scan.
       Multiple directories are separated by a colon (":") character.
       The <i>--prefix</i> option specifies the location of the files.
       Alternatively, the <i>--path=@&lt;file&gt;</i> syntax can be used to specify a
       file from which the file names will be read.

       Use <i>--list</i> to list all files independent of any rules. Use
       <i>--invert-match</i> to list only the excluded patches. Use
       <i>--with-guards</i> to also include all inclusion and exclusion rules.
