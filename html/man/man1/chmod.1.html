       chmod - change file mode bits
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>chmod </b>[<i>OPTION</i>]... <i>MODE</i>[<i>,MODE</i>]... <i>FILE</i>...
       <b>chmod </b>[<i>OPTION</i>]... <i>OCTAL-MODE FILE</i>...
       <b>chmod </b>[<i>OPTION</i>]... <i>--reference=RFILE FILE</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>chmod</b>.  <b>chmod</b>
       changes the file mode bits of each given file according to <i>mode</i>,
       which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make,
       or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode
       bits.

       The format of a symbolic mode is [<b>ugoa</b>...][[<b>-+=</b>][<i>perms</i>...]...],
       where <i>perms</i> is either zero or more letters from the set <b>rwxXst</b>,
       or a single letter from the set <b>ugo</b>.  Multiple symbolic modes can
       be given, separated by commas.

       A combination of the letters <b>ugoa </b>controls which users' access to
       the file will be changed: the user who owns it (<b>u</b>), other users
       in the file's group (<b>g</b>), other users not in the file's group (<b>o</b>),
       or all users (<b>a</b>).  If none of these are given, the effect is as
       if (<b>a</b>) were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not
       affected.

       The operator <b>+ </b>causes the selected file mode bits to be added to
       the existing file mode bits of each file; <b>- </b>causes them to be
       removed; and <b>= </b>causes them to be added and causes unmentioned
       bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user
       and group ID bits are not affected.

       The letters <b>rwxXst </b>select file mode bits for the affected users:
       read (<b>r</b>), write (<b>w</b>), execute (or search for directories) (<b>x</b>),
       execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has
       execute permission for some user (<b>X</b>), set user or group ID on
       execution (<b>s</b>), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (<b>t</b>).
       Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly
       one of the letters <b>ugo</b>: the permissions granted to the user who
       owns the file (<b>u</b>), the permissions granted to other users who are
       members of the file's group (<b>g</b>), and the permissions granted to
       users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (<b>o</b>).

       A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by
       adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are
       assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set
       user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or
       sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for
       the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1);
       the third selects permissions for other users in the file's
       group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not
       in the file's group, with the same values.

       <b>chmod </b>doesn't change the permissions of symbolic links; the <b>chmod</b>
       system call cannot change their permissions on most systems, and
       most systems ignore permissions of symbolic links.  However, for
       each symbolic link listed on the command line, <b>chmod </b>changes the
       permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, <b>chmod </b>ignores
       symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.
       Options that modify this behavior are described in the <b>OPTIONS</b>
       section.
</pre> <h2>
SETUID AND SETGID BITS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>chmod </b>clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's
       group ID does not match the user's effective group ID or one of
       the user's supplementary group IDs, unless the user has
       appropriate privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause the
       set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of <i>MODE</i> or <i>RFILE</i> to be ignored.
       This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the
       underlying <b>chmod </b>system call.  When in doubt, check the
       underlying system behavior.

       For directories <b>chmod </b>preserves set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits
       unless you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or clear
       the bits with symbolic modes like <b>u+s </b>and <b>g-s</b>.  To clear these
       bits for directories with a numeric mode requires an additional
       leading zero like <b>00755</b>, leading minus like <b>-6000</b>, or leading
       equals like <b>=755</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT </h2>
<pre>
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose
       interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it
       prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in
       the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is
       called the <i>restricted deletion flag</i> for the directory, and is
       commonly found on world-writable directories like <b>/tmp</b>.  For
       regular files on some older systems, the bit saves the program's
       text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when
       run; this is called the <i>sticky bit</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With <b>--reference</b>, change
       the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--changes</b>
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              suppress most error messages

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       <b>--dereference</b>
              affect the referent of each symbolic link, rather than the
              symbolic link itself

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--no-dereference</b>
              affect each symbolic link, rather than the referent

       <b>--no-preserve-root</b>
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       <b>--preserve-root</b>
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       <b>--reference</b>=<i>RFILE</i>
              use RFILE's mode instead of specifying MODE values.  RFILE
              is always dereferenced if a symbolic link.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
              change files and directories recursively

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when
       the <b>-R </b>option is also specified.  If more than one is specified,
       only the final one takes effect. '-H' is the default.

       <b>-H     </b>if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a
              directory, traverse it

       <b>-L     </b>traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       <b>-P     </b>do not traverse any symbolic links

       <b>--help </b>display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form
       '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.
