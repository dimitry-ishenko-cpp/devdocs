DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcp-iostat </b>reports I/O statistics for SCSI (by default) or other
       devices (if the <b>-x </b>option is specified).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       When invoked via the <a href="pcp.1.html">pcp(1)</a> command, the <i>pcp options</i> <b>-A</b>/<b>--align</b>,
       <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>, <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>, <b>-S</b>/<b>--start</b>, <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>,
       <b>-T</b>/<b>--finish</b>, <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>, <b>-v</b>/<b>--version</b>, <b>-Z</b>/<b>--timezone </b>and
       <b>-z</b>/<b>--hostzone </b>become indirectly available; refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>
       for a complete description of these options.

       The additional command line options available for <b>pcp-iostat </b>are:

       <b>-G </b><i>method</i>, <b>--aggregate</b>=<i>method</i>
            Specifies that statistics for device names matching the reg‐
            ular expression specified with the <b>-R </b><i>regex</i> option should be
            aggregated according to <i>method</i>.  Note this is aggregation
            based on matching device names (not temporal aggregation).
            When <b>-G </b>is used, the device name column is reported as
            <i>method</i>(<i>regex</i>), e.g.  if <b>-G sum -R 'sd(a|b)$' </b>is specified,
            the device column will be <b>sum</b>(<b>sd(a|b)$) </b>and summed statis‐
            tics for <b>sda </b>and <b>sdb </b>will be reported in the remaining
            columns.  If <b>-G </b>is specified but <b>-R </b>is not specified, then
            the default <i>regex</i> is <b>.*</b>, i.e. matching all device names.  If
            <i>method</i> is <b>sum </b>then the statistics are summed.  This includes
            the <b>%util </b>column, which may therefore exceed 100% if more
            than one device name matches.  If <i>method</i> is <b>avg </b>then the
            statistics are summed and then averaged by dividing by the
            number of matching device names.  If <i>method</i> is <b>min </b>or <b>max</b>,
            the minimum or maximum statistics for matching devices are
            reported, respectively.

       <b>-P </b><i>N</i>, <b>--precision</b>=<i>N</i>
            This indicates the precision (number of decimal places) to
            report.  The default precision <i>N</i> may be set to something
            other than the default (2).  Note that the <b>avgrq-sz </b>and
            <b>avgqu-sz </b>fields are always reported with <i>N</i>+1 decimals of
            precision.  These fields typically have values less than 1.

       <b>-R </b><i>pattern</i>, <b>--regex</b>=<i>pattern</i>
            This restricts the report to device names matching a regular
            expression <i>pattern</i>.  The given <i>pattern</i> is searched as a perl
            style regular expression, and will match any portion of a
            device name.  e.g. '^sd[a-zA-Z]+' will match all device
            names starting with 'sd' followed by one or more alphabetic
            characters.  e.g. '^sd(a|b)$' will only match 'sda' and
            'sdb'.  e.g. 'sda$' will match 'sda' but not 'sdab'.  See
            also the <b>-G </b>option for aggregation options.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--no-interpolation</b>
            When replaying a set of archives, by default values are re‐
            ported according to the requested sample interval (<b>-t </b>op‐
            tion), not according to the actual interval recorded in the
            archive(s).  Without this option PCP interpolates the values
            to be reported based on the records in the set of archives,
            which is particularly useful when the <b>-t </b>option is used to
            replay a set of archives with a longer sampling interval
            than that with which the archive(s) was originally recorded
            with.  With the <b>-u </b>option, uninterpolated reporting is en‐
            abled - every value is reported according to the native
            recording interval in the set of archives.  When the <b>-u </b>op‐
            tion is specified, the <b>-t </b>option makes no sense and is in‐
            compatible because the replay interval is always the same as
            the recording interval in the set of archive.  In addition,
            <b>-u </b>only makes sense when replaying archives, see the <b>-a </b>op‐
            tion on <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>, and so if <b>-u </b>is specified then <b>-a </b>must
            also be specified.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Display version number and exit.

       <b>-x </b><i>comma-separated-options</i>
            Specifies a comma-separated list of one or more extended re‐
            porting options as follows:
            <b>dm </b>- report statistics for device-mapper logical devices in‐
            stead of SCSI devices,
            <b>t </b>- prefix every line in the report with a timestamp in
            <i>ctime</i>(3) format,
            <b>h </b>- omit the heading, which is otherwise reported every 24
            samples,
            <b>noidle </b>- Do not display statistics for idle devices.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.

REPORT </h2>
<pre>
       The columns in the <b>pcp-iostat </b>report have the following interpre‐
       tation:

       <b>Timestamp</b>
              When the <b>-x t </b>option is specified, this column is the
              timestamp in <a href="../man3/ctime.3.html">ctime(3)</a> format.

       <b>Device </b>Specifies the scsi device name, or if <b>-x dm </b>is specified,
              the device-mapper logical device name.  When <b>-G </b>is speci‐
              fied, this is replaced by the aggregation method and regu‐
              lar expression - see the <b>-G </b>and <b>-R </b>options above.

       <b>rrqm/s </b>The number of read requests expressed as a rate per-second
              that were merged during the reporting interval by the I/O
              scheduler.

       <b>wrqm/s </b>The number of write requests expressed as a rate per-sec‐
              ond that were merged during the reporting interval by the
              I/O scheduler.

       <b>r/s    </b>The number of read requests completed by the device (after
              merges), expressed as a rate per second during the report‐
              ing interval.

       <b>w/s    </b>The number of write requests completed by the device (af‐
              ter merges), expressed as a rate per second during the re‐
              porting interval.

       <b>rkB/s  </b>The average volume of data read from the device expressed
              as KBytes/second during the reporting interval.

       <b>wkB/s  </b>The average volume of data written to the device expressed
              as KBytes/second during the reporting interval.

       <b>avgrq-sz</b>
              The average I/O request size for both reads and writes to
              the device expressed as Kbytes during the reporting inter‐
              val.

       <b>avgqu-sz</b>
              The average queue length of read and write requests to the
              device during the reporting interval.

       <b>await  </b>The average time in milliseconds that read and write re‐
              quests were queued (and serviced) to the device during the
              reporting interval.

       <b>r_await</b>
              The average time in milliseconds that read requests were
              queued (and serviced) to the device during the reporting
              interval.

       <b>w_await</b>
              The average time in milliseconds that write requests were
              queued (and serviced) to the device during the reporting
              interval.

       <b>%util  </b>The percentage of time during the reporting interval that
              the device was busy processing requests.  A value of 100%
              indicates device saturation.

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to parameter‐
       ize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installa‐
       tion, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values for these
       variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to specify an al‐
       ternative configuration file, as described in <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
