</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-cherry - Find commits yet to be applied to upstream
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git cherry</i> [-v] [&lt;upstream&gt; [&lt;head&gt; [&lt;limit&gt;]]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Determine whether there are commits in <b>&lt;head&gt;..&lt;upstream&gt; </b>that
       are equivalent to those in the range <b>&lt;limit&gt;..&lt;head&gt;</b>.

       The equivalence test is based on the diff, after removing
       whitespace and line numbers. git-cherry therefore detects when
       commits have been "copied" by means of <a href="git-cherry-pick.1.html">git-cherry-pick(1)</a>,
       <a href="git-am.1.html">git-am(1)</a> or <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a>.

       Outputs the SHA1 of every commit in <b>&lt;limit&gt;..&lt;head&gt;</b>, prefixed
       with <b>- </b>for commits that have an equivalent in &lt;upstream&gt;, and <b>+</b>
       for commits that do not.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -v
           Show the commit subjects next to the SHA1s.

       &lt;upstream&gt;
           Upstream branch to search for equivalent commits. Defaults to
           the upstream branch of HEAD.

       &lt;head&gt;
           Working branch; defaults to HEAD.

       &lt;limit&gt;
           Do not report commits up to (and including) limit.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Patch workflows</b>
       git-cherry is frequently used in patch-based workflows (see
       <a href="../man7/gitworkflows.7.html">gitworkflows(7)</a>) to determine if a series of patches has been
       applied by the upstream maintainer. In such a workflow you might
       create and send a topic branch like this:

           $ git checkout -b topic origin/master
           # work and create some commits
           $ git format-patch origin/master
           $ git send-email ... 00*

       Later, you can see whether your changes have been applied by
       saying (still on <b>topic</b>):

           $ git fetch  # update your notion of origin/master
           $ git cherry -v

   <b>Concrete example</b>
       In a situation where topic consisted of three commits, and the
       maintainer applied two of them, the situation might look like:

           $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --boundary origin/master...topic
           * 7654321 (origin/master) upstream tip commit
           [... snip some other commits ...]
           * cccc111 cherry-pick of C
           * aaaa111 cherry-pick of A
           [... snip a lot more that has happened ...]
           | * cccc000 (topic) commit C
           | * bbbb000 commit B
           | * aaaa000 commit A
           |/
           o 1234567 branch point

       In such cases, git-cherry shows a concise summary of what has yet
       to be applied:

           $ git cherry origin/master topic
           - cccc000... commit C
           + bbbb000... commit B
           - aaaa000... commit A

       Here, we see that the commits A and C (marked with <b>-</b>) can be
       dropped from your <b>topic </b>branch when you rebase it on top of
       <b>origin/master</b>, while the commit B (marked with <b>+</b>) still needs to
       be kept so that it will be sent to be applied to <b>origin/master</b>.

   <b>Using a limit</b>
       The optional &lt;limit&gt; is useful in cases where your topic is based
       on other work that is not in upstream. Expanding on the previous
       example, this might look like:

           $ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --boundary origin/master...topic
           * 7654321 (origin/master) upstream tip commit
           [... snip some other commits ...]
           * cccc111 cherry-pick of C
           * aaaa111 cherry-pick of A
           [... snip a lot more that has happened ...]
           | * cccc000 (topic) commit C
           | * bbbb000 commit B
           | * aaaa000 commit A
           | * 0000fff (base) unpublished stuff F
           [... snip ...]
           | * 0000aaa unpublished stuff A
           |/
           o 1234567 merge-base between upstream and topic

       By specifying <b>base </b>as the limit, you can avoid listing commits
       between <b>base </b>and <b>topic</b>:

           $ git cherry origin/master topic base
           - cccc000... commit C
           + bbbb000... commit B
           - aaaa000... commit A
