PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       unget — undo a previous get of an SCCS file (<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       unget <b>[</b>-ns<b>] [</b>-r <i>SID</i><b>] </b><i>file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>unget</i> utility shall reverse the effect of a <i>get</i> <b>-e </b>done prior
       to creating the intended new delta.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>unget</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-r </b><i>SID</i>    Uniquely identify which delta is no longer intended.
                 (This would have been specified by <i>get</i> as the new
                 delta.) The use of this option is necessary only if two
                 or more outstanding <i>get</i> commands for editing on the
                 same SCCS file were done by the same person (login
                 name).

       <b>-s        </b>Suppress the writing to standard output of the intended
                 delta's SID.

       <b>-n        </b>Retain the file that was obtained by <i>get</i>, which would
                 normally be removed from the current directory.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
                 <i>file</i> is a directory, the <i>unget</i> utility shall behave as
                 though each file in the directory were specified as a
                 named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
                 of the pathname does not begin with <b>s.</b>)  and unreadable
                 files shall be silently ignored.

                 If exactly one <i>file</i> operand appears, and it is <b>'-'</b>, the
                 standard input shall be read; each line of the standard
                 input shall be taken to be the name of an SCCS file to
                 be processed. Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall
                 be silently ignored.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be a text file used only when the <i>file</i>
       operand is specified as <b>'-'</b>.  Each line of the text file shall be
       interpreted as an SCCS pathname.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Any SCCS files processed shall be files of an unspecified format.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>unget</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The standard output shall consist of a line for each file, in the
       following format:

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>SID removed from file</i>&gt;

       If there is more than one named file or if a directory or
       standard input is named, each pathname shall be written before
       each of the preceding lines:

           "\n%s:\n", &lt;<i>pathname</i>&gt;
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Any SCCS files updated shall be files of an unspecified format.
       During processing of a <i>file</i>, a locking <i>z-file</i>, as described in
       <i>get</i>, and a <i>q-file</i> (a working copy of the <i>p-file</i>), may be created
       and deleted. The <i>p-file</i> and <i>g-file</i>, as described in <i>get</i>, shall be
       deleted.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
