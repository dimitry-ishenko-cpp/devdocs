<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       chmod — change the file modes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       chmod <b>[</b>-R<b>] </b><i>mode file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>chmod</i> utility shall change any or all of the file mode bits
       of the file named by each <i>file</i> operand in the way specified by
       the <i>mode</i> operand.

       It is implementation-defined whether and how the <i>chmod</i> utility
       affects any alternate or additional file access control mechanism
       (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 4.5</i>,
       <i>File Access Permissions</i>) being used for the specified file.

       Only a process whose effective user ID matches the user ID of the
       file, or a process with appropriate privileges, shall be
       permitted to change the file mode bits of a file.

       Upon successfully changing the file mode bits of a file, the
       <i>chmod</i> utility shall mark for update the last file status change
       timestamp of the file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>chmod</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-R        </b>Recursively change file mode bits. For each <i>file</i>
                 operand that names a directory, <i>chmod</i> shall change the
                 file mode bits of the directory and all files in the
                 file hierarchy below it.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>mode</i>      Represents the change to be made to the file mode bits
                 of each file named by one of the <i>file</i> operands; see the
                 EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file whose file mode bits shall be
                 modified.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>chmod</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mode</i> operand shall be either a <i>symbolic_mode</i> expression or a
       non-negative octal integer. The <i>symbolic_mode</i> form is described
       by the grammar later in this section.

       Each <b>clause </b>shall specify an operation to be performed on the
       current file mode bits of each <i>file</i>.  The operations shall be
       performed on each <i>file</i> in the order in which the <b>clause</b>s are
       specified.

       The <b>who </b>symbols <b>u</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>o </b>shall specify the <i>user</i>, <i>group</i>, and
       <i>other</i> parts of the file mode bits, respectively. A <b>who </b>consisting
       of the symbol <b>a </b>shall be equivalent to <b>ugo</b>.

       The <b>perm </b>symbols <b>r</b>, <b>w</b>, and <b>x </b>represent the <i>read</i>, <i>write</i>, and
       <i>execute</i>/<i>search</i> portions of file mode bits, respectively. The <b>perm</b>
       symbol <b>s </b>shall represent the <i>set-user-ID-on-execution</i> (when <b>who</b>
       contains or implies <b>u</b>) and <i>set-group-ID-on-execution</i> (when <b>who</b>
       contains or implies <b>g</b>) bits.

       The <b>perm </b>symbol <b>X </b>shall represent the execute/search portion of
       the file mode bits if the file is a directory or if the current
       (unmodified) file mode bits have at least one of the execute bits
       (S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH) set. It shall be ignored if the
       file is not a directory and none of the execute bits are set in
       the current file mode bits.

       The <b>permcopy </b>symbols <b>u</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>o </b>shall represent the current
       permissions associated with the user, group, and other parts of
       the file mode bits, respectively. For the remainder of this
       section, <b>perm </b>refers to the non-terminals <b>perm </b>and <b>permcopy </b>in
       the grammar.

       If multiple <b>actionlist</b>s are grouped with a single <b>wholist </b>in the
       grammar, each <b>actionlist </b>shall be applied in the order specified
       with that <b>wholist</b>.  The <i>op</i> symbols shall represent the operation
       performed, as follows:

       +     If <b>perm </b>is not specified, the <b>'+' </b>operation shall not
             change the file mode bits.

             If <b>who </b>is not specified, the file mode bits represented by
             <b>perm </b>for the owner, group, and other permissions, except
             for those with corresponding bits in the file mode creation
             mask of the invoking process, shall be set.

             Otherwise, the file mode bits represented by the specified
             <b>who </b>and <b>perm </b>values shall be set.

       -     If <b>perm </b>is not specified, the <b>'-' </b>operation shall not
             change the file mode bits.

             If <b>who </b>is not specified, the file mode bits represented by
             <b>perm </b>for the owner, group, and other permissions, except
             for those with corresponding bits in the file mode creation
             mask of the invoking process, shall be cleared.

             Otherwise, the file mode bits represented by the specified
             <b>who </b>and <b>perm </b>values shall be cleared.

       =     Clear the file mode bits specified by the <b>who </b>value, or, if
             no <b>who </b>value is specified, all of the file mode bits
             specified in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

             If <b>perm </b>is not specified, the <b>'=' </b>operation shall make no
             further modifications to the file mode bits.

             If <b>who </b>is not specified, the file mode bits represented by
             <b>perm </b>for the owner, group, and other permissions, except
             for those with corresponding bits in the file mode creation
             mask of the invoking process, shall be set.

             Otherwise, the file mode bits represented by the specified
             <b>who </b>and <b>perm </b>values shall be set.

       When using the symbolic mode form on a regular file, it is
       implementation-defined whether or not:

        *  Requests to set the set-user-ID-on-execution or set-group-ID-
           on-execution bit when all execute bits are currently clear
           and none are being set are ignored.

        *  Requests to clear all execute bits also clear the set-user-
           ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution bits.

        *  Requests to clear the set-user-ID-on-execution or set-group-
           ID-on-execution bits when all execute bits are currently
           clear are ignored. However, if the command <i>ls</i> <b>-l </b><i>file</i> writes
           an <i>s</i> in the position indicating that the set-user-ID-on-
           execution or set-group-ID-on-execution is set, the commands
           <i>chmod</i> <b>u-s </b><i>file</i> or <i>chmod</i> <b>g-s </b><i>file</i>, respectively, shall not be
           ignored.

       When using the symbolic mode form on other file types, it is
       implementation-defined whether or not requests to set or clear
       the set-user-ID-on-execution or set-group-ID-on-execution bits
       are honored.

       If the <b>who </b>symbol <b>o </b>is used in conjunction with the <b>perm </b>symbol <b>s</b>
       with no other <b>who </b>symbols being specified, the set-user-ID-on-
       execution and set-group-ID-on-execution bits shall not be
       modified. It shall not be an error to specify the <b>who </b>symbol <b>o </b>in
       conjunction with the <b>perm </b>symbol <b>s</b>.

       The <b>perm </b>symbol <b>t </b>shall specify the S_ISVTX bit. When used with a
       file of type directory, it can be used with the <b>who </b>symbol <b>a</b>, or
       with no <b>who </b>symbol. It shall not be an error to specify a <b>who</b>
       symbol of <b>u</b>, <b>g</b>, or <b>o </b>in conjunction with the <b>perm </b>symbol <b>t</b>, but
       the meaning of these combinations is unspecified. The effect when
       using the <b>perm </b>symbol <b>t </b>with any file type other than directory
       is unspecified.

       For an octal integer <i>mode</i> operand, the file mode bits shall be
       set absolutely.

       For each bit set in the octal number, the corresponding file
       permission bit shown in the following table shall be set; all
       other file permission bits shall be cleared. For regular files,
       for each bit set in the octal number corresponding to the set-
       user-ID-on-execution or the set-group-ID-on-execution, bits shown
       in the following table shall be set; if these bits are not set in
       the octal number, they are cleared. For other file types, it is
       implementation-defined whether or not requests to set or clear
       the set-user-ID-on-execution or set-group-ID-on-execution bits
       are honored.

   <b>Grammar for chmod</b>
       The grammar and lexical conventions in this section describe the
       syntax for the <i>symbolic_mode</i> operand. The general conventions for
       this style of grammar are described in <i>Section 1.3</i>, <i>Grammar</i>
       <i>Conventions</i>.  A valid <i>symbolic_mode</i> can be represented as the
       non-terminal symbol <i>symbolic_mode</i> in the grammar. This formal
       syntax shall take precedence over the preceding text syntax
       description.

       The lexical processing is based entirely on single characters.
       Implementations need not allow &lt;blank&gt; characters within the
       single argument being processed.

</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Some implementations of the <i>chmod</i> utility change the mode of a
       directory before the files in the directory when performing a
       recursive (<b>-R </b>option) change; others change the directory mode
       after the files in the directory. If an application tries to
       remove read or search permission for a file hierarchy, the
       removal attempt fails if the directory is changed first; on the
       other hand, trying to re-enable permissions to a restricted
       hierarchy fails if directories are changed last. Users should not
       try to make a hierarchy inaccessible to themselves.

       Some implementations of <i>chmod</i> never used the <i>umask</i> of the process
       when changing modes; systems conformant with this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 do so when <b>who </b>is not specified. Note the difference
       between:

           chmod a-w file

       which removes all write permissions, and:

           chmod -- -w file

       which removes write permissions that would be allowed if <b>file </b>was
       created with the same <i>umask</i>.

       Conforming applications should never assume that they know how
       the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on directories are
       interpreted.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The  functionality  of  <i>chmod</i>  is described substantially through
       references to concepts defined in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. In this way, there is less  duplication  of  effort
       required for describing the interactions of permissions. However,
       the  behavior  of  this  utility is not described in terms of the
       <i>chmod</i>()  function  from   the   System   Interfaces   volume   of
       POSIX.1‐2017  because  that  specification requires certain side-
       effects upon alternate file access control mechanisms that  might
       not be appropriate, depending on the implementation.

       Implementations that support mandatory file and record locking as
       specified  by  the 1984 /usr/group standard historically used the
       combination of set-group-ID bit set and group execute  bit  clear
       to  indicate  mandatory locking. This condition is usually set or
       cleared with the symbolic mode <b>perm </b>symbol <b>l </b>instead of the  <b>perm</b>
       symbols <b>s </b>and <b>x </b>so that the mandatory locking mode is not changed
       without explicit indication that that was what the user intended.
       Therefore,  the  details  on  how the implementation treats these
       conditions must be defined in the documentation. This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017  does  not  require  mandatory locking (nor does the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017), but does allow  it  as
       an  extension.  However, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does require
       that the <i>ls</i> and <i>chmod</i> utilities work consistently in  this  area.
       If  <i>ls</i>  <b>-l </b><i>file</i> indicates that the set-group-ID bit is set, <i>chmod</i>
       <b>g-s </b><i>file</i> must clear it (assuming appropriate privileges exist  to
       change modes).

       The  System  V  and BSD versions use different exit status codes.
       Some implementations used the exit  status  as  a  count  of  the
       number of errors that occurred; this practice is unworkable since
       it  can  overflow  the  range  of  valid exit status values. This
       problem is avoided here by specifying  only  0  and  &gt;0  as  exit
       values.

       The  System  Interfaces  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017  indicates that
       implementation-defined restrictions may  cause  the  S_ISUID  and
       S_ISGID  bits  to  be ignored. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 allows
       the <i>chmod</i> utility to choose to modify these bits  before  calling
       <i>chmod</i>()  (or some function providing equivalent capabilities) for
       non-regular   files.   Among   other    things,    this    allows
       implementations that use the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on
       directories   to   enable   extended  features  to  handle  these
       extensions in an intelligent manner.

       The <b>X perm </b>symbol was adopted from BSD-based systems  because  it
       provides  commonly desired functionality when doing recursive (<b>-R</b>
       option) modifications. Similar functionality is not  provided  by
       the <i>find</i> utility. Historical BSD versions of <i>chmod</i>, however, only
       supported  <b>X  </b>with  <i>op</i>+;  it  has been extended in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 because it is also useful with <i>op</i>=.   (It  has  also
       been  added  for  <i>op</i>-  even though it duplicates <b>x</b>, in this case,
       because it is intuitive and easier to explain.)

       The grammar was extended with the <i>permcopy</i> non-terminal to  allow
       historical-practice forms of symbolic modes like <b>o</b>=<b>u -g </b>(that is,
       set  the  ``other''  permissions  to the permissions of ``owner''
       minus the permissions of ``group'').
