NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-vpick - Resolve paths to ".v/" versioned directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>systemd-vpick [OPTIONS...] [PATH...]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-vpick </b>resolves a file system path referencing a ".v/"
       versioned directory to a path to the newest (by version) file
       contained therein. This tool provides a command line interface
       for the <a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v(7)</a> logic.

       The tool expects a path to a ".v/" directory as argument (either
       directly, or with a triple underscore pattern as final
       component). It then determines the newest file contained in that
       directory, and writes its path to standard output.

       Unless the triple underscore pattern is passed as last component
       of the path, it is typically necessary to at least specify the
       <b>--suffix= </b>switch to configure the file suffix to look for.

       If the specified path does not reference a ".v/" path (i.e.
       neither the final component ends in ".v", nor the penultimate
       does or the final one does contain a triple underscore) it
       specified path is written unmodified to standard output.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--basename=</b>, <b>-B</b>
           Overrides the "basename" of the files to look for, i.e. the
           part to the left of the variable part of the filenames.
           Normally this is derived automatically from the filename of
           the ".v" component of the specified path, or from the triple
           underscore pattern in the last component of the specified
           path.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>-V</b>
           Explicitly configures the version to select. If specified, a
           filename with the specified version string will be looked
           for, instead of the newest version available.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>-A</b>
           Explicitly configures the architecture to select. If
           specified, a filename with the specified architecture
           identifier will be looked for. If not specified only
           filenames with a locally supported architecture are
           considered, or those without any architecture identifier.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--suffix=</b>, <b>-S</b>
           Configures the suffix of the filenames to consider. For the
           ".v/" logic it is necessary to specify the suffix to look
           for, and the ".v/" component must also carry the suffix
           immediately before ".v" in its name.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--type=</b>, <b>-t</b>
           Configures the inode type to look for in the ".v/" directory.
           Takes one of "reg", "dir", "sock", "fifo", "blk", "chr",
           "lnk" as argument, each identifying an inode type. See
           <a href="../man7/inode.7.html">inode(7)</a> for details about inode types. If this option is
           used inodes not matching the specified type are filtered and
           not taken into consideration.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--print=</b>, <b>-p</b>
           Configures what precisely to write to standard output. If not
           specified prints the full, resolved path of the newest
           matching file in the ".v/" directory. This switch can be set
           to one of the following:

           •   If set to "filename", will print only the filename
               instead of the full path of the resolved file.

           •   If set to "version", will print only the version of the
               resolved file.

           •   If set to "type", will print only the inode type of the
               resolved file (i.e. a string such as "reg" for regular
               files, or "dir" for directories).

           •   If set to "arch", will print only the architecture of the
               resolved file.

           •   If set to "tries", will print only the tries left/tries
               done of the resolved file.

           •   If set to "all", will print all of the above in a simple
               tabular output.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--resolve=</b>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true the path to the versioned
           file is fully canonicalized (i.e. symlinks resolved, and
           redundant path components removed) before it is shown. If
           false (the default) this is not done, and the path is shown
           without canonicalization.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Use a command like the following to automatically pick the newest
       raw disk image from a ".v/" directory:

           $ systemd-vpick --suffix=.raw --type=reg /var/lib/machines/quux.raw.v/

       This will enumerate all regular files matching
       /var/lib/machines/quux.raw.v/quux*.raw, filter and sort them
       according to the rules described in <a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v(7)</a>, and then write
       the path to the newest (by version) file to standard output.

       Use a command like the following to automatically pick the newest
       OS directory tree from a ".v/" directory:

           $ systemd-vpick --type=dir /var/lib/machines/waldo.v/

       This will enumerate all directory inodes matching
       /var/lib/machines/waldo.v/waldo*, filter and sort them according
       to the rules described in <a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v(7)</a>, and then write the path
       to the newest (by version) directory to standard output.

       For further examples see <a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v(7)</a>.
