</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sar2pcp </b>- import sar data and create a PCP archive
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sar2pcp </b><i>infile outfile</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sar2pcp </b>is intended to read a binary System Activity Reporting
       (sar) data file as created by <b>sadc</b>(1) (<i>infile</i>) and translate this
       into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with the basename
       <i>outfile</i>.

       However, if <i>infile</i> has the suffix ``.xml'', then it will be
       considered already in XML format and <b>sar2pcp </b>will operate
       directly on it.

       The resultant PCP achive may be used with all the PCP client
       tools to graph subsets of the data using <a href="pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>, perform data
       reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
       <a href="pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a>, etc.

       A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
       <i>outfile</i>.  These are <i>outfile</i><b>.0 </b>(the performance data),
       <i>outfile</i><b>.meta </b>(the metadata that describes the performance data)
       and <i>outfile</i><b>.index </b>(a temporal index to improve efficiency of
       replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
       already, then <b>sar2pcp </b>will <b>not </b>overwrite them and will exit with
       an error message of the form

       _&amp;__pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written

       <b>sar2pcp </b>is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
       wrapper around the PCP <i>libpcp_import</i> library, and as such could
       be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
       of performance data and create PCP archives.  A Python wrapper
       module is also available.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       As of <b>sysstat </b>version 12.0.5, <b>sadc</b>(1) has added functionality to
       directly write PCP archive files.  To produce archive files from
       sar run:

       $ sadf -l -O pcparchive=ARCHIVE_NAME sar.dat -- -A
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       When not using the XML input option, <b>sar2pcp </b>requires <i>infile</i> to
       have been created by a version of <b>sadc</b>(1) from
       <b>http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/ </b>which includes the
       <a href="sadf.1.html">sadf(1)</a> utility to translate <i>infile</i> into an XML stream (any since
       version 6); <b>sar2pcp </b>will automatically run <a href="sadf.1.html">sadf(1)</a> and translate
       the resultant XML into a PCP archive.

       When using binary <b>sadc </b>files it is important to ensure the
       installed <b>sadf </b>is compatible with the version of <b>sadc </b>that
       originally generated the binary files.  Simply assuming a newer
       installed version will work is unfortunately far too optimistic,
       and nor should one assume that binary data from different
       platforms (e.g. different endianness) will work - these issues
       are due to limitations in <b>sadc </b>and <b>sadf</b>, and not in <b>sar2pcp</b>
       itself.

       Fortunately, the <b>sadf </b>message indicating that an incompatibility
       has been detected is consistent across versions, and is always
       prefixed

       Invalid system activity file

       Using an XML <i>infile</i> has the advantage that the installed version
       of <b>sadf </b>is completely bypassed.  <b>sar2pcp </b>undertakes to transform
       any valid XML produced by any of the different variations of <b>sadf</b>
       into a valid PCP archive.  Any version of PCP will be able to
       interpret the archive files produced by any version of <b>sar2pcp</b>,
       and you are also free to move the binary PCP archive between
       different platforms, different hardware, even different operating
       systems - it Just Works (TM).
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
       <a href="../man3/pmgetoptions.3.html">pmGetOptions(3)</a>.
