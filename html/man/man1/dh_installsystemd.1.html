NAME </h2>

       dh_installsystemd - install systemd unit files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installsystemd </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>--restart-after-upgrade</b>]
       [<b>--no-stop-on-upgrade</b>] [<b>--no-enable</b>] [<b>--no-start</b>] [<b>--name=</b><i>name</i>]
       [<i>unit file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installsystemd </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing package maintainer supplied systemd unit files.

       It also finds the service files installed by a package and
       generates <i>preinst</i>, <i>postinst</i>, and <i>prerm</i> code blocks for enabling,
       disabling, starting, stopping, and restarting the corresponding
       systemd services, when the package is installed, updated, or
       removed. These snippets are added to the maintainer scripts by
       <a href="dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a>.

       <b>deb-systemd-helper</b>(1) is used to enable and disable systemd
       units, thus it is not necessary that the machine actually runs
       systemd during package installation time, enabling happens on all
       machines in order to be able to switch from sysvinit to systemd
       and back.

       <b>dh_installsystemd </b>operates on all unit files installed by a
       package. For only generating blocks for specific unit files, pass
       them as arguments, "dh_installsystemd quota.service". Specific
       unit files can be excluded from processing using the <b>-X </b>common
       <b>debhelper</b>(1) option.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.mount, debian/<i>package</i>.path, debian/<i>package</i>@.path,
       debian/<i>package</i>.service, debian/<i>package</i>@.service,
       debian/<i>package</i>.socket, debian/<i>package</i>@.socket,
       debian/<i>package</i>.target, debian/<i>package</i>@.target,
       debian/<i>package</i>.timer, debian/<i>package</i>@.timer
           If any of those files exists, they are installed into
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/</i> in the package build directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.tmpfile
           Only used in compat 12 or earlier.  In compat 13+, this file
           is handled by <a href="dh_installtmpfiles.1.html">dh_installtmpfiles(1)</a> instead.

           If this exists, it is installed into <i>usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/</i> in
           the package build directory. Note that the "tmpfiles.d"
           mechanism is currently only used by systemd.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--no-enable</b>
           Disable the service(s) on purge, but do not enable them on
           install.

           <b>Note </b>that this option does not affect whether the services
           are started.  Please remember to also use <b>--no-start </b>if the
           service should not be started.

       <b>--name=</b><i>name</i>
           This option controls several things.

           It changes the name that <b>dh_installsystemd </b>uses when it looks
           for maintainer provided systemd unit files as listed in the
           "FILES" section.  As an example, <b>dh_installsystemd --name foo</b>
           will look for <i>debian/package.<b>foo</b>.service</i> instead of
           <i>debian/package.service</i>).  These unit files are installed as
           <i>name.unit-extension</i> (in the example, it would be installed as
           <i><b>foo</b>.service</i>).

           Furthermore, if no unit files are passed explicitly as
           command line arguments, <b>dh_installsystemd </b>will only act on
           unit files called <i>name</i> (rather than all unit files found in
           the package).

       <b>--restart-after-upgrade</b>
           Do not stop the unit file until after the package upgrade has
           been completed.  This is the default behaviour in compat 10.

           In earlier compat levels the default was to stop the unit
           file in the <i>prerm</i>, and start it again in the <i>postinst</i>.

           This can be useful for daemons that should not have a
           possibly long downtime during upgrade. But you should make
           sure that the daemon will not get confused by the package
           being upgraded while it's running before using this option.

       <b>--no-restart-after-upgrade</b>
           Undo a previous <b>--restart-after-upgrade </b>(or the default of
           compat 10).  If no other options are given, this will cause
           the service to be stopped in the <i>prerm</i> script and started
           again in the <i>postinst</i> script.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-stop-on-upgrade</b>, <b>--no-restart-on-upgrade</b>
           Do not stop service on upgrade. This has the side-effect of
           not restarting the service as a part of the upgrade.

           If you want to restart the service with minimal downtime,
           please use <b>--restart-after-upgrade </b>(default in compat 10 or
           later).  If you want the service to be restarted but be
           stopped during the upgrade, then please use
           <b>--no-restart-after-upgrade </b>(note the "after-upgrade").

           Note that the <b>--no-restart-on-upgrade </b>alias is deprecated and
           will be removed in compat 14.  This is to avoid confusion
           with the <b>--no-restart-after-upgrade </b>option.

       <b>--no-start</b>
           Do not start the unit file after upgrades and after initial
           installation (the latter is only relevant for services
           without a corresponding init script).

           <b>Note </b>that this option does not affect whether the services
           are enabled.  Please remember to also use <b>--no-enable </b>if the
           services should not be enabled.

       <b>unit file </b>...
           Only process and generate maintscripts for the installed unit
           files with the (base)name <i>unit file</i>.

           Note: <b>dh_installsystemd </b>will still install unit files from
           <i>debian/</i> but it will not generate any maintscripts for them
           unless they are explicitly listed in <b>unit file </b>...

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       This command is not idempotent. <a href="dh_prep.1.html">dh_prep(1)</a> should be called
       between invocations of this command (with the same arguments).
       Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be
       added to maintainer scripts.
