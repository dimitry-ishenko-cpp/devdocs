       cupstestppd - test conformance of ppd files

       <b>cupstestppd </b>[ <b>-I </b><i>category</i> ] [ <b>-R </b><i>rootdir</i> ] [ <b>-W </b><i>category</i> ] [ <b>-q </b>]
       [ <b>-r </b>] [ <b>-v</b>[<b>v</b>] ] <i>filename.ppd[.gz]</i> [ ...  <i>filename.ppd[.gz]</i> ]

       ] <b>-</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cupstestppd </b>tests the conformance of PPD files to the Adobe
       PostScript Printer Description file format specification version
       4.3.  It can also be used to list the supported options and
       available fonts in a PPD file.  The results of testing and any
       other output are sent to the standard output.

       The first form of <b>cupstestppd </b>tests one or more PPD files on the
       command-line.  The second form tests the PPD file provided on the
       standard input.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cupstestppd </b>supports the following options:

       <b>-I filename</b>
            Ignores all PCFileName warnings.

       <b>-I filters</b>
            Ignores all filter errors.

       <b>-I profiles</b>
            Ignores all profile errors.

       <b>-R </b><i>rootdir</i>
            Specifies an alternate root directory for the filter, pre-
            filter, and other support file checks.

       <b>-W constraints</b>
            Report all UIConstraint errors as warnings.

       <b>-W defaults</b>
            Except for size-related options, report all default option
            errors as warnings.

       <b>-W filters</b>
            Report all filter errors as warnings.

       <b>-W profiles</b>
            Report all profile errors as warnings.

       <b>-W sizes</b>
            Report all media size errors as warnings.

       <b>-W translations</b>
            Report all translation errors as warnings.

       <b>-W all</b>
            Report all of the previous errors as warnings.

       <b>-W none</b>
            Report all of the previous errors as errors.

       <b>-q   </b>Specifies that no information should be displayed.

       <b>-r   </b>Relaxes the PPD conformance requirements so that common
            whitespace, control character, and formatting problems are
            not treated as hard errors.

       <b>-v   </b>Specifies that detailed conformance testing results should
            be displayed rather than the concise PASS/FAIL/ERROR status.

       <b>-vv  </b>Specifies that all information in the PPD file should be
            displayed in addition to the detailed conformance testing
            results.

       The <i>-q</i>, <i>-v</i>, and <i>-vv</i> options are mutually exclusive.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cupstestppd </b>returns zero on success and non-zero on error.  The
       error codes are as follows:

       1    Bad command-line arguments or missing PPD filename.

       2    Unable to open or read PPD file.

       3    The PPD file contains format errors that cannot be skipped.

       4    The PPD file does not conform to the Adobe PPD
            specification.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following command will test all PPD files under the current
       directory and print the names of each file that does not conform:

           find . -name \*.ppd \! -exec cupstestppd -q '{}' \; -print

       The next command tests all PPD files under the current directory
       and print detailed conformance testing results for the files that
       do not conform:

           find . -name \*.ppd \! -exec cupstestppd -q '{}' \; \
               -exec cupstestppd -v '{}' \;
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       PPD files are deprecated and will no longer be supported in a
       future feature release of CUPS.  Printers that do not support IPP
       can be supported using applications such as <a href="ippeveprinter.1.html">ippeveprinter(1)</a>.
