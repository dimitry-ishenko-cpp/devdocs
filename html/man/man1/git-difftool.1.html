NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-difftool - Show changes using common diff tools
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git difftool</i> [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;commit&gt; [&lt;commit&gt;]] [--] [&lt;path&gt;...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git difftool</i> is a Git command that allows you to compare and edit
       files between revisions using common diff tools. <i>git difftool</i> is
       a frontend to <i>git diff</i> and accepts the same options and
       arguments. See <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -d, --dir-diff
           Copy the modified files to a temporary location and perform a
           directory diff on them. This mode never prompts before
           launching the diff tool.

       -y, --no-prompt
           Do not prompt before launching a diff tool.

       --prompt
           Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool. This is the
           default behaviour; the option is provided to override any
           configuration settings.

       --rotate-to=&lt;file&gt;
           Start showing the diff for the given path, the paths before
           it will move to the end and output.

       --skip-to=&lt;file&gt;
           Start showing the diff for the given path, skipping all the
           paths before it.

       -t &lt;tool&gt;, --tool=&lt;tool&gt;
           Use the diff tool specified by &lt;tool&gt;. Valid values include
           emerge, kompare, meld, and vimdiff. Run <b>git difftool</b>
           <b>--tool-help </b>for the list of valid &lt;tool&gt; settings.

           If a diff tool is not specified, <i>git difftool</i> will use the
           configuration variable <b>diff.tool</b>. If the configuration
           variable <b>diff.tool </b>is not set, <i>git difftool</i> will pick a
           suitable default.

           You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting
           the configuration variable <b>difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.path</b>. For example,
           you can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting
           <b>difftool.kdiff3.path</b>. Otherwise, <i>git difftool</i> assumes the
           tool is available in PATH.

           Instead of running one of the known diff tools, <i>git difftool</i>
           can be customized to run an alternative program by specifying
           the command line to invoke in a configuration variable
           <b>difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd</b>.

           When <i>git difftool</i> is invoked with this tool (either through
           the <b>-t </b>or <b>--tool </b>option or the <b>diff.tool </b>configuration
           variable) the configured command line will be invoked with
           the following variables available: <b>$LOCAL </b>is set to the name
           of the temporary file containing the contents of the diff
           pre-image and <b>$REMOTE </b>is set to the name of the temporary
           file containing the contents of the diff post-image.  <b>$MERGED</b>
           is the name of the file which is being compared.  <b>$BASE </b>is
           provided for compatibility with custom merge tool commands
           and has the same value as <b>$MERGED</b>.

       --tool-help
           Print a list of diff tools that may be used with <b>--tool</b>.

       --[no-]symlinks
           <i>git difftool</i>'s default behavior is to create symlinks to the
           working tree when run in <b>--dir-diff </b>mode and the right-hand
           side of the comparison yields the same content as the file in
           the working tree.

           Specifying <b>--no-symlinks </b>instructs <i>git difftool</i> to create
           copies instead.  <b>--no-symlinks </b>is the default on Windows.

       -x &lt;command&gt;, --extcmd=&lt;command&gt;
           Specify a custom command for viewing diffs.  <i>git-difftool</i>
           ignores the configured defaults and runs <b>&lt;command&gt; $LOCAL</b>
           <b>$REMOTE </b>when this option is specified. Additionally, <b>$BASE </b>is
           set in the environment.

       -g, --[no-]gui
           When <i>git-difftool</i> is invoked with the <b>-g </b>or <b>--gui </b>option the
           default diff tool will be read from the configured
           <b>diff.guitool </b>variable instead of <b>diff.tool</b>. This may be
           selected automatically using the configuration variable
           <b>difftool.guiDefault</b>. The <b>--no-gui </b>option can be used to
           override these settings. If <b>diff.guitool </b>is not set, we will
           fallback in the order of <b>merge.guitool</b>, <b>diff.tool</b>, <b>merge.tool</b>
           until a tool is found.

       --[no-]trust-exit-code
           Errors reported by the diff tool are ignored by default. Use
           <b>--trust-exit-code </b>to make <i>git-difftool</i> exit when an invoked
           diff tool returns a non-zero exit code.

           <i>git-difftool</i> will forward the exit code of the invoked tool
           when <b>--trust-exit-code </b>is used.

       See <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> for the full list of supported options.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git difftool</i> falls back to <i>git mergetool</i> config variables when
       the difftool equivalents have not been defined.

       Everything above this line in this section isn’t included from
       the <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> documentation. The content that follows is the
       same as what’s found there:

       diff.tool
           Controls which diff tool is used by <a href="git-difftool.1.html">git-difftool(1)</a>. This
           variable overrides the value configured in <b>merge.tool</b>. The
           list below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value
           is treated as a custom diff tool and requires that a
           corresponding difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.

       diff.guitool
           Controls which diff tool is used by <a href="git-difftool.1.html">git-difftool(1)</a> when the
           -g/--gui flag is specified. This variable overrides the value
           configured in <b>merge.guitool</b>. The list below shows the valid
           built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom diff
           tool and requires that a corresponding difftool.&lt;guitool&gt;.cmd
           variable is defined.

       difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
           variables available: <i>LOCAL</i> is set to the name of the
           temporary file containing the contents of the diff pre-image
           and <i>REMOTE</i> is set to the name of the temporary file
           containing the contents of the diff post-image.

           See the <b>--tool=&lt;tool&gt; </b>option in <a href="git-difftool.1.html">git-difftool(1)</a> for more
           details.

       difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.path
           Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case
           your tool is not in the PATH.

       difftool.trustExitCode
           Exit difftool if the invoked diff tool returns a non-zero
           exit status.

           See the <b>--trust-exit-code </b>option in <a href="git-difftool.1.html">git-difftool(1)</a> for more
           details.

       difftool.prompt
           Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool.

       difftool.guiDefault
           Set <b>true </b>to use the <b>diff.guitool </b>by default (equivalent to
           specifying the <b>--gui </b>argument), or <b>auto </b>to select
           <b>diff.guitool </b>or <b>diff.tool </b>depending on the presence of a
           <b>DISPLAY </b>environment variable value. The default is <b>false</b>,
           where the <b>--gui </b>argument must be provided explicitly for the
           <b>diff.guitool </b>to be used.
