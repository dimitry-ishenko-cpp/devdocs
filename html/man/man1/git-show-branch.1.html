SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git show-branch</i> [-a | --all] [-r | --remotes] [--topo-order | --date-order]
                       [--current] [--color[=&lt;when&gt;] | --no-color] [--sparse]
                       [--more=&lt;n&gt; | --list | --independent | --merge-base]

       <i>git show-branch</i> (-g | --reflog)[=&lt;n&gt;[,&lt;base&gt;]] [--list] [&lt;ref&gt;]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Shows the commit ancestry graph starting from the commits named
       with &lt;rev&gt;s or &lt;glob&gt;s (or all refs under refs/heads and/or
       refs/tags) semi-visually.

       It cannot show more than 29 branches and commits at a time.

       It uses <b>showbranch.default </b>multi-valued configuration items if no
       &lt;rev&gt; or &lt;glob&gt; is given on the command line.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;rev&gt;
           Arbitrary extended SHA-1 expression (see <a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>)
           that typically names a branch head or a tag.

       &lt;glob&gt;
           A glob pattern that matches branch or tag names under refs/.
           For example, if you have many topic branches under
           refs/heads/topic, giving <b>topic/* </b>would show all of them.

       -r, --remotes
           Show the remote-tracking branches.

       -a, --all
           Show both remote-tracking branches and local branches.

       --current
           With this option, the command includes the current branch in
           the list of revs to be shown when it is not given on the
           command line.

       --topo-order
           By default, the branches and their commits are shown in
           reverse chronological order. This option makes them appear in
           topological order (i.e., descendant commits are shown before
           their parents).

       --date-order
           This option is similar to <b>--topo-order </b>in the sense that no
           parent comes before all of its children, but otherwise
           commits are ordered according to their commit date.

       --sparse
           By default, the output omits merges that are reachable from
           only one tip being shown. This option makes them visible.

       --more=&lt;n&gt;
           Usually the command stops output upon showing the commit that
           is the common ancestor of all the branches. This flag tells
           the command to go &lt;n&gt; more common commits beyond that. When
           &lt;n&gt; is negative, display only the &lt;ref&gt;s given, without
           showing the commit ancestry tree.

       --list
           Synonym to <b>--more=-1</b>

       --merge-base
           Instead of showing the commit list, determine possible merge
           bases for the specified commits. All merge bases will be
           contained in all specified commits. This is different from
           how <a href="git-merge-base.1.html">git-merge-base(1)</a> handles the case of three or more
           commits.

       --independent
           Among the &lt;ref&gt;s given, display only the ones that cannot be
           reached from any other &lt;ref&gt;.

       --no-name
           Do not show naming strings for each commit.

       --sha1-name
           Instead of naming the commits using the path to reach them
           from heads (e.g. "master~2" to mean the grandparent of
           "master"), name them with the unique prefix of their object
           names.

       --topics
           Shows only commits that are NOT on the first branch given.
           This helps track topic branches by hiding any commit that is
           already in the main line of development. When given "git
           show-branch --topics master topic1 topic2", this will show
           the revisions given by "git rev-list ^master topic1 topic2"

       -g, --reflog[=&lt;n&gt;[,&lt;base&gt;]] [&lt;ref&gt;]
           Shows &lt;n&gt; most recent ref-log entries for the given ref. If
           &lt;base&gt; is given, &lt;n&gt; entries going back from that entry.
           &lt;base&gt; can be specified as count or date. When no explicit
           &lt;ref&gt; parameter is given, it defaults to the current branch
           (or <b>HEAD </b>if it is detached).

       --color[=&lt;when&gt;]
           Color the status sign (one of these: <b>* !  + -</b>) of each commit
           corresponding to the branch it’s in. The value must be always
           (the default), never, or auto.

       --no-color
           Turn off colored output, even when the configuration file
           gives the default to color output. Same as <b>--color=never</b>.

       Note that --more, --list, --independent, and --merge-base options
       are mutually exclusive.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       Given N &lt;ref&gt;s, the first N lines are the one-line description
       from their commit message. The branch head that is pointed at by
       $GIT_DIR/HEAD is prefixed with an asterisk <b>* </b>character while
       other heads are prefixed with a <b>! </b>character.

       Following these N lines, a one-line log for each commit is
       displayed, indented N places. If a commit is on the I-th branch,
       the I-th indentation character shows a <b>+ </b>sign; otherwise it shows
       a space. Merge commits are denoted by a <b>- </b>sign. Each commit shows
       a short name that can be used as an extended SHA-1 to name that
       commit.

       The following example shows three branches, "master", "fixes",
       and "mhf":

           $ git show-branch master fixes mhf
           * [master] Add 'git show-branch'.
            ! [fixes] Introduce "reset type" flag to "git reset"
             ! [mhf] Allow "+remote:local" refspec to cause --force when fetching.
           ---
             + [mhf] Allow "+remote:local" refspec to cause --force when fetching.
             + [mhf~1] Use git-octopus when pulling more than one head.
            +  [fixes] Introduce "reset type" flag to "git reset"
             + [mhf~2] "git fetch --force".
             + [mhf~3] Use .git/remote/origin, not .git/branches/origin.
             + [mhf~4] Make "git pull" and "git fetch" default to origin
             + [mhf~5] Infamous 'octopus merge'
             + [mhf~6] Retire git-parse-remote.
             + [mhf~7] Multi-head fetch.
             + [mhf~8] Start adding the $GIT_DIR/remotes/ support.
           *++ [master] Add 'git show-branch'.

       These three branches all forked from a common commit, [master],
       whose commit message is "Add 'git show-branch'". The "fixes"
       branch adds one commit "Introduce "reset type" flag to "git
       reset"". The "mhf" branch adds many other commits. The current
       branch is "master".
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       If you keep your primary branches immediately under <b>refs/heads</b>,
       and topic branches in subdirectories of it, having the following
       in the configuration file may help:

           [showbranch]
                   default = --topo-order
                   default = heads/*

       With this, <b>git show-branch </b>without extra parameters would show
       only the primary branches. In addition, if you happen to be on
       your topic branch, it is shown as well.

           $ git show-branch --reflog="10,1 hour ago" --list master

       shows 10 reflog entries going back from the tip as of 1 hour ago.
       Without <b>--list</b>, the output also shows how these tips are
       topologically related to each other.
