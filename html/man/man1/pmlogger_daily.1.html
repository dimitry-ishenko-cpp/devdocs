DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogger_daily </b>and the related <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> tools along with
       associated control files (see <a href="../man5/pmlogger.control.5.html">pmlogger.control(5)</a>) may be used to
       create a customized regime of administration and management for
       historical archives of performance data within the Performance
       Co-Pilot (see <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) infrastructure.

       <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is intended to be run once per day, preferably in
       the early morning, as soon after midnight as practicable.  Its
       task is to aggregate, rotate and perform general housekeeping one
       or more sets of PCP archives.

       To accommodate the evolution of PMDAs and changes in production
       logging environments, <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is integrated with
       <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> to allow optional and automatic rewriting of
       archives before merging.  If there are global rewriting rules to
       be applied across all archives mentioned in the control file(s),
       then create the directory <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite</i> and place
       any <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> rewriting rules in this directory.  For
       rewriting rules that are specific to only one family of archives,
       use the directory name from the control file(s) - i.e. the <i>fourth</i>
       field - and create a file, or a directory, or a symbolic link
       named <i>pmlogrewrite</i> within this directory and place the required
       rewriting rule(s) in the <i>pmlogrewrite</i> file or in files within the
       <i>pmlogrewrite</i> subdirectory.  <b>pmlogger_daily </b>will choose rewriting
       rules from the archive directory if they exist, else rewriting
       rules from <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogrewrite</i> if that directory
       exists, else no rewriting is attempted.

       As an alternate mechanism, if the file
       <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite</i> exists when <b>pmlogger_daily</b>
       starts then this is treated the same as specifying <b>-R </b>on the
       command line and <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite</i> will be
       removed once all the rewriting has been done.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-c </b><i>control</i>, <b>--control</b>=<i>control</i>
            Both <b>pmlogger_daily </b>and <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> are controlled by
            PCP logger control file(s) that specifies the <b>pmlogger</b>
            instances to be managed.  The default <i>control</i> file is
            <i>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH</i>, but an alternate may be specified
            using the <b>-c </b>option.  If the directory
            <i>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH</i><b>.d </b>(or <i>control</i><b>.d </b>from the <b>-c</b>
            option) exists, then the contents of any additional <i>control</i>
            files therein will be appended to the main control file
            (which must exist).

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--noreport</b>
            Do not perform the conditional <a href="pmlogger_daily_report.1.html">pmlogger_daily_report(1)</a>
            processing as described below.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--expunge</b>
            This option causes <b>pmlogger_daily </b>to pass the <b>-E </b>flag to
            <a href="pmlogger_merge.1.html">pmlogger_merge(1)</a> in order to expunge metrics with metadata
            inconsistencies and continue rather than fail.  This is
            intended for automated daily archive rotation where it is
            highly desirable for unattended daily archive merging,
            rewriting and compression to succeed.  For further details,
            see <a href="pmlogger_merge.1.html">pmlogger_merge(1)</a> and description for the <b>-x </b>flag in
            <a href="pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a>.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
            This option forces <b>pmlogger_daily </b>to attempt compression
            actions.  Using this option in production is not
            recommended.

       <b>-k </b><i>time</i>, <b>--discard</b>=<i>time</i>
            After some period, old PCP archives are discarded.  <i>time</i> is
            a time specification in the syntax of <a href="find-filter.1.html">find-filter(1)</a>, so
            <i>DD</i>[<b>:</b><i>HH</i>[<b>:</b><i>MM</i>]].  The optional <i>HH</i> (hours) and <i>MM</i> (minutes)
            parts are 0 if not specified.  By default the <i>time</i> is <b>14:0:0</b>
            or 14 days, but may be changed using this option.

            Some special values are recognized for the <i>time</i>, namely <b>0 </b>to
            keep no archives beyond the the ones being currently written
            by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>, and <b>forever </b>or <b>never </b>to prevent any archives
            being discarded.

            The <i>time</i> can also be set using the <b>$PCP_CULLAFTER </b>variable,
            set in either the environment or in a control file.  If both
            <b>$PCP_CULLAFTER </b>and <b>-k </b>specify different values for <i>time</i> then
            the environment variable value is used and a warning is
            issued, i.e. if <b>$PCP_CULLAFTER </b>is set in the <i>control</i> file,
            it overrides <b>-k </b>given on the command line.

            Note that the semantics of <i>time</i> are that it is measured from
            the time of last modification of each archive, and not from
            the original archive creation date.  This has subtle
            implications for compression (see below) - the compression
            process results in the creation of new archive files which
            have new modification times.  In this case, the <i>time</i> period
            (re)starts from the time of compression.

       <b>-K   </b>When this option is specified for <b>pmlogger_daily </b>then only
            the compression tasks are attempted, so no <b>pmlogger</b>
            rotation, no culling, no rewriting, etc.  When <b>-K </b>is used
            and a <i>period</i> of <b>0 </b>is in effect (from <b>-x </b>on the command line
            or <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER </b>in the environment or via the <i>control</i>
            file) this is intended for environments where compression of
            archives is desired before the scheduled daily processing
            happens.  To achieve this, once <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> has
            completed regular processing, it calls <b>pmlogger_daily </b>with
            just the <b>-K </b>option.  Provided <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER </b>is set to <b>0</b>
            along with any other required compression options to match
            the scheduled invocation of <b>pmlogger_daily</b>, then this will
            compress all volumes except the ones being currently written
            by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  If <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER </b>is set to a value
            greater than zero, then manually running <b>pmlogger_daily with</b>
            <b>the -x </b>option may be used to compress volumes that are
            younger than the <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER </b>time.  This may be used
            to reclaim filesystem space by compressing volumes earlier
            than they would have otherwise been compressed.  Note that
            since the default value of <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER </b>is 0 days, the
            <b>-x </b>option has no effect unless the <b>control </b>file has been
            edited and <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER </b>has been set to a value
            greater than <b>0</b>.

       <b>-l </b><i>file</i>, <b>--logfile</b>=<i>file</i>
            In order to ensure that mail is not unintentionally sent
            when these scripts are run from <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> or <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>
            diagnostics are always sent to log files.  By default, this
            file is <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger_daily.log</i> but this
            can be changed using the <b>-l </b>option.  If this log <i>file</i>
            already exists when the script starts, it will be renamed
            with a <i>.prev</i> suffix (overwriting any log file saved earlier)
            before diagnostics are generated to the log file.  The <b>-l</b>
            and <b>-t </b>options cannot be used together.

       <b>-m </b><i>addresses</i>, <b>--mail</b>=<i>addresses</i>
            Use of this option causes <b>pmlogger_daily </b>to construct a
            summary of the ``notices'' file entries which were generated
            in the last 24 hours, and e-mail that summary to the set of
            space-separated <i>addresses</i>.  This daily summary is stored in
            the file <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES.daily</i>, which will be empty
            when no new ``notices'' entries were made in the previous 24
            hour period.

       <b>-M   </b>This option may be used to disable archive merging (or
            renaming) and rewriting (<b>-M </b>implies <b>-r</b>).  This is most
            useful in cases where the archives are being incrementally
            copied to a remote repository, e.g. using <a href="rsync.1.html">rsync(1)</a>.
            Merging, renaming and rewriting all risk an increase in the
            synchronization load, especially immediately after
            <b>pmlogger_daily </b>has run, so <b>-M </b>may be useful in these cases.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--showme</b>
            This option enables a ``show me'' mode, where the programs
            actions are echoed, but not executed, in the style of ``make
            -n''.  Using <b>-N </b>in conjunction with <b>-V </b>maximizes the
            diagnostic capabilities for debugging.

       <b>-o   </b>By default all possible archives will be merged.  This
            option reinstates the old behaviour in which only
            yesterday's archives will be considered as merge candidates.
            In the special case where only a single input archive needs
            to be merged, <a href="pmlogmv.1.html">pmlogmv(1)</a> is used to rename the archive,
            otherwise <a href="pmlogger_merge.1.html">pmlogger_merge(1)</a> is used to merge all of the
            archives for a single host and a single day into a new PCP
            archive and the individual archives are removed.

       <b>-p   </b>If this option is specified for <b>pmlogger_daily </b>then the
            status of the daily processing is polled and if the daily
            <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> rotation, culling, rewriting, compressing, etc.
            has not been done in the last 24 hours then it is done now.
            The intent is to have <b>pmlogger_daily </b>called regularly with
            the <b>-p </b>option (at 30 mins past the hour, every hour in the
            default <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> set up) to ensure daily processing happens
            as soon as possible if it was missed at the regularly
            scheduled time (which is 00:10 by default), e.g. if the
            system was down or suspended at that time.  With this option
            <b>pmlogger_daily </b>simply exits if the previous day's processing
            has already been done.  Note that this option is not used on
            platforms supporting <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> because the
            <b>pmlogger_daily.timer </b>service unit specifies a timer setting
            with <b>Persistent=true</b>.  The <b>-K </b>and <b>-p </b>options to
            <b>pmlogger_daily </b>are mutually exclusive.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--norewrite</b>
            This command line option acts as an override and prevents
            all archive rewriting with <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> independent of
            the presence of any rewriting rule files or directories.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--rewriteall</b>
            Sometimes PMDA changes require <i>all</i> archives to be rewritten,
            not just the ones involved in any current merging.  This is
            required for example after a PCP upgrade where a new version
            of an existing PMDA has revised metadata.  The <b>-R </b>command
            line forces this universal-style of rewriting.  The <b>-R</b>
            option to <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is mutually exclusive with both the
            <b>-r </b>and <b>-M </b>options.

       <b>-s </b><i>size</i>, <b>--rotate</b>=<i>size</i>
            If the PCP ``notices'' file (<i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES</i>) is larger
            than 20480 bytes, <b>pmlogger_daily </b>will rename the file with a
            ``.old'' suffix, and start a new ``notices'' file.  The
            rotate threshold may be changed from 20480 to <i>size</i> bytes
            using the <b>-s </b>option.

       <b>-t </b><i>period</i>
            To assist with debugging or diagnosing intermittent failures
            the <b>-t </b>option may be used.  This will turn on very verbose
            tracing (<b>-VV</b>) and capture the trace output in a file named
            <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/daily.datestamp.trace</i>, where <i>datestamp</i>
            is the time <b>pmlogger_daily </b>was run in the format
            YYYYMMDD.HH.MM.  In addition, the <i>period</i> argument will
            ensure that trace files created with <b>-t </b>will be kept for
            <i>period</i> days and then discarded.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            The output from the <b>cron </b>execution of the scripts may be
            extended using the <b>-V </b>option to the scripts which will
            enable verbose tracing of their activity.  By default the
            scripts generate no output unless some error or warning
            condition is encountered.  A second <b>-V </b>increases the
            verbosity.  Using <b>-N </b>in conjunction with <b>-V </b>maximizes the
            diagnostic capabilities for debugging.

       <b>-x </b><i>time</i>, <b>--compress-after</b>=<i>time</i>
            Archive data files can optionally be compressed after some
            period to conserve disk space.  This is particularly useful
            for large numbers of <b>pmlogger </b>processes under the control of
            <b>pmlogger_daily</b>.

            <i>time</i> is a time specification in the syntax of
            <a href="find-filter.1.html">find-filter(1)</a>, so <i>DD</i>[<b>:</b><i>HH</i>[<b>:</b><i>MM</i>]].  The optional <i>HH</i> (hours)
            and <i>MM</i> (minutes) parts are 0 if not specified.

            Some special values are recognized for the <i>time</i>, namely <b>0 </b>to
            apply compression as soon as possible, and <b>forever </b>or <b>never</b>
            to prevent any compression being done.

            If <b>transparent_decompress </b>is enabled when <i>libpcp</i> was built
            (can be checked with the <a href="pmconfig.1.html">pmconfig(1)</a> <b>-L </b>option), then the
            default behaviour is compression ``as soon as possible''.
            Otherwise the default behaviour is to <b>not </b>compress files
            (which matches the historical default behaviour in earlier
            PCP releases).

            The <i>time</i> can also be set using the <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER</b>
            variable, set in either the environment or in a <i>control</i>
            file.  If both <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER </b>and <b>-x </b>specify different
            values for <i>time</i> then the environment variable value is used
            and a warning is issued.  For important other detailed notes
            concerning volume compression, see the <b>-K </b>and <b>-k </b>options
            (above).

       <b>-X </b><i>program</i>, <b>--compressor</b>=<i>program</i>
            This option specifies the program to use for compression -
            by default this is <b>xz</b>(1).  The environment variable
            <b>$PCP_COMPRESS </b>may be used as an alternative mechanism to
            define <i>program</i>.  If both <b>$PCP_COMPRESS </b>and <b>-X </b>specify
            different compression programs then the environment variable
            value is used and a warning is issued.

       <b>-Y </b><i>regex</i>, <b>--regex</b>=<i>regex</i>
            This option allows a regular expression to be specified
            causing files in the set of files matched for compression to
            be omitted - this allows only the data file to be
            compressed, and also prevents the program from attempting to
            compress it more than once.  The default <i>regex</i> is
            ".(index|Z|gz|bz2|zip|xz|lzma|lzo|lz4)$" - such files are
            filtered using the <b>-v </b>option to <b>egrep</b>(1).  The environment
            variable <b>$PCP_COMPRESSREGEX </b>may be used as an alternative
            mechanism to define <i>regex</i>.  If both <b>$PCP_COMPRESSREGEX </b>and
            <b>-Y </b>specify different values for <i>regex</i> then the environment
            variable value is used and a warning is issued.

       <b>-z   </b>This option causes <b>pmlogger_daily </b>to <b>not </b>``re-exec'', see
            <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>, when it would otherwise choose to do so and is
            intended only for QA testing.

       <b>-Z   </b>This option causes <b>pmlogger_daily </b>to ``re-exec'', see
            <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>, whenever that is possible and is intended only
            for QA testing.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
CALLBACKS </h2>
<pre>
       Additionally <b>pmlogger_daily </b>supports the following ``hooks'' to
       allow auxiliary operations to be performed at key points in the
       daily processing of the archives.  These callbacks are controlled
       via variables that may be set in the environment or via the
       <i>control</i> file.

       Note that merge callbacks and autosaving described below are <b>not</b>
       enabled when only compression tasks are being attempted, i.e.
       when <b>-K </b>command line option is used.

       All of the callback script execution and the autosave file moving
       will be executed as the non-privileged user ``pcp'' and group
       ``pcp'', so appropriate permissions may need to have been set up
       in advance.

       <b>$PCP_MERGE_CALLBACK</b>
            As each day's archive is created by merging and before any
            compression takes place, if <b>$PCP_MERGE_CALLBACK </b>is defined,
            then it is assumed to be a script that will be called with
            one argument being the name of the archive (stripped of any
            suffixes), so something of the form
            <i>/some/directory/path/YYYYMMDD</i>.  The script needs to be
            either a full pathname, or something that will be found on
            the shell's <b>$PATH .  </b>The callback script will be run in the
            foreground, so <b>pmlogger_daily </b>will wait for it to complete.

            If the control file contains more than one
            <b>$PCP_MERGE_CALLBACK </b>specification then these will be run
            serially in the order they appear in the control file.  If
            <b>$PCP_MERGE_CALLBACK </b>is defined in the environment when
            <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is run, this is treated as though this option
            was the first in the control file, i.e. it will be run
            before any merge callbacks mentioned in the control file.

            If the <i>pcp-zeroconf</i> packages is installed, then a special
            merge callback is added to call <a href="pmlogger_daily_report.1.html">pmlogger_daily_report(1)</a>
            first, before any other merge callback options.  Refer to
            <a href="pmlogger_daily_report.1.html">pmlogger_daily_report(1)</a> for an explanation of the <i>pcp-</i>
            <i>zeroconf</i> requirements.

            If <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is in ``catch up'' mode (more than one
            day's worth of archives need to be combined) then each call
            back is executed once for each day's archive that is
            generated.

            A typical use might be to produce daily reports from the PCP
            archive which needs to wait until the archive has been
            created, but is more efficient if it is done before any
            potential compression of the archive.

       <b>$PCP_COMPRESS_CALLBACK</b>
            If <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is run with <b>-x 0 </b>or <b>$PCP_COMPRESSAFTER=0</b>,
            then compression is done immediately after merging.  As each
            day's archive is compressed, if <b>$PCP_COMPRESS_CALLBACK </b>is
            defined, then it is assumed to be a script that will be
            called with one argument being the name of the archive
            (stripped of any suffixes), so something of the form
            <i>/some/directory/path/YYYYMMDD</i>.  The script needs to be
            either a full pathname, or something that will be found on
            the shell's <b>$PATH .  </b>The callback script will be run in the
            foreground, so <b>pmlogger_daily </b>will wait for it to complete.

            If the control file contains more than one
            <b>$PCP_COMPRESS_CALLBACK </b>specification then these will be run
            serially in the order they appear in the control file.  If
            <b>$PCP_COMPRESS_CALLBACK </b>is defined in the environment when
            <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is run, this is treated as though this option
            was the first in the control file, i.e. it will be run
            first.

            If <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is in ``catch up'' mode (more than one
            day's worth of archives need to be compressed) then each
            call back is executed once for each day's archive that is
            compressed.

            A typical use might be to keep recent archives in
            uncompressed form for efficient querying, but move the older
            archives to some other storage location once the compression
            has been done.

       <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR</b>
            Once the merging and possible compression has been done by
            <b>pmlogger_daily</b>, if <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR </b>is defined then all of
            the physical files that make up one day's archive will be
            moved (autosaved) to the directory specified by
            <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR.</b>

            The basename of the archive is used to set the reserved
            words <b>DATEYYYY </b>(year), <b>DATEMM </b>(month) and <b>DATEDD </b>(day) and
            these (along with <b>LOCALHOSTNAME</b>) may appear literally in
            <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR</b>, and will be substituted at execution time
            to generate the destination directory name.  For example:
                  $PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR=/gpfs/LOCALHOSTNAME/DATEYYYY/DATEMM-
                  DATEDD

            Note that these ``date'' reserved words correspond to the
            date on which the archive data was collected, not the date
            that <b>pmlogger_daily </b>was run.

            If <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR </b>(after <b>LOCALHOSTNAME </b>and ``date''
            substitution) does not exist then <b>pmlogger_daily </b>will
            attempt to create it (along with any parent directories that
            do not exist).  Just be aware that this directory creation
            runs under the uid of the user ``pcp'', so directories along
            the path to <b>$PCP_AUTOSAVE_DIR </b>may need to be writeable by
            this non-root user.

            By ``move'' the archives we mean a paranoid checksum-copy-
            checksum-remove (using the <b>-c </b>option for <a href="pmlogmv.1.html">pmlogmv(1)</a>) that
            will bail if the copy fails or the checksums do not match
            (the archives are important so we cannot risk something like
            a full filesystem or a permissions issue messing with the
            copy process).

            If <b>pmlogger_daily </b>is in ``catch up'' mode (more than one
            day's worth of archives need to be combined) then the
            archives for more than one day could be copied in this step.

            A typical use might be to create PCP archives on a local
            filesystem initially, then once all the data for a single
            day has been collected and merged, migrate that day's
            archive to a shared filesystem or a remote filesystem.  This
            may allow automatic backup to off-site storage and/or reduce
            the number of I/O operations and filesystem metadata
            operations on the (potentially slower) non-local filesystem.

CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Refer to <a href="../man5/pmlogger.control.5.html">pmlogger.control(5)</a> for a description of the contol
       file(s) that are used to control which <b>pmlogger </b>instances and
       which archives are managed by <b>pmlogger_check </b>and
       <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogger/config.default</i>
            default <b>pmlogger </b>configuration file location for the local
            primary logger, typically generated automatically by
            <a href="pmlogconf.1.html">pmlogconf(1)</a>.

       <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;</i>
            default location for archives of performance information
            collected from the host <i>hostname</i>

       <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;/lock</i>
            transient lock file to guarantee mutual exclusion during
            <b>pmlogger </b>administration for the host <i>hostname</i> - if present,
            can be safely removed if neither <b>pmlogger_daily </b>nor
            <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> are running

       <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;/Latest</i>
            PCP archive folio created by <a href="mkaf.1.html">mkaf(1)</a> for the most recently
            launched archive containing performance metrics from the
            host <i>hostname</i>

       <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES</i>
            PCP ``notices'' file used by <a href="pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> and friends

       <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/pmlogger_daily.log</i>
            if the previous execution of <b>pmlogger_daily </b>produced any
            output it is saved here.  The normal case is no output in
            which case the file does not exist.

       <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/SaveLogs</i>
             if this directory exists, then the log file from the <b>-l</b>
             argument for <b>pmlogger_daily </b>will be saved in this directory
             with the name of the format &lt;date&gt;-<b>pmlogger_daily</b>.<b>log</b>.&lt;pid&gt;
             or &lt;date&gt;-<b>pmlogger_daily-K</b>.<b>log</b>.&lt;pid&gt; This allows the log
             file to be inspected at a later time, even if several
             <b>pmlogger_daily </b>executions have been launched in the
             interim.  Because the PCP archive management tools run
             under the $PCP_USER account ``pcp'',
             <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/SaveLogs</i> typically needs to be owned by
             the user ``pcp''.

       <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;/SaveLogs</i>
              if this directory exists, then the log file from the <b>-l</b>
              argument of a newly launched <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> for <i>hostname</i> will
              be saved in this directory with the name <i>archive</i><b>.log </b>where
              <i>archive</i> is the basename of the associated <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> PCP
              archive files.  This allows the log file to be inspected
              at a later time, even if several <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instances for
              <i>hostname</i> have been launched in the interim.  Because the
              PCP archive management tools run under the uid of the user
              ``pcp'', <i>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/&lt;hostname&gt;/SaveLogs</i> typically
              needs to be owned by the user ``pcp''.

       <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/.NeedRewrite</i>
               if this file exists, then this is treated as equivalent
               to using <b>-R </b>on the command line and the file will be
               removed once all rewriting has been done.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
COMPATIBILITY ISSUES </h2>
<pre>
       Earlier versions of <b>pmlogger_daily </b>used <a href="find.1.html">find(1)</a> to locate files
       for compressing or culling and the <b>-k </b>and <b>-x </b>options took only
       integer values to mean ``days''.  The semantics of this was quite
       loose given that <a href="find.1.html">find(1)</a> offers different precision and semantics
       across platforms.

       The current implementation of <b>pmlogger_daily </b>uses <a href="find-filter.1.html">find-filter(1)</a>
       which provides high precision intervals and semantics that are
       relative to the time of execution and are consistent across
       platforms.
