Description </h2>
<pre>
       The GNU <i>roff</i> TTY (“Teletype”) output driver translates the output
       of <i>troff</i>(1) into a form suitable for typewriter-like devices,
       including video terminal emulators.  Normally, <i>grotty</i> is invoked
       by <i>groff</i>(1) when the latter is given one of the “<b>-T ascii</b>”,
       “<b>-T latin1</b>”, or “<b>-T utf8</b>” options on systems using ISO character
       encoding standards, or with “<b>-T cp1047</b>” or “<b>-T utf8</b>” on EBCDIC-
       based hosts.  (In this installation, <b>ps </b>is the default output
       device.)  Use <i>groff</i>'s <b>-P </b>option to pass any options shown above
       to <i>grotty</i>.  If no <i>file</i> arguments are given, or if <i>file</i> is “-”,
       <i>grotty</i> reads the standard input stream.  It writes to the
       standard output stream.

       By default, <i>grotty</i> emits SGR escape sequences (from ISO 6429,
       popularly called “ANSI escapes”) to change text attributes (bold,
       italic, underline, reverse video [“negative image”] and colors).
       Devices supporting the appropriate sequences can view <i>roff</i>
       documents using eight different background and foreground colors.
       Following ISO 6429, the following colors are defined in <i>tty.tmac</i>:
       black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, and cyan.
       Unrecognized colors are mapped to the default color, which is
       dependent on the settings of the terminal.  OSC 8 hyperlinks are
       produced for these devices.

       In keeping with long-standing practice and the rarity of
       terminals (and emulators) that support oblique or italic fonts,
       italicized text is represented with underlining by default—but
       see the <b>-i </b>option below.

   <b>SGR and OSC support in pagers</b>
       When paging <i>grotty</i>'s output with <i>less</i>(1), the latter program must
       be instructed to pass SGR and OSC sequences through to the
       device; its <b>-R </b>option is one way to achieve this (<i>less</i> version
       566 or later is required for OSC 8 support).  Consequently,
       programs like <i>man</i>(1) that page <i>roff</i> documents with <i>less</i> must call
       it with an appropriate option.

   <b>Legacy output format</b>
       The <b>-c </b>option tells <i>grotty</i> to use an output format compatible
       with paper terminals, like the Teletype machines for which <i>roff</i>
       and <i>nroff</i> were first developed but which are no longer in wide
       use.  SGR escape sequences are not emitted; bold, italic, and
       underlining character attributes are thus not manipulated.
       Instead, <i>grotty</i> overstrikes, representing a bold character <i>c</i> with
       the sequence “<i>c</i> BACKSPACE <i>c</i>”, an italic character <i>c</i> with the
       sequence “<b>_ </b>BACKSPACE <i>c</i>”, and bold italics with “<b>_ </b>BACKSPACE <i>c</i>
       BACKSPACE <i>c</i>”.  This rendering is inherently ambiguous when the
       character <i>c</i> is itself the underscore.

       The legacy output format can be rendered on a video terminal (or
       emulator) by piping <i>grotty</i>'s output through <i>ul</i>(1), which may
       render bold italics as reverse video.  Some implementations of
       <i>more</i>(1) are also able to display these sequences; you may wish to
       experiment with that command's <b>-b </b>option.  <i>less</i> renders legacy
       bold and italics without requiring options.  In contrast to the
       terminal output drivers of some other <i>roff</i> implementations,
       <i>grotty</i> never outputs reverse line feeds.  There is therefore no
       need to filter its output through <i>col</i>(1).

   <b>Device control commands</b>
       <i>grotty</i> supports a device control command accessed with the
       “<b>device</b>” request or <b>\X </b>escape sequence.

       <b>\X'tty: link </b>[<i>uri</i> [<i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>] ...]<b>'</b>
              Embed a hyperlink using the OSC 8 terminal escape
              sequence.  Specifying <i>uri</i> starts hyperlinked text, and
              omitting it ends the hyperlink.  When <i>uri</i> is present, any
              number of additional key/value pairs can be specified;
              their interpretation is the responsibility of the pager or
              terminal.  Spaces or tabs cannot appear literally in <i>uri</i>,
              <i>key</i>, or <i>value</i>; they must be represented in an alternate
              form.

   <b>Device description files</b>
       If the <i>DESC</i> file for the character encoding contains the
       “<b>unicode</b>” directive, <i>grotty</i> emits Unicode characters in UTF-8
       encoding.  Otherwise, it emits characters in a single-byte
       encoding depending on the data in the font description files.
       See <i>groff_font</i>(5).

       A font description file may contain a directive “<b>internalname </b><i>n</i>”
       where <i>n</i> is a decimal integer.  If the 01 bit in <i>n</i> is set, then
       the font is treated as an italic font; if the 02 bit is set, then
       it is treated as a bold font.

   <b>Typefaces</b>
       <i>grotty</i> supports the standard four styles: <b>R </b>(roman), <b>I </b>(<i>italic</i>),
       <b>B </b>(<b>bold</b>), and <b>BI </b>(<i><b>bold-italic</b></i>).  Because the output driver
       operates in <i>nroff</i> mode, attempts to set or change the font family
       or type size are ignored.

Options </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b>displays a usage message, while <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>show
       version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-b     </b>Suppress the use of overstriking for bold characters in
              legacy output format.

       <b>-B     </b>Use only overstriking for bold-italic characters in legacy
              output format.

       <b>-c     </b>Use <i>grotty</i>'s legacy output format (see subsection “Legacy
              output format” above).  SGR and OSC escape sequences are
              not emitted.

       <b>-d     </b>Ignore all <b>\D </b>drawing escape sequences in the input.  By
              default, <i>grotty</i> renders <b>\D'l</b>...<b>' </b>escape sequences that
              have at least one zero argument (and so are either
              horizontal or vertical) using Unicode box drawing
              characters (for the <b>utf8 </b>device) or the <b>-</b>, <b>|</b>, and <b>+</b>
              characters (for all other devices).  <i>grotty</i> handles
              <b>\D'p</b>...<b>' </b>escape sequences that consist entirely of
              horizontal and vertical lines similarly.

       <b>-f     </b>Emit a form feed at the end of each page having no output
              on its last line.

       <b>-F </b><i>dir</i> Prepend directory dir<i>/dev</i>name to the search path for font
              and device description files; <i>name</i> describes the output
              device's character encoding, one of <b>ascii</b>, <b>latin1</b>, <b>utf8</b>,
              or <b>cp1047</b>.

       <b>-h     </b>Use literal horizontal tab characters in the output.  Tabs
              are assumed to be set every 8 columns.

       <b>-i     </b>Render oblique-styled fonts (<b>I </b>and <b>BI</b>) with the SGR
              attribute for italic text rather than underlined text.
              Many terminals don't support this attribute; however,
              <i>xterm</i>(1), since patch #314 (2014-12-28), does.  Ignored if
              <b>-c </b>is also specified.

       <b>-o     </b>Suppress overstriking (other than for bold and/or
              underlined characters when the legacy output format is in
              use).

       <b>-r     </b>Render oblique-styled fonts (<b>I </b>and <b>BI</b>) with the SGR
              attribute for reverse video text rather than underlined
              text.  Ignored if <b>-c </b>or <b>-i </b>is also specified.

       <b>-u     </b>Suppress the use of underlining for italic characters in
              legacy output format.

       <b>-U     </b>Use only underlining for bold-italic characters in legacy
              output format.

</pre> <h2>
Limitations </h2>
<pre>
       <i>grotty</i> is intended only for simple documents.

       •  There is no support for fractional horizontal or vertical
          motions.

       •  <i>roff</i> <b>\D </b>escape sequences producing anything other than
          horizontal and vertical lines are not supported.

       •  Color handling differs from other output drivers.  The <i>groff</i>
          requests and escape sequences that set the stroke and fill
          colors instead set the foreground and background character
          cell colors, respectively.

       The <b>\l </b>and <b>\L </b>escape sequences on one hand, and the <b>\D'l' </b>line-
       drawing escape sequence on the other, make different compromises
       due to the first two factors.  Specifically, (1) <b>\l </b>draws
       horizontal lines with underscore characters; <b>\D'l' </b>uses ACS or
       Unicode line-drawing characters if possible, and hyphen-minus
       signs if not.  (2) <b>\D'l' </b>draws vertical lines an extra character
       cell high, and horizontal lines an extra cell to the right.
       <i>grotty</i> does this to detect intersecting lines so that it can
       replace them with glyphs of appropriate appearance (like “+”).
       Observe the difference below.

       The input

Examples </h2>
<pre>
       The following <i>groff</i> document exercises several features for which
       output device support varies: (1) bold style; (2) italic
       (underline) style; (3) bold-italic style; (4) character
       composition by overstriking (“coöperate”); (5) foreground color;
       (6) background color; and (7) horizontal and vertical line
       drawing.

              You might see \f[B]bold\f[] and \f[I]italic\f[].
              Some people see \f[BI]both at once\f[].
              If the output device does (not) co\z\[ad]operate,
              you might see \m[red]red\m[].
