NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-init - Initialize a StGit stack on a branch
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg init</i> [OPTIONS]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Initialize a StGit stack on a branch.

       Initializing a branch with a StGit stack commits initial, empty
       stack state for the branch to the repository. Theses stack
       metadata commits are tracked by the <b>refs/stacks/&lt;branch&gt;</b>
       reference. Updated stack state is committed by each StGit command
       that modifies the stack. StGit users do not have to do anything
       with the <b>refs/stacks/&lt;branch&gt; </b>ref directly.

       Some StGit commands, such as <b>stg new </b>and <b>stg uncommit</b>, will
       automatically initialize the stack, so it is often not necessary
       to explicitly initialize the stack on a branch. Also, branches
       created with <b>stg branch --create </b>are automatically initialized.

       The branch must already exist and point to a commit before
       initializing a StGit stack.

       StGit stack metadata can be deinitialized from a branch using <b>stg</b>
       <b>branch --cleanup</b>. See <a href="stg-branch.1.html">stg-branch(1)</a> for more details.
