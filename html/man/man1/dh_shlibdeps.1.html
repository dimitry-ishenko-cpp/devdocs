NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_shlibdeps - calculate shared library dependencies
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_shlibdeps </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-L</b><i>package</i>] [<b>-l</b><i>directory</i>]
       [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [<b>-- </b><i>params</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_shlibdeps </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       calculating shared library dependencies for packages.

       This program is merely a wrapper around <a href="dpkg-shlibdeps.1.html">dpkg-shlibdeps(1)</a> that
       calls it once for each package listed in the <i>control</i> file,
       passing it a list of ELF executables and shared libraries it has
       found.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude files that contain <i>item</i> anywhere in their filename
           from being passed to <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>. This will make their
           dependencies be ignored.  This may be useful in some
           situations, but use it with caution. This option may be used
           more than once to exclude more than one thing.

       <b>-- </b><i>params</i>
           Pass <i>params</i> to <a href="dpkg-shlibdeps.1.html">dpkg-shlibdeps(1)</a>.

       <b>-u</b><i>params</i>, <b>--dpkg-shlibdeps-params=</b><i>params</i>
           This is another way to pass <i>params</i> to <a href="dpkg-shlibdeps.1.html">dpkg-shlibdeps(1)</a>.  It
           is deprecated; use <b>-- </b>instead.

       <b>-l</b><i>directory</i>[<b>:</b><i>directory</i> ...]
           With recent versions of <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>, this option is
           generally not needed.

           It tells <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>(via its <b>-l </b>parameter), to look for
           private package libraries in the specified directory (or
           directories -- separate with colons). With recent versions of
           <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>, this is mostly only useful for packages that
           build multiple flavors of the same library, or other
           situations where the library is installed into a directory
           not on the regular library search path.

       <b>-L</b><i>package</i>, <b>--libpackage=</b><i>package</i>
           With recent versions of <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>, this option is
           generally not needed, unless your package builds multiple
           flavors of the same library or is relying on
           <i>debian/shlibs.local</i> for an internal library.

           It tells <b>dpkg-shlibdeps </b>(via its <b>-S </b>parameter) to look first
           in the package build directory for the specified package,
           when searching for libraries, symbol files, and shlibs files.

           If needed, this can be passed multiple times with different
           package names.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Suppose that your source package produces libfoo1, libfoo-dev,
       and libfoo-bin binary packages. libfoo-bin links against libfoo1,
       and should depend on it. In your rules file, first run
       <b>dh_makeshlibs</b>, then <b>dh_shlibdeps</b>:

               dh_makeshlibs
               dh_shlibdeps

       This will have the effect of generating automatically a shlibs
       file for libfoo1, and using that file and the libfoo1 library in
       the <i>debian/libfoo1/usr/lib</i> directory to calculate shared library
       dependency information.

       If a libbar1 package is also produced, that is an alternate build
       of libfoo, and is installed into <i>/usr/lib/bar/</i>, you can make
       libfoo-bin depend on libbar1 as follows:

               dh_shlibdeps -Llibbar1 -l/usr/lib/bar
