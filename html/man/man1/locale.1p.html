<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       locale — get locale-specific information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       locale <b>[</b>-a|-m<b>]</b>

       locale <b>[</b>-ck<b>] </b><i>name</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>locale</i> utility shall write information about the current
       locale environment, or all public locales, to the standard
       output. For the purposes of this section, a <i>public locale</i> is one
       provided by the implementation that is accessible to the
       application.

       When <i>locale</i> is invoked without any arguments, it shall summarize
       the current locale environment for each locale category as
       determined by the settings of the environment variables defined
       in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 7</i>,
       <i>Locale</i>.

       When invoked with operands, it shall write values that have been
       assigned to the keywords in the locale categories, as follows:

        *  Specifying a keyword name shall select the named keyword and
           the category containing that keyword.

        *  Specifying a category name shall select the named category
           and all keywords in that category.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>locale</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a        </b>Write information about all available public locales.
                 The available locales shall include <b>POSIX</b>, representing
                 the POSIX locale. The manner in which the
                 implementation determines what other locales are
                 available is implementation-defined.

       <b>-c        </b>Write the names of selected locale categories; see the
                 STDOUT section.  The <b>-c </b>option increases readability
                 when more than one category is selected (for example,
                 via more than one keyword name or via a category name).
                 It is valid both with and without the <b>-k </b>option.

       <b>-k        </b>Write the names and values of selected keywords. The
                 implementation may omit values for some keywords; see
                 the OPERANDS section.

       <b>-m        </b>Write names of available charmaps; see the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 6.1</i>,
                 <i>Portable Character Set</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>name</i>      The name of a locale category as defined in the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 7</i>, <i>Locale</i>,
                 the name of a keyword in a locale category, or the
                 reserved name <b>charmap</b>.  The named category or keyword
                 shall be selected for output. If a single <i>name</i>
                 represents both a locale category name and a keyword
                 name in the current locale, the results are
                 unspecified. Otherwise, both category and keyword names
                 can be specified as <i>name</i> operands, in any sequence. It
                 is implementation-defined whether any keyword values
                 are written for the categories <i>LC_CTYPE</i> and <i>LC_COLLATE</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>locale</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       The application shall ensure that the <i>LANG</i>, <i>LC_*</i>, and <i>NLSPATH</i>
       environment variables specify the current locale environment to
       be written out; they shall be used if the <b>-a </b>option is not
       specified.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>LANG</i> variable shall be written first using the format:

           "LANG=%s\n", &lt;<i>value</i>&gt;

       If <i>LANG</i> is not set or is an empty string, the value is the empty
       string.

       If <i>locale</i> is invoked without any options or operands, the names
       and values of the <i>LC_*</i> environment variables described in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall be written to the standard output,
       one variable per line, and each line using the following format.
       Only those variables set in the environment and not overridden by
       <i>LC_ALL</i> shall be written using this format:

           "%s=%s\n", &lt;<i>variable_name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>value</i>&gt;

       The names of those <i>LC_*</i> variables associated with locale
       categories defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 that are not
       set in the environment or are overridden by <i>LC_ALL</i> shall be
       written in the following format:

           "%s=\"%s\"\n", &lt;<i>variable_name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>implied value</i>&gt;

       The &lt;<i>implied value</i>&gt; shall be the name of the locale that has been
       selected for that category by the implementation, based on the
       values in <i>LANG</i> and <i>LC_ALL</i>, as described in the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 8</i>, <i>Environment Variables</i>.

       The &lt;<i>value</i>&gt; and &lt;<i>implied value</i>&gt; shown above shall be properly
       quoted for possible later reentry to the shell. The &lt;<i>value</i>&gt; shall
       not be quoted using double-quotes (so that it can be
       distinguished by the user from the &lt;<i>implied value</i>&gt; case, which
       always requires double-quotes).

       The <i>LC_ALL</i> variable shall be written last, using the first format
       shown above. If it is not set, it shall be written as:

           "LC_ALL=\n"

       If any arguments are specified:

        1. If the <b>-a </b>option is specified, the names of all the public
           locales shall be written, each in the following format:

               "%s\n", &lt;<i>locale name</i>&gt;

        2. If the <b>-c </b>option is specified, the names of all selected
           categories shall be written, each in the following format:

               "%s\n", &lt;<i>category name</i>&gt;

           If keywords are also selected for writing (see following
           items), the category name output shall precede the keyword
           output for that category.

           If the <b>-c </b>option is not specified, the names of the
           categories shall not be written; only the keywords, as
           selected by the &lt;<i>name</i>&gt; operand, shall be written.

        3. If the <b>-k </b>option is specified, the names and values of
           selected keywords shall be written. If a value is non-numeric
           and is not a compound keyword value, it shall be written in
           the following format:

               "%s=\"%s\"\n", &lt;<i>keyword name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>keyword value</i>&gt;

           If a value is a non-numeric compound keyword value, it shall
           either be written in the format:

               "%s=\"%s\"\n", &lt;<i>keyword name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>keyword value</i>&gt;

           where the &lt;<i>keyword value</i>&gt; is a single string of values
           separated by &lt;semicolon&gt; characters, or it shall be written
           in the format:

               "%s=%s\n", &lt;<i>keyword name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>keyword value</i>&gt;

           where the &lt;<i>keyword value</i>&gt; is encoded as a set of strings,
           each enclosed in double-quotation-marks, separated by
           &lt;semicolon&gt; characters.

           If the keyword was <b>charmap</b>, the name of the charmap (if any)
           that was specified via the <i>localedef</i> <b>-f </b>option when the
           locale was created shall be written, with the word <b>charmap </b>as
           &lt;<i>keyword name</i>&gt;.

           If a value is numeric, it shall be written in one of the
           following formats:

               "%s=%d\n", &lt;<i>keyword name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>keyword value</i>&gt;

               "%s=%c%o\n", &lt;<i>keyword name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>escape character</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>keyword value</i>&gt;

               "%s=%cx%x\n", &lt;<i>keyword name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>escape character</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>keyword value</i>&gt;

           where the &lt;<i>escape character</i>&gt; is that identified by the
           <b>escape_char </b>keyword in the current locale; see the Base
           Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 7.3</i>, <i>Locale</i>
           <i>Definition</i>.

           Compound keyword values (list entries) shall be separated in
           the output by &lt;semicolon&gt; characters. When included in
           keyword values, the &lt;semicolon&gt;, &lt;backslash&gt;, double-quote,
           and any control character shall be preceded (escaped) with
           the escape character.

        4. If the <b>-k </b>option is not specified, selected keyword values
           shall be written, each in the following format:

               "%s\n", &lt;<i>keyword value</i>&gt;

           If the keyword was <b>charmap</b>, the name of the charmap (if any)
           that was specified via the <i>localedef</i> <b>-f </b>option when the
           locale was created shall be written.

        5. If the <b>-m </b>option is specified, then a list of all available
           charmaps shall be written, each in the format:

               "%s\n", &lt;<i>charmap</i>&gt;

           where &lt;<i>charmap</i>&gt; is in a format suitable for use as the
           option-argument to the <i>localedef</i> <b>-f </b>option.
</pre> <h2>

        0    All the requested information was found and output
             successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the <i>LANG</i> environment variable is not set or set to an empty
       value, or one of the <i>LC_*</i> environment variables is set to an
       unrecognized value, the actual locales assumed (if any) are
       implementation-defined as described in the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 8</i>, <i>Environment Variables</i>.

       Implementations are not required to write out the actual values
       for keywords in the categories <i>LC_CTYPE</i> and <i>LC_COLLATE</i>; however,
       they must write out the categories (allowing an application to
       determine, for example, which character classes are available).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       In the following examples, the assumption is that locale
       environment variables are set as follows:

           LANG=locale_x
           LC_COLLATE=locale_y

       The command <i>locale</i> would result in the following output:

           LANG=locale_x
           LC_CTYPE="locale_x"
           LC_COLLATE=locale_y
           LC_TIME="locale_x"
           LC_NUMERIC="locale_x"
           LC_MONETARY="locale_x"
           LC_MESSAGES="locale_x"
           LC_ALL=

       The order of presentation of the categories is not specified by
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The command:

           LC_ALL=POSIX locale -ck decimal_point

       would produce:

           LC_NUMERIC
           decimal_point="."

       The following command shows an application of <i>locale</i> to determine
       whether a user-supplied response is affirmative:

           printf 'Prompt for response: '
           read response
           if printf "%s\n$response" | grep -- -Eq "$(locale yesexpr)"
           then
               affirmative processing goes here
           else
               non-affirmative processing goes here
           fi
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The output for categories <i>LC_CTYPE</i> and <i>LC_COLLATE</i> has been made
       implementation-defined because there is a questionable value in
       having a shell script receive an entire array of characters.  It
       is also difficult to return a logical collation description,
       short of returning a complete <i>localedef</i> source.

       The <b>-m </b>option was included to allow applications to query for the
       existence of charmaps.  The output is a list of the charmaps
       (implementation-supplied and user-supplied, if any) on the
       system.

       The <b>-c </b>option was included for readability when more than one
       category is selected (for example, via more than one keyword name
       or via a category name). It is valid both with and without the <b>-k</b>
       option.

       The <b>charmap </b>keyword, which returns the name of the charmap (if
       any) that was used when the current locale was created, was
       included to allow applications needing the information to
       retrieve it.

       According to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section</i>
       <i>6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>, the standard requires that all
       supported locales must have the same encoding for &lt;period&gt; and
       &lt;slash&gt;, because these two characters are used within the locale-
       independent pathname resolution sequence. Therefore, it would be
       an error if <i>locale</i> <b>-a </b>listed both ASCII and EBCDIC-based locales,
       since those two encodings do not share the same representation
       for either &lt;period&gt; or &lt;slash&gt;.  Any system that supports both
       environments would be expected to provide two POSIX locales, one
       in either codeset, where only the locales appropriate to the
       current environment can be visible at a time. In an XSI-compliant
       implementation, the <i>dd</i> utility is the only portable means for
       performing conversions between the two character sets.
