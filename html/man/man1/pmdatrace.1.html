DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdatrace </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports transaction performance metrics from application
       processes which use the <i>pcp_trace</i> library described in
       <a href="../man3/pmdatrace.3.html">pmdatrace(3)</a>.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdatrace </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>trace.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdatrace </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-A   </b>Host-based access control for <b>pmdatrace</b>.  <i>access</i> must be
            either an allow or deny specification, using either
            allow:hostspec:maxconns or disallow:hostspec, where `allow'
            and `disallow' are keywords, `hostspec' is a host
            specification conforming to the format used by both <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            and <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>, and `maxconns' is the maximum number of
            connections allowed from a given `hostspec'.  Using a
            maximum connections of zero specifies an unlimited number of
            connections for the accompanying `hostspec'.

       <b>-I   </b>Communicate with <i>pcp_trace</i> clients via the given Internet
            <i>port</i>.  This can alternatively be specified by setting
            <b>$PCP_TRACE_PORT </b>in the environment to some valid port number
            (use of the <b>-I </b>option overrides this).  The default port
            number is 4323.

       <b>-T   </b><i>period</i> defines the aggregation period used to compute the
            recent averages and extrema.  Specified as a time interval
            using the syntax described in <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for the common <b>-t</b>
            PCP argument, e.g. <b>30 seconds </b>or <b>1 min</b>.  The default is 60
            seconds.

       <b>-M   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.

       <b>-N   </b>Internally, the aggregation <i>period</i> is divided into <i>bucket</i>
            divisions, and the rolling average is recomputed every
            <i>period</i>/<i>bucket</i> seconds.  For example, the defaults correspond
            to -T 60 and -N 12, which means the average is recomputed
            every five seconds for a period covering the prior 60
            seconds.

       <b>-U   </b>This option allows the dimension and scale associated with
            the observation value metric to be configured.  <i>units</i> is a
            comma-separated string of six integer values, which are the
            space dimension, time dimension, count dimension, space
            scale, time scale, and count scale, respectively.  The
            default dimension and scale is ``none'', which is equivalent
            to presenting ``0,0,0,0,0,0'' as the argument to -U.  The
            units associated with a metric are most easily viewed using
            the -d (metric description) option to <a href="pminfo.1.html">pminfo(1)</a>.  The
            Install script described below steps through this option
            quite explicitly, so it is recommended that the Install
            script be used for building up the <i>units</i> specification.

       Essentially, the exported metrics provide statistics on the time
       for completion of each transaction, and an average count of
       transactions completed and watch points passed over a given time
       <i>period</i>.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       In order for a host to export the names, help text and values for
       the Trace performance metrics, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace
            # ./Install

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/trace
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdatrace </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</b>

              from <b>pmdatrace</b>
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
