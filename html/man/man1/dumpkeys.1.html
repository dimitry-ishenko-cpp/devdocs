</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dumpkeys - dump keyboard translation tables
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dumpkeys </b>[OPTIONS]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dumpkeys </b>writes, to the standard output, the current contents of
       the keyboard driver's translation tables, in the format specified
       by <a href="../man5/keymaps.5.html">keymaps(5)</a>.

       Using the various options, the format of the output can be
       controlled and also other information from the kernel and the
       programs <a href="dumpkeys.1.html">dumpkeys(1)</a> and <a href="loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys(1)</a> can be obtained.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-h --help</b>
              Prints the program's version number and a short usage
              message to the program's standard error output and exits.

       <b>-i --short-info</b>
              Prints some characteristics of the kernel's keyboard
              driver. The items shown are:

              Keycode range supported by the kernel

                     This tells what values can be used after the
                     <b>keycode </b>keyword in keytable files. See <a href="../man5/keymaps.5.html">keymaps(5)</a>
                     for more information and the syntax of these files.

              Number of actions bindable to a key

                     This tells how many different actions a single key
                     can output using various modifier keys. If the
                     value is 16 for example, you can define up to 16
                     different actions to a key combined with modifiers.
                     When the value is 16, the kernel probably knows
                     about four modifier keys, which you can press in
                     different combinations with the key to access all
                     the bound actions.

              Ranges of action codes supported by the kernel

                     This item contains a list of action code ranges in
                     hexadecimal notation.  These are the values that
                     can be used in the right hand side of a key
                     definition, ie. the <i>vv</i>'s in a line

                            <b>keycode </b><i>xx</i> = <i>vv vv vv vv</i>

                     (see <a href="../man5/keymaps.5.html">keymaps(5)</a> for more information about the
                     format of key definition lines).  <a href="dumpkeys.1.html">dumpkeys(1)</a> and
                     <a href="loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys(1)</a> support a symbolic notation, which is
                     preferable to the numeric one, as the action codes
                     may vary from kernel to kernel while the symbolic
                     names usually remain the same. However, the list of
                     action code ranges can be used to determine, if the
                     kernel actually supports all the symbols
                     <a href="loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys(1)</a> knows, or are there maybe some actions
                     supported by the kernel that have no symbolic name
                     in your <a href="loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys(1)</a> program. To see this, you
                     compare the range list with the action symbol list,
                     see option <b>--long-info </b>below.

              Number of function keys supported by kernel

                     This tells the number of action codes that can be
                     used to output strings of characters. These action
                     codes are traditionally bound to the various
                     function and editing keys of the keyboard and are
                     defined to send standard escape sequences. However,
                     you can redefine these to send common command
                     lines, email addresses or whatever you like.
                     Especially if the number of this item is greater
                     than the number of function and editing keys in
                     your keyboard, you may have some "spare" action
                     codes that you can bind to AltGr-letter
                     combinations, for example, to send some useful
                     strings. See <a href="loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys(1)</a> for more details.

              Function strings

                     You can see you current function key definitions
                     with the command

                            <b>dumpkeys --funcs-only</b>

       <b>-l -s --long-info</b>
              This option instructs <b>dumpkeys </b>to print a long information
              listing. The output is the same as with the <b>--short-info</b>
              appended with the list of action symbols supported by
              <a href="loadkeys.1.html">loadkeys(1)</a> and <a href="dumpkeys.1.html">dumpkeys(1)</a>, along with the symbols'
              numeric values.

       <b>-n --numeric</b>
              This option causes <b>dumpkeys </b>to by-pass the conversion of
              action code values to symbolic notation and to print the
              in hexadecimal format instead.

       <b>-f --full-table</b>
              This makes <b>dumpkeys </b>skip all the short-hand heuristics
              (see <a href="../man5/keymaps.5.html">keymaps(5)</a>) and output the key bindings in the
              canonical form. First a keymaps line describing the
              currently defined modifier combinations is printed. Then
              for each key a row with a column for each modifier
              combination is printed. For example, if the current keymap
              in use uses seven modifiers, every row will have seven
              action code columns. This format can be useful for example
              to programs that post-process the output of <b>dumpkeys</b>.

       <b>-S</b><i>shape</i>  <b>--shape=</b><i>shape</i>
              Available shapes:

              <b>2 </b>default output.

              <b>4 </b>one line for each keycode.

              <b>8 </b>one line for each (modifier,keycode) pair.

              <b>16 </b>one line for each keycode until 1st hole.

       <b>-1 --separate-lines</b>
              This forces <b>dumpkeys </b>to write one line per
              (modifier,keycode) pair. It prefixes the word <i>plain</i> for
              plain keycodes.

       <b>-t --funcs-only</b>
              When this option is given, <b>dumpkeys </b>prints only the
              function key string definitions. Normally <b>dumpkeys </b>prints
              both the key bindings and the string definitions.

       <b>-k --keys-only</b>
              When this option is given, <b>dumpkeys </b>prints only the key
              bindings. Normally <b>dumpkeys </b>prints both the key bindings
              and the string definitions.

       <b>-d --compose-only</b>
              When this option is given, <b>dumpkeys </b>prints only the
              compose key combinations.  This option is available only
              if your kernel has compose key support.

       <b>-c</b><i>charset</i>  <b>--charset=</b><i>charset</i>
              This instructs <b>dumpkeys </b>to interpret character code values
              according to the specified character set. This affects
              only the translation of character code values to symbolic
              names. Valid values for <i>charset</i> currently are <b>iso-8859-X</b>,
              Where X is a digit in 1-9.  If no <i>charset</i> is specified,
              <b>iso-8859-1 </b>is used as a default.  This option produces an
              output line `charset "iso-8859-X"', telling loadkeys how
              to interpret the keymap. (For example, "division" is 0xf7
              in iso-8859-1 but 0xba in iso-8859-8.)

       <b>-C</b><i>dev</i>  <b>--console=</b><i>dev</i>
              The affected console device can be specified using the <i>-C</i>
              (or <i>--console</i> ) option. This option supports exactly one
              device name.

       <b>-v --verbose</b>
              Turn on verbose output.

       <b>-V --version</b>
              Prints version number and exits.
