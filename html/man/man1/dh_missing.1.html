</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_missing - check for missing files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_missing </b>[<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [<b>--sourcedir=</b><i>dir</i>] [<i>debhelper options</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_missing </b>compares the list of installed files with the files in
       the source directory. If any of the files (and symlinks) in the
       source directory were not installed to somewhere, it will warn on
       stderr about that (<b>--list-missing</b>) or fail (<b>--fail-missing</b>).

       Please note that in compat 11 and earlier without either of these
       options, <b>dh_missing </b>will silently do nothing.  In compat 12,
       <b>--list-missing </b>is the default  In compat 13 and later,
       <b>--fail-missing </b>is the default.

       This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make
       sure that you don't miss installing newly added files in new
       upstream releases.

       Remember to test different kinds of builds (dpkg-buildpackage
       -A/-B/...) as you may experience varying results when only a
       subset of the packages are built.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/not-installed
           List the files that are deliberately not installed in <i>any</i>
           binary package.  Paths listed in this file are ignored by
           <b>dh_missing</b>.  However, it is <b>not </b>a method to exclude files
           from being installed by any of the debhelper tool.  If you
           want a tool to not install a given file, please use its
           <b>--exclude </b>option (where available).

           <b>dh_missing </b>will expand wildcards in this file (since
           debhelper 11.1).  Wildcards without matches will be ignored.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
           documented in <a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper(7)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--list-missing</b>
           Warn on stderr about source files not installed to somewhere.

           Note that many dh-tools acting on a path will mark the path
           as installed even if it has been excluded via <b>-X </b>or
           <b>--exclude</b>.  This is also seen when a dh-tool is acting on a
           directory and exclusion is used to ignore some files in the
           directory.  In either case, this will make <b>dh_missing</b>
           silently assume the excluded files have been handled.

           This is the default in compat 12.

       <b>--fail-missing</b>
           This option is like <b>--list-missing</b>, except if a file was
           missed, it will not only list the missing files, but also
           fail with a nonzero exit code.

           This is the default in compat 13 and later.
