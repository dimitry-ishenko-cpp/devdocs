NAME </h2>
<pre>
       hardlink - link multiple copies of a file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>hardlink </b>[options] [<i>directory</i>|<i>file</i>]...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>hardlink </b>is a tool that replaces copies of a file with either
       hardlinks or copy-on-write clones, thus saving space.

       <b>hardlink </b>first creates a binary tree of file sizes and then
       compares the content of files that have the same size. There are
       two basic content comparison methods. The <b>memcmp </b>method directly
       reads data blocks from files and compares them. The other method
       is based on checksums (like SHA256); in this case for each data
       block a checksum is calculated by the Linux kernel crypto API,
       and this checksum is stored in userspace and used for file
       comparisons.

       For each file also an "intro" buffer (32 bytes) is cached. This
       buffer is used independently from the comparison method and
       requested cache-size and io-size. The "intro" buffer dramatically
       reduces operations with data content as files are very often
       different from the beginning.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--content</b>
           Consider only file content, not attributes, when determining
           whether two files are equal. Same as <b>-pot</b>.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--io-size </b><i>size</i>
           The size of the <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile(2)</a> buffer used when
           comparing file contents. The <i>size</i> argument may be followed by
           the multiplicative suffixes KiB, MiB, etc. The "iB" is
           optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB". The
           default is 8KiB for memcmp method and 1MiB for the other
           methods. The only memcmp method uses process memory for the
           buffer, other methods use zero-copy way and I/O operation is
           done in the kernel. The size may be altered on the fly to fit
           a number of cached content checksums.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--respect-dir</b>
           Only try to link files with the same directory name. The
           top-level directory (as specified on the <b>hardlink </b>command
           line) is ignored. For example, <b>hardlink --respect-dir /foo</b>
           <b>/bar </b>will link <i>/foo/some/file</i> with <i>/bar/some/file</i>, but not
           <i>/bar/other/file</i>. If combined with <b>--respect-name</b>, then entire
           paths (except the top-level directory) are compared.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--respect-name</b>
           Only try to link files with the same (base)name. It’s
           strongly recommended to use long options rather than <b>-f </b>which
           is interpreted in a different way by other <b>hardlink</b>
           implementations.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--prioritize-trees</b>
           Keep files found in the earliest specified top-level
           directory if there are multiple identical files in different
           trees. For example, <b>hardlink foo/ bar/ </b>will link files in
           bar/ to equal files in the foo/ directory.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--include </b><i>regex</i>
           A regular expression to include files. If the option
           <b>--exclude </b>has been given, this option re-includes files which
           would otherwise be excluded. If the option is used without
           <b>--exclude</b>, only files matched by the pattern are included.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maximize</b>
           Among equal files, keep the file with the highest link count.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--minimize</b>
           Among equal files, keep the file with the lowest link count.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
           Do not act, just print what would happen.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--ignore-owner</b>
           Link and compare files even if their owner information (user
           and group) differs. Results may be unpredictable.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--keep-oldest</b>
           Among equal files, keep the oldest file (least recent
           modification time). By default, the newest file is kept. If
           <b>--maximize </b>or <b>--minimize </b>is specified, the link count has a
           higher precedence than the time of modification.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--ignore-mode</b>
           Link and compare files even if their mode is different.
           Results may be slightly unpredictable.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Quiet mode, don’t print anything.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--cache-size </b><i>size</i>
           The size of the cache for content checksums. All non-memcmp
           methods calculate checksum for each file content block (see
           <b>--io-size</b>), these checksums are cached for the next
           comparison. The size is important for large files or a large
           sets of files of the same size. The default is 10MiB.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--minimum-size </b><i>size</i>
           The minimum size to consider. By default this is 1, so empty
           files will not be linked. The <i>size</i> argument may be followed
           by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024),
           and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is
           optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB").

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--maximum-size </b><i>size</i>
           The maximum size to consider. By default this is 0 and 0 has
           the special meaning of unlimited. The <i>size</i> argument may be
           followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB
           (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB
           (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as
           "KiB").

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--ignore-time</b>
           Link and compare files even if their time of modification is
           different. This is usually a good choice.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Verbose output, explain to the user what is being done. If
           specified once, every hardlinked file is displayed. If
           specified twice, it also shows every comparison.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exclude </b><i>regex</i>
           A regular expression which excludes files from being compared
           and linked.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--respect-xattrs</b>
           Only try to link files with the same extended attributes.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--method </b><i>name</i>
           Set the file content comparison method. The currently
           supported methods are sha256, sha1, crc32c and memcmp. The
           default is sha256, or memcmp if Linux Crypto API is not
           available. The methods based on checksums are implemented in
           zero-copy way, in this case file contents are not copied to
           the userspace and all calculation is done in kernel.

       <b>--reflink</b>[=<i>when</i>]
           Create copy-on-write clones (aka reflinks) rather than
           hardlinks. The reflinked files share only on-disk data, but
           the file mode and owner can be different. It’s recommended to
           use it with <b>--ignore-owner </b>and <b>--ignore-mode </b>options. This
           option implies <b>--skip-reflinks </b>to ignore already cloned
           files.

           The optional argument <i>when</i> can be <b>never</b>, <b>always</b>, or <b>auto</b>. If
           the <i>when</i> argument is omitted, it defaults to <b>auto</b>, in this
           case, <b>hardlink </b>checks filesystem type and uses reflinks on
           BTRFS and XFS only, and fallback to hardlinks when creating
           reflink is impossible. The argument <b>always </b>disables
           filesystem type detection and fallback to hardlinks, in this
           case, only reflinks are allowed.

       <b>--skip-reflinks</b>
           Ignore already cloned files. This option may be used without
           <b>--reflink </b>when creating classic hardlinks.
</pre> <h2>
ARGUMENTS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>hardlink </b>takes one or more directories which will be searched for
       files to be linked.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The original <b>hardlink </b>implementation uses the option <b>-f </b>to force
       hardlinks creation between filesystem. This very rarely usable
       feature is no more supported by the current <b>hardlink</b>.

       <b>hardlink </b>assumes that the trees it operates on do not change
       during operation. If a tree does change, the result is undefined
       and potentially dangerous. For example, if a regular file is
       replaced by a device, <b>hardlink </b>may start reading from the device.
       If a component of a path is replaced by a symbolic link or file
       permissions change, security may be compromised. Do not run
       <b>hardlink </b>on a changing tree or on a tree controlled by another
       user.
</pre> <h2>
AUTHOR </h2>
<pre>
       There are multiple <b>hardlink </b>implementations. The very first
       implementation is from Jakub Jelinek for Fedora distribution,
       this implementation has been used in util-linux between versions
       v2.34 to v2.36. The current implementations is based on Debian
       version from Julian Andres Klode.
