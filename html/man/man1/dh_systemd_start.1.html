NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_systemd_start - start/stop/restart systemd unit files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_systemd_start </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>--restart-after-upgrade</b>]
       [<b>--no-stop-on-upgrade</b>] [<i>unit file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_systemd_start </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       starting/stopping or restarting systemd unit files in case no
       corresponding sysv init script is available.

       As with <b>dh_installinit</b>, the unit file is stopped before upgrades
       and started afterwards (unless <b>--restart-after-upgrade </b>is
       specified, in which case it will only be restarted after the
       upgrade).  This logic is not used when there is a corresponding
       SysV init script because invoke-rc.d performs the
       stop/start/restart in that case.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--restart-after-upgrade</b>
           Do not stop the unit file until after the package upgrade has
           been completed.  This is the default behaviour in compat 10.

           In earlier compat levels the default was to stop the unit
           file in the <i>prerm</i>, and start it again in the <i>postinst</i>.

           This can be useful for daemons that should not have a
           possibly long downtime during upgrade. But you should make
           sure that the daemon will not get confused by the package
           being upgraded while it's running before using this option.

       <b>--no-restart-after-upgrade</b>
           Undo a previous <b>--restart-after-upgrade </b>(or the default of
           compat 10).  If no other options are given, this will cause
           the service to be stopped in the <i>prerm</i> script and started
           again in the <i>postinst</i> script.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-stop-on-upgrade</b>, <b>--no-restart-on-upgrade</b>
           Do not stop service on upgrade.

       <b>--no-start</b>
           Do not start the unit file after upgrades and after initial
           installation (the latter is only relevant for services
           without a corresponding init script).

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that this command is not idempotent. <a href="dh_prep.1.html">dh_prep(1)</a> should be
       called between invocations of this command (with the same
       arguments). Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the
       same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

       Note that <b>dh_systemd_start </b>should be run after <b>dh_installinit </b>so
       that it can detect corresponding SysV init scripts. The default
       sequence in <b>dh </b>does the right thing, this note is only relevant
       when you are calling <b>dh_systemd_start </b>manually.
