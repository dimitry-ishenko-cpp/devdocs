NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mariadb-upgrade - check tables for MariaDB upgrade (mysql_upgrade
       is now a symlink to mariadb-upgrade)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>mysql_upgrade [</b><i>options</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mysql_upgrade </b>examines all tables in all databases for
       incompatibilities with the current version of the MariaDB Server.
       <b>mysql_upgrade </b>also upgrades the system tables so that you can
       take advantage of new privileges or capabilities that might have
       been added.

       <b>mysql_upgrade </b>should be executed each time you upgrade MariaDB.

       If a table is found to have a possible incompatibility,
       <b>mysql_upgrade </b>performs a table check. If any problems are found,
       a table repair is attempted.

           <b>Note</b>

           On Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, you must run
           <b>mysql_upgrade </b>with administrator privileges. You can do this
           by running a Command Prompt as Administrator and running the
           command. Failure to do so may result in the upgrade failing
           to execute correctly.

           <b>Caution</b>

           You should always back up your current MariaDB installation
           <i>before</i> performing an upgrade.

       To use <b>mysql_upgrade</b>, make sure that the server is running, and
       then invoke it like this:

           shell&gt; <b>mysql_upgrade [</b><i>options</i><b>]</b>

       After running <b>mysql_upgrade</b>, stop the server and restart it so
       that any changes made to the system tables take effect.

       <b>mysql_upgrade </b>executes the following commands to check and repair
       tables and to upgrade the system tables:

           mysqlcheck --all-databases --check-upgrade --auto-repair
           mysql &lt; <i>fix_priv_tables</i>
           mysqlcheck --all-databases --check-upgrade --fix-db-names --fix-table-names

       Notes about the preceding commands:

       •   Because <b>mysql_upgrade </b>invokes <b>mysqlcheck </b>with the
           <b>--all-databases </b>option, it processes all tables in all
           databases, which might take a long time to complete. Each
           table is locked and therefore unavailable to other sessions
           while it is being processed. Check and repair operations can
           be time-consuming, particularly for large tables.

       •   For details about what checks the <b>--check-upgrade </b>option
           entails, see the description of the FOR UPGRADE option of the
           CHECK TABLE statement.

       •   <i>fix_priv_tables</i> represents a script generated internally by
           <b>mysql_upgrade </b>that contains SQL statements to upgrade the
           tables in the mysql database.

       All checked and repaired tables are marked with the current
       MariaDB version number. This ensures that next time you run
       <b>mysql_upgrade </b>with the same version of the server, it can tell
       whether there is any need to check or repair the table again.

       <b>mysql_upgrade </b>also saves the MariaDB version number in a file
       named mysql_upgrade_info in the data directory. This is used to
       quickly check whether all tables have been checked for this
       release so that table-checking can be skipped. To ignore this
       file and perform the check regardless, use the <b>--force </b>option.

       For this reason, <b>mysql_upgrade </b>needs to be run as a user with
       write access to the data directory.

       If you install MariaDB from RPM packages on Linux, you must
       install the server and client RPMs.  <b>mysql_upgrade </b>is included in
       the server RPM but requires the client RPM because the latter
       includes <b>mysqlcheck</b>.

       <b>mysql_upgrade </b>supports the following options, which can be
       specified on the command line or in the [mysql_upgrade] and
       [client] option file groups. Other options are passed to
       <b>mysqlcheck</b>. For example, it might be necessary to specify the
       <b>--password[=</b><i>password</i><b>] </b>option.  <b>mysql_upgrade </b>also supports the
       options for processing option files.

       •   <b>--help</b>, <b>-?</b>

           Display a short help message and exit.

       •   <b>--basedir=</b><i>path</i>

           Old option accepted for backward compatibility but ignored.

       •   <b>--character-sets-dir=</b><i>path</i>

           Old option accepted for backward compatibility but ignored.

       •   <b>--check-if-upgrade-is-needed</b>

           Exit with a status code indicating if an upgrade is needed.
           Returns 0 if upgrade needed or current version couldn't be
           determined, 1 when no action required.

       •   <b>--datadir=</b><i>path</i>

           Old option accepted for backward compatibility but ignored.

       •   <b>--debug=</b><i>path</i>, <b>-# </b><i>path</i>

           For debug builds, output debug log.

       •   <b>--debug-check</b>

           Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       •   <b>--debug-info</b>, <b>-T</b>

           Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage
           statistics when the program exits.

       •   <b>--default-character-set=</b><i>name</i>

           Old option accepted for backward compatibility but ignored.

       •   <b>--force</b>

           Ignore the mysql_upgrade_info file and force execution of
           <b>mysqlcheck </b>even if <b>mysql_upgrade </b>has already been executed
           for the current version of MariaDB.

       •   <b>--host</b>

           Connect to MariaDB on the given host.

       •   <b>--password[=</b><i>password</i><b>]</b>, <b>-p[</b><i>password</i><b>]</b>

           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use
           the short option form (<b>-p</b>), you <i>cannot</i> have a space between
           the option and the password. If you omit the <i>password</i> value
           following the <b>--password </b>or <b>-p </b>option on the command line,
           <b>mysql_upgrade </b>prompts for one.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be
           considered insecure. You can use an option file to avoid
           giving the password on the command line.

       •   <b>--port=</b><i>port_num</i>, <b>-P </b><i>port_num</i>

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

       •   <b>--protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}</b>

           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server.
           It is useful when the other connection parameters normally
           would cause a protocol to be used other than the one you
           want.

       •   <b>--silent</b>

           Print less information.

       •   <b>--socket=</b><i>path</i>, <b>-S </b><i>path</i>

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use,
           or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.

       •   <b>--ssl</b>

           Enable SSL for connection (automatically enabled with other
           flags). Disable with <b>--skip-ssl</b>.

       •   <b>--ssl-ca=</b><i>name</i>

           CA file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies <b>--ssl</b>).

       •   <b>--ssl-capath=</b><i>name</i>

       •   <b>--ssl-key=</b><i>name</i>

           X509 key in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies <b>--ssl</b>).

       •   <b>--ssl-crl=</b><i>name</i>

           Certificate revocation list (check OpenSSL docs, implies
           <b>--ssl</b>).

       •   <b>--ssl-crlpath=</b><i>name</i>

           Certificate revocation list path (check OpenSSL docs, implies
           <b>--ssl</b>).

       •   <b>--ssl-verify-server-cert</b>

           Verify server's "Common Name" in its cert against hostname
           used when connecting. This option is disabled by default.

       •   <b>--tmpdir=</b><i>path</i>, <b>-t </b><i>path</i>

           The path name of the directory to use for creating temporary
           files.

       •   <b>--upgrade-system-tables</b>, <b>-s</b>

           Only upgrade the system tables in the mysql database. Tables
           in other databases are not checked or touched.

       •   <b>--user=</b><i>user_name</i>, <b>-u </b><i>user_name</i>

           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server
           and not using the current login.

       •   <b>--verbose</b>

           Display more output about the process. Using it twice will
           print connection arguments; using it 3 times will print out
           all CHECK, RENAME and ALTER TABLE commands used during the
           check phase; using it 4 times (added in MariaDB 10.0.14) will
           also write out all mariadb-check commands used; using it 5
           times will print all the mariadb commands used and their
           results while running mysql_fix_privilege_tables script.

       •   <b>--version</b>, <b>-V</b>

           Output version information and exit.

       •   <b>--version-check</b>, <b>-k</b>

           Run this program only if its 'server version' matches the
           version of the server to which it's connecting. Note: the
           'server version' of the program is the version of the MariaDB
           server with which it was built/distributed. Defaults to on;
           use <b>--skip-version-check </b>to disable.

       •   <b>--write-binlog</b>

           Cause binary logging to be enabled while <b>mysql_upgrade </b>runs.
