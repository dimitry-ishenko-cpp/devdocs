       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       trap — trap signals
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       trap <i>n</i> <b>[</b><i>condition</i>...<b>]</b>
       trap <b>[</b><i>action condition</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If the first operand is an unsigned decimal integer, the shell
       shall treat all operands as conditions, and shall reset each
       condition to the default value. Otherwise, if there are operands,
       the first is treated as an action and the remaining as
       conditions.

       If <i>action</i> is <b>'-'</b>, the shell shall reset each <i>condition</i> to the
       default value. If <i>action</i> is null (<b>""</b>), the shell shall ignore
       each specified <i>condition</i> if it arises. Otherwise, the argument
       <i>action</i> shall be read and executed by the shell when one of the
       corresponding conditions arises. The action of <i>trap</i> shall
       override a previous action (either default action or one
       explicitly set). The value of <b>"$?" </b>after the <i>trap</i> action
       completes shall be the value it had before <i>trap</i> was invoked.

       The condition can be EXIT, 0 (equivalent to EXIT), or a signal
       specified using a symbolic name, without the SIG prefix, as
       listed in the tables of signal names in the <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> header
       defined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter</i>
       <i>13</i>, <i>Headers</i>; for example, HUP, INT, QUIT, TERM. Implementations
       may permit names with the SIG prefix or ignore case in signal
       names as an extension. Setting a trap for SIGKILL or SIGSTOP
       produces undefined results.

       The environment in which the shell executes a <i>trap</i> on EXIT shall
       be identical to the environment immediately after the last
       command executed before the <i>trap</i> on EXIT was taken.

       Each time <i>trap</i> is invoked, the <i>action</i> argument shall be processed
       in a manner equivalent to:

           eval <i>action</i>

       Signals that were ignored on entry to a non-interactive shell
       cannot be trapped or reset, although no error need be reported
       when attempting to do so. An interactive shell may reset or catch
       signals ignored on entry. Traps shall remain in place for a given
       shell until explicitly changed with another <i>trap</i> command.

       When a subshell is entered, traps that are not being ignored
       shall be set to the default actions, except in the case of a
       command substitution containing only a single <i>trap</i> command, when
       the traps need not be altered. Implementations may check for this
       case using only lexical analysis; for example, if <i>`trap`</i> and <i>$(</i>
       <i>trap -- )</i> do not alter the traps in the subshell, cases such as
       assigning <i>var=trap</i> and then using <i>$($var)</i> may still alter them.
       This does not imply that the <i>trap</i> command cannot be used within
       the subshell to set new traps.

       The <i>trap</i> command with no operands shall write to standard output
       a list of commands associated with each condition. If the command
       is executed in a subshell, the implementation does not perform
       the optional check described above for a command substitution
       containing only a single <i>trap</i> command, and no <i>trap</i> commands with
       operands have been executed since entry to the subshell, the list
       shall contain the commands that were associated with each
       condition immediately before the subshell environment was
       entered.  Otherwise, the list shall contain the commands
       currently associated with each condition. The format shall be:

           "trap -- %s %s ...\n", &lt;<i>action</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>condition</i>&gt; ...

       The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of
       quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as
       commands that achieve the same trapping results. For example:

           save_traps=$(trap)
           ...
           eval "$save_traps"

       XSI-conformant systems also allow numeric signal numbers for the
       conditions corresponding to the following signal names:

       1     SIGHUP

       2     SIGINT

       3     SIGQUIT

       6     SIGABRT

       9     SIGKILL

       14    SIGALRM

       15    SIGTERM

       The <i>trap</i> special built-in shall conform to the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       numbers shall not be considered a syntax error and do not cause
       the shell to abort.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Write out a list of all traps and actions:

           trap

       Set a trap so the <i>logout</i> utility in the directory referred to by
       the <i>HOME</i> environment variable executes when the shell terminates:

           trap '"$HOME"/logout' EXIT

       or:

           trap '"$HOME"/logout' 0

       Unset traps on INT, QUIT, TERM, and EXIT:

           trap - INT QUIT TERM EXIT
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Implementations may permit lowercase signal names as an
       extension.  Implementations may also accept the names with the
       SIG prefix; no known historical shell does so. The <i>trap</i> and <i>kill</i>
       utilities in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 are now consistent in
       their omission of the SIG prefix for signal names. Some <i>kill</i>
       implementations do not allow the prefix, and <i>kill</i> <b>-l </b>lists the
       signals without prefixes.

       Trapping SIGKILL or SIGSTOP is syntactically accepted by some
       historical implementations, but it has no effect. Portable POSIX
       applications cannot attempt to trap these signals.

       The output format is not historical practice. Since the output of
       historical <i>trap</i> commands is not portable (because numeric signal
       values are not portable) and had to change to become so, an
       opportunity was taken to format the output in a way that a shell
       script could use to save and then later reuse a trap if it
       wanted.

       The KornShell uses an <b>ERR </b>trap that is triggered whenever <i>set</i> <b>-e</b>
       would cause an exit. This is allowable as an extension, but was
       not mandated, as other shells have not used it.

       The text about the environment for the EXIT trap invalidates the
       behavior of some historical versions of interactive shells which,
       for example, close the standard input before executing a trap on
       0. For example, in some historical interactive shell sessions the
       following trap on 0 would always print <b>"--"</b>:

           trap 'read foo; echo "-$foo-"' 0

       The command:

           trap 'eval " $cmd"' 0

       causes the contents of the shell variable <i>cmd</i> to be executed as a
       command when the shell exits. Using:

           trap '$cmd' 0

       does not work correctly if <i>cmd</i> contains any special characters
       such as quoting or redirections. Using:

           trap " $cmd" 0

       also works (the leading &lt;space&gt; character protects against
       unlikely cases where <i>cmd</i> is a decimal integer or begins with
       <b>'-'</b>), but it expands the <i>cmd</i> variable when the <i>trap</i> command is
       executed, not when the exit action is executed.
