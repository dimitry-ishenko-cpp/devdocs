DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmchart </b>is a graphical utility that plots performance metrics
       values available through the facilities of the Performance Co-
       Pilot (PCP).  Multiple charts can be displayed simultaneously,
       either aligned on the unified time axis (X-axis), and through the
       use of multiple interface Tabs.

       Metric values can be sourced from one or more live hosts
       (simultaneously).  Alternatively, one or more sets of PCP
       archives can be used as a source of historical data.  See
       <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for an in-depth discussion of the capabilities of the
       PCP framework, many of which are used by <b>pmchart.</b>

       Many aspects of the behaviour of <b>pmchart </b>can be customised
       through the interface.  In particular, the use of "views" (refer
       to the section describing VIEWS later in this document) allows
       predefined sets of metrics and charting parameters like colors,
       scaling, titles, legends, and so on to be stored for later use,
       or use with different hosts and sets of archives.  In addition,
       the Preferences dialog allows customisations to the rest of the
       <b>pmchart </b>user interface to be saved and restored between different
       invocations of the tool.  This allows the default background
       color, highlight color, contents and location of the toolbar, and
       many other aspects to be configured.

       <b>pmchart </b>makes extensive use of the <a href="pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a> utility for time
       control, refer to the <b>pmtime </b>manual page for further details of
       its operation.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-a </b><i>archive</i>, <b>--archive</b>=<i>archive</i>
            Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
            Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archives identified by this
            option, by default.  The argument is a comma-separated list
            of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive
            or the name of a directory containing one or more archives.
            The resulting set of archives will be the source of the
            performance metrics.  The initial Tab created will be an
            archive mode Tab.  Multiple <b>-a </b>options can be presented, and
            the resulting list of sets of archives is used for sourcing
            metric values.  Any <i>sources</i> listed on the command line are
            assumed to be sets of archives if this option is used.

       <b>-A </b><i>align</i>, <b>--align</b>=<i>align</i>
            Force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a
            natural time unit <i>align</i>.  Refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for a
            complete description of the syntax for <i>align</i>.

       <b>--archive-folio</b>=<i>folio</i>
            Read metric source archives from the PCP archive <i>folio</i>.

       <b>-c </b><i>configfile</i>, <b>--view</b>=<i>configfile</i>
            <i>configfile</i> specifies an initial view to load, using the
            default source of metrics.  Multiple <b>-c </b>views can be
            specified, and they will all be opened in the default Tab
            with the default source of metrics.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--check</b>
            Used with <b>-c</b>, the view(s) are parsed, any errors are
            reported, and the tool exits.  This is primarily intended
            for testing purposes.  If a second <b>-C </b>option is presented,
            <b>pmchart </b>also connects to <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to check the semantics of
            metrics.

       <b>-f </b><i>family</i>, <b>--font-family</b>=<i>family</i>
            Specify the default font <i>family</i> to be used in several chart
            components, such as the chart title, legend, and Y-axis
            label.  The default value is "Sans Serif".  This setting
            does not affect the rest of the user interface, where the
            value is inherited from the environment in which <b>pmchart</b>
            operates, and differs according to the look-and-feel of each
            platform.

       <b>-F </b><i>point</i>, <b>--font-size</b>=<i>point</i>
            Specify the default font <i>point</i> size to be used in several
            chart components, such as the chart title, legend, and Y-
            axis label.  The default is platform dependent, but is
            either 7, 8 or 9.  This setting does not affect the rest of
            the user interface.

       <b>-g </b><i>geometry</i>, <b>--geometry</b>=<i>geometry</i>
            Generate image with the specified <i>geometry</i> (width and
            height).  This option is only useful when used in
            conjunction with the <b>-o </b>option for generating an output
            image.  The <i>geometry</i> argument takes the form "WxH" (e.g.
            240x120).  When NOT using the <b>-o </b>flag, to specify the
            display window geometry, use <b>-geometry </b><i>geometry</i> where
            <i>geometry</i> specifies the desired window width, height and
            optional placement.

       <b>-h </b><i>host</i>, <b>--host</b>=<i>host</i>
            Current performance metric values are retrieved from the
            nominated <i>host</i> machine by default.  Multiple <b>-h </b>options can
            be presented, and the list of hosts is used for sourcing
            metric values.  Any <i>sources</i> listed on the command line are
            assumed to be hosts if this option is used.

       <b>-H </b><i>path</i>, <b>--hostsfile</b>=<i>path</i>
            Specify the <i>path</i> to a file containing a set of hostnames
            where <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> is running , rather than using the default
            localhost.

       <b>-K </b><i>spec</i>, <b>--spec-local</b>=<i>spec</i>
            When fetching metrics from a local context (see <b>-L</b>), the <b>-K</b>
            option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
            made accessible.  The <i>spec</i> argument conforms to the syntax
            described in <a href="../man3/pmspeclocalpmda.3.html">pmSpecLocalPMDA(3)</a>.  More than one <b>-K </b>option
            may be used.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--local-PMDA</b>
            Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the
            local host without PMCD.  See also <b>-K</b>.

       <b>-n </b><i>pmnsfile</i>, <b>--namespace</b>=<i>pmnsfile</i>
            Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (<a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>)
            from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       <b>-o </b><i>outfile</i>, <b>--output</b>=<i>outfile</i>
            Generate an image file named <i>outfile</i>, and then exit.  This
            is most useful when run with a set of archives and one or
            more views.  The generated image will be in the format
            specified as the file extension (automatically determined
            from <i>outfile</i>).  If no extension can be determined, then the
            GIF format is used and the generated file is named with this
            extension.  The supported image file formats include: bmp,
            jpeg, jpg, png, ppm, tif, tiff, xbm, and xpm.

       <b>-O </b><i>origin</i>, <b>--origin</b>=<i>origin</i>
            When reporting archived metrics, start reporting at <i>origin</i>
            within the time window (see <b>-S </b>and <b>-T</b>).  Refer to
            <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for a complete description of the syntax for
            <i>origin</i>.

       <b>-p </b><i>port</i>, <b>--guiport</b>=<i>port</i>
            <i>port</i> number for connection to an existing <b>pmtime </b>time
            control process.

       <b>-s </b><i>samples</i>, <b>--samples</b>=<i>samples</i>
            Specifies the number of <i>samples</i> that will be retained before
            discarding old data (replaced by new values at the current
            time position).  This value can subsequently be modified
            through the Edit Tab dialog.

       <b>-S </b><i>starttime</i>, <b>--start</b>=<i>starttime</i>
            When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
            restricted to those records logged at or after <i>starttime</i>.
            Refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for a complete description of the
            syntax for <i>starttime</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>interval</i>, <b>--interval</b>=<i>interval</i>
            Sets the initial update <i>interval</i> to something other than the
            default 1 second.  The <i>interval</i> argument follows the syntax
            described in <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>, and in the simplest form may be an
            unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
            seconds).

       <b>-T </b><i>endtime</i>, <b>--finish</b>=<i>endtime</i>
            When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
            restricted to those records logged before or at <i>endtime</i>.
            Refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for a complete description of the
            syntax for <i>endtime</i>.

       <b>-v </b><i>samples</i>, <b>--visible</b>=<i>samples</i>
            Sets the initial visible <i>samples</i> that will be displayed in
            all charts in the default Tab.  This value must be less than
            or equal to the total number of samples retained (the <b>-s</b>
            value).

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Display pmchart version number and exit

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--white</b>
            Export images using an opaque(white) background

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--hostzone</b>
            Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
            host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
            identified via either the <b>-h </b>or <b>-a </b>options.

       <b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i>, <b>--timezone</b>=<i>timezone</i>
            By default, <b>pmtime </b>reports the time of day according to the
            local timezone on the system where <b>pmchart </b>is run.  The <b>-Z</b>
            option changes the timezone to <i>timezone</i> in the format of the
            environment variable TZ as described in <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
VIEWS </h2>
<pre>
       The primary <b>pmchart </b>configuration file is the "view", which
       allows the metadata associated with one or more charts to be
       saved in the filesystem.  This metadata describes all aspects of
       the charts, including which PCP metrics and instances are to be
       used, which hosts, which colors, the chart titles, use of chart
       legends, and much more.

       From a conceptual point of view, there are two classes of view.
       These views share the same configuration file format - refer to a
       later section for a complete description of this format.  The
       differences lie in where they are installed and how they are
       manipulated.

       The first class, the "system" view, is simply any view that is
       installed as part of the <b>pmchart </b>package.  These are stored in
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmchart.</i>  When the <i>File→Open View</i> dialog is
       displayed, it is these views that are initially listed.  The
       system views cannot be modified by a normal user, and should not
       be modified even by a user with suitable privileges, as they will
       be overwritten during an upgrade.

       The second class of view is the "user" view.  These views are
       created on-the-fly using the <i>File→Save View</i> dialog.  This is a
       mechanism for individual users to save their commonly used views.
       Access to these views is achieved through the <i>File→Open View</i>
       dialog, as with the system views.  Once the dialog is opened, the
       list of views can be toggled between user and system views by
       clicking on the two toggle buttons in the top right corner.  User
       views are stored in <i>$HOME/.pcp/pmchart.</i>
</pre> <h2>
TABS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmchart </b>provides the common user interface concept of the Tab,
       which is most prevalent in modern web browsers.  Tabs allow
       <b>pmchart </b>to update many more charts than the available screen real
       estate allows, by providing a user interface mechanism to stack
       (and switch between) different vertical sets of charts.
       Switching between Tabs is achieved by clicking on the Tab labels,
       which are located along the top of the display beneath the Menu
       and Tool bars).

       Each Tab has a mode of operation (either live or archive -
       <b>pmchart </b>can support both modes simultaneously), the total number
       of samples and currently visible points, and a label describing
       the Tab which is displayed at the top of the <b>pmchart </b>window.  New
       Tabs can be created using the <i>File→Add Tab</i> dialog.

       In order to save on vertical screen real estate, note that the
       user interface element for changing between different Tabs (and
       its label) are only displayed when more than one Tab exists.  A
       Tab can be dismissed using the <i>File→Close Tab</i> menu, which removes
       the current Tab and any charts it contained.
</pre> <h2>
IMAGES and PRINTING </h2>
<pre>
       A static copy of the currently displayed vertical series of
       charts can be captured in two ways.

       When the intended display device is the screen, the <i>File→Export</i>
       menu option should be used.  This allows exporting the charts in
       a variety of image formats, including PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP.
       The image size can be scaled up or down in any dimension.

       Alternatively, when the intended display device is paper, the
       <i>File→Print</i> menu option can be used.  This supports the usual set
       of printing options (choice of printer, grayscale/color,
       landscape/portrait, scaling to different paper sizes, etc), and
       in addition allows printing to the intermediate printer formats
       of PostScript and Portable Document Format (PDF).
</pre> <h2>
RECORDING </h2>
<pre>
       It is possible to make a recording of a set of displayed charts,
       for later playback through <b>pmchart </b>or any of the other
       Performance Co-Pilot tools.  The <i>Record→Start</i> functionality is
       simple to configure through the user interface, and allows fine-
       tuning of the recording process (including record frequencies
       that differ to the <b>pmchart </b>update interval, alternate file
       locations, etc).

       <b>pmchart </b>produces recordings that are compatible with the PCP
       <a href="pmafm.1.html">pmafm(1)</a> replay mechanism, for later playback via a new instance
       of <b>pmchart</b>.  In addition, when recording through <b>pmchart </b>one can
       also replay the recording immediately, as on termination of the
       recording (through the <i>Record→Stop</i> menu item), an archive mode
       Tab will be created with the captured view.

       Once recording is active in a Live Tab, the Time Control status
       button in the bottom left corner of the <b>pmchart </b>window is
       displayed with a distinctive red dot.  At any time during a
       <b>pmchart </b>recording session, the amount of space used in the
       filesystem by that recording can be displayed using the
       <i>Record→Query</i> menu item.

       Finally, the <i>Record→Detach</i> menu option provides a mechanism
       whereby the recording process can be completely divorced from the
       running <b>pmchart </b>process, and allowed to continue on when <b>pmchart</b>
       exits.  A dialog displaying the current size and estimated rate
       of growth for the recording is presented.  On the other hand, if
       <b>pmchart </b>is terminated while recording is in process, then the
       recording process will prompt the user to choose immediate
       cessation of recording or for it to continue on independently.

       All of the record mode services available from <b>pmchart </b>are
       implemented with the assistance of the base Performance Co-Pilot
       logging services - refer to <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> and <a href="pmafm.1.html">pmafm(1)</a> for an
       extensive description of the capabilities of these tools.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmchart </b>loads predefined chart configurations (or "views") from
       external files that conform to the following rules.  In the
       descriptions below keywords (shown in <b>bold</b>) may appear in upper,
       lower or mixed case, elements shown in [stuff] are optional, and
       user-supplied elements are shown as &lt;other stuff&gt;.  A vertical
       bar (|) is used where syntactic elements are alternatives.
       Quotes (") may be used to enclose lexical elements that may
       contain white space, such as titles, labels and instance names.

       1. The first line defines the configuration file type and should
          be
               <b>#kmchart</b>
          although <b>pmchart </b>provides backwards compatibility for the
          older <b>pmchart </b>view formats with an initial line of
               <b>#pmchart</b>

       2. After the first line, lines beginning with "#" as the first
          non-white space character are treated as comments and skipped.
          Similarly blank lines are skipped.

       3. The next line should be
               <b>version </b>&lt;n&gt; &lt;host-clause&gt;
          where &lt;n&gt; depends on the configuration file type, and is <b>1 </b>for
          <b>pmchart </b>else <b>1.1</b>, <b>1.2 </b>or <b>2.0 </b>for <b>pmchart</b>.
          The &lt;host-clause&gt; part is optional (and ignored) for <b>pmchart</b>
          configuration files, but required for the <b>pmchart</b>
          configuration files, and is of the form
               <b>host literal</b>
          or
               <b>host dynamic</b>

       4. A configuration contains one or more charts defined as
          follows:
               <b>chart </b>[<b>title </b>&lt;title&gt;] <b>style </b>&lt;style&gt; &lt;options&gt;
          If specified, the title will appear centred and above the
          graph area of the chart.  The &lt;title&gt; is usually enclosed in
          quotes (") and if it contains the sequence "%h" this will be
          replaced by the short form of the hostname for the default
          source of metrics at the time this chart was loaded.
          Alternatively, "%H" can be used to insert the full host name.
          If the hostname appears to be an inet or IPv6 address, no
          shortening will be attempted; it will be used as-is in both
          replacement cases.  After the view is loaded, the title
          visibility and setting can be manipulated using the <i>Chart</i>
          <i>Title</i> text box in the <i>Edit→Chart</i> dialog.

          The &lt;style&gt; controls the initial plotting style of the chart,
          and should be one of the keywords <b>plot </b>(line graph), <b>bar</b>,
          <b>stacking </b>(stacked bar), <b>area </b>or <b>utilization</b>.  After the view
          is loaded, the plotting style can be changed using the
          <i>Edit→Chart</i> Style drop-down list.

          The &lt;options&gt; are zero or more of the optional elements:
               [<b>scale </b>[from] &lt;ymin&gt; [to] &lt;ymax&gt;] [<b>legend </b>&lt;onoff&gt;]
          If <b>scale </b>is specified, the vertical scaling is set for all
          plots in the chart to a y-range defined by &lt;ymin&gt; and &lt;ymax&gt;.
          Otherwise the vertical axis will be autoscaled based on the
          values currently being plotted.

          &lt;onoff&gt; is one of the keywords <b>on </b>or <b>off </b>and the <b>legend </b>clause
          controls the presence or absence of the plot legend below the
          graph area.  The default is for the legend to be shown.  After
          the view is loaded, the legend visibility can be toggled using
          the <i>Show Legend</i> button in the <i>Edit→Chart</i> dialog.

       5. <b>pmchart </b>supports a <b>global </b>clause to specify the dimensions of
          the top-level window (using the <b>width </b>and <b>height </b>keywords),
          the number of visible points (<b>points </b>keyword) and the starting
          X and Y axis positions on the screen (<b>xpos </b>and <b>ypos </b>keywords).
          Each of these <b>global </b>attributes takes an integer value as the
          sole qualifier.

       6. Each <b>chart </b>has one or more plots associated with it, as
          defined by one of the following specifications:
               <b>plot</b>
                   [<b>legend </b>&lt;title&gt;] [<b>color </b>&lt;colorspec&gt;] [<b>host </b>&lt;hostspec&gt;]
                   <b>metric </b>&lt;metricname&gt;
                   [ <b>instance </b>&lt;inst&gt; | <b>matching </b>&lt;pat&gt; | <b>not-matching </b>&lt;pat&gt; ]

          The keyword <b>plot </b>may be replaced with the keyword <b>optional-</b>
          <b>plot</b>, in which case if the source of performance data does not
          include the specified performance metric and/or instance, then
          this plot is silently dropped from the chart.

          If specified, the title will appear in the chart legend.  The
          &lt;title&gt; is usually enclosed in quotes (") and it may contain
          one or more wildcard characters which will be expanded using
          metric name, instance name, and host name for the plot.  The
          wildcards are "%i" (short unique instance name, up to the
          first whitespace), "%I" (full instance name), "%h" (short host
          name, up to the first dot), %H (full host name), "%m" (metric
          name shortened to the final two PMNS components), and "%M"
          (full metric name).

          For older <b>pmchart </b>configuration files, the keyword <b>title </b>must
          be used instead of <b>legend</b>.  Nowadays <b>pmchart </b>supports either
          keyword.

          The <b>color </b>clause is optional for newer <b>pmchart </b>configuration
          files, but it was mandatory in the original <b>pmchart</b>
          configuration file format.  &lt;colorspec&gt; may be one of the
          following:
               <b>#-cycle</b>
               <b>rgbi:</b>rr<b>:</b>gg<b>:</b>bb
               <b>#</b>rgb
               <b>#</b>rrggbb
               <b>#</b>rrrgggbbb
               <b>#</b>rrrrggggbbbb
               &lt;Xcolor&gt;
          where each of r, g and b are hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F)
          representing respectively the red, green and blue color
          components.  &lt;Xcolor&gt; is one of the color names from the X
          color database, e.g. <b>red </b>or <b>steelblue</b>, see also the output
          from <b>showrgb</b>(1).

          The "color" <b>#-cycle </b>specifies that <b>pmchart </b>should use the next
          in a pallet of colors that it uses cyclically for each chart.
          This is the default if the <b>color </b>clause is omitted.

          The &lt;hostspec&gt; in the <b>host </b>clause may be a hostname, an IP
          address or an asterisk (*); the latter is used to mean the
          default source of performance metrics.  For older <b>pmchart</b>
          configuration files, the <b>host </b>clause must be present, for new
          <b>pmchart </b>configuration files it is optional, and if missing the
          default source of performance metrics will be used.

          The optional instance specification,

          (a)
             is omitted in which case one plot will be created for every
             instance of the &lt;metricname&gt; metric

          (b)
             starts with <b>instance</b>, in which case only the instance named
             &lt;inst&gt; will be plotted

          (c)
             starts with <b>matching</b>, in which case all instances whose
             names match the pattern &lt;pat&gt; will be plotted; the pattern
             uses extended regular expression notation in the style of
             <b>egrep</b>(1) (refer to the PMCD view for an example)

          (d)
             starts with <b>not-matching</b>, in which case all instances whose
             names <b>do   not </b>match the pattern &lt;pat&gt; will be plotted; the
             pattern uses extended regular expression notation in the
             style of <b>egrep</b>(1) (refer to the Netbytes view for an
             example)

          <b>pmchart </b>uses a bizarre syntactic notation where &lt;inst&gt; and
          &lt;pat&gt; extend from the first non-white space character to the
          end of the input line.  For <b>pmchart </b>configuration files these
          elements are either delimited by white space, or enclosed in
          quotes (").

       7. The optional <b>tab </b>directive can be used to create views with
          multiple charts which span multiple Tabs.  The syntax is as
          follows:
               <b>tab </b>&lt;label&gt; [<b>host </b>&lt;host&gt;] [<b>points </b>&lt;points&gt; [<b>samples </b>&lt;samples&gt;]]

          All chart specifications following this keyword will be created
          on the new Tab, until the end of the configuration file or until
          another <b>tab </b>keyword is encountered.

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.

       Of particular note, the <b>$PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG </b>setting is explicitly
       and unconditionally overridden by <b>pmchart</b>.  This is set to the
       <a href="pmconfirm.1.html">pmconfirm(1)</a>, utility, in order that some popup dialogs
       (particularly in the area of Recording) maintain a consistent
       look-and-feel with the rest of the <b>pmchart </b>application.
