NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-divert - override a package's version of a file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-divert </b>[<i>option</i>...]  <i>command</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-divert </b>is the utility used to set up and update the list of
       diversions.

       File <i>diversions</i> are a way of forcing <a href="dpkg.1.html">dpkg(1)</a> not to install a
       file into its location, but to a <i>diverted</i> location.  Diversions
       can be used through the package maintainer scripts to move a file
       away when it causes a conflict.  System administrators can also
       use it to override some package's configuration file, or whenever
       some files (which aren't marked as “conffiles”) need to be
       preserved by <b>dpkg</b>, when installing a newer version of a package
       which contains those files.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       [<b>--add</b>] <i>file</i>
           Add a diversion for <i>file</i>.  The file is currently not renamed,
           see <b>--rename</b>.

       <b>--remove </b><i>file</i>
           Remove a diversion for <i>file</i>.  The file is currently not
           renamed, see <b>--rename</b>.

       <b>--list </b>[<i>glob-pattern</i>]
           List all diversions, or ones matching <i>glob-pattern</i>.

       <b>--listpackage </b><i>file</i>
           Print the name of the package that diverts <i>file</i> (since dpkg
           1.15.0).  Prints LOCAL if <i>file</i> is locally diverted and
           nothing if <i>file</i> is not diverted.

       <b>--truename </b><i>file</i>
           Print the real name for a diverted file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--admindir </b><i>directory</i>
           Set the administrative directory to <i>directory</i>.  Defaults to
           «<i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</i>» if <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR </b>has not been set.

       <b>--instdir </b><i>directory</i>
           Set the installation directory, which refers to the directory
           where packages get installed (since dpkg 1.19.2).  Defaults
           to «<i>/</i>» if <b>DPKG_ROOT </b>has not been set.

       <b>--root </b><i>directory</i>
           Set the root directory to <b>directory</b>, which sets the
           installation directory to «<i>directory</i>» and the administrative
           directory to «<i>directory</i><b>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</b>» (since dpkg
           1.19.2) if <b>DPKG_ROOT </b>has not been set.

       <b>--divert </b><i>divert-to</i>
           <i>divert-to</i> is the location where the versions of <i>file</i>, as
           provided by other packages, will be diverted.

       <b>--local</b>
           Specifies that all packages' versions of this file are
           diverted.  This means, that there are no exceptions, and
           whatever package is installed, the file is diverted.  This
           can be used by an admin to install a locally modified
           version.

       <b>--package </b><i>package</i>
           <i>package</i> is the name of a package whose copy of <i>file</i> will not
           be diverted.  i.e. <i>file</i> will be diverted for all packages
           except <i>package</i>.

       <b>--quiet</b>
           Quiet mode, i.e. no verbose output.

       <b>--rename</b>
           Actually move the file aside (or back).  <b>dpkg-divert </b>will
           abort operation in case the destination file already exists.
           This is the common behavior used for diversions of files from
           the non-<b>Essential </b>package set (see <b>--no-rename </b>for more
           details).

       <b>--no-rename</b>
           Specifies that the file should not be renamed while adding or
           removing the diversion into the database (since dpkg 1.19.1).
           This is intended for diversions of files from the <b>Essential</b>
           package set, where the temporary disappearance of the
           original file is not acceptable, as it can render the system
           non-functional.  This is the default behavior, but that will
           change in the dpkg 1.20.x cycle.

       <b>--test</b>
           Test mode, i.e. don't actually perform any changes, just
           demonstrate.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0   </b>The requested action was successfully performed.

       <b>2   </b>Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
           usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to
           the database, memory allocations, etc.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
           If set and the <b>--instdir </b>or <b>--root </b>options have not been
           specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory
           (since dpkg 1.19.2).

       <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR</b>
           If set and the <b>--admindir </b>or <b>--root </b>options have not been
           specified, it will be used as the <b>dpkg </b>data directory.

       <b>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE</b>
           If set and the <b>--local </b>and <b>--package </b>options have not been
           specified, <b>dpkg-divert </b>will use it as the package name.

       <b>DPKG_DEBUG</b>
           Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
           The currently accepted flags are described in the <b>dpkg</b>
           <b>--debug </b>option, but not all these flags might have an effect
           on this program.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.22.7).  The accepted values are:
           <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>(default).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/diversions</i>
           File which contains the current list of diversions of the
           system.  It is located in the <b>dpkg </b>administration directory,
           along with other files important to <b>dpkg</b>, such as <i>status</i> or
           <i>available</i>.

           <b>Note</b>: <b>dpkg-divert </b>preserves the old copy of this file, with
           extension <i>-old</i>, before replacing it with the new one.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       When adding, default is <b>--local </b>and <b>--divert </b><i>original</i><b>.distrib</b>.
       When removing, <b>--package </b>or <b>--local </b>and <b>--divert </b>must match if
       specified.

       Directories can't be diverted with <b>dpkg-divert</b>.

       Care should be taken when diverting shared libraries, <a href="../man8/ldconfig.8.html">ldconfig(8)</a>
       creates a symbolic link based on the DT_SONAME field embedded in
       the library.  Because <b>ldconfig </b>does not honor diverts (only <b>dpkg</b>
       does), the symlink may end up pointing at the diverted library,
       if a diverted library has the same SONAME as the undiverted one.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To divert all copies of a <i>/usr/bin/example</i> to
       <i>/usr/bin/example.foo</i>, i.e. directs all packages providing
       <i>/usr/bin/example</i> to install it as <i>/usr/bin/example.foo</i>,
       performing the rename if required:

        dpkg-divert --divert /usr/bin/example.foo --rename /usr/bin/example

       To remove that diversion:

        dpkg-divert --rename --remove /usr/bin/example

       To divert any package trying to install <i>/usr/bin/example</i> to
       <i>/usr/bin/example.foo</i>, except your own <i>wibble</i> package:

        dpkg-divert --package wibble --divert /usr/bin/example.foo \
           --rename /usr/bin/example

       To remove that diversion:

        dpkg-divert --package wibble --rename --remove /usr/bin/example
