NAME </h2>
<pre>
       trace-cmd-restore - restore a failed trace record
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>trace-cmd restore </b>[<i>OPTIONS</i>] [<i>command</i>] cpu-file [cpu-file ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The trace-cmd(1) restore command will restore a crashed
       trace-cmd-record(1) file. If for some reason a trace-cmd record
       fails, it will leave a the per-cpu data files and not create the
       final trace.dat file. The trace-cmd restore will append the files
       to create a working trace.dat file that can be read with
       trace-cmd-report(1).

       When trace-cmd record runs, it spawns off a process per CPU and
       writes to a per cpu file usually called <i>trace.dat.cpuX</i>, where X
       represents the CPU number that it is tracing. If the -o option
       was used in the trace-cmd record, then the CPU data files will
       have that name instead of the <i>trace.dat</i> name. If a unexpected
       crash occurs before the tracing is finished, then the per CPU
       files will still exist but there will not be any trace.dat file
       to read from. trace-cmd restore will allow you to create a
       trace.dat file with the existing data files.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-c</b>
           Create a partial trace.dat file from the machine, to be used
           with a full trace-cmd restore at another time. This option is
           useful for embedded devices. If a server contains the cpu
           files of a crashed trace-cmd record (or trace-cmd listen),
           trace-cmd restore can be executed on the embedded device with
           the -c option to get all the stored information of that
           embedded device. Then the file created could be copied to the
           server to run the trace-cmd restore there with the cpu files.

               If *-o* is not specified, then the file created will be called
               'trace-partial.dat'. This is because the file is not a full version
               of something that trace-cmd-report(1) could use.

       <b>-t </b>tracing_dir
           Used with <b>-c</b>, it overrides the location to read the events
           from. By default, tracing information is read from the
           debugfs/tracing directory.  <b>-t </b>will use that location
           instead. This can be useful if the trace.dat file to create
           is from another machine. Just tar -cvf events.tar
           debugfs/tracing and copy and untar that file locally, and use
           that directory instead.

       <b>-k </b>kallsyms
           Used with <b>-c</b>, it overrides where to read the kallsyms file
           from. By default, /proc/kallsyms is used.  <b>-k </b>will override
           the file to read the kallsyms from. This can be useful if the
           trace.dat file to create is from another machine. Just copy
           the /proc/kallsyms file locally, and use <b>-k </b>to point to that
           file.

       <b>-o </b>output'
           By default, trace-cmd restore will create a <i>trace.dat</i> file
           (or <i>trace-partial.dat</i> if <b>-c </b>is specified). You can specify a
           different file to write to with the <b>-o </b>option.

       <b>-i </b>input
           By default, trace-cmd restore will read the information of
           the current system to create the initial data stored in the
           <i>trace.dat</i> file. If the crash was on another machine, then
           that machine should have the trace-cmd restore run with the
           <b>-c </b>option to create the trace.dat partial file. Then that
           file can be copied to the current machine where trace-cmd
           restore will use <b>-i </b>to load that file instead of reading from
           the current system.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       If a crash happened on another box, you could run:

           $ trace-cmd restore -c -o box-partial.dat

       Then on the server that has the cpu files:

           $ trace-cmd restore -i box-partial.dat trace.dat.cpu0 trace.dat.cpu1

       This would create a trace.dat file for the embedded box.
