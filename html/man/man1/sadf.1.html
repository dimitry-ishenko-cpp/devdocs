</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sadf </b>command is used for displaying the contents of data
       files created by the <a href="sar.1.html">sar(1)</a> command. But unlike <b>sar</b>, <b>sadf </b>can
       write its data in many different formats (CSV, XML, etc.)  The
       default format is one that can easily be handled by pattern
       processing commands like <b>awk </b>(see option <b>-p</b>). The <b>sadf </b>command
       can also be used to draw graphs for the various activities
       collected by <b>sar </b>and display them as SVG (Scalable Vector
       Graphics) graphics in your web browser (see option <b>-g</b>).

       The <b>sadf </b>command extracts and writes to standard output records
       saved in the <i>datafile</i> file. This file must have been created by a
       version of <b>sar </b>which is compatible with that of <b>sadf</b>. If <i>datafile</i>
       is omitted, <b>sadf </b>uses the standard system activity daily data
       file.  It is also possible to enter <b>-1</b>, <b>-2 </b>etc. as an argument to
       <b>sadf </b>to display data of that days ago. For example, <b>-1 </b>will point
       at the standard system activity file of yesterday.

       The standard system activity daily data file is named <i>saDD</i> or
       <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, where <i>YYYY</i> stands for the current year, <i>MM</i> for the
       current month and <i>DD</i> for the current day.  <b>sadf </b>will look for the
       most recent of <i>saDD</i> and <i>saYYYYMMDD</i>, and use it. By default it is
       located in the <i>/var/log/sa</i> directory. Yet it is possible to
       specify an alternate location for it: If <i>datafile</i> is a directory
       (instead of a plain file) then it will be considered as the
       directory where the standard system activity daily data file is
       located.

       The <i>interval</i> and <i>count</i> parameters are used to tell <b>sadf </b>to select
       <i>count</i> records at <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>count</i> parameter
       is not set, then all the records saved in the data file will be
       displayed.

       All the activity flags of <b>sar </b>may be entered on the command line
       to indicate which activities are to be reported. Before
       specifying them, put a pair of dashes (<b>--</b>) on the command line in
       order not to confuse the flags with those of <b>sadf.  </b>Not
       specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-C     </b>Tell <b>sadf </b>to display comments present in file.

       <b>-c     </b>Convert an old system activity binary datafile (version
              9.1.6 and later) to current up-to-date format. Use the
              following syntax:

              <b>sadf -c </b><i>old_datafile</i> <b>&gt; </b><i>new_datafile</i>

              Conversion can be controlled using option <b>-O </b>(see below).

       <b>-d     </b>Print the contents of the data file in a format that can
              easily be ingested by a relational database system. The
              output consists of fields separated by a semicolon. Each
              record contains the hostname of the host where the file
              was created, the interval value (or -1 if not applicable),
              the timestamp in a form easily acceptable by most
              databases, and additional semicolon separated data fields
              as specified by <i>sar_options</i> command line options.  Note
              that timestamp output can be controlled by options <b>-T</b>, <b>-t</b>
              and <b>-U</b>.

       <b>--dev=</b><i>dev_list</i>
              Specify the block devices for which statistics are to be
              displayed by <b>sadf</b>.  <i>dev_list</i> is a list of comma-separated
              device names. Useful with option <b>-d </b>from <b>sar</b>.

       <b>-e [ </b><i>hh</i><b>:</b><i>mm</i><b>[:</b><i>ss</i><b>] ]</b>
       <b>-e [ </b><i>seconds_since_the_epoch</i> <b>]</b>
              Set the ending time of the report. The default ending time
              is 18:00:00. Hours must be given in 24-hour format, or as
              the number of seconds since the epoch (given as a 10 digit
              number).

       <b>--fs=</b><i>fs_list</i>
              Specify the filesystems for which statistics are to be
              displayed by <b>sadf</b>.  <i>fs_list</i> is a list of comma-separated
              filesystem names or mountpoints. Useful with option <b>-F</b>
              from <b>sar</b>.

       <b>-g     </b>Print the contents of the data file in SVG (Scalable
              Vector Graphics) format.  This option enables you to
              display some fancy graphs in your web browser.  Use the
              following syntax:

              <b>sadf -g </b><i>your_datafile</i> <b>[ -- </b><i>sar_options</i> <b>] &gt; </b><i>output.svg</i>

              and open the resulting SVG file in your favorite web
              browser.  Output can be controlled using option <b>-O </b>(see
              below).

       <b>-H     </b>Display only the header of the report (when applicable).
              If no format has been specified, then the header data
              (metadata) of the data file are displayed.

       <b>-h     </b>When used in conjunction with option <b>-d</b>, all activities
              will be displayed horizontally on a single line.

       <b>--iface=</b><i>iface_list</i>
              Specify the network interfaces for which statistics are to
              be displayed by <b>sadf</b>.  <i>iface_list</i> is a list of comma-
              separated interface names. Useful with options <b>-n DEV </b>and
              <b>-n EDEV </b>from <b>sar</b>.

       <b>--int=</b><i>int_list</i>
              Specify the interrupts names for which statistics are to
              be displayed by <b>sadf</b>.  <i>int_list</i> is a list of comma-
              separated values or range of values (e.g., <b>0-16,35,40-</b>).
              Useful with option <b>-I </b>from <b>sar</b>.

       <b>-j     </b>Print the contents of the data file in JSON (JavaScript
              Object Notation) format. Timestamps can be controlled by
              options <b>-T </b>and <b>-t</b>.

       <b>-l     </b>Export the contents of the data file to a PCP (Performance
              Co-Pilot) archive.  The name of the archive can be
              specified using the keyword <b>pcparchive= </b>with option <b>-O</b>.

       <b>-O </b><i>opts</i><b>[,...]</b>
              Use the specified options to control the output of <b>sadf</b>.
              The following options are used to control SVG output
              displayed by <b>sadf -g</b>:

              autoscale
                     Draw all the graphs of a given view as large as
                     possible based on current view's scale. To do this,
                     a factor (10, 100, 1000...) is used to enlarge the
                     graph drawing.  This option may be interesting when
                     several graphs are drawn on the same view, some
                     with only very small values, and others with high
                     ones, the latter making the former hardly visible.

              bwcol  Use a black and white palette to draw the graphs.

              customcol
                     Use a customizable color palette instead of the
                     default one to draw the graphs. See environment
                     variable <b>S_COLORS_PALETTE </b>below to know how to
                     customize that palette.

              debug  Add helpful comments in SVG output file.

              height=<i>value</i>
                     Set SVG canvas height to <i>value</i>.

              oneday Display graphs data over a period of 24 hours. Note
                     that hours are still printed in UTC by default: You
                     should use option <b>-T </b>to print them in local time
                     and get a time window starting from midnight.

              packed Group all views from the same activity (and for the
                     same device) on the same row.

              showidle
                     Also display %idle state in graphs for CPU
                     statistics.

              showinfo
                     Display additional information (such as the date
                     and the host name) on each view.

              showtoc
                     Add a table of contents at the beginning of the SVG
                     output, consisting of links pointing at the first
                     graph of each activity.

              skipempty
                     Do not display views where all graphs have only
                     zero values.

              The following option may be used when converting an old
              system activity binary datafile to current up-to-date
              format:

              hz=<i>value</i>
                     Specify the number of ticks per second for the
                     machine where the old datafile has been created.

              The following option may be used when data are exported to
              a PCP archive:

              pcparchive=<i>name</i>
                     Specify the name of the PCP archive to create.

              The following option is used to control raw output
              displayed by <b>sadf -r</b>:

              debug  Display additional information, mainly useful for
                     debugging purpose.

       <b>-P { </b><i>cpu_list</i> <b>| ALL }</b>
              Tell <b>sadf </b>that processor dependent statistics are to be
              reported only for the specified processor or processors.
              <i>cpu_list</i> is a list of comma-separated values or range of
              values (e.g., <b>0,2,4-7,12-</b>).  Note that processor 0 is the
              first processor, and processor <b>all </b>is the global average
              among all processors. Specifying the <b>ALL </b>keyword reports
              statistics for each individual processor, and globally for
              all processors.

       <b>-p     </b>Print the contents of the data file in a format that can
              easily be handled by pattern processing commands like <b>awk</b>.
              The output consists of fields separated by a tab. Each
              record contains the hostname of the host where the file
              was created, the interval value (or -1 if not applicable),
              the timestamp, the device name (or - if not applicable),
              the field name and its value.  Note that timestamp output
              can be controlled by options <b>-T</b>, <b>-t </b>and <b>-U</b>.

       <b>-r     </b>Print the raw contents of the data file. With this format,
              the values for all the counters are displayed as read from
              the kernel, which means e.g., that no average values are
              calculated over the elapsed time interval.  Output can be
              controlled using option <b>-O </b>(see above).

       <b>-s [ </b><i>hh</i><b>:</b><i>mm</i><b>[:</b><i>ss</i><b>] ]</b>
       <b>-s [ </b><i>seconds_since_the_epoch</i> <b>]</b>
              Set the starting time of the data, causing the <b>sadf</b>
              command to extract records time-tagged at, or following,
              the time specified. The default starting time is 08:00:00.
              Hours must be given in 24-hour format, or as the number of
              seconds since the epoch (given as a 10 digit number).

       <b>-T     </b>Display timestamp in local time instead of UTC
              (Coordinated Universal Time).

       <b>-t     </b>Display timestamp in the original local time of the data
              file creator instead of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

       <b>-U     </b>Display timestamp (UTC - Coordinated Universal Time) in
              seconds from the epoch.

       <b>-V     </b>Print version number then exit.

       <b>-x     </b>Print the contents of the data file in XML format.
              Timestamps can be controlled by options <b>-T </b>and <b>-t</b>.  The
              corresponding DTD (Document Type Definition) and XML
              Schema are included in the sysstat source package. They
              are also available at <i><a href="https://sysstat.github.io/">https://sysstat.github.io/</a> </i>.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>sadf </b>command takes into account the following environment
       variables:

       <b>S_COLORS_PALETTE</b>
              Specify the colors used by <b>sadf -g </b>to render the SVG
              output. This environment variable is taken into account
              only when the custom color palette has been selected with
              the option <b>customcol </b>(see option <b>-O</b>).  Its value is a
              colon-separated list of capabilities associated with six-
              digit, three-byte hexadecimal numbers (hex triplets)
              representing colors that defaults to

              <b>0=000000:1=1a1aff:2=1affb2:3=b21aff:</b>
              <b>4=1ab2ff:5=ff1a1a:6=ffb31a:7=b2ff1a:</b>
              <b>8=efefef:9=000000:A=1a1aff:B=1affb2:</b>
              <b>C=b21aff:D=1ab2ff:E=ff1a1a:F=ffb31a:</b>
              <b>G=bebebe:H=000000:I=000000:K=ffffff:</b>
              <b>L=000000:T=000000:W=000000:X=000000</b>

              Capabilities consisting of a hexadecimal digit (<b>0 </b>through
              <b>F</b>) are used to specify the first sixteen colors in the
              palette (these colors are used to draw the graphs), e.g.,
              3=ffffff would indicate that the third color in the
              palette is white (0xffffff).
              Other capabilities are:

              <b>G=     </b>Specify the color used to draw the grid lines.

              <b>H=     </b>Specify the color used to display the report
                     header.

              <b>I=     </b>Specify the color used to display additional
                     information (e.g., date, hostname...)

              <b>K=     </b>Specify the color used for the graphs background.

              <b>L=     </b>Specify the default color (which is for example
                     used to display the table of contents).

              <b>T=     </b>Specify the color used to display the graphs title.

              <b>W=     </b>Specify the color used to display warning and error
                     messages.

              <b>X=     </b>Specify the color used to draw the axes and display
                     the graduations.

       <b>S_TIME_DEF_TIME</b>
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>UTC </b>then <b>sadf</b>
              will use UTC time instead of local time to determine the
              current daily data file located in the <i>/var/log/sa</i>
              directory.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>sadf -d /var/log/sa/sa21 -- -r -n DEV</b>
              Extract memory and network statistics from system activity
              file <i>sa21</i>, and display them in a format that can be
              ingested by a database.

       <b>sadf -p -P 1</b>
              Extract CPU statistics for processor 1 (the second
              processor) from current daily data file, and display them
              in a format that can easily be handled by a pattern
              processing command.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       SVG output (as created by option <b>-g</b>) is fully compliant with SVG
       1.1 standard.  Graphics have been successfully displayed in
       various web browsers, including Firefox, Chrome and Opera. Yet
       SVG rendering is broken on Microsoft browsers (tested on Internet
       Explorer 11 and Edge 13.1): So please don't use them.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/var/log/sa/saDD</i>
       <i>/var/log/sa/saYYYYMMDD</i>
              The standard system activity daily data files and their
              default location.  <i>YYYY</i> stands for the current year, <i>MM</i>
              for the current month and <i>DD</i> for the current day.
