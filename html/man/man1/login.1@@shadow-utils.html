NAME </h2>
<pre>
       login - begin session on the system
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>login </b>[-p] [-h <i>host</i>] [<i>username</i>] [<i>ENV=VAR</i>...]

       <b>login </b>[-p] [-h <i>host</i>] -f <i>username</i>

       <b>login </b>[-p] -r <i>host</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>login </b>program is used to establish a new session with the
       system. It is normally invoked automatically by responding to the
       <i>login:</i> prompt on the user's terminal.  <b>login </b>may be special to
       the shell and may not be invoked as a sub-process. When called
       from a shell, <b>login </b>should be executed as <b>exec login </b>which will
       cause the user to exit from the current shell (and thus will
       prevent the new logged in user to return to the session of the
       caller). Attempting to execute <b>login </b>from any shell but the login
       shell will produce an error message.

       The user is then prompted for a password, where appropriate.
       Echoing is disabled to prevent revealing the password. Only a
       small number of password failures are permitted before <b>login</b>
       exits and the communications link is severed.

       If password aging has been enabled for your account, you may be
       prompted for a new password before proceeding. You will be forced
       to provide your old password and the new password before
       continuing. Please refer to <a href="passwd.1.html">passwd(1)</a> for more information.

       Your user and group ID will be set according to their values in
       the /etc/passwd file. The value for <b>$HOME</b>, <b>$SHELL</b>, <b>$PATH</b>,
       <b>$LOGNAME</b>, and <b>$MAIL </b>are set according to the appropriate fields
       in the password entry. Ulimit, umask and nice values may also be
       set according to entries in the GECOS field.

       On some installations, the environmental variable <b>$TERM </b>will be
       initialized to the terminal type on your tty line, as specified
       in /etc/ttytype.

       An initialization script for your command interpreter may also be
       executed. Please see the appropriate manual section for more
       information on this function.

       A subsystem login is indicated by the presence of a "*" as the
       first character of the login shell. The given home directory will
       be used as the root of a new file system which the user is
       actually logged into.

       The <b>login </b>program is NOT responsible for removing users from the
       utmp file. It is the responsibility of <b>getty</b>(8) and <b>init</b>(8) to
       clean up apparent ownership of a terminal session. If you use
       <b>login </b>from the shell prompt without <b>exec</b>, the user you use will
       continue to appear to be logged in even after you log out of the
       "subsession".
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-f</b>
           Do not perform authentication, user is preauthenticated.

           Note: In that case, <i>username</i> is mandatory.

       <b>-h</b>
           Name of the remote host for this login.

       <b>-p</b>
           Preserve environment.

       The <b>-r</b>, <b>-h </b>and <b>-f </b>options are only used when <b>login </b>is invoked by
       root.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       This version of <b>login </b>has many compilation options, only some of
       which may be in use at any particular site.

       The location of files is subject to differences in system
       configuration.

       The <b>login </b>program is NOT responsible for removing users from the
       utmp file. It is the responsibility of <b>getty</b>(8) and <b>init</b>(8) to
       clean up apparent ownership of a terminal session. If you use
       <b>login </b>from the shell prompt without <b>exec</b>, the user you use will
       continue to appear to be logged in even after you log out of the
       "subsession".

       As with any program, <b>login</b>'s appearance can be faked. If
       non-trusted users have physical access to a machine, an attacker
       could use this to obtain the password of the next person coming
       to sit in front of the machine. Under Linux, the SAK mechanism
       can be used by users to initiate a trusted path and prevent this
       kind of attack.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
       the behavior of this tool:

       <b>DEFAULT_HOME </b>(boolean)
           Indicate if login is allowed if we can't cd to the home
           directory. Default is no.

           If set to <i>yes</i>, the user will login in the root (/) directory
           if it is not possible to cd to her home directory.

       <b>ENV_PATH </b>(string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment
           variable when a regular user login. The value is a colon
           separated list of paths (for example <i>/bin:/usr/bin</i>) and can
           be preceded by <i>PATH=</i>. The default value is
           <i>PATH=/bin:/usr/bin</i>.

       <b>ENV_SUPATH </b>(string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment
           variable when the superuser login. The value is a colon
           separated list of paths (for example
           <i>/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</i>) and can be preceded by <i>PATH=</i>.
           The default value is <i>PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin</i>.

       <b>ERASECHAR </b>(number)
           Terminal ERASE character (<i>010</i> = backspace, <i>0177</i> = DEL).

           The value can be prefixed "0" for an octal value, or "0x" for
           an hexadecimal value.

       <b>FAIL_DELAY </b>(number)
           Delay in seconds before being allowed another attempt after a
           login failure.

       <b>FAKE_SHELL </b>(string)
           If set, <b>login </b>will execute this shell instead of the users'
           shell specified in /etc/passwd.

       <b>HUSHLOGIN_FILE </b>(string)
           If defined, this file can inhibit all the usual chatter
           during the login sequence. If a full pathname is specified,
           then hushed mode will be enabled if the user's name or shell
           are found in the file. If not a full pathname, then hushed
           mode will be enabled if the file exists in the user's home
           directory.

       <b>KILLCHAR </b>(number)
           Terminal KILL character (<i>025</i> = CTRL/U).

           The value can be prefixed "0" for an octal value, or "0x" for
           an hexadecimal value.

       <b>LOGIN_RETRIES </b>(number)
           Maximum number of login retries in case of bad password.

           This will most likely be overridden by PAM, since the default
           pam_unix module has its own built in of 3 retries. However,
           this is a safe fallback in case you are using an
           authentication module that does not enforce PAM_MAXTRIES.

       <b>LOGIN_TIMEOUT </b>(number)
           Max time in seconds for login.

       <b>LOG_OK_LOGINS </b>(boolean)
           Enable logging of successful logins.

       <b>LOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB </b>(boolean)
           Enable display of unknown usernames when login failures are
           recorded.

           Note: logging unknown usernames may be a security issue if an
           user enter her password instead of her login name.

       <b>TTYGROUP </b>(string), <b>TTYPERM </b>(string)
           The terminal permissions: the login tty will be owned by the
           <b>TTYGROUP </b>group, and the permissions will be set to <b>TTYPERM</b>.

           <b>TTYGROUP </b>can be either the name of a group or a numeric group
           identifier.

           If TTYGROUP is not defined, then the group ownership of the
           terminal is set to the user's primary group. If TTYPERM is
           not defined, then the permissions are set to <i>0600</i>.

           If you have a <b>write </b>program which is "setgid" to a special
           group which owns the terminals, define TTYGROUP to the group
           number and TTYPERM to 0620. Otherwise leave TTYGROUP
           commented out and assign TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.

       <b>TTYTYPE_FILE </b>(string)
           If defined, file which maps tty line to TERM environment
           parameter. Each line of the file is in a format something
           like "vt100 tty01".

       <b>USERGROUPS_ENAB </b>(boolean)
           If set to <i>yes</i>, <b>userdel </b>will remove the user's group if it
           contains no more members, and <b>useradd </b>will create by default
           a group with the name of the user.
