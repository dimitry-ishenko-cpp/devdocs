</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-override - Override application requirements
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak override </b>[OPTION...] [APP]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Overrides the application specified runtime requirements. This
       can be used to grant a sandboxed application more or less
       resources than it requested.

       By default the application gets access to the resources it
       requested when it is started. But the user can override it on a
       particular instance by specifying extra arguments to <b>flatpak run</b>,
       or every time by using <b>flatpak override</b>.

       The application overrides are saved in text files residing in
       $XDG_DATA_HOME/flatpak/overrides in user mode.

       If the application ID APP is not specified then the overrides
       affect all applications, but the per-application overrides can
       override the global overrides.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user </b>or <b>--installation </b>options, this
       command changes the default system-wide installation.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Update a per-user installation.

       <b>--system</b>
           Update the default system-wide installation.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Updates a system-wide installation specified by NAME among
           those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
           <b>--installation=default </b>is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--share=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the
           Context section from the application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM
           must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--unshare=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Don't share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides
           the Context section from the application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM
           must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--socket=SOCKET</b>
           Expose a well-known socket to the application. This overrides
           to the Context section from the application metadata.  SOCKET
           must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio,
           system-bus, session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent,
           inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--nosocket=SOCKET</b>
           Don't expose a well-known socket to the application. This
           overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11,
           pulseaudio, system-bus, session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups,
           gpg-agent, inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--device=DEVICE</b>
           Expose a device to the application. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata.  DEVICE must
           be one of: dri, input, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--nodevice=DEVICE</b>
           Don't expose a device to the application. This overrides to
           the Context section from the application metadata.  DEVICE
           must be one of: dri, input, kvm, shm, all. This option can be
           used multiple times.

       <b>--allow=FEATURE</b>
           Allow access to a specific feature. This updates the
           [Context] group in the metadata.  FEATURE must be one of:
           devel, multiarch, bluetooth, canbus, per-app-dev-shm. This
           option can be used multiple times.

           See <a href="flatpak-build-finish.1.html">flatpak-build-finish(1)</a> for the meaning of the various
           features.

       <b>--disallow=FEATURE</b>
           Disallow access to a specific feature. This updates the
           [Context] group in the metadata.  FEATURE must be one of:
           devel, multiarch, bluetooth, canbus, per-app-dev-shm. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--filesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Allow the application access to a subset of the filesystem.
           This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  FILESYSTEM can be one of: home, host, host-os,
           host-etc, xdg-desktop, xdg-documents, xdg-download,
           xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share, xdg-templates,
           xdg-videos, xdg-run, xdg-config, xdg-cache, xdg-data, an
           absolute path, or a homedir-relative path like ~/dir or paths
           relative to the xdg dirs, like xdg-download/subdir. The
           optional :ro suffix indicates that the location will be
           read-only. The optional :create suffix indicates that the
           location will be read-write and created if it doesn't exist.
           This option can be used multiple times. See the "[Context]
           filesystems" list in <a href="../man5/flatpak-metadata.5.html">flatpak-metadata(5)</a> for details of the
           meanings of these filesystems.

       <b>--nofilesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Undo the effect of a previous <b>--filesystem=</b>FILESYSTEM in the
           app's manifest or a lower-precedence layer of overrides,
           and/or remove a previous <b>--filesystem=</b>FILESYSTEM from this
           layer of overrides. This overrides the Context section of the
           application metadata.  FILESYSTEM can take the same values as
           for <b>--filesystem</b>, but the :ro and :create suffixes are not
           used here. This option can be used multiple times.

           This option does not prevent access to a more narrowly-scoped
           <b>--filesystem</b>. For example, if an application has the
           equivalent of <b>--filesystem=xdg-config/MyApp </b>in its manifest
           or as a system-wide override, and flatpak override --user
           --nofilesystem=home as a per-user override, then it will be
           prevented from accessing most of the home directory, but it
           will still be allowed to access $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MyApp.

           As a special case, <b>--nofilesystem=host:reset </b>will ignore all
           <b>--filesystem </b>permissions inherited from the app manifest or a
           lower-precedence layer of overrides, in addition to having
           the behaviour of <b>--nofilesystem=host</b>.

       <b>--add-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Add generic policy option. For example,
           "--add-policy=subsystem.key=v1 --add-policy=subsystem.key=v2"
           would map to this metadata:

               [Policy subsystem]
               key=v1;v2;

           This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--remove-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Remove generic policy option. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--env=VAR=VALUE</b>
           Set an environment variable in the application. This
           overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--unset-env=VAR</b>
           Unset an environment variable in the application. This
           overrides the unset-environment entry in the [Context] group
           of the metadata, and the [Environment] group. This option can
           be used multiple times.

       <b>--env-fd=</b><i>FD</i>
           Read environment variables from the file descriptor <i>FD</i>, and
           set them as if via <b>--env</b>. This can be used to avoid
           environment variables and their values becoming visible to
           other users.

           Each environment variable is in the form <i>VAR</i>=<i>VALUE</i> followed
           by a zero byte. This is the same format used by env -0 and
           /proc/*/environ.

       <b>--own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well-known name NAME on the
           session bus. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well-known name NAME on
           the session bus. This overrides to the Context section from
           the application metadata. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--no-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Don't allow the application to talk to the well-known name
           NAME on the session bus. This overrides to the Context
           section from the application metadata. This option can be
           used multiple times.

       <b>--system-own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well known name NAME on the
           system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the application
           to own all matching names. This overrides to the Context
           section from the application metadata. This option can be
           used multiple times.

       <b>--system-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on
           the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
           application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
           the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-no-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Don't allow the application to talk to the well known name
           NAME on the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
           application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
           the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--persist=FILENAME</b>
           If the application doesn't have access to the real homedir,
           make the (homedir-relative) path FILENAME a bind mount to the
           corresponding path in the per-application directory, allowing
           that location to be used for persistent data. This overrides
           to the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--reset</b>
           Remove overrides. If an APP is given, remove the overrides
           for that application, otherwise remove the global overrides.

       <b>--show</b>
           Shows overrides. If an APP is given, shows the overrides for
           that application, otherwise shows the global overrides.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
