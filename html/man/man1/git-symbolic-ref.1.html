NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-symbolic-ref - Read, modify and delete symbolic refs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git symbolic-ref</i> [-m &lt;reason&gt;] &lt;name&gt; &lt;ref&gt;
       <i>git symbolic-ref</i> [-q] [--short] [--no-recurse] &lt;name&gt;
       <i>git symbolic-ref</i> --delete [-q] &lt;name&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Given one argument, reads which branch head the given symbolic
       ref refers to and outputs its path, relative to the <b>.git/</b>
       directory. Typically you would give <b>HEAD </b>as the &lt;name&gt; argument
       to see which branch your working tree is on.

       Given two arguments, creates or updates a symbolic ref &lt;name&gt; to
       point at the given branch &lt;ref&gt;.

       Given <b>--delete </b>and an additional argument, deletes the given
       symbolic ref.

       A symbolic ref is a regular file that stores a string that begins
       with <b>ref: refs/</b>. For example, your <b>.git/HEAD </b>is a regular file
       whose content is <b>ref: refs/heads/master</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -d, --delete
           Delete the symbolic ref &lt;name&gt;.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not issue an error message if the &lt;name&gt; is not a symbolic
           ref but a detached HEAD; instead exit with non-zero status
           silently.

       --short
           When showing the value of &lt;name&gt; as a symbolic ref, try to
           shorten the value, e.g. from <b>refs/heads/master </b>to <b>master</b>.

       --recurse, --no-recurse
           When showing the value of &lt;name&gt; as a symbolic ref, if &lt;name&gt;
           refers to another symbolic ref, follow such a chain of
           symbolic refs until the result no longer points at a symbolic
           ref (<b>--recurse</b>, which is the default).  <b>--no-recurse </b>stops
           after dereferencing only a single level of symbolic ref.

       -m
           Update the reflog for &lt;name&gt; with &lt;reason&gt;. This is valid
           only when creating or updating a symbolic ref.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       In the past, <b>.git/HEAD </b>was a symbolic link pointing at
       <b>refs/heads/master</b>. When we wanted to switch to another branch, we
       did <b>ln -sf refs/heads/newbranch .git/HEAD</b>, and when we wanted to
       find out which branch we are on, we did <b>readlink .git/HEAD</b>. But
       symbolic links are not entirely portable, so they are now
       deprecated and symbolic refs (as described above) are used by
       default.

       <i>git symbolic-ref</i> will exit with status 0 if the contents of the
       symbolic ref were printed correctly, with status 1 if the
       requested name is not a symbolic ref, or 128 if another error
       occurs.
