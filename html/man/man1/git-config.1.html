</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The
       name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and
       the value will be escaped.

       Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the <b>--append</b>
       option. If you want to update or unset an option which can occur
       on multiple lines, a <b>value-pattern </b>(which is an extended regular
       expression, unless the <b>--fixed-value </b>option is given) needs to be
       given. Only the existing values that match the pattern are
       updated or unset. If you want to handle the lines that do <b>not</b>
       match the pattern, just prepend a single exclamation mark in
       front (see also the section called “EXAMPLES”), but note that
       this only works when the <b>--fixed-value </b>option is not in use.

       The <b>--type=&lt;type&gt; </b>option instructs <i>git config</i> to ensure that
       incoming and outgoing values are canonicalize-able under the
       given &lt;type&gt;. If no <b>--type=&lt;type&gt; </b>is given, no canonicalization
       will be performed. Callers may unset an existing <b>--type </b>specifier
       with <b>--no-type</b>.

       When reading, the values are read from the system, global and
       repository local configuration files by default, and options
       <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>, <b>--local</b>, <b>--worktree </b>and <b>--file &lt;filename&gt; </b>can
       be used to tell the command to read from only that location (see
       the section called “FILES”).

       When writing, the new value is written to the repository local
       configuration file by default, and options <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>,
       <b>--worktree</b>, <b>--file &lt;filename&gt; </b>can be used to tell the command to
       write to that location (you can say <b>--local </b>but that is the
       default).

       This command will fail with non-zero status upon error. Some exit
       codes are:

       •   The section or key is invalid (ret=1),

       •   no section or name was provided (ret=2),

       •   the config file is invalid (ret=3),

       •   the config file cannot be written (ret=4),

       •   you try to unset an option which does not exist (ret=5),

       •   you try to unset/set an option for which multiple lines match
           (ret=5), or

       •   you try to use an invalid regexp (ret=6).

       On success, the command returns the exit code 0.

       A list of all available configuration variables can be obtained
       using the <b>git help --config </b>command.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       list
           List all variables set in config file, along with their
           values.

       get
           Emits the value of the specified key. If key is present
           multiple times in the configuration, emits the last value. If
           <b>--all </b>is specified, emits all values associated with key.
           Returns error code 1 if key is not present.

       set
           Set value for one or more config options. By default, this
           command refuses to write multi-valued config options. Passing
           <b>--all </b>will replace all multi-valued config options with the
           new value, whereas <b>--value= </b>will replace all config options
           whose values match the given pattern.

       unset
           Unset value for one or more config options. By default, this
           command refuses to unset multi-valued keys. Passing <b>--all</b>
           will unset all multi-valued config options, whereas <b>--value</b>
           will unset all config options whose values match the given
           pattern.

       rename-section
           Rename the given section to a new name.

       remove-section
           Remove the given section from the configuration file.

       edit
           Opens an editor to modify the specified config file; either
           <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>, <b>--local </b>(default), <b>--worktree</b>, or <b>--file</b>
           <b>&lt;config-file&gt;</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --replace-all
           Default behavior is to replace at most one line. This
           replaces all lines matching the key (and optionally the
           <b>value-pattern</b>).

       --append
           Adds a new line to the option without altering any existing
           values. This is the same as providing <i>--value=^$</i> in <b>set</b>.

       --comment &lt;message&gt;
           Append a comment at the end of new or modified lines.

               If _&lt;message&gt;_ begins with one or more whitespaces followed
               by "#", it is used as-is.  If it begins with "#", a space is
               prepended before it is used.  Otherwise, a string " # " (a
               space followed by a hash followed by a space) is prepended
               to it.  And the resulting string is placed immediately after
               the value defined for the variable.  The _&lt;message&gt;_ must
               not contain linefeed characters (no multi-line comments are
               permitted).

       --all
           With <b>get</b>, return all values for a multi-valued key.

       ---regexp
           With <b>get</b>, interpret the name as a regular expression. Regular
           expression matching is currently case-sensitive and done
           against a canonicalized version of the key in which section
           and variable names are lowercased, but subsection names are
           not.

       --url=&lt;URL&gt;
           When given a two-part &lt;name&gt; as &lt;section&gt;.&lt;key&gt;, the value
           for &lt;section&gt;.&lt;URL&gt;.&lt;key&gt; whose &lt;URL&gt; part matches the best
           to the given URL is returned (if no such key exists, the
           value for &lt;section&gt;.&lt;key&gt; is used as a fallback). When given
           just the &lt;section&gt; as name, do so for all the keys in the
           section and list them. Returns error code 1 if no value is
           found.

       --global
           For writing options: write to global <b>~/.gitconfig </b>file rather
           than the repository <b>.git/config</b>, write to
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config </b>file if this file exists and the
           <b>~/.gitconfig </b>file doesn’t.

           For reading options: read only from global <b>~/.gitconfig </b>and
           from <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config </b>rather than from all
           available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --system
           For writing options: write to system-wide
           <b>$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig </b>rather than the repository
           <b>.git/config</b>.

           For reading options: read only from system-wide
           <b>$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig </b>rather than from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --local
           For writing options: write to the repository <b>.git/config</b>
           file. This is the default behavior.

           For reading options: read only from the repository
           <b>.git/config </b>rather than from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --worktree
           Similar to <b>--local </b>except that <b>$GIT_DIR/config.worktree </b>is
           read from or written to if <b>extensions.worktreeConfig </b>is
           enabled. If not it’s the same as <b>--local</b>. Note that <b>$GIT_DIR</b>
           is equal to <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR </b>for the main working tree, but is
           of the form <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/ </b>for other working trees.
           See <a href="git-worktree.1.html">git-worktree(1)</a> to learn how to enable
           <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b>.

       -f &lt;config-file&gt;, --file &lt;config-file&gt;
           For writing options: write to the specified file rather than
           the repository <b>.git/config</b>.

           For reading options: read only from the specified file rather
           than from all available files.

           See also the section called “FILES”.

       --blob &lt;blob&gt;
           Similar to <b>--file </b>but use the given blob instead of a file.
           E.g. you can use <i>master:.gitmodules</i> to read values from the
           file <i>.gitmodules</i> in the master branch. See "SPECIFYING
           REVISIONS" section in <a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a> for a more complete
           list of ways to spell blob names.

       --fixed-value
           When used with the <b>value-pattern </b>argument, treat
           <b>value-pattern </b>as an exact string instead of a regular
           expression. This will restrict the name/value pairs that are
           matched to only those where the value is exactly equal to the
           <b>value-pattern</b>.

       --type &lt;type&gt;
           <i>git config</i> will ensure that any input or output is valid
           under the given type constraint(s), and will canonicalize
           outgoing values in <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>'s canonical form.

           Valid <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>'s include:

           •   <i>bool</i>: canonicalize values as either "true" or "false".

           •   <i>int</i>: canonicalize values as simple decimal numbers. An
               optional suffix of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> will cause the value to be
               multiplied by 1024, 1048576, or 1073741824 upon input.

           •   <i>bool-or-int</i>: canonicalize according to either <i>bool</i> or
               <i>int</i>, as described above.

           •   <i>path</i>: canonicalize by expanding a leading <b>~ </b>to the value
               of <b>$HOME </b>and <b>~user </b>to the home directory for the
               specified user. This specifier has no effect when setting
               the value (but you can use <b>git config section.variable ~/</b>
               from the command line to let your shell do the
               expansion.)

           •   <i>expiry-date</i>: canonicalize by converting from a fixed or
               relative date-string to a timestamp. This specifier has
               no effect when setting the value.

           •   <i>color</i>: When getting a value, canonicalize by converting
               to an ANSI color escape sequence. When setting a value, a
               sanity-check is performed to ensure that the given value
               is canonicalize-able as an ANSI color, but it is written
               as-is.

       --bool, --int, --bool-or-int, --path, --expiry-date
           Historical options for selecting a type specifier. Prefer
           instead <b>--type </b>(see above).

       --no-type
           Un-sets the previously set type specifier (if one was
           previously set). This option requests that <i>git config</i> not
           canonicalize the retrieved variable.  <b>--no-type </b>has no effect
           without <b>--type=&lt;type&gt; </b>or <b>--&lt;type&gt;</b>.

       -z, --null
           For all options that output values and/or keys, always end
           values with the null character (instead of a newline). Use
           newline instead as a delimiter between key and value. This
           allows for secure parsing of the output without getting
           confused e.g. by values that contain line breaks.

       --name-only
           Output only the names of config variables for <b>list </b>or <b>get</b>.

       --show-origin
           Augment the output of all queried config options with the
           origin type (file, standard input, blob, command line) and
           the actual origin (config file path, ref, or blob id if
           applicable).

       --show-scope
           Similar to <b>--show-origin </b>in that it augments the output of
           all queried config options with the scope of that value
           (worktree, local, global, system, command).

       --get-colorbool &lt;name&gt; [&lt;stdout-is-tty&gt;]
           Find the color setting for <b>&lt;name&gt; </b>(e.g.  <b>color.diff</b>) and
           output "true" or "false".  <b>&lt;stdout-is-tty&gt; </b>should be either
           "true" or "false", and is taken into account when
           configuration says "auto". If <b>&lt;stdout-is-tty&gt; </b>is missing,
           then checks the standard output of the command itself, and
           exits with status 0 if color is to be used, or exits with
           status 1 otherwise. When the color setting for <b>name </b>is
           undefined, the command uses <b>color.ui </b>as fallback.

       --[no-]includes
           Respect <b>include.*  </b>directives in config files when looking up
           values. Defaults to <b>off </b>when a specific file is given (e.g.,
           using <b>--file</b>, <b>--global</b>, etc) and <b>on </b>when searching all config
           files.

       --default &lt;value&gt;
           When using <b>get</b>, and the requested variable is not found,
           behave as if &lt;value&gt; were the value assigned to that
           variable.

</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pager.config </b>is only respected when listing configuration, i.e.,
       when using <b>list </b>or <b>get </b>which may return multiple results. The
       default is to use a pager.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       By default, <i>git config</i> will read configuration options from
       multiple files:

       $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig
           System-wide configuration file.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config, ~/.gitconfig
           User-specific configuration files. When the XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           environment variable is not set or empty, $HOME/.config/ is
           used as $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.

           These are also called "global" configuration files. If both
           files exist, both files are read in the order given above.

       $GIT_DIR/config
           Repository specific configuration file.

       $GIT_DIR/config.worktree
           This is optional and is only searched when
           <b>extensions.worktreeConfig </b>is present in $GIT_DIR/config.

       You may also provide additional configuration parameters when
       running any git command by using the <b>-c </b>option. See <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> for
       details.

       Options will be read from all of these files that are available.
       If the global or the system-wide configuration files are missing
       or unreadable they will be ignored. If the repository
       configuration file is missing or unreadable, <i>git config</i> will exit
       with a non-zero error code. An error message is produced if the
       file is unreadable, but not if it is missing.

       The files are read in the order given above, with last value
       found taking precedence over values read earlier. When multiple
       values are taken then all values of a key from all files will be
       used.

       By default, options are only written to the repository specific
       configuration file. Note that this also affects options like <b>set</b>
       and <b>unset</b>. <i>git config</i> <b>will only ever change one file at a time</b>.

       You can limit which configuration sources are read from or
       written to by specifying the path of a file with the <b>--file</b>
       option, or by specifying a configuration scope with <b>--system</b>,
       <b>--global</b>, <b>--local</b>, or <b>--worktree</b>. For more, see the section
       called “OPTIONS” above.
</pre> <h2>
SCOPES </h2>
<pre>
       Each configuration source falls within a configuration scope. The
       scopes are:

       system
           $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig

       global
           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config

           ~/.gitconfig

       local
           $GIT_DIR/config

       worktree
           $GIT_DIR/config.worktree

       command
           GIT_CONFIG_{COUNT,KEY,VALUE} environment variables (see the
           section called “ENVIRONMENT” below)

           the <b>-c </b>option

       With the exception of <i>command</i>, each scope corresponds to a
       command line option: <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>, <b>--local</b>, <b>--worktree</b>.

       When reading options, specifying a scope will only read options
       from the files within that scope. When writing options,
       specifying a scope will write to the files within that scope
       (instead of the repository specific configuration file). See the
       section called “OPTIONS” above for a complete description.

       Most configuration options are respected regardless of the scope
       it is defined in, but some options are only respected in certain
       scopes. See the respective option’s documentation for the full
       details.

   <b>Protected configuration</b>
       Protected configuration refers to the <i>system</i>, <i>global</i>, and <i>command</i>
       scopes. For security reasons, certain options are only respected
       when they are specified in protected configuration, and ignored
       otherwise.

       Git treats these scopes as if they are controlled by the user or
       a trusted administrator. This is because an attacker who controls
       these scopes can do substantial harm without using Git, so it is
       assumed that the user’s environment protects these scopes against
       attackers.

ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL, GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM
           Take the configuration from the given files instead from
           global or system-level configuration. See <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> for details.

       GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
           Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide
           $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig file. See <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> for details.

       See also the section called “FILES”.

       GIT_CONFIG_COUNT, GIT_CONFIG_KEY_&lt;n&gt;, GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_&lt;n&gt;
           If GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is set to a positive number, all
           environment pairs GIT_CONFIG_KEY_&lt;n&gt; and GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_&lt;n&gt;
           up to that number will be added to the process’s runtime
           configuration. The config pairs are zero-indexed. Any missing
           key or value is treated as an error. An empty
           GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is treated the same as GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=0,
           namely no pairs are processed. These environment variables
           will override values in configuration files, but will be
           overridden by any explicit options passed via <b>git -c</b>.

           This is useful for cases where you want to spawn multiple git
           commands with a common configuration but cannot depend on a
           configuration file, for example when writing scripts.

       GIT_CONFIG
           If no <b>--file </b>option is provided to <b>git config</b>, use the file
           given by <b>GIT_CONFIG </b>as if it were provided via <b>--file</b>. This
           variable has no effect on other Git commands, and is mostly
           for historical compatibility; there is generally no reason to
           use it instead of the <b>--file </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Given a .git/config like this:

           #
           # This is the config file, and
           # a '#' or ';' character indicates
           # a comment
           #

           ; core variables
           [core]
                   ; Don't trust file modes
                   filemode = false

           ; Our diff algorithm
           [diff]
                   external = /usr/local/bin/diff-wrapper
                   renames = true

           ; Proxy settings
           [core]
                   gitproxy=proxy-command for kernel.org
                   gitproxy=default-proxy ; for all the rest

           ; HTTP
           [http]
                   sslVerify
           [http "https://weak.example.com"]
                   sslVerify = false
                   cookieFile = /tmp/cookie.txt

       you can set the filemode to true with

           % git config set core.filemode true

       The hypothetical proxy command entries actually have a postfix to
       discern what URL they apply to. Here is how to change the entry
       for kernel.org to "ssh".

           % git config set --value='for kernel.org$' core.gitproxy '"ssh" for kernel.org'

       This makes sure that only the key/value pair for kernel.org is
       replaced.

       To delete the entry for renames, do

           % git config unset diff.renames

       If you want to delete an entry for a multivar (like core.gitproxy
       above), you have to provide a regex matching the value of exactly
       one line.

       To query the value for a given key, do

           % git config get core.filemode

       or, to query a multivar:

           % git config get --value="for kernel.org$" core.gitproxy

       If you want to know all the values for a multivar, do:

           % git config get --all --show-names core.gitproxy

       If you like to live dangerously, you can replace <b>all</b>
       core.gitproxy by a new one with

           % git config set --all core.gitproxy ssh

       However, if you really only want to replace the line for the
       default proxy, i.e. the one without a "for ..." postfix, do
       something like this:

           % git config set --value='! for ' core.gitproxy ssh

       To actually match only values with an exclamation mark, you have
       to

           % git config set --value='[!]' section.key value

       To add a new proxy, without altering any of the existing ones,
       use

           % git config set --append core.gitproxy '"proxy-command" for example.com'

       An example to use customized color from the configuration in your
       script:

           #!/bin/sh
           WS=$(git config get --type=color --default="blue reverse" color.diff.whitespace)
           RESET=$(git config get --type=color --default="reset" "")
           echo "${WS}your whitespace color or blue reverse${RESET}"

       For URLs in <b><a href="https://weak.example.com">https://weak.example.com</a> </b>, <b>http.sslVerify </b>is set to
       false, while it is set to <b>true </b>for all others:

           % git config get --type=bool --url=https://good.example.com http.sslverify
           true
           % git config get --type=bool --url=https://weak.example.com http.sslverify
           false
           % git config get --url=https://weak.example.com http
           http.cookieFile /tmp/cookie.txt
           http.sslverify false
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE </h2>
<pre>
       The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that
       affect the Git commands' behavior. The files <b>.git/config </b>and
       optionally <b>config.worktree </b>(see the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section
       of <a href="git-worktree.1.html">git-worktree(1)</a>) in each repository are used to store the
       configuration for that repository, and <b>$HOME/.gitconfig </b>is used
       to store a per-user configuration as fallback values for the
       <b>.git/config </b>file. The file <b>/etc/gitconfig </b>can be used to store a
       system-wide default configuration.

       The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing and
       the porcelain commands. The variables are divided into sections,
       wherein the fully qualified variable name of the variable itself
       is the last dot-separated segment and the section name is
       everything before the last dot. The variable names are
       case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and <b>-</b>, and
       must start with an alphabetic character. Some variables may
       appear multiple times; we say then that the variable is
       multivalued.

   <b>Syntax</b>
       The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive. Whitespace
       characters, which in this context are the space character (SP)
       and the horizontal tabulation (HT), are mostly ignored. The <i>#</i> and
       <i>;</i> characters begin comments to the end of line. Blank lines are
       ignored.

       The file consists of sections and variables. A section begins
       with the name of the section in square brackets and continues
       until the next section begins. Section names are
       case-insensitive. Only alphanumeric characters, <b>- </b>and <b>. </b>are
       allowed in section names. Each variable must belong to some
       section, which means that there must be a section header before
       the first setting of a variable.

       Sections can be further divided into subsections. To begin a
       subsection put its name in double quotes, separated by space from
       the section name, in the section header, like in the example
       below:

                   [section "subsection"]

       Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any
       characters except newline and the null byte. Doublequote <b>" </b>and
       backslash can be included by escaping them as <b>\" </b>and <b>\\</b>,
       respectively. Backslashes preceding other characters are dropped
       when reading; for example, <b>\t </b>is read as <b>t </b>and <b>\0 </b>is read as <b>0</b>.
       Section headers cannot span multiple lines. Variables may belong
       directly to a section or to a given subsection. You can have
       <b>[section] </b>if you have <b>[section "subsection"]</b>, but you don’t need
       to.

       There is also a deprecated <b>[section.subsection] </b>syntax. With this
       syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower-case and is
       also compared case sensitively. These subsection names follow the
       same restrictions as section names.

       All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the
       section header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form
       <i>name = value</i> (or just <i>name</i>, which is a short-hand to say that the
       variable is the boolean "true"). The variable names are
       case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and <b>-</b>, and
       must start with an alphabetic character.

       Whitespace characters surrounding <b>name</b>, <b>= </b>and <b>value </b>are
       discarded. Internal whitespace characters within <i>value</i> are
       retained verbatim. Comments starting with either <b># </b>or <b>; </b>and
       extending to the end of line are discarded. A line that defines a
       value can be continued to the next line by ending it with a
       backslash (<b>\</b>); the backslash and the end-of-line characters are
       discarded.

       If <b>value </b>needs to contain leading or trailing whitespace
       characters, it must be enclosed in double quotation marks (<b>"</b>).
       Inside double quotation marks, double quote (<b>"</b>) and backslash (<b>\</b>)
       characters must be escaped: use <b>\" </b>for <b>" </b>and <b>\\ </b>for <b>\</b>.

       The following escape sequences (beside <b>\" </b>and <b>\\</b>) are recognized:
       <b>\n </b>for newline character (NL), <b>\t </b>for horizontal tabulation (HT,
       TAB) and <b>\b </b>for backspace (BS). Other char escape sequences
       (including octal escape sequences) are invalid.

   <b>Includes</b>
       The <b>include </b>and <b>includeIf </b>sections allow you to include config
       directives from another source. These sections behave identically
       to each other with the exception that <b>includeIf </b>sections may be
       ignored if their condition does not evaluate to true; see
       "Conditional includes" below.

       You can include a config file from another by setting the special
       <b>include.path </b>(or <b>includeIf.*.path</b>) variable to the name of the
       file to be included. The variable takes a pathname as its value,
       and is subject to tilde expansion. These variables can be given
       multiple times.

       The contents of the included file are inserted immediately, as if
       they had been found at the location of the include directive. If
       the value of the variable is a relative path, the path is
       considered to be relative to the configuration file in which the
       include directive was found. See below for examples.

   <b>Conditional includes</b>
       You can conditionally include a config file from another by
       setting an <b>includeIf.&lt;condition&gt;.path </b>variable to the name of the
       file to be included.

       The condition starts with a keyword followed by a colon and some
       data whose format and meaning depends on the keyword. Supported
       keywords are:

       <b>gitdir</b>
           The data that follows the keyword <b>gitdir: </b>is used as a glob
           pattern. If the location of the .git directory matches the
           pattern, the include condition is met.

           The .git location may be auto-discovered, or come from
           <b>$GIT_DIR </b>environment variable. If the repository is
           auto-discovered via a .git file (e.g. from submodules, or a
           linked worktree), the .git location would be the final
           location where the .git directory is, not where the .git file
           is.

           The pattern can contain standard globbing wildcards and two
           additional ones, <b>**/ </b>and <b>/**</b>, that can match multiple path
           components. Please refer to <a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore(5)</a> for details. For
           convenience:

           •   If the pattern starts with <b>~/</b>, <b>~ </b>will be substituted with
               the content of the environment variable <b>HOME</b>.

           •   If the pattern starts with <b>./</b>, it is replaced with the
               directory containing the current config file.

           •   If the pattern does not start with either <b>~/</b>, <b>./ </b>or <b>/</b>,
               <b>**/ </b>will be automatically prepended. For example, the
               pattern <b>foo/bar </b>becomes <b>**/foo/bar </b>and would match
               <b>/any/path/to/foo/bar</b>.

           •   If the pattern ends with <b>/</b>, <b>** </b>will be automatically
               added. For example, the pattern <b>foo/ </b>becomes <b>foo/**</b>. In
               other words, it matches "foo" and everything inside,
               recursively.

       <b>gitdir/i</b>
           This is the same as <b>gitdir </b>except that matching is done
           case-insensitively (e.g. on case-insensitive file systems)

       <b>onbranch</b>
           The data that follows the keyword <b>onbranch: </b>is taken to be a
           pattern with standard globbing wildcards and two additional
           ones, <b>**/ </b>and <b>/**</b>, that can match multiple path components.
           If we are in a worktree where the name of the branch that is
           currently checked out matches the pattern, the include
           condition is met.

           If the pattern ends with <b>/</b>, <b>** </b>will be automatically added.
           For example, the pattern <b>foo/ </b>becomes <b>foo/**</b>. In other words,
           it matches all branches that begin with <b>foo/</b>. This is useful
           if your branches are organized hierarchically and you would
           like to apply a configuration to all the branches in that
           hierarchy.

       <b>hasconfig:remote.*.url:</b>
           The data that follows this keyword is taken to be a pattern
           with standard globbing wildcards and two additional ones, <b>**/</b>
           and <b>/**</b>, that can match multiple components. The first time
           this keyword is seen, the rest of the config files will be
           scanned for remote URLs (without applying any values). If
           there exists at least one remote URL that matches this
           pattern, the include condition is met.

           Files included by this option (directly or indirectly) are
           not allowed to contain remote URLs.

           Note that unlike other includeIf conditions, resolving this
           condition relies on information that is not yet known at the
           point of reading the condition. A typical use case is this
           option being present as a system-level or global-level
           config, and the remote URL being in a local-level config;
           hence the need to scan ahead when resolving this condition.
           In order to avoid the chicken-and-egg problem in which
           potentially-included files can affect whether such files are
           potentially included, Git breaks the cycle by prohibiting
           these files from affecting the resolution of these conditions
           (thus, prohibiting them from declaring remote URLs).

           As for the naming of this keyword, it is for forwards
           compatibility with a naming scheme that supports more
           variable-based include conditions, but currently Git only
           supports the exact keyword described above.

       A few more notes on matching via <b>gitdir </b>and <b>gitdir/i</b>:

       •   Symlinks in <b>$GIT_DIR </b>are not resolved before matching.

       •   Both the symlink &amp; realpath versions of paths will be matched
           outside of <b>$GIT_DIR</b>. E.g. if ~/git is a symlink to
           /mnt/storage/git, both <b>gitdir:~/git </b>and
           <b>gitdir:/mnt/storage/git </b>will match.

           This was not the case in the initial release of this feature
           in v2.13.0, which only matched the realpath version.
           Configuration that wants to be compatible with the initial
           release of this feature needs to either specify only the
           realpath version, or both versions.

       •   Note that "../" is not special and will match literally,
           which is unlikely what you want.

   <b>Values</b>
       Values of many variables are treated as a simple string, but
       there are variables that take values of specific types and there
       are rules as to how to spell them.

       boolean
           When a variable is said to take a boolean value, many
           synonyms are accepted for <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>; these are all
           case-insensitive.

           true
               Boolean true literals are <b>yes</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>true</b>, and <b>1</b>. Also, a
               variable defined without <b>= &lt;value&gt; </b>is taken as true.

           false
               Boolean false literals are <b>no</b>, <b>off</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>0 </b>and the
               empty string.

               When converting a value to its canonical form using the
               <b>--type=bool </b>type specifier, <i>git config</i> will ensure that
               the output is "true" or "false" (spelled in lowercase).

       integer
           The value for many variables that specify various sizes can
           be suffixed with <b>k</b>, <b>M</b>,... to mean "scale the number by 1024",
           "by 1024x1024", etc.

       color
           The value for a variable that takes a color is a list of
           colors (at most two, one for foreground and one for
           background) and attributes (as many as you want), separated
           by spaces.

           The basic colors accepted are <b>normal</b>, <b>black</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>,
           <b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan</b>, <b>white </b>and <b>default</b>. The first
           color given is the foreground; the second is the background.
           All the basic colors except <b>normal </b>and <b>default </b>have a bright
           variant that can be specified by prefixing the color with
           <b>bright</b>, like <b>brightred</b>.

           The color <b>normal </b>makes no change to the color. It is the same
           as an empty string, but can be used as the foreground color
           when specifying a background color alone (for example,
           "normal red").

           The color <b>default </b>explicitly resets the color to the terminal
           default, for example to specify a cleared background.
           Although it varies between terminals, this is usually not the
           same as setting to "white black".

           Colors may also be given as numbers between 0 and 255; these
           use ANSI 256-color mode (but note that not all terminals may
           support this). If your terminal supports it, you may also
           specify 24-bit RGB values as hex, like <b>#ff0ab3</b>, or 12-bit RGB
           values like <b>#f1b</b>, which is equivalent to the 24-bit color
           <b>#ff11bb</b>.

           The accepted attributes are <b>bold</b>, <b>dim</b>, <b>ul</b>, <b>blink</b>, <b>reverse</b>,
           <b>italic</b>, and <b>strike </b>(for crossed-out or "strikethrough"
           letters). The position of any attributes with respect to the
           colors (before, after, or in between), doesn’t matter.
           Specific attributes may be turned off by prefixing them with
           <b>no </b>or <b>no- </b>(e.g., <b>noreverse</b>, <b>no-ul</b>, etc).

           The pseudo-attribute <b>reset </b>resets all colors and attributes
           before applying the specified coloring. For example, <b>reset</b>
           <b>green </b>will result in a green foreground and default
           background without any active attributes.

           An empty color string produces no color effect at all. This
           can be used to avoid coloring specific elements without
           disabling color entirely.

           For git’s pre-defined color slots, the attributes are meant
           to be reset at the beginning of each item in the colored
           output. So setting <b>color.decorate.branch </b>to <b>black </b>will paint
           that branch name in a plain <b>black</b>, even if the previous thing
           on the same output line (e.g. opening parenthesis before the
           list of branch names in <b>log --decorate </b>output) is set to be
           painted with <b>bold </b>or some other attribute. However, custom
           log formats may do more complicated and layered coloring, and
           the negated forms may be useful there.

       pathname
           A variable that takes a pathname value can be given a string
           that begins with "<b>~/</b>" or "<b>~user/</b>", and the usual tilde
           expansion happens to such a string: <b>~/ </b>is expanded to the
           value of <b>$HOME</b>, and <b>~user/ </b>to the specified user’s home
           directory.

           If a path starts with <b>%(prefix)/</b>, the remainder is
           interpreted as a path relative to Git’s "runtime prefix",
           i.e. relative to the location where Git itself was installed.
           For example, <b>%(prefix)/bin/ </b>refers to the directory in which
           the Git executable itself lives. If Git was compiled without
           runtime prefix support, the compiled-in prefix will be
           substituted instead. In the unlikely event that a literal
           path needs to be specified that should <i>not</i> be expanded, it
           needs to be prefixed by <b>./</b>, like so: <b>./%(prefix)/bin</b>.

   <b>Variables</b>
       Note that this list is non-comprehensive and not necessarily
       complete. For command-specific variables, you will find a more
       detailed description in the appropriate manual page.

       Other git-related tools may and do use their own variables. When
       inventing new variables for use in your own tool, make sure their
       names do not conflict with those that are used by Git itself and
       other popular tools, and describe them in your documentation.

       add.ignoreErrors, add.ignore-errors (deprecated)
           Tells <i>git add</i> to continue adding files when some files cannot
           be added due to indexing errors. Equivalent to the
           <b>--ignore-errors </b>option of <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a>.  <b>add.ignore-errors </b>is
           deprecated, as it does not follow the usual naming convention
           for configuration variables.

       add.interactive.useBuiltin
           Unused configuration variable. Used in Git versions v2.25.0
           to v2.36.0 to enable the built-in version of <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a>'s
           interactive mode, which then became the default in Git
           versions v2.37.0 to v2.39.0.

       advice.*
           These variables control various optional help messages
           designed to aid new users. When left unconfigured, Git will
           give the message alongside instructions on how to squelch it.
           You can tell Git that you do not need the help message by
           setting these to <b>false</b>:

               pathspec parameter.

           addIgnoredFile
               Shown when the user attempts to add an ignored file to
               the index.

               Shown when a fetch refspec for multiple remotes maps to
               the same remote-tracking branch namespace and causes
               branch tracking set-up to fail.

           checkoutAmbiguousRemoteBranchName
               Shown when the argument to <a href="git-checkout.1.html">git-checkout(1)</a> and
               <a href="git-switch.1.html">git-switch(1)</a> ambiguously resolves to a remote tracking
               branch on more than one remote in situations where an
               unambiguous argument would have otherwise caused a
               remote-tracking branch to be checked out. See the
               <b>checkout.defaultRemote </b>configuration variable for how to
               set a given remote to be used by default in some
               situations where this advice would be printed.

           commitBeforeMerge
               Shown when <a href="git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a> refuses to merge to avoid

               Shown when a hook is ignored because the hook is not set
               as executable.

           implicitIdentity
               Shown when the user’s information is guessed from the

               Shown when <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> rejects an update that does not
               qualify for fast-forwarding (e.g., a tag.)

           pushFetchFirst
               Shown when <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> rejects an update that tries to
               overwrite a remote ref that points at an object we do not
               have.

           pushNeedsForce
               Shown when <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> rejects an update that tries to
               overwrite a remote ref that points at an object that is
               not a commit-ish, or make the remote ref point at an
               object that is not a commit-ish.

           pushNonFFCurrent
               Shown when <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> fails due to a non-fast-forward
               update to the current branch.

           pushNonFFMatching
               Shown when the user ran <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> and pushed "matching
               refs" explicitly (i.e. used <b>:</b>, or specified a refspec
               that isn’t the current branch) and it resulted in a
               non-fast-forward error.

           pushRefNeedsUpdate
               Shown when <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> rejects a forced update of a
               branch when its remote-tracking ref has updates that we
               do not have locally.

           pushUnqualifiedRefname
               Shown when <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> gives up trying to guess based on
               the source and destination refs what remote ref namespace
               the source belongs in, but where we can still suggest
               that the user push to either <b>refs/heads/* </b>or <b>refs/tags/*</b>
               based on the type of the source object.

           pushUpdateRejected
               Set this variable to <b>false </b>if you want to disable
               <b>pushNonFFCurrent</b>, <b>pushNonFFMatching</b>, <b>pushAlreadyExists</b>,
               <b>pushFetchFirst</b>, <b>pushNeedsForce</b>, and <b>pushRefNeedsUpdate</b>
               simultaneously.

               refresh the index after reset, to tell the user that they
               can use the <b>--no-refresh </b>option.

           resolveConflict
               Shown by various commands when conflicts prevent the
               operation from being performed.

           rmHints
               Shown on failure in the output of <a href="git-rm.1.html">git-rm(1)</a>, to give
               directions on how to proceed from the current state.

           skippedCherryPicks
               Shown when <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a> skips a commit that has already
               been cherry-picked onto the upstream branch.

           statusAheadBehind
               Shown when <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> computes the ahead/behind counts
               for a local ref compared to its remote tracking ref, and
               that calculation takes longer than expected. Will not
               appear if <b>status.aheadBehind </b>is false or the option
               <b>--no-ahead-behind </b>is given.

           statusHints
               Show directions on how to proceed from the current state
               in the output of <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a>, in the template shown
               when writing commit messages in <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a>, and in the
               help message shown by <a href="git-switch.1.html">git-switch(1)</a> or <a href="git-checkout.1.html">git-checkout(1)</a>

           statusUoption
               Shown when <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> takes more than 2 seconds to
               enumerate untracked files, to tell the user that they can
               use the <b>-u </b>option.

           submoduleAlternateErrorStrategyDie

               is encountered.

           submodulesNotUpdated
               Shown when a user runs a submodule command that fails
               because <b>git submodule update --init </b>was not run.

           suggestDetachingHead
               Shown when <a href="git-switch.1.html">git-switch(1)</a> refuses to detach HEAD without
               the explicit <b>--detach </b>option.

           updateSparsePath
               Shown when either <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a> or <a href="git-rm.1.html">git-rm(1)</a> is asked to
               update index entries outside the current sparse checkout.

           waitingForEditor
               Shown when Git is waiting for editor input. Relevant when
               e.g. the editor is not launched inside the terminal.

           worktreeAddOrphan
               Shown when the user tries to create a worktree from an
               invalid reference, to tell the user how to create a new
               unborn branch instead.

       alias.*
           Command aliases for the <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> command wrapper - e.g. after
           defining <b>alias.last = cat-file commit HEAD</b>, the invocation
           <b>git last </b>is equivalent to <b>git cat-file commit HEAD</b>. To avoid
           confusion and troubles with script usage, aliases that hide
           existing Git commands are ignored. Arguments are split by
           spaces, the usual shell quoting and escaping are supported. A
           quote pair or a backslash can be used to quote them.

           Note that the first word of an alias does not necessarily
           have to be a command. It can be a command-line option that
           will be passed into the invocation of <b>git</b>. In particular,
           this is useful when used with <b>-c </b>to pass in one-time
           configurations or <b>-p </b>to force pagination. For example,
           <b>loud-rebase = -c commit.verbose=true rebase </b>can be defined
           such that running <b>git loud-rebase </b>would be equivalent to <b>git</b>
           <b>-c commit.verbose=true rebase</b>. Also, <b>ps = -p status </b>would be
           a helpful alias since <b>git ps </b>would paginate the output of <b>git</b>
           <b>status </b>where the original command does not.

           If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point,
           it will be treated as a shell command. For example, defining
           <b>alias.new = !gitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD</b>, the invocation <b>git</b>
           <b>new </b>is equivalent to running the shell command <b>gitk --all</b>
           <b>--not ORIG_HEAD</b>. Note:

           •   Shell commands will be executed from the top-level
               directory of a repository, which may not necessarily be
               the current directory.

           •   <b>GIT_PREFIX </b>is set as returned by running <b>git rev-parse</b>
               <b>--show-prefix </b>from the original current directory. See
               <a href="git-rev-parse.1.html">git-rev-parse(1)</a>.

           •   Shell command aliases always receive any extra arguments
               provided to the Git command-line as positional arguments.

               •   Care should be taken if your shell alias is a
                   "one-liner" script with multiple commands (e.g. in a
                   pipeline), references multiple arguments, or is
                   otherwise not able to handle positional arguments
                   added at the end. For example: <b>alias.cmd = "!echo $1</b>
                   <b>| grep $2" </b>called as <b>git cmd 1 2 </b>will be executed as
                   <i>echo $1 | grep $2 1 2</i>, which is not what you want.

               •   A convenient way to deal with this is to write your
                   script operations in an inline function that is then
                   called with any arguments from the command-line. For
                   example `alias.cmd = "!c() { echo $1 | grep $2 ; };
                   c" will correctly execute the prior example.

               •   Setting <b>GIT_TRACE=1 </b>can help you debug the command
                   being run for your alias.

       am.keepcr
           If true, git-am will call git-mailsplit for patches in mbox
           format with parameter <b>--keep-cr</b>. In this case git-mailsplit
           will not remove <b>\r </b>from lines ending with <b>\r\n</b>. Can be
           overridden by giving <b>--no-keep-cr </b>from the command line. See
           <a href="git-am.1.html">git-am(1)</a>, <a href="git-mailsplit.1.html">git-mailsplit(1)</a>.

       am.threeWay
           By default, <b>git am </b>will fail if the patch does not apply
           cleanly. When set to true, this setting tells <b>git am </b>to fall
           back on 3-way merge if the patch records the identity of
           blobs it is supposed to apply to and we have those blobs
           available locally (equivalent to giving the <b>--3way </b>option
           from the command line). Defaults to <b>false</b>. See <a href="git-am.1.html">git-am(1)</a>.

       apply.ignoreWhitespace
           When set to <i>change</i>, tells <i>git apply</i> to ignore changes in
           whitespace, in the same way as the <b>--ignore-space-change</b>
           option. When set to one of: no, none, never, false, it tells
           <i>git apply</i> to respect all whitespace differences. See
           <a href="git-apply.1.html">git-apply(1)</a>.

       apply.whitespace
           Tells <i>git apply</i> how to handle whitespace, in the same way as
           the <b>--whitespace </b>option. See <a href="git-apply.1.html">git-apply(1)</a>.

       attr.tree
           A reference to a tree in the repository from which to read
           attributes, instead of the <b>.gitattributes </b>file in the working
           tree. In a bare repository, this defaults to
           <b>HEAD:.gitattributes</b>. If the value does not resolve to a valid
           tree object, an empty tree is used instead. When the
           <b>GIT_ATTR_SOURCE </b>environment variable or <b>--attr-source </b>command
           line option are used, this configuration variable has no
           effect.

       blame.blankBoundary
           Show blank commit object name for boundary commits in
           <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>. This option defaults to false.

       blame.coloring
           This determines the coloring scheme to be applied to blame
           output. It can be <i>repeatedLines</i>, <i>highlightRecent</i>, or <i>none</i>
           which is the default.

       blame.date
           Specifies the format used to output dates in <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>. If
           unset the iso format is used. For supported values, see the
           discussion of the <b>--date </b>option at <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>.

       blame.showEmail
           Show the author email instead of author name in <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>.
           This option defaults to false.

       blame.showRoot
           Do not treat root commits as boundaries in <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>. This
           option defaults to false.

       blame.ignoreRevsFile
           Ignore revisions listed in the file, one unabbreviated object
           name per line, in <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>. Whitespace and comments
           beginning with <b># </b>are ignored. This option may be repeated
           multiple times. Empty file names will reset the list of
           ignored revisions. This option will be handled before the
           command line option <b>--ignore-revs-file</b>.

       blame.markUnblamableLines
           Mark lines that were changed by an ignored revision that we
           could not attribute to another commit with a <i>*</i> in the output
           of <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>.

       blame.markIgnoredLines
           Mark lines that were changed by an ignored revision that we
           attributed to another commit with a <i>?</i>  in the output of
           <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>.

       branch.autoSetupMerge
           Tells <i>git branch</i>, <i>git switch</i> and <i>git checkout</i> to set up new
           branches so that <a href="git-pull.1.html">git-pull(1)</a> will appropriately merge from
           the starting point branch. Note that even if this option is
           not set, this behavior can be chosen per-branch using the
           <b>--track </b>and <b>--no-track </b>options. The valid settings are: <b>false</b>
           — no automatic setup is done; <b>true </b>— automatic setup is done
           when the starting point is a remote-tracking branch; <b>always </b>—
           automatic setup is done when the starting point is either a
           local branch or remote-tracking branch; <b>inherit </b>— if the
           starting point has a tracking configuration, it is copied to
           the new branch; <b>simple </b>— automatic setup is done only when
           the starting point is a remote-tracking branch and the new
           branch has the same name as the remote branch. This option
           defaults to true.

       branch.autoSetupRebase
           When a new branch is created with <i>git branch</i>, <i>git switch</i> or
           <i>git checkout</i> that tracks another branch, this variable tells
           Git to set up pull to rebase instead of merge (see
           "branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase"). When <b>never</b>, rebase is never
           automatically set to true. When <b>local</b>, rebase is set to true
           for tracked branches of other local branches. When <b>remote</b>,
           rebase is set to true for tracked branches of remote-tracking
           branches. When <b>always</b>, rebase will be set to true for all
           tracking branches. See "branch.autoSetupMerge" for details on
           how to set up a branch to track another branch. This option
           defaults to never.

       branch.sort
           This variable controls the sort ordering of branches when
           displayed by <a href="git-branch.1.html">git-branch(1)</a>. Without the "--sort=&lt;value&gt;"
           option provided, the value of this variable will be used as
           the default. See <a href="git-for-each-ref.1.html">git-for-each-ref(1)</a> field names for valid
           values.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote
           When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells <i>git fetch</i> and <i>git push</i> which
           remote to fetch from or push to. The remote to push to may be
           overridden with <b>remote.pushDefault </b>(for all branches). The
           remote to push to, for the current branch, may be further
           overridden by <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote</b>. If no remote is
           configured, or if you are not on any branch and there is more
           than one remote defined in the repository, it defaults to
           <b>origin </b>for fetching and <b>remote.pushDefault </b>for pushing.
           Additionally, <b>.  </b>(a period) is the current local repository
           (a dot-repository), see <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</b>'s final note
           below.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote
           When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it overrides <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote </b>for
           pushing. It also overrides <b>remote.pushDefault </b>for pushing
           from branch &lt;name&gt;. When you pull from one place (e.g. your
           upstream) and push to another place (e.g. your own publishing
           repository), you would want to set <b>remote.pushDefault </b>to
           specify the remote to push to for all branches, and use this
           option to override it for a specific branch.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge
           Defines, together with branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote, the upstream
           branch for the given branch. It tells <i>git fetch</i>/<i>git pull</i>/<i>git</i>
           <i>rebase</i> which branch to merge and can also affect <i>git push</i>
           (see push.default). When in branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells <i>git fetch</i>
           the default refspec to be marked for merging in FETCH_HEAD.
           The value is handled like the remote part of a refspec, and
           must match a ref which is fetched from the remote given by
           "branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote". The merge information is used by <i>git</i>
           <i>pull</i> (which first calls <i>git fetch</i>) to lookup the default
           branch for merging. Without this option, <i>git pull</i> defaults to
           merge the first refspec fetched. Specify multiple values to
           get an octopus merge. If you wish to setup <i>git pull</i> so that
           it merges into &lt;name&gt; from another branch in the local
           repository, you can point branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge to the desired
           branch, and use the relative path setting <b>.  </b>(a period) for
           branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.mergeOptions
           Sets default options for merging into branch &lt;name&gt;. The
           syntax and supported options are the same as those of
           <a href="git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a>, but option values containing whitespace
           characters are currently not supported.

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase
           When true, rebase the branch &lt;name&gt; on top of the fetched
           branch, instead of merging the default branch from the
           default remote when "git pull" is run. See "pull.rebase" for
           doing this in a non branch-specific manner.

           When <b>merges </b>(or just <i>m</i>), pass the <b>--rebase-merges </b>option to
           <i>git rebase</i> so that the local merge commits are included in
           the rebase (see <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a> for details).

           When the value is <b>interactive </b>(or just <i>i</i>), the rebase is run
           in interactive mode.

           <b>NOTE</b>: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do <b>not </b>use it
           unless you understand the implications (see <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a> for
           details).

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.description
           Branch description, can be edited with <b>git branch</b>
           <b>--edit-description</b>. Branch description is automatically added
           to the format-patch cover letter or request-pull summary.

       browser.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified browser. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the URLs passed
           as arguments. (See <a href="git-web--browse.1.html">git-web--browse(1)</a>.)

       browser.&lt;tool&gt;.path
           Override the path for the given tool that may be used to
           browse HTML help (see <b>-w </b>option in <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>) or a working
           repository in gitweb (see <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a>).

       bundle.*
           The <b>bundle.*  </b>keys may appear in a bundle list file found via
           the <b>git clone --bundle-uri </b>option. These keys currently have
           no effect if placed in a repository config file, though this
           will change in the future. See <b>the bundle URI design</b>
           <b>document</b>[1] for more details.

       bundle.version
           This integer value advertises the version of the bundle list
           format used by the bundle list. Currently, the only accepted
           value is <b>1</b>.

       bundle.mode
           This string value should be either <b>all </b>or <b>any</b>. This value
           describes whether all of the advertised bundles are required
           to unbundle a complete understanding of the bundled
           information (<b>all</b>) or if any one of the listed bundle URIs is
           sufficient (<b>any</b>).

       bundle.heuristic
           If this string-valued key exists, then the bundle list is
           designed to work well with incremental <b>git fetch </b>commands.
           The heuristic signals that there are additional keys
           available for each bundle that help determine which subset of
           bundles the client should download. The only value currently
           understood is <b>creationToken</b>.

       bundle.&lt;id&gt;.*
           The <b>bundle.&lt;id&gt;.*  </b>keys are used to describe a single item in
           the bundle list, grouped under <b>&lt;id&gt; </b>for identification
           purposes.

       bundle.&lt;id&gt;.uri
           This string value defines the URI by which Git can reach the
           contents of this <b>&lt;id&gt;</b>. This URI may be a bundle file or
           another bundle list.

       checkout.defaultRemote
           When you run <b>git checkout &lt;something&gt; </b>or <b>git switch</b>
           <b>&lt;something&gt; </b>and only have one remote, it may implicitly fall
           back on checking out and tracking e.g.  <b>origin/&lt;something&gt;</b>.
           This stops working as soon as you have more than one remote
           with a <b>&lt;something&gt; </b>reference. This setting allows for setting
           the name of a preferred remote that should always win when it
           comes to disambiguation. The typical use-case is to set this
           to <b>origin</b>.

           Currently this is used by <a href="git-switch.1.html">git-switch(1)</a> and <a href="git-checkout.1.html">git-checkout(1)</a>
           when <b>git checkout &lt;something&gt; </b>or <b>git switch &lt;something&gt; </b>will
           checkout the <b>&lt;something&gt; </b>branch on another remote, and by
           <a href="git-worktree.1.html">git-worktree(1)</a> when <b>git worktree add </b>refers to a remote
           branch. This setting might be used for other checkout-like
           commands or functionality in the future.

       checkout.guess
           Provides the default value for the <b>--guess </b>or <b>--no-guess</b>
           option in <b>git checkout </b>and <b>git switch</b>. See <a href="git-switch.1.html">git-switch(1)</a> and
           <a href="git-checkout.1.html">git-checkout(1)</a>.

       checkout.workers
           The number of parallel workers to use when updating the
           working tree. The default is one, i.e. sequential execution.
           If set to a value less than one, Git will use as many workers
           as the number of logical cores available. This setting and
           <b>checkout.thresholdForParallelism </b>affect all commands that
           perform checkout. E.g. checkout, clone, reset,
           sparse-checkout, etc.

           Note: Parallel checkout usually delivers better performance
           for repositories located on SSDs or over NFS. For
           repositories on spinning disks and/or machines with a small
           number of cores, the default sequential checkout often
           performs better. The size and compression level of a
           repository might also influence how well the parallel version
           performs.

       checkout.thresholdForParallelism
           When running parallel checkout with a small number of files,
           the cost of subprocess spawning and inter-process
           communication might outweigh the parallelization gains. This
           setting allows you to define the minimum number of files for
           which parallel checkout should be attempted. The default is
           100.

       clean.requireForce
           A boolean to make git-clean refuse to delete files unless -f
           is given. Defaults to true.

       <b>clone.defaultRemoteName</b>
           The name of the remote to create when cloning a repository.
           Defaults to <b>origin</b>. It can be overridden by passing the
           <b>--origin </b>command-line option to <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>.

       <b>clone.rejectShallow</b>
           Reject cloning a repository if it is a shallow one; this can
           be overridden by passing the <b>--reject-shallow </b>option on the
           command line. See <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>.

       <b>clone.filterSubmodules</b>
           If a partial clone filter is provided (see <b>--filter </b>in
           <a href="git-rev-list.1.html">git-rev-list(1)</a>) and <b>--recurse-submodules </b>is used, also apply
           the filter to submodules.

       color.advice
           A boolean to enable/disable color in hints (e.g. when a push
           failed, see <b>advice.*  </b>for a list). May be set to <b>always</b>,
           <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or <b>auto </b>(or <b>true</b>), in which case colors are
           used only when the error output goes to a terminal. If unset,
           then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.advice.hint
           Use customized color for hints.

       color.blame.highlightRecent
           Specify the line annotation color for <b>git blame</b>
           <b>--color-by-age </b>depending upon the age of the line.

           This setting should be set to a comma-separated list of color
           and date settings, starting and ending with a color, the
           dates should be set from oldest to newest. The metadata will
           be colored with the specified colors if the line was
           introduced before the given timestamp, overwriting older
           timestamped colors.

           Instead of an absolute timestamp relative timestamps work as
           well, e.g.  <b>2.weeks.ago </b>is valid to address anything older
           than 2 weeks.

           It defaults to <b>blue,12 month ago,white,1 month ago,red</b>, which
           colors everything older than one year blue, recent changes
           between one month and one year old are kept white, and lines
           introduced within the last month are colored red.

       color.blame.repeatedLines
           Use the specified color to colorize line annotations for <b>git</b>
           <b>blame --color-lines</b>, if they come from the same commit as the
           preceding line. Defaults to cyan.

       color.branch
           A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
           <a href="git-branch.1.html">git-branch(1)</a>. May be set to <b>always</b>, <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or <b>auto</b>
           (or <b>true</b>), in which case colors are used only when the output
           is to a terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is
           used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.branch.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for branch coloration.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>is one of
           <b>current </b>(the current branch), <b>local </b>(a local branch), <b>remote</b>
           (a remote-tracking branch in refs/remotes/), <b>upstream</b>
           (upstream tracking branch), <b>plain </b>(other refs).

       color.diff
           Whether to use ANSI escape sequences to add color to patches.
           If this is set to <b>always</b>, <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>, <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, and
           <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a> will use color for all patches. If it is set to
           <b>true </b>or <b>auto</b>, those commands will only use color when output
           is to the terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is
           used (<b>auto </b>by default).

           This does not affect <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a> or the <i>git-diff-*</i>
           plumbing commands. Can be overridden on the command line with
           the <b>--color[=&lt;when&gt;] </b>option.

       color.diff.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for diff colorization.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>specifies
           which part of the patch to use the specified color, and is
           one of <b>context </b>(context text - <b>plain </b>is a historical
           synonym), <b>meta </b>(metainformation), <b>frag </b>(hunk header), <i>func</i>
           (function in hunk header), <b>old </b>(removed lines), <b>new </b>(added
           lines), <b>commit </b>(commit headers), <b>whitespace </b>(highlighting
           whitespace errors), <b>oldMoved </b>(deleted lines), <b>newMoved </b>(added
           lines), <b>oldMovedDimmed</b>, <b>oldMovedAlternative</b>,
           <b>oldMovedAlternativeDimmed</b>, <b>newMovedDimmed</b>,
           <b>newMovedAlternative newMovedAlternativeDimmed </b>(See the <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i>
           setting of <i>--color-moved</i> in <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> for details),
           <b>contextDimmed</b>, <b>oldDimmed</b>, <b>newDimmed</b>, <b>contextBold</b>, <b>oldBold</b>,
           and <b>newBold </b>(see <a href="git-range-diff.1.html">git-range-diff(1)</a> for details).

       color.decorate.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for <i>git log --decorate</i> output.  <b>&lt;slot&gt;</b>
           is one of <b>branch</b>, <b>remoteBranch</b>, <b>tag</b>, <b>stash </b>or <b>HEAD </b>for local
           branches, remote-tracking branches, tags, stash and HEAD,
           respectively and <b>grafted </b>for grafted commits.

       color.grep
           When set to <b>always</b>, always highlight matches. When <b>false </b>(or
           <b>never</b>), never. When set to <b>true </b>or <b>auto</b>, use color only when
           the output is written to the terminal. If unset, then the
           value of <b>color.ui </b>is used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.grep.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for grep colorization.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>specifies
           which part of the line to use the specified color, and is one
           of

           <b>context</b>
               non-matching text in context lines (when using <b>-A</b>, <b>-B</b>, or
               <b>-C</b>)

           <b>filename</b>
               filename prefix (when not using <b>-h</b>)

           <b>function</b>
               function name lines (when using <b>-p</b>)

           <b>lineNumber</b>
               line number prefix (when using <b>-n</b>)

           <b>column</b>
               column number prefix (when using <b>--column</b>)

           <b>match</b>
               matching text (same as setting <b>matchContext </b>and
               <b>matchSelected</b>)

           <b>matchContext</b>
               matching text in context lines

           <b>matchSelected</b>
               matching text in selected lines. Also, used to customize
               the following <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> subcommands: <b>--grep</b>, <b>--author</b>,
               and <b>--committer</b>.

           <b>selected</b>
               non-matching text in selected lines. Also, used to
               customize the following <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> subcommands: <b>--grep</b>,
               <b>--author </b>and <b>--committer</b>.

           <b>separator</b>
               separators between fields on a line (<b>:</b>, <b>-</b>, and <b>=</b>) and
               between hunks (<b>--</b>)

       color.interactive
           When set to <b>always</b>, always use colors for interactive prompts
           and displays (such as those used by "git-add --interactive"
           and "git-clean --interactive"). When false (or <b>never</b>), never.
           When set to <b>true </b>or <b>auto</b>, use colors only when the output is
           to the terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is used
           (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.interactive.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for <i>git add --interactive</i> and <i>git clean</i>
           <i>--interactive</i> output.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>may be <b>prompt</b>, <b>header</b>, <b>help </b>or
           <b>error</b>, for four distinct types of normal output from
           interactive commands.

       color.pager
           A boolean to specify whether <b>auto </b>color modes should colorize
           output going to the pager. Defaults to true; set this to
           false if your pager does not understand ANSI color codes.

       color.push
           A boolean to enable/disable color in push errors. May be set
           to <b>always</b>, <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or <b>auto </b>(or <b>true</b>), in which case
           colors are used only when the error output goes to a
           terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is used (<b>auto</b>
           by default).

       color.push.error
           Use customized color for push errors.

       color.remote
           If set, keywords at the start of the line are highlighted.
           The keywords are "error", "warning", "hint" and "success",
           and are matched case-insensitively. May be set to <b>always</b>,
           <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or <b>auto </b>(or <b>true</b>). If unset, then the value
           of <b>color.ui </b>is used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.remote.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for each remote keyword.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>may be
           <b>hint</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>success </b>or <b>error </b>which match the corresponding
           keyword.

       color.showBranch
           A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
           <a href="git-show-branch.1.html">git-show-branch(1)</a>. May be set to <b>always</b>, <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or
           <b>auto </b>(or <b>true</b>), in which case colors are used only when the
           output is to a terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui</b>
           is used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.status
           A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
           <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a>. May be set to <b>always</b>, <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or <b>auto</b>
           (or <b>true</b>), in which case colors are used only when the output
           is to a terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is
           used (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.status.&lt;slot&gt;
           Use customized color for status colorization.  <b>&lt;slot&gt; </b>is one
           of <b>header </b>(the header text of the status message), <b>added </b>or
           <b>updated </b>(files which are added but not committed), <b>changed</b>
           (files which are changed but not added in the index),
           <b>untracked </b>(files which are not tracked by Git), <b>branch </b>(the
           current branch), <b>nobranch </b>(the color the <i>no branch</i> warning is
           shown in, defaulting to red), <b>localBranch </b>or <b>remoteBranch</b>
           (the local and remote branch names, respectively, when branch
           and tracking information is displayed in the status
           short-format), or <b>unmerged </b>(files which have unmerged
           changes).

       color.transport
           A boolean to enable/disable color when pushes are rejected.
           May be set to <b>always</b>, <b>false </b>(or <b>never</b>) or <b>auto </b>(or <b>true</b>), in
           which case colors are used only when the error output goes to
           a terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui </b>is used
           (<b>auto </b>by default).

       color.transport.rejected
           Use customized color when a push was rejected.

       color.ui
           This variable determines the default value for variables such
           as <b>color.diff </b>and <b>color.grep </b>that control the use of color
           per command family. Its scope will expand as more commands
           learn configuration to set a default for the <b>--color </b>option.
           Set it to <b>false </b>or <b>never </b>if you prefer Git commands not to
           use color unless enabled explicitly with some other
           configuration or the <b>--color </b>option. Set it to <b>always </b>if you
           want all output not intended for machine consumption to use
           color, to <b>true </b>or <b>auto </b>(this is the default since Git 1.8.4)
           if you want such output to use color when written to the
           terminal.

       column.ui
           Specify whether supported commands should output in columns.
           This variable consists of a list of tokens separated by
           spaces or commas:

           These options control when the feature should be enabled
           (defaults to <i>never</i>):

           <b>always</b>
               always show in columns

           <b>never</b>
               never show in columns

           <b>auto</b>
               show in columns if the output is to the terminal

           These options control layout (defaults to <i>column</i>). Setting
           any of these implies <i>always</i> if none of <i>always</i>, <i>never</i>, or <i>auto</i>
           are specified.

           <b>column</b>
               fill columns before rows

           <b>row</b>
               fill rows before columns

           <b>plain</b>
               show in one column

           Finally, these options can be combined with a layout option
           (defaults to <i>nodense</i>):

           <b>dense</b>
               make unequal size columns to utilize more space

           <b>nodense</b>
               make equal size columns

       column.branch
           Specify whether to output branch listing in <b>git branch </b>in
           columns. See <b>column.ui </b>for details.

       column.clean
           Specify the layout when listing items in <b>git clean -i</b>, which
           always shows files and directories in columns. See <b>column.ui</b>
           for details.

       column.status
           Specify whether to output untracked files in <b>git status </b>in
           columns. See <b>column.ui </b>for details.

       column.tag
           Specify whether to output tag listings in <b>git tag </b>in columns.
           See <b>column.ui </b>for details.

       commit.cleanup
           This setting overrides the default of the <b>--cleanup </b>option in
           <b>git commit</b>. See <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> for details. Changing the
           default can be useful when you always want to keep lines that
           begin with the comment character <b># </b>in your log message, in
           which case you would do <b>git config commit.cleanup whitespace</b>
           (note that you will have to remove the help lines that begin
           with <b># </b>in the commit log template yourself, if you do this).

       commit.gpgSign
           A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG
           signed. Use of this option when doing operations such as
           rebase can result in a large number of commits being signed.
           It may be convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your GPG
           passphrase several times.

       commit.status
           A boolean to enable/disable inclusion of status information
           in the commit message template when using an editor to
           prepare the commit message. Defaults to true.

       commit.template
           Specify the pathname of a file to use as the template for new
           commit messages.

       commit.verbose
           A boolean or int to specify the level of verbosity with <b>git</b>
           <b>commit</b>. See <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a>.

       commitGraph.generationVersion
           Specifies the type of generation number version to use when
           writing or reading the commit-graph file. If version 1 is
           specified, then the corrected commit dates will not be
           written or read. Defaults to 2.

       commitGraph.maxNewFilters
           Specifies the default value for the <b>--max-new-filters </b>option
           of <b>git commit-graph write </b>(c.f., <a href="git-commit-graph.1.html">git-commit-graph(1)</a>).

       commitGraph.readChangedPaths
           If true, then git will use the changed-path Bloom filters in
           the commit-graph file (if it exists, and they are present).
           Defaults to true. See <a href="git-commit-graph.1.html">git-commit-graph(1)</a> for more
           information.

       completion.commands
           This is only used by git-completion.bash to add or remove
           commands from the list of completed commands. Normally only
           porcelain commands and a few select others are completed. You
           can add more commands, separated by space, in this variable.
           Prefixing the command with <i>-</i> will remove it from the existing
           list.

       core.fileMode
           Tells Git if the executable bit of files in the working tree
           is to be honored.

           Some filesystems lose the executable bit when a file that is
           marked as executable is checked out, or checks out a
           non-executable file with executable bit on.  <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> or
           <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> probe the filesystem to see if it handles the
           executable bit correctly and this variable is automatically
           set as necessary.

           A repository, however, may be on a filesystem that handles
           the filemode correctly, and this variable is set to <i>true</i> when
           created, but later may be made accessible from another
           environment that loses the filemode (e.g. exporting ext4 via
           CIFS mount, visiting a Cygwin created repository with Git for
           Windows or Eclipse). In such a case it may be necessary to
           set this variable to <i>false</i>. See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.

           The default is true (when core.filemode is not specified in
           the config file).

       core.hideDotFiles
           (Windows-only) If true, mark newly-created directories and
           files whose name starts with a dot as hidden. If <i>dotGitOnly</i>,
           only the <b>.git/ </b>directory is hidden, but no other files
           starting with a dot. The default mode is <i>dotGitOnly</i>.

       core.ignoreCase
           Internal variable which enables various workarounds to enable
           Git to work better on filesystems that are not case
           sensitive, like APFS, HFS+, FAT, NTFS, etc. For example, if a
           directory listing finds "makefile" when Git expects
           "Makefile", Git will assume it is really the same file, and
           continue to remember it as "Makefile".

           The default is false, except <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> or <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> will
           probe and set core.ignoreCase true if appropriate when the
           repository is created.

           Git relies on the proper configuration of this variable for
           your operating and file system. Modifying this value may
           result in unexpected behavior.

       core.precomposeUnicode
           This option is only used by Mac OS implementation of Git.
           When core.precomposeUnicode=true, Git reverts the unicode
           decomposition of filenames done by Mac OS. This is useful
           when sharing a repository between Mac OS and Linux or
           Windows. (Git for Windows 1.7.10 or higher is needed, or Git
           under cygwin 1.7). When false, file names are handled fully
           transparent by Git, which is backward compatible with older
           versions of Git.

       core.protectHFS
           If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would be
           considered equivalent to <b>.git </b>on an HFS+ filesystem. Defaults
           to <b>true </b>on Mac OS, and <b>false </b>elsewhere.

       core.protectNTFS
           If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would
           cause problems with the NTFS filesystem, e.g. conflict with
           8.3 "short" names. Defaults to <b>true </b>on Windows, and <b>false</b>
           elsewhere.

       core.fsmonitor
           If set to true, enable the built-in file system monitor
           daemon for this working directory (<a href="git-fsmonitor--daemon.1.html">git-fsmonitor--daemon(1)</a>).

           Like hook-based file system monitors, the built-in file
           system monitor can speed up Git commands that need to refresh
           the Git index (e.g.  <b>git status</b>) in a working directory with
           many files. The built-in monitor eliminates the need to
           install and maintain an external third-party tool.

           The built-in file system monitor is currently available only
           on a limited set of supported platforms. Currently, this
           includes Windows and MacOS.

               Otherwise, this variable contains the pathname of the "fsmonitor"
               hook command.

           This hook command is used to identify all files that may have
           changed since the requested date/time. This information is
           used to speed up git by avoiding unnecessary scanning of
           files that have not changed.

           See the "fsmonitor-watchman" section of <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a>.

           Note that if you concurrently use multiple versions of Git,
           such as one version on the command line and another version
           in an IDE tool, that the definition of <b>core.fsmonitor </b>was
           extended to allow boolean values in addition to hook
           pathnames. Git versions 2.35.1 and prior will not understand
           the boolean values and will consider the "true" or "false"
           values as hook pathnames to be invoked. Git versions 2.26
           thru 2.35.1 default to hook protocol V2 and will fall back to
           no fsmonitor (full scan). Git versions prior to 2.26 default
           to hook protocol V1 and will silently assume there were no
           changes to report (no scan), so status commands may report
           incomplete results. For this reason, it is best to upgrade
           all of your Git versions before using the built-in file
           system monitor.

       core.fsmonitorHookVersion
           Sets the protocol version to be used when invoking the
           "fsmonitor" hook.

           There are currently versions 1 and 2. When this is not set,
           version 2 will be tried first and if it fails then version 1
           will be tried. Version 1 uses a timestamp as input to
           determine which files have changes since that time but some
           monitors like Watchman have race conditions when used with a
           timestamp. Version 2 uses an opaque string so that the
           monitor can return something that can be used to determine
           what files have changed without race conditions.

       core.trustctime
           If false, the ctime differences between the index and the
           working tree are ignored; useful when the inode change time
           is regularly modified by something outside Git (file system
           crawlers and some backup systems). See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.
           True by default.

       core.splitIndex
           If true, the split-index feature of the index will be used.
           See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>. False by default.

       core.untrackedCache
           Determines what to do about the untracked cache feature of
           the index. It will be kept, if this variable is unset or set
           to <b>keep</b>. It will automatically be added if set to <b>true</b>. And
           it will automatically be removed, if set to <b>false</b>. Before
           setting it to <b>true</b>, you should check that mtime is working
           properly on your system. See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.  <b>keep </b>by
           default, unless <b>feature.manyFiles </b>is enabled which sets this
           setting to <b>true </b>by default.

       core.checkStat
           When missing or is set to <b>default</b>, many fields in the stat
           structure are checked to detect if a file has been modified
           since Git looked at it. When this configuration variable is
           set to <b>minimal</b>, sub-second part of mtime and ctime, the uid
           and gid of the owner of the file, the inode number (and the
           device number, if Git was compiled to use it), are excluded
           from the check among these fields, leaving only the
           whole-second part of mtime (and ctime, if <b>core.trustCtime </b>is
           set) and the filesize to be checked.

           There are implementations of Git that do not leave usable
           values in some fields (e.g. JGit); by excluding these fields
           from the comparison, the <b>minimal </b>mode may help
           interoperability when the same repository is used by these
           other systems at the same time.

       core.quotePath
           Commands that output paths (e.g.  <i>ls-files</i>, <i>diff</i>), will quote
           "unusual" characters in the pathname by enclosing the
           pathname in double-quotes and escaping those characters with
           backslashes in the same way C escapes control characters
           (e.g.  <b>\t </b>for TAB, <b>\n </b>for LF, <b>\\ </b>for backslash) or bytes with
           values larger than 0x80 (e.g. octal <b>\302\265 </b>for "micro" in
           UTF-8). If this variable is set to false, bytes higher than
           0x80 are not considered "unusual" any more. Double-quotes,
           backslash and control characters are always escaped
           regardless of the setting of this variable. A simple space
           character is not considered "unusual". Many commands can
           output pathnames completely verbatim using the <b>-z </b>option. The
           default value is true.

       core.eol
           Sets the line ending type to use in the working directory for
           files that are marked as text (either by having the <b>text</b>
           attribute set, or by having <b>text=auto </b>and Git auto-detecting
           the contents as text). Alternatives are <i>lf</i>, <i>crlf</i> and <i>native</i>,
           which uses the platform’s native line ending. The default
           value is <b>native</b>. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for more information on
           end-of-line conversion. Note that this value is ignored if
           <b>core.autocrlf </b>is set to <b>true </b>or <b>input</b>.

       core.safecrlf
           If true, makes Git check if converting <b>CRLF </b>is reversible
           when end-of-line conversion is active. Git will verify if a
           command modifies a file in the work tree either directly or
           indirectly. For example, committing a file followed by
           checking out the same file should yield the original file in
           the work tree. If this is not the case for the current
           setting of <b>core.autocrlf</b>, Git will reject the file. The
           variable can be set to "warn", in which case Git will only
           warn about an irreversible conversion but continue the
           operation.

           CRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting data.
           When it is enabled, Git will convert CRLF to LF during commit
           and LF to CRLF during checkout. A file that contains a
           mixture of LF and CRLF before the commit cannot be recreated
           by Git. For text files this is the right thing to do: it
           corrects line endings such that we have only LF line endings
           in the repository. But for binary files that are accidentally
           classified as text the conversion can corrupt data.

           If you recognize such corruption early you can easily fix it
           by setting the conversion type explicitly in .gitattributes.
           Right after committing you still have the original file in
           your work tree and this file is not yet corrupted. You can
           explicitly tell Git that this file is binary and Git will
           handle the file appropriately.

           Unfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text files
           with mixed line endings and the undesired effect of
           corrupting binary files cannot be distinguished. In both
           cases CRLFs are removed in an irreversible way. For text
           files this is the right thing to do because CRLFs are line
           endings, while for binary files converting CRLFs corrupts
           data.

           Note, this safety check does not mean that a checkout will
           generate a file identical to the original file for a
           different setting of <b>core.eol </b>and <b>core.autocrlf</b>, but only for
           the current one. For example, a text file with <b>LF </b>would be
           accepted with <b>core.eol=lf </b>and could later be checked out with
           <b>core.eol=crlf</b>, in which case the resulting file would contain
           <b>CRLF</b>, although the original file contained <b>LF</b>. However, in
           both work trees the line endings would be consistent, that is
           either all <b>LF </b>or all <b>CRLF</b>, but never mixed. A file with mixed
           line endings would be reported by the <b>core.safecrlf</b>
           mechanism.

       core.autocrlf
           Setting this variable to "true" is the same as setting the
           <b>text </b>attribute to "auto" on all files and core.eol to "crlf".
           Set to true if you want to have <b>CRLF </b>line endings in your
           working directory and the repository has LF line endings.
           This variable can be set to <i>input</i>, in which case no output
           conversion is performed.

       core.checkRoundtripEncoding
           A comma and/or whitespace separated list of encodings that
           Git performs UTF-8 round trip checks on if they are used in
           an <b>working-tree-encoding </b>attribute (see <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>).
           The default value is <b>SHIFT-JIS</b>.

       core.symlinks
           If false, symbolic links are checked out as small plain files
           that contain the link text.  <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a> and
           <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a> will not change the recorded type to regular file.
           Useful on filesystems like FAT that do not support symbolic
           links.

           The default is true, except <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> or <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> will
           probe and set core.symlinks false if appropriate when the
           repository is created.

       core.gitProxy
           A "proxy command" to execute (as <i>command host port</i>) instead
           of establishing direct connection to the remote server when
           using the Git protocol for fetching. If the variable value is
           in the "COMMAND for DOMAIN" format, the command is applied
           only on hostnames ending with the specified domain string.
           This variable may be set multiple times and is matched in the
           given order; the first match wins.

           Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_PROXY_COMMAND </b>environment
           variable (which always applies universally, without the
           special "for" handling).

           The special string <b>none </b>can be used as the proxy command to
           specify that no proxy be used for a given domain pattern.
           This is useful for excluding servers inside a firewall from
           proxy use, while defaulting to a common proxy for external
           domains.

       core.sshCommand
           If this variable is set, <b>git fetch </b>and <b>git push </b>will use the
           specified command instead of <b>ssh </b>when they need to connect to
           a remote system. The command is in the same form as the
           <b>GIT_SSH_COMMAND </b>environment variable and is overridden when
           the environment variable is set.

       core.ignoreStat
           If true, Git will avoid using lstat() calls to detect if
           files have changed by setting the "assume-unchanged" bit for
           those tracked files which it has updated identically in both
           the index and working tree.

           When files are modified outside of Git, the user will need to
           stage the modified files explicitly (e.g. see <i>Examples</i>
           section in <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>). Git will not normally detect
           changes to those files.

           This is useful on systems where lstat() calls are very slow,
           such as CIFS/Microsoft Windows.

           False by default.

       core.preferSymlinkRefs
           Instead of the default "symref" format for HEAD and other
           symbolic reference files, use symbolic links. This is
           sometimes needed to work with old scripts that expect HEAD to
           be a symbolic link.

       core.alternateRefsCommand
           When advertising tips of available history from an alternate,
           use the shell to execute the specified command instead of
           <a href="git-for-each-ref.1.html">git-for-each-ref(1)</a>. The first argument is the absolute path
           of the alternate. Output must contain one hex object id per
           line (i.e., the same as produced by <b>git for-each-ref</b>
           <b>--format='%(objectname)'</b>).

           Note that you cannot generally put <b>git for-each-ref </b>directly
           into the config value, as it does not take a repository path
           as an argument (but you can wrap the command above in a shell
           script).

       core.alternateRefsPrefixes
           When listing references from an alternate, list only
           references that begin with the given prefix. Prefixes match
           as if they were given as arguments to <a href="git-for-each-ref.1.html">git-for-each-ref(1)</a>. To
           list multiple prefixes, separate them with whitespace. If
           <b>core.alternateRefsCommand </b>is set, setting
           <b>core.alternateRefsPrefixes </b>has no effect.

       core.bare
           If true this repository is assumed to be <i>bare</i> and has no
           working directory associated with it. If this is the case a
           number of commands that require a working directory will be
           disabled, such as <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a> or <a href="git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a>.

           This setting is automatically guessed by <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> or
           <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> when the repository was created. By default a
           repository that ends in "/.git" is assumed to be not bare
           (bare = false), while all other repositories are assumed to
           be bare (bare = true).

       core.worktree
           Set the path to the root of the working tree. If
           <b>GIT_COMMON_DIR </b>environment variable is set, core.worktree is
           ignored and not used for determining the root of working
           tree. This can be overridden by the <b>GIT_WORK_TREE </b>environment
           variable and the <b>--work-tree </b>command-line option. The value
           can be an absolute path or relative to the path to the .git
           directory, which is either specified by --git-dir or GIT_DIR,
           or automatically discovered. If --git-dir or GIT_DIR is
           specified but none of --work-tree, GIT_WORK_TREE and
           core.worktree is specified, the current working directory is
           regarded as the top level of your working tree.

           Note that this variable is honored even when set in a
           configuration file in a ".git" subdirectory of a directory
           and its value differs from the latter directory (e.g.
           "/path/to/.git/config" has core.worktree set to
           "/different/path"), which is most likely a misconfiguration.
           Running Git commands in the "/path/to" directory will still
           use "/different/path" as the root of the work tree and can
           cause confusion unless you know what you are doing (e.g. you
           are creating a read-only snapshot of the same index to a
           location different from the repository’s usual working tree).

       core.logAllRefUpdates
           Enable the reflog. Updates to a ref &lt;ref&gt; is logged to the
           file "<b>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;</b>", by appending the new and old
           SHA-1, the date/time and the reason of the update, but only
           when the file exists. If this configuration variable is set
           to <b>true</b>, missing "<b>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;</b>" file is automatically
           created for branch heads (i.e. under <b>refs/heads/</b>), remote
           refs (i.e. under <b>refs/remotes/</b>), note refs (i.e. under
           <b>refs/notes/</b>), and the symbolic ref <b>HEAD</b>. If it is set to
           <b>always</b>, then a missing reflog is automatically created for
           any ref under <b>refs/</b>.

           This information can be used to determine what commit was the
           tip of a branch "2 days ago".

           This value is true by default in a repository that has a
           working directory associated with it, and false by default in
           a bare repository.

       core.repositoryFormatVersion
           Internal variable identifying the repository format and
           layout version.

       core.sharedRepository
           When <i>group</i> (or <i>true</i>), the repository is made shareable
           between several users in a group (making sure all the files
           and objects are group-writable). When <i>all</i> (or <i>world</i> or
           <i>everybody</i>), the repository will be readable by all users,
           additionally to being group-shareable. When <i>umask</i> (or <i>false</i>),
           Git will use permissions reported by umask(2). When <i>0xxx</i>,
           where <i>0xxx</i> is an octal number, files in the repository will
           have this mode value.  <i>0xxx</i> will override user’s umask value
           (whereas the other options will only override requested parts
           of the user’s umask value). Examples: <i>0660</i> will make the repo
           read/write-able for the owner and group, but inaccessible to
           others (equivalent to <i>group</i> unless umask is e.g.  <i>0022</i>).
           <i>0640</i> is a repository that is group-readable but not
           group-writable. See <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a>. False by default.

       core.warnAmbiguousRefs
           If true, Git will warn you if the ref name you passed it is
           ambiguous and might match multiple refs in the repository.
           True by default.

       core.compression
           An integer -1..9, indicating a default compression level. -1
           is the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9 are
           various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If set, this
           provides a default to other compression variables, such as
           <b>core.looseCompression </b>and <b>pack.compression</b>.

       core.looseCompression
           An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for
           objects that are not in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default.
           0 means no compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size
           tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If not set, defaults to
           core.compression. If that is not set, defaults to 1 (best
           speed).

       core.packedGitWindowSize
           Number of bytes of a pack file to map into memory in a single
           mapping operation. Larger window sizes may allow your system
           to process a smaller number of large pack files more quickly.
           Smaller window sizes will negatively affect performance due
           to increased calls to the operating system’s memory manager,
           but may improve performance when accessing a large number of
           large pack files.

           Default is 1 MiB if NO_MMAP was set at compile time,
           otherwise 32 MiB on 32 bit platforms and 1 GiB on 64 bit
           platforms. This should be reasonable for all users/operating
           systems. You probably do not need to adjust this value.

           Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

       core.packedGitLimit
           Maximum number of bytes to map simultaneously into memory
           from pack files. If Git needs to access more than this many
           bytes at once to complete an operation it will unmap existing
           regions to reclaim virtual address space within the process.

           Default is 256 MiB on 32 bit platforms and 32 TiB
           (effectively unlimited) on 64 bit platforms. This should be
           reasonable for all users/operating systems, except on the
           largest projects. You probably do not need to adjust this
           value.

           Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

       core.deltaBaseCacheLimit
           Maximum number of bytes per thread to reserve for caching
           base objects that may be referenced by multiple deltified
           objects. By storing the entire decompressed base objects in a
           cache Git is able to avoid unpacking and decompressing
           frequently used base objects multiple times.

           Default is 96 MiB on all platforms. This should be reasonable
           for all users/operating systems, except on the largest
           projects. You probably do not need to adjust this value.

           Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

       core.bigFileThreshold
           The size of files considered "big", which as discussed below
           changes the behavior of numerous git commands, as well as how
           such files are stored within the repository. The default is
           512 MiB. Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

           Files above the configured limit will be:

           •   Stored deflated in packfiles, without attempting delta
               compression.

               The default limit is primarily set with this use-case in
               mind. With it, most projects will have their source code
               and other text files delta compressed, but not larger
               binary media files.

               Storing large files without delta compression avoids
               excessive memory usage, at the slight expense of
               increased disk usage.

           •   Will be treated as if they were labeled "binary" (see
               <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>). e.g.  <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> and <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> will
               not compute diffs for files above this limit.

           •   Will generally be streamed when written, which avoids
               excessive memory usage, at the cost of some fixed
               overhead. Commands that make use of this include
               <a href="git-archive.1.html">git-archive(1)</a>, <a href="git-fast-import.1.html">git-fast-import(1)</a>, <a href="git-index-pack.1.html">git-index-pack(1)</a>,
               <a href="git-unpack-objects.1.html">git-unpack-objects(1)</a> and <a href="git-fsck.1.html">git-fsck(1)</a>.

       core.excludesFile
           Specifies the pathname to the file that contains patterns to
           describe paths that are not meant to be tracked, in addition
           to <b>.gitignore </b>(per-directory) and <b>.git/info/exclude</b>. Defaults
           to <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore</b>. If <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME </b>is either
           not set or empty, <b>$HOME/.config/git/ignore </b>is used instead.
           See <a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore(5)</a>.

       core.askPass
           Some commands (e.g. svn and http interfaces) that
           interactively ask for a password can be told to use an
           external program given via the value of this variable. Can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_ASKPASS </b>environment variable. If not
           set, fall back to the value of the <b>SSH_ASKPASS </b>environment
           variable or, failing that, a simple password prompt. The
           external program shall be given a suitable prompt as
           command-line argument and write the password on its STDOUT.

       core.attributesFile
           In addition to <b>.gitattributes </b>(per-directory) and
           <b>.git/info/attributes</b>, Git looks into this file for attributes
           (see <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>). Path expansions are made the same way
           as for <b>core.excludesFile</b>. Its default value is
           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/attributes</b>. If <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME </b>is
           either not set or empty, <b>$HOME/.config/git/attributes </b>is used
           instead.

       core.hooksPath
           By default Git will look for your hooks in the <b>$GIT_DIR/hooks</b>
           directory. Set this to different path, e.g.  <b>/etc/git/hooks</b>,
           and Git will try to find your hooks in that directory, e.g.
           <b>/etc/git/hooks/pre-receive </b>instead of in
           <b>$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive</b>.

           The path can be either absolute or relative. A relative path
           is taken as relative to the directory where the hooks are run
           (see the "DESCRIPTION" section of <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a>).

           This configuration variable is useful in cases where you’d
           like to centrally configure your Git hooks instead of
           configuring them on a per-repository basis, or as a more
           flexible and centralized alternative to having an
           <b>init.templateDir </b>where you’ve changed default hooks.

       core.editor
           Commands such as <b>commit </b>and <b>tag </b>that let you edit messages by
           launching an editor use the value of this variable when it is
           set, and the environment variable <b>GIT_EDITOR </b>is not set. See
           <a href="git-var.1.html">git-var(1)</a>.

       core.commentChar, core.commentString
           Commands such as <b>commit </b>and <b>tag </b>that let you edit messages
           consider a line that begins with this character commented,
           and removes them after the editor returns (default <i>#</i>).

           If set to "auto", <b>git-commit </b>would select a character that is
           not the beginning character of any line in existing commit
           messages.

           Note that these two variables are aliases of each other, and
           in modern versions of Git you are free to use a string (e.g.,
           <b>// </b>or <b>⁑⁕⁑</b>) with <b>commentChar</b>. Versions of Git prior to v2.45.0
           will ignore <b>commentString </b>but will reject a value of
           <b>commentChar </b>that consists of more than a single ASCII byte.
           If you plan to use your config with older and newer versions
           of Git, you may want to specify both:

               [core]
               # single character for older versions
               commentChar = "#"
               # string for newer versions (which will override commentChar
               # because it comes later in the file)
               commentString = "//"

       core.filesRefLockTimeout
           The length of time, in milliseconds, to retry when trying to
           lock an individual reference. Value 0 means not to retry at
           all; -1 means to try indefinitely. Default is 100 (i.e.,
           retry for 100ms).

       core.packedRefsTimeout
           The length of time, in milliseconds, to retry when trying to
           lock the <b>packed-refs </b>file. Value 0 means not to retry at all;
           -1 means to try indefinitely. Default is 1000 (i.e., retry
           for 1 second).

       core.pager
           Text viewer for use by Git commands (e.g., <i>less</i>). The value
           is meant to be interpreted by the shell. The order of
           preference is the <b>$GIT_PAGER </b>environment variable, then
           <b>core.pager </b>configuration, then <b>$PAGER</b>, and then the default
           chosen at compile time (usually <i>less</i>).

           When the <b>LESS </b>environment variable is unset, Git sets it to
           <b>FRX </b>(if <b>LESS </b>environment variable is set, Git does not change
           it at all). If you want to selectively override Git’s default
           setting for <b>LESS</b>, you can set <b>core.pager </b>to e.g.  <b>less -S</b>.
           This will be passed to the shell by Git, which will translate
           the final command to <b>LESS=FRX less -S</b>. The environment does
           not set the <b>S </b>option but the command line does, instructing
           less to truncate long lines. Similarly, setting <b>core.pager </b>to
           <b>less -+F </b>will deactivate the <b>F </b>option specified by the
           environment from the command-line, deactivating the "quit if
           one screen" behavior of <b>less</b>. One can specifically activate
           some flags for particular commands: for example, setting
           <b>pager.blame </b>to <b>less -S </b>enables line truncation only for <b>git</b>
           <b>blame</b>.

           Likewise, when the <b>LV </b>environment variable is unset, Git sets
           it to <b>-c</b>. You can override this setting by exporting <b>LV </b>with
           another value or setting <b>core.pager </b>to <b>lv +c</b>.

       core.whitespace
           A comma separated list of common whitespace problems to
           notice.  <i>git diff</i> will use <b>color.diff.whitespace </b>to highlight
           them, and <i>git apply --whitespace=error</i> will consider them as
           errors. You can prefix <b>- </b>to disable any of them (e.g.
           <b>-trailing-space</b>):

           •   <b>blank-at-eol </b>treats trailing whitespaces at the end of
               the line as an error (enabled by default).

           •   <b>space-before-tab </b>treats a space character that appears
               immediately before a tab character in the initial indent
               part of the line as an error (enabled by default).

           •   <b>indent-with-non-tab </b>treats a line that is indented with
               space characters instead of the equivalent tabs as an
               error (not enabled by default).

           •   <b>tab-in-indent </b>treats a tab character in the initial
               indent part of the line as an error (not enabled by
               default).

           •   <b>blank-at-eof </b>treats blank lines added at the end of file
               as an error (enabled by default).

           •   <b>trailing-space </b>is a short-hand to cover both <b>blank-at-eol</b>
               and <b>blank-at-eof</b>.

           •   <b>cr-at-eol </b>treats a carriage-return at the end of line as
               part of the line terminator, i.e. with it, <b>trailing-space</b>
               does not trigger if the character before such a
               carriage-return is not a whitespace (not enabled by
               default).

           •   <b>tabwidth=&lt;n&gt; </b>tells how many character positions a tab
               occupies; this is relevant for <b>indent-with-non-tab </b>and
               when Git fixes <b>tab-in-indent </b>errors. The default tab
               width is 8. Allowed values are 1 to 63.

       core.fsync
           A comma-separated list of components of the repository that
           should be hardened via the core.fsyncMethod when created or
           modified. You can disable hardening of any component by
           prefixing it with a <i>-</i>. Items that are not hardened may be
           lost in the event of an unclean system shutdown. Unless you
           have special requirements, it is recommended that you leave
           this option empty or pick one of <b>committed</b>, <b>added</b>, or <b>all</b>.

           When this configuration is encountered, the set of components
           starts with the platform default value, disabled components
           are removed, and additional components are added.  <b>none</b>
           resets the state so that the platform default is ignored.

           The empty string resets the fsync configuration to the
           platform default. The default on most platforms is equivalent
           to <b>core.fsync=committed,-loose-object</b>, which has good
           performance, but risks losing recent work in the event of an
           unclean system shutdown.

           •   <b>none </b>clears the set of fsynced components.

           •   <b>loose-object </b>hardens objects added to the repo in
               loose-object form.

           •   <b>pack </b>hardens objects added to the repo in packfile form.

           •   <b>pack-metadata </b>hardens packfile bitmaps and indexes.

           •   <b>commit-graph </b>hardens the commit-graph file.

           •   <b>index </b>hardens the index when it is modified.

           •   <b>objects </b>is an aggregate option that is equivalent to
               <b>loose-object,pack</b>.

           •   <b>reference </b>hardens references modified in the repo.

           •   <b>derived-metadata </b>is an aggregate option that is
               equivalent to <b>pack-metadata,commit-graph</b>.

           •   <b>committed </b>is an aggregate option that is currently
               equivalent to <b>objects</b>. This mode sacrifices some
               performance to ensure that work that is committed to the
               repository with <b>git commit </b>or similar commands is
               hardened.

           •   <b>added </b>is an aggregate option that is currently equivalent
               to <b>committed,index</b>. This mode sacrifices additional
               performance to ensure that the results of commands like
               <b>git add </b>and similar operations are hardened.

           •   <b>all </b>is an aggregate option that syncs all individual
               components above.

       core.fsyncMethod
           A value indicating the strategy Git will use to harden
           repository data using fsync and related primitives.

           •   <b>fsync </b>uses the fsync() system call or platform
               equivalents.

           •   <b>writeout-only </b>issues pagecache writeback requests, but
               depending on the filesystem and storage hardware, data
               added to the repository may not be durable in the event
               of a system crash. This is the default mode on macOS.

           •   <b>batch </b>enables a mode that uses writeout-only flushes to
               stage multiple updates in the disk writeback cache and
               then does a single full fsync of a dummy file to trigger
               the disk cache flush at the end of the operation.

               Currently <b>batch </b>mode only applies to loose-object files.
               Other repository data is made durable as if <b>fsync </b>was
               specified. This mode is expected to be as safe as <b>fsync</b>
               on macOS for repos stored on HFS+ or APFS filesystems and
               on Windows for repos stored on NTFS or ReFS filesystems.

       core.fsyncObjectFiles
           This boolean will enable <i>fsync()</i> when writing object files.
           This setting is deprecated. Use core.fsync instead.

           This setting affects data added to the Git repository in
           loose-object form. When set to true, Git will issue an fsync
           or similar system call to flush caches so that loose-objects
           remain consistent in the face of a unclean system shutdown.

       core.preloadIndex
           Enable parallel index preload for operations like <i>git diff</i>

           This can speed up operations like <i>git diff</i> and <i>git status</i>
           especially on filesystems like NFS that have weak caching
           semantics and thus relatively high IO latencies. When
           enabled, Git will do the index comparison to the filesystem
           data in parallel, allowing overlapping IO’s. Defaults to
           true.

       core.unsetenvvars
           Windows-only: comma-separated list of environment variables'
           names that need to be unset before spawning any other
           process. Defaults to <b>PERL5LIB </b>to account for the fact that
           Git for Windows insists on using its own Perl interpreter.

       core.restrictinheritedhandles
           Windows-only: override whether spawned processes inherit only
           standard file handles (<b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout </b>and <b>stderr</b>) or all
           handles. Can be <b>auto</b>, <b>true </b>or <b>false</b>. Defaults to <b>auto</b>, which
           means <b>true </b>on Windows 7 and later, and <b>false </b>on older Windows
           versions.

       core.createObject
           You can set this to <i>link</i>, in which case a hardlink followed
           by a delete of the source are used to make sure that object
           creation will not overwrite existing objects.

           On some file system/operating system combinations, this is
           unreliable. Set this config setting to <i>rename</i> there; however,
           this will remove the check that makes sure that existing
           object files will not get overwritten.

       core.notesRef
           When showing commit messages, also show notes which are
           stored in the given ref. The ref must be fully qualified. If
           the given ref does not exist, it is not an error but means
           that no notes should be printed.

           This setting defaults to "refs/notes/commits", and it can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_NOTES_REF </b>environment variable. See
           <a href="git-notes.1.html">git-notes(1)</a>.

       core.commitGraph
           If true, then git will read the commit-graph file (if it
           exists) to parse the graph structure of commits. Defaults to
           true. See <a href="git-commit-graph.1.html">git-commit-graph(1)</a> for more information.

       core.useReplaceRefs
           If set to <b>false</b>, behave as if the <b>--no-replace-objects </b>option
           was given on the command line. See <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> and <a href="git-replace.1.html">git-replace(1)</a>
           for more information.

       core.multiPackIndex
           Use the multi-pack-index file to track multiple packfiles
           using a single index. See <a href="git-multi-pack-index.1.html">git-multi-pack-index(1)</a> for more
           information. Defaults to true.

       core.sparseCheckout
           Enable "sparse checkout" feature. See <a href="git-sparse-checkout.1.html">git-sparse-checkout(1)</a>
           for more information.

       core.sparseCheckoutCone
           Enables the "cone mode" of the sparse checkout feature. When
           the sparse-checkout file contains a limited set of patterns,
           this mode provides significant performance advantages. The
           "non-cone mode" can be requested to allow specifying more
           flexible patterns by setting this variable to <i>false</i>. See
           <a href="git-sparse-checkout.1.html">git-sparse-checkout(1)</a> for more information.

       core.abbrev
           Set the length object names are abbreviated to. If
           unspecified or set to "auto", an appropriate value is
           computed based on the approximate number of packed objects in
           your repository, which hopefully is enough for abbreviated
           object names to stay unique for some time. If set to "no", no
           abbreviation is made and the object names are shown in their
           full length. The minimum length is 4.

       core.maxTreeDepth
           The maximum depth Git is willing to recurse while traversing
           a tree (e.g., "a/b/cde/f" has a depth of 4). This is a
           fail-safe to allow Git to abort cleanly, and should not
           generally need to be adjusted. The default is 4096.

       credential.helper
           Specify an external helper to be called when a username or
           password credential is needed; the helper may consult
           external storage to avoid prompting the user for the
           credentials. This is normally the name of a credential helper
           with possible arguments, but may also be an absolute path
           with arguments or, if preceded by <b>!</b>, shell commands.

           Note that multiple helpers may be defined. See
           <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> for details and examples.

       credential.useHttpPath
           When acquiring credentials, consider the "path" component of
           an http or https URL to be important. Defaults to false. See
           <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> for more information.

       credential.username
           If no username is set for a network authentication, use this
           username by default. See credential.&lt;context&gt;.* below, and
           <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a>.

       credential.&lt;url&gt;.*
           Any of the credential.* options above can be applied
           selectively to some credentials. For example,
           "credential.https://example.com.username" would set the
           default username only for https connections to example.com.
           See <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> for details on how URLs are matched.

       credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP
           Tell git-credential-cache—daemon to ignore SIGHUP, instead of
           quitting.

       credentialStore.lockTimeoutMS
           The length of time, in milliseconds, for git-credential-store
           to retry when trying to lock the credentials file. A value of
           0 means not to retry at all; -1 means to try indefinitely.
           Default is 1000 (i.e., retry for 1s).

       diff.autoRefreshIndex
           When using <i>git diff</i> to compare with work tree files, do not
           consider stat-only changes as changed. Instead, silently run
           <b>git update-index --refresh </b>to update the cached stat
           information for paths whose contents in the work tree match
           the contents in the index. This option defaults to true. Note
           that this affects only <i>git diff</i> Porcelain, and not lower
           level <i>diff</i> commands such as <i>git diff-files</i>.

       diff.dirstat
           A comma separated list of <b>--dirstat </b>parameters specifying the
           default behavior of the <b>--dirstat </b>option to <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> and
           friends. The defaults can be overridden on the command line
           (using <b>--dirstat=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;</b>). The fallback defaults
           (when not changed by <b>diff.dirstat</b>) are
           <b>changes,noncumulative,3</b>. The following parameters are
           available:

           <b>changes</b>
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that
               have been removed from the source, or added to the
               destination. This ignores the amount of pure code
               movements within a file. In other words, rearranging
               lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes.
               This is the default behavior when no parameter is given.

           <b>lines</b>
               Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular
               line-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added
               line counts. (For binary files, count 64-byte chunks
               instead, since binary files have no natural concept of
               lines). This is a more expensive <b>--dirstat </b>behavior than
               the <b>changes </b>behavior, but it does count rearranged lines
               within a file as much as other changes. The resulting
               output is consistent with what you get from the other
               <b>--*stat </b>options.

           <b>files</b>
               Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of
               files changed. Each changed file counts equally in the
               dirstat analysis. This is the computationally cheapest
               <b>--dirstat </b>behavior, since it does not have to look at the
               file contents at all.

           <b>cumulative</b>
               Count changes in a child directory for the parent
               directory as well. Note that when using <b>cumulative</b>, the
               sum of the percentages reported may exceed 100%. The
               default (non-cumulative) behavior can be specified with
               the <b>noncumulative </b>parameter.

           &lt;limit&gt;
               An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
               default). Directories contributing less than this
               percentage of the changes are not shown in the output.

           Example: The following will count changed files, while
           ignoring directories with less than 10% of the total amount
           of changed files, and accumulating child directory counts in
           the parent directories: <b>files,10,cumulative</b>.

       diff.statNameWidth
           Limit the width of the filename part in --stat output. If
           set, applies to all commands generating --stat output except
           format-patch.

       diff.statGraphWidth
           Limit the width of the graph part in --stat output. If set,
           applies to all commands generating --stat output except
           format-patch.

       diff.context
           Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of the
           default of 3. This value is overridden by the -U option.

       diff.interHunkContext
           Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified
           number of lines, thereby fusing the hunks that are close to
           each other. This value serves as the default for the
           <b>--inter-hunk-context </b>command line option.

       diff.external
           If this config variable is set, diff generation is not
           performed using the internal diff machinery, but using the
           given command. Can be overridden with the ‘GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF’
           environment variable. The command is called with parameters
           as described under "git Diffs" in <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>. Note: if you want
           to use an external diff program only on a subset of your
           files, you might want to use <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> instead.

       diff.ignoreSubmodules
           Sets the default value of --ignore-submodules. Note that this
           affects only <i>git diff</i> Porcelain, and not lower level <i>diff</i>
           commands such as <i>git diff-files</i>.  <i>git checkout</i> and <i>git switch</i>
           also honor this setting when reporting uncommitted changes.
           Setting it to <i>all</i> disables the submodule summary normally
           shown by <i>git commit</i> and <i>git status</i> when
           <b>status.submoduleSummary </b>is set unless it is overridden by
           using the --ignore-submodules command-line option. The <i>git</i>
           <i>submodule</i> commands are not affected by this setting. By
           default this is set to untracked so that any untracked
           submodules are ignored.

       diff.mnemonicPrefix
           If set, <i>git diff</i> uses a prefix pair that is different from
           the standard "a/" and "b/" depending on what is being
           compared. When this configuration is in effect, reverse diff
           output also swaps the order of the prefixes:

           <b>git diff</b>
               compares the (i)ndex and the (w)ork tree;

           <b>git diff HEAD</b>
               compares a (c)ommit and the (w)ork tree;

           <b>git diff --cached</b>
               compares a (c)ommit and the (i)ndex;

           <b>git diff HEAD:file1 file2</b>
               compares an (o)bject and a (w)ork tree entity;

           <b>git diff --no-index a b</b>
               compares two non-git things (1) and (2).

       diff.noPrefix
           If set, <i>git diff</i> does not show any source or destination
           prefix.

       diff.srcPrefix
           If set, <i>git diff</i> uses this source prefix. Defaults to "a/".

       diff.dstPrefix
           If set, <i>git diff</i> uses this destination prefix. Defaults to
           "b/".

       diff.relative
           If set to <i>true</i>, <i>git diff</i> does not show changes outside of the
           directory and show pathnames relative to the current
           directory.

       diff.orderFile
           File indicating how to order files within a diff. See the <i>-O</i>
           option to <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> for details. If <b>diff.orderFile </b>is a
           relative pathname, it is treated as relative to the top of
           the working tree.

       diff.renameLimit
           The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of
           copy/rename detection; equivalent to the <i>git diff</i> option <b>-l</b>.
           If not set, the default value is currently 1000. This setting
           has no effect if rename detection is turned off.

       diff.renames
           Whether and how Git detects renames. If set to "false",
           rename detection is disabled. If set to "true", basic rename
           detection is enabled. If set to "copies" or "copy", Git will
           detect copies, as well. Defaults to true. Note that this
           affects only <i>git diff</i> Porcelain like <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> and
           <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, and not lower level commands such as
           <a href="git-diff-files.1.html">git-diff-files(1)</a>.

       diff.suppressBlankEmpty
           A boolean to inhibit the standard behavior of printing a
           space before each empty output line. Defaults to false.

       diff.submodule
           Specify the format in which differences in submodules are
           shown. The "short" format just shows the names of the commits
           at the beginning and end of the range. The "log" format lists
           the commits in the range like <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a> <b>summary </b>does.
           The "diff" format shows an inline diff of the changed
           contents of the submodule. Defaults to "short".

       diff.wordRegex
           A POSIX Extended Regular Expression used to determine what is
           a "word" when performing word-by-word difference
           calculations. Character sequences that match the regular
           expression are "words", all other characters are <b>ignorable</b>
           whitespace.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.command
           The custom diff driver command. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for
           details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.xfuncname
           The regular expression that the diff driver should use to
           recognize the hunk header. A built-in pattern may also be
           used. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.binary
           Set this option to true to make the diff driver treat files
           as binary. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.textconv
           The command that the diff driver should call to generate the
           text-converted version of a file. The result of the
           conversion is used to generate a human-readable diff. See
           <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.wordRegex
           The regular expression that the diff driver should use to
           split words in a line. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.&lt;driver&gt;.cachetextconv
           Set this option to true to make the diff driver cache the
           text conversion outputs. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       diff.indentHeuristic
           Set this option to <b>false </b>to disable the default heuristics
           that shift diff hunk boundaries to make patches easier to
           read.

       diff.algorithm
           Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:

           <b>default</b>, <b>myers</b>
               The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
               default.

           <b>minimal</b>
               Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff
               is produced.

           <b>patience</b>
               Use "patience diff" algorithm when generating patches.

           <b>histogram</b>
               This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to "support
               low-occurrence common elements".

       diff.wsErrorHighlight
           Highlight whitespace errors in the <b>context</b>, <b>old </b>or <b>new </b>lines
           of the diff. Multiple values are separated by comma, <b>none</b>
           resets previous values, <b>default </b>reset the list to <b>new </b>and <b>all</b>
           is a shorthand for <b>old,new,context</b>. The whitespace errors are
           colored with <b>color.diff.whitespace</b>. The command line option
           <b>--ws-error-highlight=&lt;kind&gt; </b>overrides this setting.

       diff.colorMoved
           If set to either a valid <b>&lt;mode&gt; </b>or a true value, moved lines
           in a diff are colored differently, for details of valid modes
           see <i>--color-moved</i> in <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>. If simply set to true the
           default color mode will be used. When set to false, moved
           lines are not colored.

       diff.colorMovedWS
           When moved lines are colored using e.g. the <b>diff.colorMoved</b>
           setting, this option controls the <b>&lt;mode&gt; </b>how spaces are
           treated. For details of valid modes see <i>--color-moved-ws</i> in
           <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a>.

       diff.tool
           Controls which diff tool is used by <a href="git-difftool.1.html">git-difftool(1)</a>. This
           variable overrides the value configured in <b>merge.tool</b>. The
           list below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value
           is treated as a custom diff tool and requires that a
           corresponding difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.

       diff.guitool
           Controls which diff tool is used by <a href="git-difftool.1.html">git-difftool(1)</a> when the
           -g/--gui flag is specified. This variable overrides the value
           configured in <b>merge.guitool</b>. The list below shows the valid
           built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom diff
           tool and requires that a corresponding difftool.&lt;guitool&gt;.cmd
           variable is defined.

       difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
           variables available: <i>LOCAL</i> is set to the name of the
           temporary file containing the contents of the diff pre-image
           and <i>REMOTE</i> is set to the name of the temporary file
           containing the contents of the diff post-image.

           See the <b>--tool=&lt;tool&gt; </b>option in <a href="git-difftool.1.html">git-difftool(1)</a> for more
           details.

       difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.path
           Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case
           your tool is not in the PATH.

       difftool.trustExitCode
           Exit difftool if the invoked diff tool returns a non-zero
           exit status.

           See the <b>--trust-exit-code </b>option in <a href="git-difftool.1.html">git-difftool(1)</a> for more
           details.

       difftool.prompt
           Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool.

       difftool.guiDefault
           Set <b>true </b>to use the <b>diff.guitool </b>by default (equivalent to
           specifying the <b>--gui </b>argument), or <b>auto </b>to select
           <b>diff.guitool </b>or <b>diff.tool </b>depending on the presence of a
           <b>DISPLAY </b>environment variable value. The default is <b>false</b>,
           where the <b>--gui </b>argument must be provided explicitly for the
           <b>diff.guitool </b>to be used.

       extensions.objectFormat
           Specify the hash algorithm to use. The acceptable values are
           <b>sha1 </b>and <b>sha256</b>. If not specified, <b>sha1 </b>is assumed. It is an
           error to specify this key unless <b>core.repositoryFormatVersion</b>
           is 1.

           Note that this setting should only be set by <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> or
           <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>. Trying to change it after initialization will
           not work and will produce hard-to-diagnose issues.

       extensions.compatObjectFormat
           Specify a compatitbility hash algorithm to use. The
           acceptable values are <b>sha1 </b>and <b>sha256</b>. The value specified
           must be different from the value of extensions.objectFormat.
           This allows client level interoperability between git
           repositories whose objectFormat matches this
           compatObjectFormat. In particular when fully implemented the
           pushes and pulls from a repository in whose objectFormat
           matches compatObjectFormat. As well as being able to use oids
           encoded in compatObjectFormat in addition to oids encoded
           with objectFormat to locally specify objects.

       extensions.refStorage
           Specify the ref storage format to use. The acceptable values
           are:

           •   <b>files </b>for loose files with packed-refs. This is the
               default.

           •   <b>reftable </b>for the reftable format. This format is
               experimental and its internals are subject to change.

               It is an error to specify this key unless
               <b>core.repositoryFormatVersion </b>is 1.

               Note that this setting should only be set by <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a>
               or <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>. Trying to change it after initialization
               will not work and will produce hard-to-diagnose issues.

       extensions.worktreeConfig
           If enabled, then worktrees will load config settings from the
           <b>$GIT_DIR/config.worktree </b>file in addition to the
           <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config </b>file. Note that <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR </b>and
           <b>$GIT_DIR </b>are the same for the main working tree, while other
           working trees have <b>$GIT_DIR </b>equal to
           <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/</b>. The settings in the
           <b>config.worktree </b>file will override settings from any other
           config files.

           When enabling <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b>, you must be careful
           to move certain values from the common config file to the
           main working tree’s <b>config.worktree </b>file, if present:

           •   <b>core.worktree </b>must be moved from <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config</b>
               to <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config.worktree</b>.

           •   If <b>core.bare </b>is true, then it must be moved from
               <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config </b>to
               <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config.worktree</b>.

               It may also be beneficial to adjust the locations of
               <b>core.sparseCheckout </b>and <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone </b>depending
               on your desire for customizable sparse-checkout settings
               for each worktree. By default, the <b>git sparse-checkout</b>
               builtin enables <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b>, assigns these
               config values on a per-worktree basis, and uses the
               <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout </b>file to specify the
               sparsity for each worktree independently. See
               <a href="git-sparse-checkout.1.html">git-sparse-checkout(1)</a> for more details.

               For historical reasons, <b>extensions.worktreeConfig </b>is
               respected regardless of the <b>core.repositoryFormatVersion</b>
               setting.

       fastimport.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects imported by <a href="git-fast-import.1.html">git-fast-import(1)</a> is
           below this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into
           loose object files. However, if the number of imported
           objects equals or exceeds this limit, then the pack will be
           stored as a pack. Storing the pack from a fast-import can
           make the import operation complete faster, especially on slow
           filesystems. If not set, the value of <b>transfer.unpackLimit </b>is
           used instead.

       feature.*
           The config settings that start with <b>feature.  </b>modify the
           defaults of a group of other config settings. These groups
           are created by the Git developer community as recommended
           defaults and are subject to change. In particular, new config
           options may be added with different defaults.

       feature.experimental
           Enable config options that are new to Git, and are being
           considered for future defaults. Config settings included here
           may be added or removed with each release, including minor
           version updates. These settings may have unintended
           interactions since they are so new. Please enable this
           setting if you are interested in providing feedback on
           experimental features. The new default values are:

           •   <b>fetch.negotiationAlgorithm=skipping </b>may improve fetch
               negotiation times by skipping more commits at a time,
               reducing the number of round trips.

           •   <b>pack.useBitmapBoundaryTraversal=true </b>may improve bitmap
               traversal times by walking fewer objects.

           •   <b>pack.allowPackReuse=multi </b>may improve the time it takes
               to create a pack by reusing objects from multiple packs
               instead of just one.

       feature.manyFiles
           Enable config options that optimize for repos with many files
           in the working directory. With many files, commands such as
           <b>git status </b>and <b>git checkout </b>may be slow and these new
           defaults improve performance:

           •   <b>index.skipHash=true </b>speeds up index writes by not
               computing a trailing checksum. Note that this will cause
               Git versions earlier than 2.13.0 to refuse to parse the
               index and Git versions earlier than 2.40.0 will report a
               corrupted index during <b>git fsck</b>.

           •   <b>index.version=4 </b>enables path-prefix compression in the
               index.

           •   <b>core.untrackedCache=true </b>enables the untracked cache.
               This setting assumes that mtime is working on your
               machine.

       fetch.recurseSubmodules
           This option controls whether <b>git fetch </b>(and the underlying
           fetch in <b>git pull</b>) will recursively fetch into populated
           submodules. This option can be set either to a boolean value
           or to <i>on-demand</i>. Setting it to a boolean changes the behavior
           of fetch and pull to recurse unconditionally into submodules
           when set to true or to not recurse at all when set to false.
           When set to <i>on-demand</i>, fetch and pull will only recurse into
           a populated submodule when its superproject retrieves a
           commit that updates the submodule’s reference. Defaults to
           <i>on-demand</i>, or to the value of <i>submodule.recurse</i> if set.

       fetch.fsckObjects
           If it is set to true, git-fetch-pack will check all fetched
           objects. See <b>transfer.fsckObjects </b>for what’s checked.
           Defaults to false. If not set, the value of
           <b>transfer.fsckObjects </b>is used instead.

       fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;
           Acts like <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>, but is used by <a href="git-fetch-pack.1.html">git-fetch-pack(1)</a>
           instead of <a href="git-fsck.1.html">git-fsck(1)</a>. See the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>documentation
           for details.

       fetch.fsck.skipList
           Acts like <b>fsck.skipList</b>, but is used by <a href="git-fetch-pack.1.html">git-fetch-pack(1)</a>
           instead of <a href="git-fsck.1.html">git-fsck(1)</a>. See the <b>fsck.skipList </b>documentation
           for details.

       fetch.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects fetched over the Git native transfer
           is below this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into
           loose object files. However if the number of received objects
           equals or exceeds this limit then the received pack will be
           stored as a pack, after adding any missing delta bases.
           Storing the pack from a push can make the push operation
           complete faster, especially on slow filesystems. If not set,
           the value of <b>transfer.unpackLimit </b>is used instead.

       fetch.prune
           If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the <b>--prune</b>
           option was given on the command line. See also
           <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune </b>and the PRUNING section of <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>.

       fetch.pruneTags
           If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the
           <b>refs/tags/*:refs/tags/* </b>refspec was provided when pruning, if
           not set already. This allows for setting both this option and
           <b>fetch.prune </b>to maintain a 1=1 mapping to upstream refs. See
           also <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.pruneTags </b>and the PRUNING section of
           <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>.

       fetch.all
           If true, fetch will attempt to update all available remotes.
           This behavior can be overridden by passing <b>--no-all </b>or by
           explicitly specifying one or more remote(s) to fetch from.
           Defaults to false.

       fetch.output
           Control how ref update status is printed. Valid values are
           <b>full </b>and <b>compact</b>. Default value is <b>full</b>. See the OUTPUT
           section in <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> for details.

       fetch.negotiationAlgorithm
           Control how information about the commits in the local
           repository is sent when negotiating the contents of the
           packfile to be sent by the server. Set to "consecutive" to
           use an algorithm that walks over consecutive commits checking
           each one. Set to "skipping" to use an algorithm that skips
           commits in an effort to converge faster, but may result in a
           larger-than-necessary packfile; or set to "noop" to not send
           any information at all, which will almost certainly result in
           a larger-than-necessary packfile, but will skip the
           negotiation step. Set to "default" to override settings made
           previously and use the default behaviour. The default is
           normally "consecutive", but if <b>feature.experimental </b>is true,
           then the default is "skipping". Unknown values will cause <i>git</i>
           <i>fetch</i> to error out.

           See also the <b>--negotiate-only </b>and <b>--negotiation-tip </b>options
           to <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>.

       fetch.showForcedUpdates
           Set to false to enable <b>--no-show-forced-updates </b>in
           <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> and <a href="git-pull.1.html">git-pull(1)</a> commands. Defaults to true.

       fetch.parallel
           Specifies the maximal number of fetch operations to be run in
           parallel at a time (submodules, or remotes when the
           <b>--multiple </b>option of <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> is in effect).

           A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset, it
           defaults to 1.

           For submodules, this setting can be overridden using the
           <b>submodule.fetchJobs </b>config setting.

       fetch.writeCommitGraph
           Set to true to write a commit-graph after every <b>git fetch</b>
           command that downloads a pack-file from a remote. Using the
           <b>--split </b>option, most executions will create a very small
           commit-graph file on top of the existing commit-graph
           file(s). Occasionally, these files will merge and the write
           may take longer. Having an updated commit-graph file helps
           performance of many Git commands, including <b>git merge-base</b>,
           <b>git push -f</b>, and <b>git log --graph</b>. Defaults to false.

       fetch.bundleURI
           This value stores a URI for downloading Git object data from
           a bundle URI before performing an incremental fetch from the
           origin Git server. This is similar to how the <b>--bundle-uri</b>
           option behaves in <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>.  <b>git clone --bundle-uri </b>will
           set the <b>fetch.bundleURI </b>value if the supplied bundle URI
           contains a bundle list that is organized for incremental
           fetches.

           If you modify this value and your repository has a
           <b>fetch.bundleCreationToken </b>value, then remove that
           <b>fetch.bundleCreationToken </b>value before fetching from the new
           bundle URI.

       fetch.bundleCreationToken
           When using <b>fetch.bundleURI </b>to fetch incrementally from a
           bundle list that uses the "creationToken" heuristic, this
           config value stores the maximum <b>creationToken </b>value of the
           downloaded bundles. This value is used to prevent downloading
           bundles in the future if the advertised <b>creationToken </b>is not
           strictly larger than this value.

           The creation token values are chosen by the provider serving
           the specific bundle URI. If you modify the URI at
           <b>fetch.bundleURI</b>, then be sure to remove the value for the
           <b>fetch.bundleCreationToken </b>value before fetching.

       filter.&lt;driver&gt;.clean
           The command which is used to convert the content of a
           worktree file to a blob upon checkin. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>
           for details.

       filter.&lt;driver&gt;.smudge
           The command which is used to convert the content of a blob
           object to a worktree file upon checkout. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>
           for details.

       format.attach
           Enable multipart/mixed attachments as the default for
           <i>format-patch</i>. The value can also be a double quoted string
           which will enable attachments as the default and set the
           value as the boundary. See the --attach option in
           <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a>. To countermand an earlier value, set it
           to an empty string.

       format.from
           Provides the default value for the <b>--from </b>option to
           format-patch. Accepts a boolean value, or a name and email
           address. If false, format-patch defaults to <b>--no-from</b>, using
           commit authors directly in the "From:" field of patch mails.
           If true, format-patch defaults to <b>--from</b>, using your
           committer identity in the "From:" field of patch mails and
           including a "From:" field in the body of the patch mail if
           different. If set to a non-boolean value, format-patch uses
           that value instead of your committer identity. Defaults to
           false.

       format.forceInBodyFrom
           Provides the default value for the <b>--[no-]force-in-body-from</b>
           option to format-patch. Defaults to false.

       format.numbered
           A boolean which can enable or disable sequence numbers in
           patch subjects. It defaults to "auto" which enables it only
           if there is more than one patch. It can be enabled or
           disabled for all messages by setting it to "true" or "false".
           See --numbered option in <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a>.

       format.headers
           Additional email headers to include in a patch to be
           submitted by mail. See <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a>.

       format.to, format.cc
           Additional recipients to include in a patch to be submitted
           by mail. See the --to and --cc options in
           <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a>.

       format.subjectPrefix
           The default for format-patch is to output files with the
           <i>[PATCH]</i> subject prefix. Use this variable to change that
           prefix.

       format.coverFromDescription
           The default mode for format-patch to determine which parts of
           the cover letter will be populated using the branch’s
           description. See the <b>--cover-from-description </b>option in
           <a href="git-format-patch.1.html">git-format-patch(1)</a>.

       format.signature
           The default for format-patch is to output a signature
           containing the Git version number. Use this variable to
           change that default. Set this variable to the empty string
           ("") to suppress signature generation.

       format.signatureFile
           Works just like format.signature except the contents of the
           file specified by this variable will be used as the
           signature.

       format.suffix
           The default for format-patch is to output files with the
           suffix <b>.patch</b>. Use this variable to change that suffix (make
           sure to include the dot if you want it).

       format.encodeEmailHeaders
           Encode email headers that have non-ASCII characters with
           "Q-encoding" (described in RFC 2047) for email transmission.
           Defaults to true.

       format.pretty
           The default pretty format for log/show/whatchanged command.
           See <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>, <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a>.

       format.thread
           The default threading style for <i>git format-patch</i>. Can be a
           boolean value, or <b>shallow </b>or <b>deep</b>.  <b>shallow </b>threading makes
           every mail a reply to the head of the series, where the head
           is chosen from the cover letter, the <b>--in-reply-to</b>, and the
           first patch mail, in this order.  <b>deep </b>threading makes every
           mail a reply to the previous one. A true boolean value is the
           same as <b>shallow</b>, and a false value disables threading.

       format.signOff
           A boolean value which lets you enable the <b>-s/--signoff </b>option
           of format-patch by default.  <b>Note: </b>Adding the <b>Signed-off-by</b>
           trailer to a patch should be a conscious act and means that
           you certify you have the rights to submit this work under the
           same open source license. Please see the <i>SubmittingPatches</i>
           document for further discussion.

       format.coverLetter
           A boolean that controls whether to generate a cover-letter
           when format-patch is invoked, but in addition can be set to
           "auto", to generate a cover-letter only when there’s more
           than one patch. Default is false.

       format.outputDirectory
           Set a custom directory to store the resulting files instead
           of the current working directory. All directory components
           will be created.

       format.filenameMaxLength
           The maximum length of the output filenames generated by the
           <b>format-patch </b>command; defaults to 64. Can be overridden by
           the <b>--filename-max-length=&lt;n&gt; </b>command line option.

       format.useAutoBase
           A boolean value which lets you enable the <b>--base=auto </b>option
           of format-patch by default. Can also be set to "whenAble" to
           allow enabling <b>--base=auto </b>if a suitable base is available,
           but to skip adding base info otherwise without the format
           dying.

       format.notes
           Provides the default value for the <b>--notes </b>option to
           format-patch. Accepts a boolean value, or a ref which
           specifies where to get notes. If false, format-patch defaults
           to <b>--no-notes</b>. If true, format-patch defaults to <b>--notes</b>. If
           set to a non-boolean value, format-patch defaults to
           <b>--notes=&lt;ref&gt;</b>, where <b>ref </b>is the non-boolean value. Defaults
           to false.

           If one wishes to use the ref <b>refs/notes/true</b>, please use that
           literal instead.

           This configuration can be specified multiple times in order
           to allow multiple notes refs to be included. In that case, it
           will behave similarly to multiple <b>--[no-]notes[=] </b>options
           passed in. That is, a value of <b>true </b>will show the default
           notes, a value of <b>&lt;ref&gt; </b>will also show notes from that notes
           ref and a value of <b>false </b>will negate previous configurations
           and not show notes.

           For example,

               [format]
                       notes = true
                       notes = foo
                       notes = false
                       notes = bar

           will only show notes from <b>refs/notes/bar</b>.

       format.mboxrd
           A boolean value which enables the robust "mboxrd" format when
           <b>--stdout </b>is in use to escape "^&gt;+From " lines.

       format.noprefix
           If set, do not show any source or destination prefix in
           patches. This is equivalent to the <b>diff.noprefix </b>option used
           by <b>git diff </b>(but which is not respected by <b>format-patch</b>).
           Note that by setting this, the receiver of any patches you
           generate will have to apply them using the <b>-p0 </b>option.

       fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;
           During fsck git may find issues with legacy data which
           wouldn’t be generated by current versions of git, and which
           wouldn’t be sent over the wire if <b>transfer.fsckObjects </b>was
           set. This feature is intended to support working with legacy
           repositories containing such data.

           Setting <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>will be picked up by <a href="git-fsck.1.html">git-fsck(1)</a>, but
           to accept pushes of such data set <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>
           instead, or to clone or fetch it set <b>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>.

           The rest of the documentation discusses <b>fsck.*  </b>for brevity,
           but the same applies for the corresponding <b>receive.fsck.*</b>
           and <b>fetch.fsck.*</b>. variables.

           Unlike variables like <b>color.ui </b>and <b>core.editor</b>, the
           <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>and <b>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>variables will
           not fall back on the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>configuration if they
           aren’t set. To uniformly configure the same fsck settings in
           different circumstances, all three of them must be set to the
           same values.

           When <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>is set, errors can be switched to warnings
           and vice versa by configuring the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>setting where
           the <b>&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>is the fsck message ID and the value is one of
           <b>error</b>, <b>warn </b>or <b>ignore</b>. For convenience, fsck prefixes the
           error/warning with the message ID, e.g. "missingEmail:
           invalid author/committer line - missing email" means that
           setting <b>fsck.missingEmail = ignore </b>will hide that issue.

           In general, it is better to enumerate existing objects with
           problems with <b>fsck.skipList</b>, instead of listing the kind of
           breakages these problematic objects share to be ignored, as
           doing the latter will allow new instances of the same
           breakages go unnoticed.

           Setting an unknown <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>value will cause fsck to
           die, but doing the same for <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>and
           <b>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>will only cause git to warn.

           See the <b>Fsck Messages </b>section of <a href="git-fsck.1.html">git-fsck(1)</a> for supported
           values of <b>&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>.

       fsck.skipList
           The path to a list of object names (i.e. one unabbreviated
           SHA-1 per line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal
           way and should be ignored. On versions of Git 2.20 and later,
           comments (<i>#</i>), empty lines, and any leading and trailing
           whitespace are ignored. Everything but a SHA-1 per line will
           error out on older versions.

           This feature is useful when an established project should be
           accepted despite early commits containing errors that can be
           safely ignored, such as invalid committer email addresses.
           Note: corrupt objects cannot be skipped with this setting.

           Like <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>this variable has corresponding
           <b>receive.fsck.skipList </b>and <b>fetch.fsck.skipList </b>variants.

           Unlike variables like <b>color.ui </b>and <b>core.editor </b>the
           <b>receive.fsck.skipList </b>and <b>fetch.fsck.skipList </b>variables will
           not fall back on the <b>fsck.skipList </b>configuration if they
           aren’t set. To uniformly configure the same fsck settings in
           different circumstances, all three of them must be set to the
           same values.

           Older versions of Git (before 2.20) documented that the
           object names list should be sorted. This was never a
           requirement; the object names could appear in any order, but
           when reading the list we tracked whether the list was sorted
           for the purposes of an internal binary search implementation,
           which could save itself some work with an already sorted
           list. Unless you had a humongous list there was no reason to
           go out of your way to pre-sort the list. After Git version
           2.20 a hash implementation is used instead, so there’s now no
           reason to pre-sort the list.

       fsmonitor.allowRemote
           By default, the fsmonitor daemon refuses to work with
           network-mounted repositories. Setting <b>fsmonitor.allowRemote</b>
           to <b>true </b>overrides this behavior. Only respected when
           <b>core.fsmonitor </b>is set to <b>true</b>.

       fsmonitor.socketDir
           This Mac OS-specific option, if set, specifies the directory
           in which to create the Unix domain socket used for
           communication between the fsmonitor daemon and various Git
           commands. The directory must reside on a native Mac OS
           filesystem. Only respected when <b>core.fsmonitor </b>is set to
           <b>true</b>.

       gc.aggressiveDepth
           The depth parameter used in the delta compression algorithm
           used by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 50, which is
           the default for the <b>--depth </b>option when <b>--aggressive </b>isn’t in
           use.

           See the documentation for the <b>--depth </b>option in <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>
           for more details.

       gc.aggressiveWindow
           The window size parameter used in the delta compression
           algorithm used by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 250,
           which is a much more aggressive window size than the default
           <b>--window </b>of 10.

           See the documentation for the <b>--window </b>option in
           <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a> for more details.

       gc.auto
           When there are approximately more than this many loose
           objects in the repository, <b>git gc --auto </b>will pack them. Some
           Porcelain commands use this command to perform a light-weight
           garbage collection from time to time. The default value is
           6700.

           Setting this to 0 disables not only automatic packing based
           on the number of loose objects, but also any other heuristic
           <b>git gc --auto </b>will otherwise use to determine if there’s work
           to do, such as <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b>.

       gc.autoPackLimit
           When there are more than this many packs that are not marked
           with <b>*.keep </b>file in the repository, <b>git gc --auto</b>
           consolidates them into one larger pack. The default value is
           50. Setting this to 0 disables it. Setting <b>gc.auto </b>to 0 will
           also disable this.

           See the <b>gc.bigPackThreshold </b>configuration variable below.
           When in use, it’ll affect how the auto pack limit works.

       gc.autoDetach
           Make <b>git gc --auto </b>return immediately and run in the
           background if the system supports it. Default is true.

       gc.bigPackThreshold
           If non-zero, all non-cruft packs larger than this limit are
           kept when <b>git gc </b>is run. This is very similar to
           <b>--keep-largest-pack </b>except that all non-cruft packs that meet
           the threshold are kept, not just the largest pack. Defaults
           to zero. Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

           Note that if the number of kept packs is more than
           gc.autoPackLimit, this configuration variable is ignored, all
           packs except the base pack will be repacked. After this the
           number of packs should go below gc.autoPackLimit and
           gc.bigPackThreshold should be respected again.

           If the amount of memory estimated for <b>git repack </b>to run
           smoothly is not available and <b>gc.bigPackThreshold </b>is not set,
           the largest pack will also be excluded (this is the
           equivalent of running <b>git gc </b>with <b>--keep-largest-pack</b>).

       gc.writeCommitGraph
           If true, then gc will rewrite the commit-graph file when
           <a href="git-gc.1.html">git-gc(1)</a> is run. When using <b>git gc --auto </b>the commit-graph
           will be updated if housekeeping is required. Default is true.
           See <a href="git-commit-graph.1.html">git-commit-graph(1)</a> for details.

       gc.logExpiry
           If the file gc.log exists, then <b>git gc --auto </b>will print its
           content and exit with status zero instead of running unless
           that file is more than <i>gc.logExpiry</i> old. Default is "1.day".
           See <b>gc.pruneExpire </b>for more ways to specify its value.

       gc.packRefs
           Running <b>git pack-refs </b>in a repository renders it unclonable
           by Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb transports such as
           HTTP. This variable determines whether <i>git gc</i> runs <b>git</b>
           <b>pack-refs</b>. This can be set to <b>notbare </b>to enable it within all
           non-bare repos or it can be set to a boolean value. The
           default is <b>true</b>.

       gc.cruftPacks
           Store unreachable objects in a cruft pack (see <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>)
           instead of as loose objects. The default is <b>true</b>.

       gc.maxCruftSize
           Limit the size of new cruft packs when repacking. When
           specified in addition to <b>--max-cruft-size</b>, the command line
           option takes priority. See the <b>--max-cruft-size </b>option of
           <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>.

       gc.pruneExpire
           When <i>git gc</i> is run, it will call <i>prune --expire 2.weeks.ago</i>
           (and <i>repack --cruft --cruft-expiration 2.weeks.ago</i> if using
           cruft packs via <b>gc.cruftPacks </b>or <b>--cruft</b>). Override the grace
           period with this config variable. The value "now" may be used
           to disable this grace period and always prune unreachable
           objects immediately, or "never" may be used to suppress
           pruning. This feature helps prevent corruption when <i>git gc</i>
           runs concurrently with another process writing to the
           repository; see the "NOTES" section of <a href="git-gc.1.html">git-gc(1)</a>.

       gc.worktreePruneExpire
           When <i>git gc</i> is run, it calls <i>git worktree prune --expire</i>
           <i>3.months.ago</i>. This config variable can be used to set a
           different grace period. The value "now" may be used to
           disable the grace period and prune <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b>
           immediately, or "never" may be used to suppress pruning.

       gc.reflogExpire, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpire
           <i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older than this
           time; defaults to 90 days. The value "now" expires all
           entries immediately, and "never" suppresses expiration
           altogether. With "&lt;pattern&gt;" (e.g. "refs/stash") in the
           middle the setting applies only to the refs that match the
           &lt;pattern&gt;.

       gc.reflogExpireUnreachable, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpireUnreachable
           <i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older than this time
           and are not reachable from the current tip; defaults to 30
           days. The value "now" expires all entries immediately, and
           "never" suppresses expiration altogether. With "&lt;pattern&gt;"
           (e.g. "refs/stash") in the middle, the setting applies only
           to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.

           These types of entries are generally created as a result of
           using <b>git commit --amend </b>or <b>git rebase </b>and are the commits
           prior to the amend or rebase occurring. Since these changes
           are not part of the current project most users will want to
           expire them sooner, which is why the default is more
           aggressive than <b>gc.reflogExpire</b>.

       gc.recentObjectsHook
           When considering whether or not to remove an object (either
           when generating a cruft pack or storing unreachable objects
           as loose), use the shell to execute the specified command(s).
           Interpret their output as object IDs which Git will consider
           as "recent", regardless of their age. By treating their
           mtimes as "now", any objects (and their descendants)
           mentioned in the output will be kept regardless of their true
           age.

           Output must contain exactly one hex object ID per line, and
           nothing else. Objects which cannot be found in the repository
           are ignored. Multiple hooks are supported, but all must exit
           successfully, else the operation (either generating a cruft
           pack or unpacking unreachable objects) will be halted.

       gc.repackFilter
           When repacking, use the specified filter to move certain
           objects into a separate packfile. See the
           <b>--filter=&lt;filter-spec&gt; </b>option of <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>.

       gc.repackFilterTo
           When repacking and using a filter, see <b>gc.repackFilter</b>, the
           specified location will be used to create the packfile
           containing the filtered out objects.  <b>WARNING: </b>The specified
           location should be accessible, using for example the Git
           alternates mechanism, otherwise the repo could be considered
           corrupt by Git as it migh not be able to access the objects
           in that packfile. See the <b>--filter-to=&lt;dir&gt; </b>option of
           <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a> and the <b>objects/info/alternates </b>section of
           <a href="../man5/gitrepository-layout.5.html">gitrepository-layout(5)</a>.

       gc.rerereResolved
           Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are kept for
           this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. You can also use
           more human-readable "1.month.ago", etc. The default is 60
           days. See <a href="git-rerere.1.html">git-rerere(1)</a>.

       gc.rerereUnresolved
           Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are kept
           for this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. You can also
           use more human-readable "1.month.ago", etc. The default is 15
           days. See <a href="git-rerere.1.html">git-rerere(1)</a>.

       gitcvs.commitMsgAnnotation
           Append this string to each commit message. Set to empty
           string to disable this feature. Defaults to "via git-CVS
           emulator".

       gitcvs.enabled
           Whether the CVS server interface is enabled for this
           repository. See <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a>.

       gitcvs.logFile
           Path to a log file where the CVS server interface well...
           logs various stuff. See <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a>.

       gitcvs.usecrlfattr
           If true, the server will look up the end-of-line conversion
           attributes for files to determine the <b>-k </b>modes to use. If the
           attributes force Git to treat a file as text, the <b>-k </b>mode
           will be left blank so CVS clients will treat it as text. If
           they suppress text conversion, the file will be set with <i>-kb</i>
           mode, which suppresses any newline munging the client might
           otherwise do. If the attributes do not allow the file type to
           be determined, then <b>gitcvs.allBinary </b>is used. See
           <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>.

       gitcvs.allBinary
           This is used if <b>gitcvs.usecrlfattr </b>does not resolve the
           correct <i>-kb</i> mode to use. If true, all unresolved files are
           sent to the client in mode <i>-kb</i>. This causes the client to
           treat them as binary files, which suppresses any newline
           munging it otherwise might do. Alternatively, if it is set to
           "guess", then the contents of the file are examined to decide
           if it is binary, similar to <b>core.autocrlf</b>.

       gitcvs.dbName
           Database used by git-cvsserver to cache revision information
           derived from the Git repository. The exact meaning depends on
           the used database driver, for SQLite (which is the default
           driver) this is a filename. Supports variable substitution
           (see <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a> for details). May not contain
           semicolons (<b>;</b>). Default: <i>%Ggitcvs.%m.sqlite</i>

       gitcvs.dbDriver
           Used Perl DBI driver. You can specify any available driver
           for this here, but it might not work. git-cvsserver is tested
           with <i>DBD::SQLite</i>, reported to work with <i>DBD::Pg</i>, and reported
           <b>not </b>to work with <i>DBD::mysql</i>. Experimental feature. May not
           contain double colons (<b>:</b>). Default: <i>SQLite</i>. See
           <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a>.

       gitcvs.dbUser, gitcvs.dbPass
           Database user and password. Only useful if setting
           <b>gitcvs.dbDriver</b>, since SQLite has no concept of database
           users and/or passwords.  <i>gitcvs.dbUser</i> supports variable
           substitution (see <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a> for details).

       gitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix
           Database table name prefix. Prepended to the names of any
           database tables used, allowing a single database to be used
           for several repositories. Supports variable substitution (see
           <a href="git-cvsserver.1.html">git-cvsserver(1)</a> for details). Any non-alphabetic characters
           will be replaced with underscores.

       All gitcvs variables except for <b>gitcvs.usecrlfattr </b>and
       <b>gitcvs.allBinary </b>can also be specified as
       <i>gitcvs.&lt;access_method&gt;.&lt;varname&gt;</i> (where <i>access_method</i> is one of
       "ext" and "pserver") to make them apply only for the given access
       method.

       gpg.program
           Use this custom program instead of "<b>gpg</b>" found on <b>$PATH </b>when
           making or verifying a PGP signature. The program must support
           the same command-line interface as GPG, namely, to verify a
           detached signature, "<b>gpg --verify $signature - &lt;$file</b>" is
           run, and the program is expected to signal a good signature
           by exiting with code 0. To generate an ASCII-armored detached
           signature, the standard input of "<b>gpg -bsau $key</b>" is fed with
           the contents to be signed, and the program is expected to
           send the result to its standard output.

       gpg.format
           Specifies which key format to use when signing with
           <b>--gpg-sign</b>. Default is "openpgp". Other possible values are
           "x509", "ssh".

           See <a href="../man5/gitformat-signature.5.html">gitformat-signature(5)</a> for the signature format, which
           differs based on the selected <b>gpg.format</b>.

       gpg.&lt;format&gt;.program
           Use this to customize the program used for the signing format
           you chose. (see <b>gpg.program </b>and <b>gpg.format</b>) <b>gpg.program </b>can
           still be used as a legacy synonym for <b>gpg.openpgp.program</b>.
           The default value for <b>gpg.x509.program </b>is "gpgsm" and
           <b>gpg.ssh.program </b>is "ssh-keygen".

       gpg.minTrustLevel
           Specifies a minimum trust level for signature verification.
           If this option is unset, then signature verification for
           merge operations requires a key with at least <b>marginal </b>trust.
           Other operations that perform signature verification require
           a key with at least <b>undefined </b>trust. Setting this option
           overrides the required trust-level for all operations.
           Supported values, in increasing order of significance:

           •   <b>undefined</b>

           •   <b>never</b>

           •   <b>marginal</b>

           •   <b>fully</b>

           •   <b>ultimate</b>

       gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand
           This command will be run when user.signingkey is not set and
           a ssh signature is requested. On successful exit a valid ssh
           public key prefixed with <b>key:: </b>is expected in the first line
           of its output. This allows for a script doing a dynamic
           lookup of the correct public key when it is impractical to
           statically configure <b>user.signingKey</b>. For example when keys
           or SSH Certificates are rotated frequently or selection of
           the right key depends on external factors unknown to git.

       gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile
           A file containing ssh public keys which you are willing to
           trust. The file consists of one or more lines of principals
           followed by an ssh public key. e.g.:
           <b>user1@example.com,user2@example.com ssh-rsa AAAAX1...  </b>See
           ssh-keygen(1) "ALLOWED SIGNERS" for details. The principal is
           only used to identify the key and is available when verifying
           a signature.

           SSH has no concept of trust levels like gpg does. To be able
           to differentiate between valid signatures and trusted
           signatures the trust level of a signature verification is set
           to <b>fully </b>when the public key is present in the
           allowedSignersFile. Otherwise the trust level is <b>undefined</b>
           and git verify-commit/tag will fail.

           This file can be set to a location outside of the repository
           and every developer maintains their own trust store. A
           central repository server could generate this file
           automatically from ssh keys with push access to verify the
           code against. In a corporate setting this file is probably
           generated at a global location from automation that already
           handles developer ssh keys.

           A repository that only allows signed commits can store the
           file in the repository itself using a path relative to the
           top-level of the working tree. This way only committers with
           an already valid key can add or change keys in the keyring.

           Since OpensSSH 8.8 this file allows specifying a key lifetime
           using valid-after &amp; valid-before options. Git will mark
           signatures as valid if the signing key was valid at the time
           of the signature’s creation. This allows users to change a
           signing key without invalidating all previously made
           signatures.

           Using a SSH CA key with the cert-authority option (see
           ssh-keygen(1) "CERTIFICATES") is also valid.

       gpg.ssh.revocationFile
           Either a SSH KRL or a list of revoked public keys (without
           the principal prefix). See ssh-keygen(1) for details. If a
           public key is found in this file then it will always be
           treated as having trust level "never" and signatures will
           show as invalid.

       grep.lineNumber
           If set to true, enable <b>-n </b>option by default.

       grep.column
           If set to true, enable the <b>--column </b>option by default.

       grep.patternType
           Set the default matching behavior. Using a value of <i>basic</i>,
           <i>extended</i>, <i>fixed</i>, or <i>perl</i> will enable the <b>--basic-regexp</b>,
           <b>--extended-regexp</b>, <b>--fixed-strings</b>, or <b>--perl-regexp </b>option
           accordingly, while the value <i>default</i> will use the
           <b>grep.extendedRegexp </b>option to choose between <i>basic</i> and
           <i>extended</i>.

       grep.extendedRegexp
           If set to true, enable <b>--extended-regexp </b>option by default.
           This option is ignored when the <b>grep.patternType </b>option is
           set to a value other than <i>default</i>.

       grep.threads
           Number of grep worker threads to use. If unset (or set to 0),
           Git will use as many threads as the number of logical cores
           available.

       grep.fullName
           If set to true, enable <b>--full-name </b>option by default.

       grep.fallbackToNoIndex
           If set to true, fall back to <b>git grep --no-index </b>if <b>git grep</b>
           is executed outside of a git repository. Defaults to false.

       gui.commitMsgWidth
           Defines how wide the commit message window is in the
           <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a>. "75" is the default.

       gui.diffContext
           Specifies how many context lines should be used in calls to
           diff made by the <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a>. The default is "5".

       gui.displayUntracked
           Determines if <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> shows untracked files in the file
           list. The default is "true".

       gui.encoding
           Specifies the default character encoding to use for
           displaying of file contents in <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> and <a href="gitk.1.html">gitk(1)</a>. It can
           be overridden by setting the <i>encoding</i> attribute for relevant
           files (see <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>). If this option is not set, the
           tools default to the locale encoding.

       gui.matchTrackingBranch
           Determines if new branches created with <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> should
           default to tracking remote branches with matching names or
           not. Default: "false".

       gui.newBranchTemplate
           Is used as a suggested name when creating new branches using
           the <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a>.

       gui.pruneDuringFetch
           "true" if <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> should prune remote-tracking branches
           when performing a fetch. The default value is "false".

       gui.trustmtime
           Determines if <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> should trust the file modification
           timestamp or not. By default the timestamps are not trusted.

       gui.spellingDictionary
           Specifies the dictionary used for spell checking commit
           messages in the <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a>. When set to "none" spell checking
           is turned off.

       gui.fastCopyBlame
           If true, <i>git gui blame</i> uses <b>-C </b>instead of <b>-C -C </b>for original
           location detection. It makes blame significantly faster on
           huge repositories at the expense of less thorough copy
           detection.

       gui.copyBlameThreshold
           Specifies the threshold to use in <i>git gui blame</i> original
           location detection, measured in alphanumeric characters. See
           the <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a> manual for more information on copy
           detection.

       gui.blamehistoryctx
           Specifies the radius of history context in days to show in
           <a href="gitk.1.html">gitk(1)</a> for the selected commit, when the <b>Show History</b>
           <b>Context </b>menu item is invoked from <i>git gui blame</i>. If this
           variable is set to zero, the whole history is shown.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.cmd
           Specifies the shell command line to execute when the
           corresponding item of the <a href="git-gui.1.html">git-gui(1)</a> <b>Tools </b>menu is invoked.
           This option is mandatory for every tool. The command is
           executed from the root of the working directory, and in the
           environment it receives the name of the tool as <b>GIT_GUITOOL</b>,
           the name of the currently selected file as <i>FILENAME</i>, and the
           name of the current branch as <i>CUR_BRANCH</i> (if the head is
           detached, <i>CUR_BRANCH</i> is empty).

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.needsFile
           Run the tool only if a diff is selected in the GUI. It
           guarantees that <i>FILENAME</i> is not empty.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.noConsole
           Run the command silently, without creating a window to
           display its output.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.noRescan
           Don’t rescan the working directory for changes after the tool
           finishes execution.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.confirm
           Show a confirmation dialog before actually running the tool.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.argPrompt
           Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to the
           tool through the <b>ARGS </b>environment variable. Since requesting
           an argument implies confirmation, the <i>confirm</i> option has no
           effect if this is enabled. If the option is set to <i>true</i>, <i>yes</i>,
           or <i>1</i>, the dialog uses a built-in generic prompt; otherwise
           the exact value of the variable is used.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revPrompt
           Request a single valid revision from the user, and set the
           <b>REVISION </b>environment variable. In other aspects this option
           is similar to <i>argPrompt</i>, and can be used together with it.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revUnmerged
           Show only unmerged branches in the <i>revPrompt</i> subdialog. This
           is useful for tools similar to merge or rebase, but not for
           things like checkout or reset.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.title
           Specifies the title to use for the prompt dialog. The default
           is the tool name.

       guitool.&lt;name&gt;.prompt
           Specifies the general prompt string to display at the top of
           the dialog, before subsections for <i>argPrompt</i> and <i>revPrompt</i>.
           The default value includes the actual command.

       help.browser
           Specify the browser that will be used to display help in the
           <i>web</i> format. See <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>.

       help.format
           Override the default help format used by <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>. Values
           <i>man</i>, <i>info</i>, <i>web</i> and <i>html</i> are supported.  <i>man</i> is the default.
           <i>web</i> and <i>html</i> are the same.

       help.autoCorrect
           If git detects typos and can identify exactly one valid
           command similar to the error, git will try to suggest the
           correct command or even run the suggestion automatically.
           Possible config values are:

           •   0 (default): show the suggested command.

           •   positive number: run the suggested command after
               specified deciseconds (0.1 sec).

           •   "immediate": run the suggested command immediately.

           •   "prompt": show the suggestion and prompt for confirmation
               to run the command.

           •   "never": don’t run or show any suggested command.

       help.htmlPath
           Specify the path where the HTML documentation resides. File
           system paths and URLs are supported. HTML pages will be
           prefixed with this path when help is displayed in the <i>web</i>
           format. This defaults to the documentation path of your Git
           installation.

       http.proxy
           Override the HTTP proxy, normally configured using the
           <i>http_proxy</i>, <i>https_proxy</i>, and <i>all_proxy</i> environment variables
           (see <a href="curl.1.html">curl(1)</a>). In addition to the syntax understood by curl,
           it is possible to specify a proxy string with a user name but
           no password, in which case git will attempt to acquire one in
           the same way it does for other credentials. See
           <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials(7)</a> for more information. The syntax thus is
           <i>[protocol://][user[:password]@]proxyhost[:port]</i>. This can be
           overridden on a per-remote basis; see remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy

       http.proxyAuthMethod
           Set the method with which to authenticate against the HTTP
           proxy. This only takes effect if the configured proxy string
           contains a user name part (i.e. is of the form <i>user@host</i> or
           <i>user@host:port</i>). This can be overridden on a per-remote
           basis; see <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxyAuthMethod</b>. Both can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_HTTP_PROXY_AUTHMETHOD </b>environment
           variable. Possible values are:

           •   <b>anyauth </b>- Automatically pick a suitable authentication
               method. It is assumed that the proxy answers an
               unauthenticated request with a 407 status code and one or
               more Proxy-authenticate headers with supported
               authentication methods. This is the default.

           •   <b>basic </b>- HTTP Basic authentication

           •   <b>digest </b>- HTTP Digest authentication; this prevents the
               password from being transmitted to the proxy in clear
               text

           •   <b>negotiate </b>- GSS-Negotiate authentication (compare the
               --negotiate option of <a href="curl.1.html">curl(1)</a>)

           •   <b>ntlm </b>- NTLM authentication (compare the --ntlm option of
               <a href="curl.1.html">curl(1)</a>)

       http.proxySSLCert
           The pathname of a file that stores a client certificate to
           use to authenticate with an HTTPS proxy. Can be overridden by
           the <b>GIT_PROXY_SSL_CERT </b>environment variable.

       http.proxySSLKey
           The pathname of a file that stores a private key to use to
           authenticate with an HTTPS proxy. Can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_PROXY_SSL_KEY </b>environment variable.

       http.proxySSLCertPasswordProtected
           Enable Git’s password prompt for the proxy SSL certificate.
           Otherwise OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times,
           if the certificate or private key is encrypted. Can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_PROXY_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED</b>
           environment variable.

       http.proxySSLCAInfo
           Pathname to the file containing the certificate bundle that
           should be used to verify the proxy with when using an HTTPS
           proxy. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_PROXY_SSL_CAINFO</b>
           environment variable.

       http.emptyAuth
           Attempt authentication without seeking a username or
           password. This can be used to attempt GSS-Negotiate
           authentication without specifying a username in the URL, as
           libcurl normally requires a username for authentication.

       http.delegation
           Control GSSAPI credential delegation. The delegation is
           disabled by default in libcurl since version 7.21.7. Set
           parameter to tell the server what it is allowed to delegate
           when it comes to user credentials. Used with GSS/kerberos.
           Possible values are:

           •   <b>none </b>- Don’t allow any delegation.

           •   <b>policy </b>- Delegates if and only if the OK-AS-DELEGATE flag
               is set in the Kerberos service ticket, which is a matter
               of realm policy.

           •   <b>always </b>- Unconditionally allow the server to delegate.

       http.extraHeader
           Pass an additional HTTP header when communicating with a
           server. If more than one such entry exists, all of them are
           added as extra headers. To allow overriding the settings
           inherited from the system config, an empty value will reset
           the extra headers to the empty list.

       http.cookieFile
           The pathname of a file containing previously stored cookie
           lines, which should be used in the Git http session, if they
           match the server. The file format of the file to read cookies
           from should be plain HTTP headers or the Netscape/Mozilla
           cookie file format (see <a href="curl.1.html">curl(1)</a>). NOTE that the file
           specified with http.cookieFile is used only as input unless
           http.saveCookies is set.

       http.saveCookies
           If set, store cookies received during requests to the file
           specified by http.cookieFile. Has no effect if
           http.cookieFile is unset.

       http.version
           Use the specified HTTP protocol version when communicating
           with a server. If you want to force the default. The
           available and default version depend on libcurl. Currently
           the possible values of this option are:

           •   HTTP/2

           •   HTTP/1.1

       http.curloptResolve
           Hostname resolution information that will be used first by
           libcurl when sending HTTP requests. This information should
           be in one of the following formats:

           •   [+]HOST:PORT:ADDRESS[,ADDRESS]

           •   -HOST:PORT

           The first format redirects all requests to the given
           <b>HOST:PORT </b>to the provided <b>ADDRESS</b>(s). The second format
           clears all previous config values for that <b>HOST:PORT</b>
           combination. To allow easy overriding of all the settings
           inherited from the system config, an empty value will reset
           all resolution information to the empty list.

       http.sslVersion
           The SSL version to use when negotiating an SSL connection, if
           you want to force the default. The available and default
           version depend on whether libcurl was built against NSS or
           OpenSSL and the particular configuration of the crypto
           library in use. Internally this sets the <i>CURLOPT_SSL_VERSION</i>
           option; see the libcurl documentation for more details on the
           format of this option and for the ssl version supported.
           Currently the possible values of this option are:

           •   sslv2

           •   sslv3

           •   tlsv1

           •   tlsv1.0

           •   tlsv1.1

           •   tlsv1.2

           •   tlsv1.3

           Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_VERSION </b>environment
           variable. To force git to use libcurl’s default ssl version
           and ignore any explicit http.sslversion option, set
           <b>GIT_SSL_VERSION </b>to the empty string.

       http.sslCipherList
           A list of SSL ciphers to use when negotiating an SSL
           connection. The available ciphers depend on whether libcurl
           was built against NSS or OpenSSL and the particular
           configuration of the crypto library in use. Internally this
           sets the <i>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</i> option; see the libcurl
           documentation for more details on the format of this list.

           Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST </b>environment
           variable. To force git to use libcurl’s default cipher list
           and ignore any explicit http.sslCipherList option, set
           <b>GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST </b>to the empty string.

       http.sslVerify
           Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or
           pushing over HTTPS. Defaults to true. Can be overridden by
           the <b>GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY </b>environment variable.

       http.sslCert
           File containing the SSL certificate when fetching or pushing
           over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_CERT </b>environment
           variable.

       http.sslKey
           File containing the SSL private key when fetching or pushing
           over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_KEY </b>environment
           variable.

       http.sslCertPasswordProtected
           Enable Git’s password prompt for the SSL certificate.
           Otherwise OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times,
           if the certificate or private key is encrypted. Can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED </b>environment
           variable.

       http.sslCAInfo
           File containing the certificates to verify the peer with when
           fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_SSL_CAINFO </b>environment variable.

       http.sslCAPath
           Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify the
           peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_CAPATH </b>environment variable.

       http.sslBackend
           Name of the SSL backend to use (e.g. "openssl" or
           "schannel"). This option is ignored if cURL lacks support for
           choosing the SSL backend at runtime.

       http.schannelCheckRevoke
           Used to enforce or disable certificate revocation checks in
           cURL when http.sslBackend is set to "schannel". Defaults to
           <b>true </b>if unset. Only necessary to disable this if Git
           consistently errors and the message is about checking the
           revocation status of a certificate. This option is ignored if
           cURL lacks support for setting the relevant SSL option at
           runtime.

       http.schannelUseSSLCAInfo
           As of cURL v7.60.0, the Secure Channel backend can use the
           certificate bundle provided via <b>http.sslCAInfo</b>, but that
           would override the Windows Certificate Store. Since this is
           not desirable by default, Git will tell cURL not to use that
           bundle by default when the <b>schannel </b>backend was configured
           via <b>http.sslBackend</b>, unless <b>http.schannelUseSSLCAInfo</b>
           overrides this behavior.

       http.pinnedPubkey
           Public key of the https service. It may either be the
           filename of a PEM or DER encoded public key file or a string
           starting with <i>sha256//</i> followed by the base64 encoded sha256
           hash of the public key. See also libcurl
           <i>CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY</i>. git will exit with an error if this
           option is set but not supported by cURL.

       http.sslTry
           Attempt to use AUTH SSL/TLS and encrypted data transfers when
           connecting via regular FTP protocol. This might be needed if
           the FTP server requires it for security reasons or you wish
           to connect securely whenever remote FTP server supports it.
           Default is false since it might trigger certificate
           verification errors on misconfigured servers.

       http.maxRequests
           How many HTTP requests to launch in parallel. Can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUESTS </b>environment variable.
           Default is 5.

       http.minSessions
           The number of curl sessions (counted across slots) to be kept
           across requests. They will not be ended with
           curl_easy_cleanup() until http_cleanup() is invoked. If
           USE_CURL_MULTI is not defined, this value will be capped at
           1. Defaults to 1.

       http.postBuffer
           Maximum size in bytes of the buffer used by smart HTTP
           transports when POSTing data to the remote system. For
           requests larger than this buffer size, HTTP/1.1 and
           Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used to avoid creating a
           massive pack file locally. Default is 1 MiB, which is
           sufficient for most requests.

           Note that raising this limit is only effective for disabling
           chunked transfer encoding and therefore should be used only
           where the remote server or a proxy only supports HTTP/1.0 or
           is noncompliant with the HTTP standard. Raising this is not,
           in general, an effective solution for most push problems, but
           can increase memory consumption significantly since the
           entire buffer is allocated even for small pushes.

       http.lowSpeedLimit, http.lowSpeedTime
           If the HTTP transfer speed, in bytes per second, is less than
           <i>http.lowSpeedLimit</i> for longer than <i>http.lowSpeedTime</i> seconds,
           the transfer is aborted. Can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT </b>and <b>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME</b>
           environment variables.

       http.noEPSV
           A boolean which disables using of EPSV ftp command by curl.
           This can be helpful with some "poor" ftp servers which don’t
           support EPSV mode. Can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_CURL_FTP_NO_EPSV </b>environment variable. Default is false
           (curl will use EPSV).

       http.userAgent
           The HTTP USER_AGENT string presented to an HTTP server. The
           default value represents the version of the Git client such
           as git/1.7.1. This option allows you to override this value
           to a more common value such as Mozilla/4.0. This may be
           necessary, for instance, if connecting through a firewall
           that restricts HTTP connections to a set of common USER_AGENT
           strings (but not including those like git/1.7.1). Can be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT </b>environment variable.

       http.followRedirects
           Whether git should follow HTTP redirects. If set to <b>true</b>, git
           will transparently follow any redirect issued by a server it
           encounters. If set to <b>false</b>, git will treat all redirects as
           errors. If set to <b>initial</b>, git will follow redirects only for
           the initial request to a remote, but not for subsequent
           follow-up HTTP requests. Since git uses the redirected URL as
           the base for the follow-up requests, this is generally
           sufficient. The default is <b>initial</b>.

       http.&lt;url&gt;.*
           Any of the http.* options above can be applied selectively to
           some URLs. For a config key to match a URL, each element of
           the config key is compared to that of the URL, in the
           following order:

            1. Scheme (e.g., <b>https </b>in <b><a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a> </b>). This field
               must match exactly between the config key and the URL.

            2. Host/domain name (e.g., <b>example.com </b>in
               <b><a href="https://example.com/">https://example.com/</a> </b>). This field must match between the
               config key and the URL. It is possible to specify a <b>* </b>as
               part of the host name to match all subdomains at this
               level.  <b>https://*.example.com/ </b>for example would match
               <b><a href="https://foo.example.com/">https://foo.example.com/</a> </b>, but not
               <b><a href="https://foo.bar.example.com/">https://foo.bar.example.com/</a> </b>.

            3. Port number (e.g., <b>8080 </b>in <b><a href="http://example.com:8080/">http://example.com:8080/</a> </b>).
               This field must match exactly between the config key and
               the URL. Omitted port numbers are automatically converted
               to the correct default for the scheme before matching.

            4. Path (e.g., <b>repo.git </b>in <b><a href="https://example.com/repo.git">https://example.com/repo.git</a> </b>).
               The path field of the config key must match the path
               field of the URL either exactly or as a prefix of
               slash-delimited path elements. This means a config key
               with path <b>foo/ </b>matches URL path <b>foo/bar</b>. A prefix can
               only match on a slash (<b>/</b>) boundary. Longer matches take
               precedence (so a config key with path <b>foo/bar </b>is a better
               match to URL path <b>foo/bar </b>than a config key with just
               path <b>foo/</b>).

            5. User name (e.g., <b>user </b>in
               <b>https://user@example.com/repo.git</b>). If the config key has
               a user name it must match the user name in the URL
               exactly. If the config key does not have a user name,
               that config key will match a URL with any user name
               (including none), but at a lower precedence than a config
               key with a user name.

           The list above is ordered by decreasing precedence; a URL
           that matches a config key’s path is preferred to one that
           matches its user name. For example, if the URL is
           <b>https://user@example.com/foo/bar </b>a config key match of
           <b>https://example.com/foo </b>will be preferred over a config key
           match of <b>https://user@example.com</b>.

           All URLs are normalized before attempting any matching (the
           password part, if embedded in the URL, is always ignored for
           matching purposes) so that equivalent URLs that are simply
           spelled differently will match properly. Environment variable
           settings always override any matches. The URLs that are
           matched against are those given directly to Git commands.
           This means any URLs visited as a result of a redirection do
           not participate in matching.

       i18n.commitEncoding
           Character encoding the commit messages are stored in; Git
           itself does not care per se, but this information is
           necessary e.g. when importing commits from emails or in the
           gitk graphical history browser (and possibly in other places
           in the future or in other porcelains). See e.g.
           <a href="git-mailinfo.1.html">git-mailinfo(1)</a>. Defaults to <i>utf-8</i>.

       i18n.logOutputEncoding
           Character encoding the commit messages are converted to when
           running <i>git log</i> and friends.

       imap.folder
           The folder to drop the mails into, which is typically the
           Drafts folder. For example: "INBOX.Drafts", "INBOX/Drafts" or
           "[Gmail]/Drafts". Required.

       imap.tunnel
           Command used to set up a tunnel to the IMAP server through
           which commands will be piped instead of using a direct
           network connection to the server. Required when imap.host is
           not set.

       imap.host
           A URL identifying the server. Use an <b>imap:// </b>prefix for
           non-secure connections and an <b>imaps:// </b>prefix for secure
           connections. Ignored when imap.tunnel is set, but required
           otherwise.

       imap.user
           The username to use when logging in to the server.

       imap.pass
           The password to use when logging in to the server.

       imap.port
           An integer port number to connect to on the server. Defaults
           to 143 for imap:// hosts and 993 for imaps:// hosts. Ignored
           when imap.tunnel is set.

       imap.sslverify
           A boolean to enable/disable verification of the server
           certificate used by the SSL/TLS connection. Default is <b>true</b>.
           Ignored when imap.tunnel is set.

       imap.preformattedHTML
           A boolean to enable/disable the use of html encoding when
           sending a patch. An html encoded patch will be bracketed with
           &lt;pre&gt; and have a content type of text/html. Ironically,
           enabling this option causes Thunderbird to send the patch as
           a plain/text, format=fixed email. Default is <b>false</b>.

       imap.authMethod
           Specify the authentication method for authenticating with the
           IMAP server. If Git was built with the NO_CURL option, or if
           your curl version is older than 7.34.0, or if you’re running
           git-imap-send with the <b>--no-curl </b>option, the only supported
           method is <i>CRAM-MD5</i>. If this is not set then <i>git imap-send</i>
           uses the basic IMAP plaintext LOGIN command.

       include.path, includeIf.&lt;condition&gt;.path
           Special variables to include other configuration files. See
           the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section in the main <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>
           documentation, specifically the "Includes" and "Conditional
           Includes" subsections.

       index.recordEndOfIndexEntries
           Specifies whether the index file should include an "End Of
           Index Entry" section. This reduces index load time on
           multiprocessor machines but produces a message "ignoring EOIE
           extension" when reading the index using Git versions before
           2.20. Defaults to <i>true</i> if index.threads has been explicitly
           enabled, <i>false</i> otherwise.

       index.recordOffsetTable
           Specifies whether the index file should include an "Index
           Entry Offset Table" section. This reduces index load time on
           multiprocessor machines but produces a message "ignoring IEOT
           extension" when reading the index using Git versions before
           2.20. Defaults to <i>true</i> if index.threads has been explicitly
           enabled, <i>false</i> otherwise.

       index.sparse
           When enabled, write the index using sparse-directory entries.
           This has no effect unless <b>core.sparseCheckout </b>and
           <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone </b>are both enabled. Defaults to <i>false</i>.

       index.threads
           Specifies the number of threads to spawn when loading the
           index. This is meant to reduce index load time on
           multiprocessor machines. Specifying 0 or <i>true</i> will cause Git
           to auto-detect the number of CPUs and set the number of
           threads accordingly. Specifying 1 or <i>false</i> will disable
           multithreading. Defaults to <i>true</i>.

       index.version
           Specify the version with which new index files should be
           initialized. This does not affect existing repositories. If
           <b>feature.manyFiles </b>is enabled, then the default is 4.

       index.skipHash
           When enabled, do not compute the trailing hash for the index
           file. This accelerates Git commands that manipulate the
           index, such as <b>git add</b>, <b>git commit</b>, or <b>git status</b>. Instead of
           storing the checksum, write a trailing set of bytes with
           value zero, indicating that the computation was skipped.

           If you enable <b>index.skipHash</b>, then Git clients older than
           2.13.0 will refuse to parse the index and Git clients older
           than 2.40.0 will report an error during <b>git fsck</b>.

       <b>init.templateDir</b>
           Specify the directory from which templates will be copied.
           (See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section of <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a>.)

       <b>init.defaultBranch</b>
           Allows overriding the default branch name e.g. when
           initializing a new repository.

       instaweb.browser
           Specify the program that will be used to browse your working
           repository in gitweb. See <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a>.

       instaweb.httpd
           The HTTP daemon command-line to start gitweb on your working
           repository. See <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a>.

       instaweb.local
           If true the web server started by <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a> will be
           bound to the local IP (127.0.0.1).

       instaweb.modulePath
           The default module path for <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a> to use instead of
           /usr/lib/apache2/modules. Only used if httpd is Apache.

       instaweb.port
           The port number to bind the gitweb httpd to. See
           <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a>.

       interactive.singleKey
           In interactive commands, allow the user to provide one-letter
           input with a single key (i.e., without hitting enter).
           Currently this is used by the <b>--patch </b>mode of <a href="git-add.1.html">git-add(1)</a>,
           <a href="git-checkout.1.html">git-checkout(1)</a>, <a href="git-restore.1.html">git-restore(1)</a>, <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a>, <a href="git-reset.1.html">git-reset(1)</a>,
           and <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a>.

       interactive.diffFilter
           When an interactive command (such as <b>git add --patch</b>) shows a
           colorized diff, git will pipe the diff through the shell
           command defined by this configuration variable. The command
           may mark up the diff further for human consumption, provided
           that it retains a one-to-one correspondence with the lines in
           the original diff. Defaults to disabled (no filtering).

       log.abbrevCommit
           If true, makes <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>, and
           <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a> assume <b>--abbrev-commit</b>. You may override
           this option with <b>--no-abbrev-commit</b>.

       log.date
           Set the default date-time mode for the <i>log</i> command. Setting a
           value for log.date is similar to using <i>git log</i>'s <b>--date</b>
           option. See <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> for details.

           If the format is set to "auto:foo" and the pager is in use,
           format "foo" will be used for the date format. Otherwise,
           "default" will be used.

       log.decorate
           Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by the
           log command. If <i>short</i> is specified, the ref name prefixes
           <i>refs/heads/</i>, <i>refs/tags/</i> and <i>refs/remotes/</i> will not be
           printed. If <i>full</i> is specified, the full ref name (including
           prefix) will be printed. If <i>auto</i> is specified, then if the
           output is going to a terminal, the ref names are shown as if
           <i>short</i> were given, otherwise no ref names are shown. This is
           the same as the <b>--decorate </b>option of the <b>git log</b>.

       log.initialDecorationSet
           By default, <b>git log </b>only shows decorations for certain known
           ref namespaces. If <i>all</i> is specified, then show all refs as
           decorations.

       log.excludeDecoration
           Exclude the specified patterns from the log decorations. This
           is similar to the <b>--decorate-refs-exclude </b>command-line
           option, but the config option can be overridden by the
           <b>--decorate-refs </b>option.

       log.diffMerges
           Set diff format to be used when <b>--diff-merges=on </b>is
           specified, see <b>--diff-merges </b>in <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> for details.
           Defaults to <b>separate</b>.

       log.follow
           If <b>true</b>, <b>git log </b>will act as if the <b>--follow </b>option was used
           when a single &lt;path&gt; is given. This has the same limitations
           as <b>--follow</b>, i.e. it cannot be used to follow multiple files
           and does not work well on non-linear history.

       log.graphColors
           A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used to
           draw history lines in <b>git log --graph</b>.

       log.showRoot
           If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big creation
           event. This is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree.
           Tools like <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> or <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a>, which normally
           hide the root commit will now show it. True by default.

       log.showSignature
           If true, makes <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>, and
           <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a> assume <b>--show-signature</b>.

       log.mailmap
           If true, makes <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>, and
           <a href="git-whatchanged.1.html">git-whatchanged(1)</a> assume <b>--use-mailmap</b>, otherwise assume
           <b>--no-use-mailmap</b>. True by default.

       lsrefs.unborn
           May be "advertise" (the default), "allow", or "ignore". If
           "advertise", the server will respond to the client sending
           "unborn" (as described in <a href="../man5/gitprotocol-v2.5.html">gitprotocol-v2(5)</a>) and will
           advertise support for this feature during the protocol v2
           capability advertisement. "allow" is the same as "advertise"
           except that the server will not advertise support for this
           feature; this is useful for load-balanced servers that cannot
           be updated atomically (for example), since the administrator
           could configure "allow", then after a delay, configure
           "advertise".

       mailinfo.scissors
           If true, makes <a href="git-mailinfo.1.html">git-mailinfo(1)</a> (and therefore <a href="git-am.1.html">git-am(1)</a>) act
           by default as if the --scissors option was provided on the
           command-line. When active, this feature removes everything
           from the message body before a scissors line (i.e. consisting
           mainly of "&gt;8", "8&lt;" and "-").

       mailmap.file
           The location of an augmenting mailmap file. The default
           mailmap, located in the root of the repository, is loaded
           first, then the mailmap file pointed to by this variable. The
           location of the mailmap file may be in a repository
           subdirectory, or somewhere outside of the repository itself.
           See <a href="git-shortlog.1.html">git-shortlog(1)</a> and <a href="git-blame.1.html">git-blame(1)</a>.

       mailmap.blob
           Like <b>mailmap.file</b>, but consider the value as a reference to a
           blob in the repository. If both <b>mailmap.file </b>and <b>mailmap.blob</b>
           are given, both are parsed, with entries from <b>mailmap.file</b>
           taking precedence. In a bare repository, this defaults to
           <b>HEAD:.mailmap</b>. In a non-bare repository, it defaults to
           empty.

       maintenance.auto
           This boolean config option controls whether some commands run
           <b>git maintenance run --auto </b>after doing their normal work.
           Defaults to true.

       maintenance.strategy
           This string config option provides a way to specify one of a
           few recommended schedules for background maintenance. This
           only affects which tasks are run during <b>git maintenance run</b>
           <b>--schedule=X </b>commands, provided no <b>--task=&lt;task&gt; </b>arguments
           are provided. Further, if a <b>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</b>
           config value is set, then that value is used instead of the
           one provided by <b>maintenance.strategy</b>. The possible strategy
           strings are:

           •   <b>none</b>: This default setting implies no tasks are run at
               any schedule.

           •   <b>incremental</b>: This setting optimizes for performing small
               maintenance activities that do not delete any data. This
               does not schedule the <b>gc </b>task, but runs the <b>prefetch </b>and
               <b>commit-graph </b>tasks hourly, the <b>loose-objects </b>and
               <b>incremental-repack </b>tasks daily, and the <b>pack-refs </b>task
               weekly.

       maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled
           This boolean config option controls whether the maintenance
           task with name <b>&lt;task&gt; </b>is run when no <b>--task </b>option is
           specified to <b>git maintenance run</b>. These config values are
           ignored if a <b>--task </b>option exists. By default, only
           <b>maintenance.gc.enabled </b>is true.

       maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule
           This config option controls whether or not the given <b>&lt;task&gt;</b>
           runs during a <b>git maintenance run --schedule=&lt;frequency&gt;</b>
           command. The value must be one of "hourly", "daily", or
           "weekly".

       maintenance.commit-graph.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the
           <b>commit-graph </b>task should be run as part of <b>git maintenance</b>
           <b>run --auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>commit-graph </b>task will not run
           with the <b>--auto </b>option. A negative value will force the task
           to run every time. Otherwise, a positive value implies the
           command should run when the number of reachable commits that
           are not in the commit-graph file is at least the value of
           <b>maintenance.commit-graph.auto</b>. The default value is 100.

       maintenance.loose-objects.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the
           <b>loose-objects </b>task should be run as part of <b>git maintenance</b>
           <b>run --auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>loose-objects </b>task will not run
           with the <b>--auto </b>option. A negative value will force the task
           to run every time. Otherwise, a positive value implies the
           command should run when the number of loose objects is at
           least the value of <b>maintenance.loose-objects.auto</b>. The
           default value is 100.

       maintenance.incremental-repack.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the
           <b>incremental-repack </b>task should be run as part of <b>git</b>
           <b>maintenance run --auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>incremental-repack</b>
           task will not run with the <b>--auto </b>option. A negative value
           will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive
           value implies the command should run when the number of
           pack-files not in the multi-pack-index is at least the value
           of <b>maintenance.incremental-repack.auto</b>. The default value is
           10.

       man.viewer
           Specify the programs that may be used to display help in the
           <i>man</i> format. See <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>.

       man.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified man viewer. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the man page
           passed as an argument. (See <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>.)

       man.&lt;tool&gt;.path
           Override the path for the given tool that may be used to
           display help in the <i>man</i> format. See <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a>.

       merge.conflictStyle
           Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out
           to working tree files upon merge. The default is "merge",
           which shows a <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; </b>conflict marker, changes made by one
           side, a <b>======= </b>marker, changes made by the other side, and
           then a <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </b>marker. An alternate style, "diff3", adds a
           <b>||||||| </b>marker and the original text before the <b>=======</b>
           marker. The "merge" style tends to produce smaller conflict
           regions than diff3, both because of the exclusion of the
           original text, and because when a subset of lines match on
           the two sides, they are just pulled out of the conflict
           region. Another alternate style, "zdiff3", is similar to
           diff3 but removes matching lines on the two sides from the
           conflict region when those matching lines appear near either
           the beginning or end of a conflict region.

       merge.defaultToUpstream
           If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the
           upstream branches configured for the current branch by using
           their last observed values stored in their remote-tracking
           branches. The values of the <b>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge</b>
           that name the branches at the remote named by <b>branch.&lt;current</b>
           <b>branch&gt;.remote </b>are consulted, and then they are mapped via
           <b>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch </b>to their corresponding remote-tracking
           branches, and the tips of these tracking branches are merged.
           Defaults to true.

       merge.ff
           By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when
           merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit.
           Instead, the tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded.
           When set to <b>false</b>, this variable tells Git to create an extra
           merge commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the <b>--no-ff</b>
           option from the command line). When set to <b>only</b>, only such
           fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the
           <b>--ff-only </b>option from the command line).

       merge.verifySignatures
           If true, this is equivalent to the --verify-signatures
           command line option. See <a href="git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a> for details.

       merge.branchdesc
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with
           the branch description text associated with them. Defaults to
           false.

       merge.log
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at
           most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the
           actual commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and
           true is a synonym for 20.

       merge.suppressDest
           By adding a glob that matches the names of integration
           branches to this multi-valued configuration variable, the
           default merge message computed for merges into these
           integration branches will omit "into &lt;branch name&gt;" from its
           title.

           An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list
           of globs accumulated from previous configuration entries.
           When there is no <b>merge.suppressDest </b>variable defined, the
           default value of <b>master </b>is used for backward compatibility.

       merge.renameLimit
           The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of
           rename detection during a merge. If not specified, defaults
           to the value of diff.renameLimit. If neither
           merge.renameLimit nor diff.renameLimit are specified,
           currently defaults to 7000. This setting has no effect if
           rename detection is turned off.

       merge.renames
           Whether Git detects renames. If set to "false", rename
           detection is disabled. If set to "true", basic rename
           detection is enabled. Defaults to the value of diff.renames.

       merge.directoryRenames
           Whether Git detects directory renames, affecting what happens
           at merge time to new files added to a directory on one side
           of history when that directory was renamed on the other side
           of history. If merge.directoryRenames is set to "false",
           directory rename detection is disabled, meaning that such new
           files will be left behind in the old directory. If set to
           "true", directory rename detection is enabled, meaning that
           such new files will be moved into the new directory. If set
           to "conflict", a conflict will be reported for such paths. If
           merge.renames is false, merge.directoryRenames is ignored and
           treated as false. Defaults to "conflict".

       merge.renormalize
           Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the
           repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record
           text files with CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF
           line endings). In such a repository, Git can convert the data
           recorded in commits to a canonical form before performing a
           merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more information,
           see section "Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
           attributes" in <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>.

       merge.stat
           Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the merge
           result at the end of the merge. True by default.

       merge.autoStash
           When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash
           entry before the operation begins, and apply it after the
           operation ends. This means that you can run merge on a dirty
           worktree. However, use with care: the final stash application
           after a successful merge might result in non-trivial
           conflicts. This option can be overridden by the
           <b>--no-autostash </b>and <b>--autostash </b>options of <a href="git-merge.1.html">git-merge(1)</a>.
           Defaults to false.

       merge.tool
           Controls which merge tool is used by <a href="git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool(1)</a>. The
           list below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value
           is treated as a custom merge tool and requires that a
           corresponding mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.

       merge.guitool
           Controls which merge tool is used by <a href="git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool(1)</a> when
           the -g/--gui flag is specified. The list below shows the
           valid built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom
           merge tool and requires that a corresponding
           mergetool.&lt;guitool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.

       merge.verbosity
           Controls the amount of output shown by the recursive merge
           strategy. Level 0 outputs nothing except a final error
           message if conflicts were detected. Level 1 outputs only
           conflicts, 2 outputs conflicts and file changes. Level 5 and
           above outputs debugging information. The default is level 2.
           Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY </b>environment
           variable.

       merge.&lt;driver&gt;.name
           Defines a human-readable name for a custom low-level merge
           driver. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       merge.&lt;driver&gt;.driver
           Defines the command that implements a custom low-level merge
           driver. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a> for details.

       merge.&lt;driver&gt;.recursive
           Names a low-level merge driver to be used when performing an
           internal merge between common ancestors. See <a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes(5)</a>
           for details.

       mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.path
           Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in case
           your tool is not in the PATH.

       mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd
           Specify the command to invoke the specified merge tool. The
           specified command is evaluated in shell with the following
           variables available: <i>BASE</i> is the name of a temporary file
           containing the common base of the files to be merged, if
           available; <i>LOCAL</i> is the name of a temporary file containing
           the contents of the file on the current branch; <i>REMOTE</i> is the
           name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file
           from the branch being merged; <i>MERGED</i> contains the name of the
           file to which the merge tool should write the results of a
           successful merge.

       mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.hideResolved
           Allows the user to override the global <b>mergetool.hideResolved</b>
           value for a specific tool. See <b>mergetool.hideResolved </b>for the
           full description.

       mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.trustExitCode
           For a custom merge command, specify whether the exit code of
           the merge command can be used to determine whether the merge
           was successful. If this is not set to true then the merge
           target file timestamp is checked, and the merge is assumed to
           have been successful if the file has been updated; otherwise,
           the user is prompted to indicate the success of the merge.

       mergetool.meld.hasOutput
           Older versions of <b>meld </b>do not support the <b>--output </b>option.
           Git will attempt to detect whether <b>meld </b>supports <b>--output </b>by
           inspecting the output of <b>meld --help</b>. Configuring
           <b>mergetool.meld.hasOutput </b>will make Git skip these checks and
           use the configured value instead. Setting
           <b>mergetool.meld.hasOutput </b>to <b>true </b>tells Git to unconditionally
           use the <b>--output </b>option, and <b>false </b>avoids using <b>--output</b>.

       mergetool.meld.useAutoMerge
           When the <b>--auto-merge </b>is given, meld will merge all
           non-conflicting parts automatically, highlight the
           conflicting parts, and wait for user decision. Setting
           <b>mergetool.meld.useAutoMerge </b>to <b>true </b>tells Git to
           unconditionally use the <b>--auto-merge </b>option with <b>meld</b>.
           Setting this value to <b>auto </b>makes git detect whether
           <b>--auto-merge </b>is supported and will only use <b>--auto-merge </b>when
           available. A value of <b>false </b>avoids using <b>--auto-merge</b>
           altogether, and is the default value.

       mergetool.&lt;vimdiff variant&gt;.layout
           Configure the split window layout for vimdiff’s <b>&lt;variant&gt;</b>,
           which is any of <b>vimdiff</b>, <b>nvimdiff</b>, <b>gvimdiff</b>. Upon launching
           <b>git mergetool </b>with <b>--tool=&lt;variant&gt; </b>(or without <b>--tool </b>if
           <b>merge.tool </b>is configured as <b>&lt;variant&gt;</b>), Git will consult
           <b>mergetool.&lt;variant&gt;.layout </b>to determine the tool’s layout. If
           the variant-specific configuration is not available,
           <b>vimdiff</b>'s is used as fallback. If that too is not available,
           a default layout with 4 windows will be used. To configure
           the layout, see the <b>BACKEND SPECIFIC HINTS </b>section in
           <a href="git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool(1)</a>.

       mergetool.hideResolved
           During a merge, Git will automatically resolve as many
           conflicts as possible and write the <i>MERGED</i> file containing
           conflict markers around any conflicts that it cannot resolve;
           <i>LOCAL</i> and <i>REMOTE</i> normally represent the versions of the file
           from before Git’s conflict resolution. This flag causes <i>LOCAL</i>
           and <i>REMOTE</i> to be overwritten so that only the unresolved
           conflicts are presented to the merge tool. Can be configured
           per-tool via the <b>mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.hideResolved </b>configuration
           variable. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       mergetool.keepBackup
           After performing a merge, the original file with conflict
           markers can be saved as a file with a <b>.orig </b>extension. If
           this variable is set to <b>false </b>then this file is not
           preserved. Defaults to <b>true </b>(i.e. keep the backup files).

       mergetool.keepTemporaries
           When invoking a custom merge tool, Git uses a set of
           temporary files to pass to the tool. If the tool returns an
           error and this variable is set to <b>true</b>, then these temporary
           files will be preserved; otherwise, they will be removed
           after the tool has exited. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       mergetool.writeToTemp
           Git writes temporary <i>BASE</i>, <i>LOCAL</i>, and <i>REMOTE</i> versions of
           conflicting files in the worktree by default. Git will
           attempt to use a temporary directory for these files when set
           <b>true</b>. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       mergetool.prompt
           Prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution
           program.

       mergetool.guiDefault
           Set <b>true </b>to use the <b>merge.guitool </b>by default (equivalent to
           specifying the <b>--gui </b>argument), or <b>auto </b>to select
           <b>merge.guitool </b>or <b>merge.tool </b>depending on the presence of a
           <b>DISPLAY </b>environment variable value. The default is <b>false</b>,
           where the <b>--gui </b>argument must be provided explicitly for the
           <b>merge.guitool </b>to be used.

       notes.mergeStrategy
           Which merge strategy to choose by default when resolving
           notes conflicts. Must be one of <b>manual</b>, <b>ours</b>, <b>theirs</b>, <b>union</b>,
           or <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>. Defaults to <b>manual</b>. See the "NOTES MERGE
           STRATEGIES" section of <a href="git-notes.1.html">git-notes(1)</a> for more information on
           each strategy.

           This setting can be overridden by passing the <b>--strategy</b>
           option to <a href="git-notes.1.html">git-notes(1)</a>.

       notes.&lt;name&gt;.mergeStrategy
           Which merge strategy to choose when doing a notes merge into
           refs/notes/&lt;name&gt;. This overrides the more general
           "notes.mergeStrategy". See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES"
           section in <a href="git-notes.1.html">git-notes(1)</a> for more information on the available
           strategies.

       notes.displayRef
           Which ref (or refs, if a glob or specified more than once),
           in addition to the default set by <b>core.notesRef </b>or
           <b>GIT_NOTES_REF</b>, to read notes from when showing commit
           messages with the <i>git log</i> family of commands.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF</b>
           environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of
           refs or globs.

           A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a
           glob that does not match any refs is silently ignored.

           This setting can be disabled by the <b>--no-notes </b>option to the
           <i>git log</i> family of commands, or by the <b>--notes=&lt;ref&gt; </b>option
           accepted by those commands.

           The effective value of "core.notesRef" (possibly overridden
           by GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly added to the list of
           refs to be displayed.

       notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;
           When rewriting commits with &lt;command&gt; (currently <b>amend </b>or
           <b>rebase</b>), if this variable is <b>false</b>, git will not copy notes
           from the original to the rewritten commit. Defaults to <b>true</b>.
           See also "<b>notes.rewriteRef</b>" below.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</b>
           environment variable, which must be a colon separated list of
           refs or globs.

       notes.rewriteMode
           When copying notes during a rewrite (see the
           "notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;" option), determines what to do if
           the target commit already has a note. Must be one of
           <b>overwrite</b>, <b>concatenate</b>, <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>, or <b>ignore</b>. Defaults to
           <b>concatenate</b>.

           This setting can be overridden with the
           <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE </b>environment variable.

       notes.rewriteRef
           When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully
           qualified) ref whose notes should be copied. May be a glob,
           in which case notes in all matching refs will be copied. You
           may also specify this configuration several times.

           Does not have a default value; you must configure this
           variable to enable note rewriting. Set it to
           <b>refs/notes/commits </b>to enable rewriting for the default commit
           notes.

           Can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF </b>environment
           variable. See <b>notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt; </b>above for a further
           description of its format.

       pack.window
           The size of the window used by <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> when no
           window size is given on the command line. Defaults to 10.

       pack.depth
           The maximum delta depth used by <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> when no
           maximum depth is given on the command line. Defaults to 50.
           Maximum value is 4095.

       pack.windowMemory
           The maximum size of memory that is consumed by each thread in
           <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> for pack window memory when no limit is
           given on the command line. The value can be suffixed with
           "k", "m", or "g". When left unconfigured (or set explicitly
           to 0), there will be no limit.

       pack.compression
           An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for
           objects in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no
           compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9
           being slowest. If not set, defaults to core.compression. If
           that is not set, defaults to -1, the zlib default, which is
           "a default compromise between speed and compression
           (currently equivalent to level 6)."

           Note that changing the compression level will not
           automatically recompress all existing objects. You can force
           recompression by passing the -F option to <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>.

       pack.allowPackReuse
           When true or "single", and when reachability bitmaps are
           enabled, pack-objects will try to send parts of the bitmapped
           packfile verbatim. When "multi", and when a multi-pack
           reachability bitmap is available, pack-objects will try to
           send parts of all packs in the MIDX.

           If only a single pack bitmap is available, and
           <b>pack.allowPackReuse </b>is set to "multi", reuse parts of just
           the bitmapped packfile. This can reduce memory and CPU usage
           to serve fetches, but might result in sending a slightly
           larger pack. Defaults to true.

       pack.island
           An extended regular expression configuring a set of delta
           islands. See "DELTA ISLANDS" in <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> for
           details.

       pack.islandCore
           Specify an island name which gets to have its objects be
           packed first. This creates a kind of pseudo-pack at the front
           of one pack, so that the objects from the specified island
           are hopefully faster to copy into any pack that should be
           served to a user requesting these objects. In practice this
           means that the island specified should likely correspond to
           what is the most commonly cloned in the repo. See also "DELTA
           ISLANDS" in <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a>.

       pack.deltaCacheSize
           The maximum memory in bytes used for caching deltas in
           <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> before writing them out to a pack. This
           cache is used to speed up the writing object phase by not
           having to recompute the final delta result once the best
           match for all objects is found. Repacking large repositories
           on machines which are tight with memory might be badly
           impacted by this though, especially if this cache pushes the
           system into swapping. A value of 0 means no limit. The
           smallest size of 1 byte may be used to virtually disable this
           cache. Defaults to 256 MiB.

       pack.deltaCacheLimit
           The maximum size of a delta, that is cached in
           <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a>. This cache is used to speed up the
           writing object phase by not having to recompute the final
           delta result once the best match for all objects is found.
           Defaults to 1000. Maximum value is 65535.

       pack.threads
           Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching for
           best delta matches. This requires that <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> be
           compiled with pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with
           a warning. This is meant to reduce packing time on
           multiprocessor machines. The required amount of memory for
           the delta search window is however multiplied by the number
           of threads. Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the
           number of CPUs and set the number of threads accordingly.

       pack.indexVersion
           Specify the default pack index version. Valid values are 1
           for legacy pack index used by Git versions prior to 1.5.2,
           and 2 for the new pack index with capabilities for packs
           larger than 4 GB as well as proper protection against the
           repacking of corrupted packs. Version 2 is the default. Note
           that version 2 is enforced and this config option is ignored
           whenever the corresponding pack is larger than 2 GB.

           If you have an old Git that does not understand the version 2
           <b>*.idx </b>file, cloning or fetching over a non-native protocol
           (e.g. "http") that will copy both <b>*.pack </b>file and
           corresponding <b>*.idx </b>file from the other side may give you a
           repository that cannot be accessed with your older version of
           Git. If the <b>*.pack </b>file is smaller than 2 GB, however, you
           can use <a href="git-index-pack.1.html">git-index-pack(1)</a> on the *.pack file to regenerate
           the <b>*.idx </b>file.

       pack.packSizeLimit
           The maximum size of a pack. This setting only affects packing
           to a file when repacking, i.e. the git:// protocol is
           unaffected. It can be overridden by the <b>--max-pack-size</b>
           option of <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>. Reaching this limit results in the
           creation of multiple packfiles.

           Note that this option is rarely useful, and may result in a
           larger total on-disk size (because Git will not store deltas
           between packs) and worse runtime performance (object lookup
           within multiple packs is slower than a single pack, and
           optimizations like reachability bitmaps cannot cope with
           multiple packs).

           If you need to actively run Git using smaller packfiles
           (e.g., because your filesystem does not support large files),
           this option may help. But if your goal is to transmit a
           packfile over a medium that supports limited sizes (e.g.,
           removable media that cannot store the whole repository), you
           are likely better off creating a single large packfile and
           splitting it using a generic multi-volume archive tool (e.g.,
           Unix <b>split</b>).

           The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB. The default is
           unlimited. Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are supported.

       pack.useBitmaps
           When true, git will use pack bitmaps (if available) when
           packing to stdout (e.g., during the server side of a fetch).
           Defaults to true. You should not generally need to turn this
           off unless you are debugging pack bitmaps.

       pack.useBitmapBoundaryTraversal
           When true, Git will use an experimental algorithm for
           computing reachability queries with bitmaps. Instead of
           building up complete bitmaps for all of the negated tips and
           then OR-ing them together, consider negated tips with
           existing bitmaps as additive (i.e. OR-ing them into the
           result if they exist, ignoring them otherwise), and build up
           a bitmap at the boundary instead.

           When using this algorithm, Git may include too many objects
           as a result of not opening up trees belonging to certain
           UNINTERESTING commits. This inexactness matches the
           non-bitmap traversal algorithm.

           In many cases, this can provide a speed-up over the exact
           algorithm, particularly when there is poor bitmap coverage of
           the negated side of the query.

       pack.useSparse
           When true, git will default to using the <i>--sparse</i> option in
           <i>git pack-objects</i> when the <i>--revs</i> option is present. This
           algorithm only walks trees that appear in paths that
           introduce new objects. This can have significant performance
           benefits when computing a pack to send a small change.
           However, it is possible that extra objects are added to the
           pack-file if the included commits contain certain types of
           direct renames. Default is <b>true</b>.

       pack.preferBitmapTips
           When selecting which commits will receive bitmaps, prefer a
           commit at the tip of any reference that is a suffix of any
           value of this configuration over any other commits in the
           "selection window".

           Note that setting this configuration to <b>refs/foo </b>does not
           mean that the commits at the tips of <b>refs/foo/bar </b>and
           <b>refs/foo/baz </b>will necessarily be selected. This is because
           commits are selected for bitmaps from within a series of
           windows of variable length.

           If a commit at the tip of any reference which is a suffix of
           any value of this configuration is seen in a window, it is
           immediately given preference over any other commit in that
           window.

       pack.writeBitmaps (deprecated)
           This is a deprecated synonym for <b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>.

       pack.writeBitmapHashCache
           When true, git will include a "hash cache" section in the
           bitmap index (if one is written). This cache can be used to
           feed git’s delta heuristics, potentially leading to better
           deltas between bitmapped and non-bitmapped objects (e.g.,
           when serving a fetch between an older, bitmapped pack and
           objects that have been pushed since the last gc). The
           downside is that it consumes 4 bytes per object of disk
           space. Defaults to true.

           When writing a multi-pack reachability bitmap, no new
           namehashes are computed; instead, any namehashes stored in an
           existing bitmap are permuted into their appropriate location
           when writing a new bitmap.

       pack.writeBitmapLookupTable
           When true, Git will include a "lookup table" section in the
           bitmap index (if one is written). This table is used to defer
           loading individual bitmaps as late as possible. This can be
           beneficial in repositories that have relatively large bitmap
           indexes. Defaults to false.

       pack.readReverseIndex
           When true, git will read any .rev file(s) that may be
           available (see: <a href="../man5/gitformat-pack.5.html">gitformat-pack(5)</a>). When false, the reverse
           index will be generated from scratch and stored in memory.
           Defaults to true.

       pack.writeReverseIndex
           When true, git will write a corresponding .rev file (see:
           <a href="../man5/gitformat-pack.5.html">gitformat-pack(5)</a>) for each new packfile that it writes in
           all places except for <a href="git-fast-import.1.html">git-fast-import(1)</a> and in the bulk
           checkin mechanism. Defaults to true.

       pager.&lt;cmd&gt;
           If the value is boolean, turns on or off pagination of the
           output of a particular Git subcommand when writing to a tty.
           Otherwise, turns on pagination for the subcommand using the
           pager specified by the value of <b>pager.&lt;cmd&gt;</b>. If <b>--paginate </b>or
           <b>--no-pager </b>is specified on the command line, it takes
           precedence over this option. To disable pagination for all
           commands, set <b>core.pager </b>or <b>GIT_PAGER </b>to <b>cat</b>.

       pretty.&lt;name&gt;
           Alias for a --pretty= format string, as specified in
           <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>. Any aliases defined here can be used just as the
           built-in pretty formats could. For example, running <b>git</b>
           <b>config pretty.changelog "format:* %H %s" </b>would cause the
           invocation <b>git log --pretty=changelog </b>to be equivalent to
           running <b>git log "--pretty=format:* %H %s"</b>. Note that an alias
           with the same name as a built-in format will be silently
           ignored.

       promisor.quiet
           If set to "true" assume <b>--quiet </b>when fetching additional
           objects for a partial clone.

       protocol.allow
           If set, provide a user defined default policy for all
           protocols which don’t explicitly have a policy
           (<b>protocol.&lt;name&gt;.allow</b>). By default, if unset, known-safe
           protocols (http, https, git, ssh) have a default policy of
           <b>always</b>, known-dangerous protocols (ext) have a default policy
           of <b>never</b>, and all other protocols (including file) have a
           default policy of <b>user</b>. Supported policies:

           •   <b>always </b>- protocol is always able to be used.

           •   <b>never </b>- protocol is never able to be used.

           •   <b>user </b>- protocol is only able to be used when
               <b>GIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER </b>is either unset or has a value of
               1. This policy should be used when you want a protocol to
               be directly usable by the user but don’t want it used by
               commands which execute clone/fetch/push commands without
               user input, e.g. recursive submodule initialization.

       protocol.&lt;name&gt;.allow
           Set a policy to be used by protocol <b>&lt;name&gt; </b>with
           clone/fetch/push commands. See <b>protocol.allow </b>above for the
           available policies.

           The protocol names currently used by git are:

           •   <b>file</b>: any local file-based path (including <b>file:// </b>URLs,
               or local paths)

           •   <b>git</b>: the anonymous git protocol over a direct TCP
               connection (or proxy, if configured)

           •   <b>ssh</b>: git over ssh (including <b>host:path </b>syntax, <b>ssh://</b>,
               etc).

           •   <b>http</b>: git over http, both "smart http" and "dumb http".
               Note that this does <i>not</i> include <b>https</b>; if you want to
               configure both, you must do so individually.

           •   any external helpers are named by their protocol (e.g.,
               use <b>hg </b>to allow the <b>git-remote-hg </b>helper)

       protocol.version
           If set, clients will attempt to communicate with a server
           using the specified protocol version. If the server does not
           support it, communication falls back to version 0. If unset,
           the default is <b>2</b>. Supported versions:

           •   <b>0 </b>- the original wire protocol.

           •   <b>1 </b>- the original wire protocol with the addition of a
               version string in the initial response from the server.

           •   <b>2 </b>- Wire protocol version 2, see <a href="../man5/gitprotocol-v2.5.html">gitprotocol-v2(5)</a>.

       pull.ff
           By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when
           merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit.
           Instead, the tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded.
           When set to <b>false</b>, this variable tells Git to create an extra
           merge commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the <b>--no-ff</b>
           option from the command line). When set to <b>only</b>, only such
           fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the
           <b>--ff-only </b>option from the command line). This setting
           overrides <b>merge.ff </b>when pulling.

       pull.rebase
           When true, rebase branches on top of the fetched branch,
           instead of merging the default branch from the default remote
           when "git pull" is run. See "branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase" for
           setting this on a per-branch basis.

           When <b>merges </b>(or just <i>m</i>), pass the <b>--rebase-merges </b>option to
           <i>git rebase</i> so that the local merge commits are included in
           the rebase (see <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a> for details).

           When the value is <b>interactive </b>(or just <i>i</i>), the rebase is run
           in interactive mode.

           <b>NOTE</b>: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do <b>not </b>use it
           unless you understand the implications (see <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a> for
           details).

       pull.octopus
           The default merge strategy to use when pulling multiple
           branches at once.

       pull.twohead
           The default merge strategy to use when pulling a single
           branch.

       push.autoSetupRemote
           If set to "true" assume <b>--set-upstream </b>on default push when
           no upstream tracking exists for the current branch; this
           option takes effect with push.default options <i>simple</i>,
           <i>upstream</i>, and <i>current</i>. It is useful if by default you want
           new branches to be pushed to the default remote (like the
           behavior of <i>push.default=current</i>) and you also want the
           upstream tracking to be set. Workflows most likely to benefit
           from this option are <i>simple</i> central workflows where all
           branches are expected to have the same name on the remote.

       push.default
           Defines the action <b>git push </b>should take if no refspec is
           given (whether from the command-line, config, or elsewhere).
           Different values are well-suited for specific workflows; for
           instance, in a purely central workflow (i.e. the fetch source
           is equal to the push destination), <b>upstream </b>is probably what
           you want. Possible values are:

           •   <b>nothing </b>- do not push anything (error out) unless a
               refspec is given. This is primarily meant for people who
               want to avoid mistakes by always being explicit.

           •   <b>current </b>- push the current branch to update a branch with
               the same name on the receiving end. Works in both central
               and non-central workflows.

           •   <b>upstream </b>- push the current branch back to the branch
               whose changes are usually integrated into the current
               branch (which is called <b>@{upstream}</b>). This mode only
               makes sense if you are pushing to the same repository you
               would normally pull from (i.e. central workflow).

           •   <b>tracking </b>- This is a deprecated synonym for <b>upstream</b>.

           •   <b>simple </b>- push the current branch with the same name on
               the remote.

               If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to
               the same repository you pull from, which is typically
               <b>origin</b>), then you need to configure an upstream branch
               with the same name.

               This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest
               option suited for beginners.

           •   <b>matching </b>- push all branches having the same name on both
               ends. This makes the repository you are pushing to
               remember the set of branches that will be pushed out
               (e.g. if you always push <i>maint</i> and <i>master</i> there and no
               other branches, the repository you push to will have
               these two branches, and your local <i>maint</i> and <i>master</i> will
               be pushed there).

               To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure <i>all</i>
               the branches you would push out are ready to be pushed
               out before running <i>git push</i>, as the whole point of this
               mode is to allow you to push all of the branches in one
               go. If you usually finish work on only one branch and
               push out the result, while other branches are unfinished,
               this mode is not for you. Also this mode is not suitable
               for pushing into a shared central repository, as other
               people may add new branches there, or update the tip of
               existing branches outside your control.

               This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0
               (<b>simple </b>is the new default).

       push.followTags
           If set to true, enable <b>--follow-tags </b>option by default. You
           may override this configuration at time of push by specifying
           <b>--no-follow-tags</b>.

       push.gpgSign
           May be set to a boolean value, or the string <i>if-asked</i>. A true
           value causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as if <b>--signed </b>is
           passed to <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>. The string <i>if-asked</i> causes pushes to
           be signed if the server supports it, as if <b>--signed=if-asked</b>
           is passed to <i>git push</i>. A false value may override a value
           from a lower-priority config file. An explicit command-line
           flag always overrides this config option.

       push.pushOption
           When no <b>--push-option=&lt;option&gt; </b>argument is given from the
           command line, <b>git push </b>behaves as if each &lt;value&gt; of this
           variable is given as <b>--push-option=&lt;value&gt;</b>.

           This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be
           used in a higher priority configuration file (e.g.
           <b>.git/config </b>in a repository) to clear the values inherited
           from a lower priority configuration files (e.g.
           <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b>).

               Example:

               /etc/gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = a
                 push.pushoption = b

               ~/.gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = c

               repo/.git/config
                 push.pushoption =
                 push.pushoption = b

               This will result in only b (a and c are cleared).

       push.recurseSubmodules
           May be "check", "on-demand", "only", or "no", with the same
           behavior as that of "push --recurse-submodules". If not set,
           <i>no</i> is used by default, unless <i>submodule.recurse</i> is set (in
           which case a <i>true</i> value means <i>on-demand</i>).

       push.useForceIfIncludes
           If set to "true", it is equivalent to specifying
           <b>--force-if-includes </b>as an option to <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> in the
           command line. Adding <b>--no-force-if-includes </b>at the time of
           push overrides this configuration setting.

       push.negotiate
           If set to "true", attempt to reduce the size of the packfile
           sent by rounds of negotiation in which the client and the
           server attempt to find commits in common. If "false", Git
           will rely solely on the server’s ref advertisement to find
           commits in common.

       push.useBitmaps
           If set to "false", disable use of bitmaps for "git push" even
           if <b>pack.useBitmaps </b>is "true", without preventing other git
           operations from using bitmaps. Default is true.

       rebase.backend
           Default backend to use for rebasing. Possible choices are
           <i>apply</i> or <i>merge</i>. In the future, if the merge backend gains all
           remaining capabilities of the apply backend, this setting may
           become unused.

       rebase.stat
           Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since the
           last rebase. False by default.

       rebase.autoSquash
           If set to true, enable the <b>--autosquash </b>option of
           <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a> by default for interactive mode. This can be
           overridden with the <b>--no-autosquash </b>option.

       rebase.autoStash
           When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash
           entry before the operation begins, and apply it after the
           operation ends. This means that you can run rebase on a dirty
           worktree. However, use with care: the final stash application
           after a successful rebase might result in non-trivial
           conflicts. This option can be overridden by the
           <b>--no-autostash </b>and <b>--autostash </b>options of <a href="git-rebase.1.html">git-rebase(1)</a>.
           Defaults to false.

       rebase.updateRefs
           If set to true enable <b>--update-refs </b>option by default.

       rebase.missingCommitsCheck
           If set to "warn", git rebase -i will print a warning if some
           commits are removed (e.g. a line was deleted), however the
           rebase will still proceed. If set to "error", it will print
           the previous warning and stop the rebase, <i>git rebase</i>
           <i>--edit-todo</i> can then be used to correct the error. If set to
           "ignore", no checking is done. To drop a commit without
           warning or error, use the <b>drop </b>command in the todo list.
           Defaults to "ignore".

       rebase.instructionFormat
           A format string, as specified in <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a>, to be used for
           the todo list during an interactive rebase. The format will
           automatically have the commit hash prepended to the format.

       rebase.abbreviateCommands
           If set to true, <b>git rebase </b>will use abbreviated command names
           in the todo list resulting in something like this:

                       p deadbee The oneline of the commit
                       p fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
                       ...

           instead of:

                       pick deadbee The oneline of the commit
                       pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
                       ...

           Defaults to false.

       rebase.rescheduleFailedExec
           Automatically reschedule <b>exec </b>commands that failed. This only
           makes sense in interactive mode (or when an <b>--exec </b>option was
           provided). This is the same as specifying the
           <b>--reschedule-failed-exec </b>option.

       rebase.forkPoint
           If set to false set <b>--no-fork-point </b>option by default.

       rebase.rebaseMerges
           Whether and how to set the <b>--rebase-merges </b>option by default.
           Can be <b>rebase-cousins</b>, <b>no-rebase-cousins</b>, or a boolean.
           Setting to true or to <b>no-rebase-cousins </b>is equivalent to
           <b>--rebase-merges=no-rebase-cousins</b>, setting to <b>rebase-cousins</b>
           is equivalent to <b>--rebase-merges=rebase-cousins</b>, and setting
           to false is equivalent to <b>--no-rebase-merges</b>. Passing
           <b>--rebase-merges </b>on the command line, with or without an
           argument, overrides any <b>rebase.rebaseMerges </b>configuration.

       rebase.maxLabelLength
           When generating label names from commit subjects, truncate
           the names to this length. By default, the names are truncated
           to a little less than <b>NAME_MAX </b>(to allow e.g.  <b>.lock </b>files to
           be written for the corresponding loose refs).

       receive.advertiseAtomic
           By default, git-receive-pack will advertise the atomic push
           capability to its clients. If you don’t want to advertise
           this capability, set this variable to false.

       receive.advertisePushOptions
           When set to true, git-receive-pack will advertise the push
           options capability to its clients. False by default.

       receive.autogc
           By default, git-receive-pack will run "git maintenance run
           --auto" after receiving data from git-push and updating refs.
           You can stop it by setting this variable to false.

       receive.certNonceSeed
           By setting this variable to a string, <b>git receive-pack </b>will
           accept a <b>git push --signed </b>and verify it by using a "nonce"
           protected by HMAC using this string as a secret key.

       receive.certNonceSlop
           When a <b>git push --signed </b>sends a push certificate with a
           "nonce" that was issued by a receive-pack serving the same
           repository within this many seconds, export the "nonce" found
           in the certificate to <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE </b>to the hooks
           (instead of what the receive-pack asked the sending side to
           include). This may allow writing checks in <b>pre-receive </b>and
           <b>post-receive </b>a bit easier. Instead of checking
           <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP </b>environment variable that records by
           how many seconds the nonce is stale to decide if they want to
           accept the certificate, they only can check
           <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS </b>is <b>OK</b>.

       receive.fsckObjects
           If it is set to true, git-receive-pack will check all
           received objects. See <b>transfer.fsckObjects </b>for what’s
           checked. Defaults to false. If not set, the value of
           <b>transfer.fsckObjects </b>is used instead.

       receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;
           Acts like <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>, but is used by <a href="git-receive-pack.1.html">git-receive-pack(1)</a>
           instead of <a href="git-fsck.1.html">git-fsck(1)</a>. See the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>documentation
           for details.

       receive.fsck.skipList
           Acts like <b>fsck.skipList</b>, but is used by <a href="git-receive-pack.1.html">git-receive-pack(1)</a>
           instead of <a href="git-fsck.1.html">git-fsck(1)</a>. See the <b>fsck.skipList </b>documentation
           for details.

       receive.keepAlive
           After receiving the pack from the client, <b>receive-pack </b>may
           produce no output (if <b>--quiet </b>was specified) while processing
           the pack, causing some networks to drop the TCP connection.
           With this option set, if <b>receive-pack </b>does not transmit any
           data in this phase for <b>receive.keepAlive </b>seconds, it will
           send a short keepalive packet. The default is 5 seconds; set
           to 0 to disable keepalives entirely.

       receive.unpackLimit
           If the number of objects received in a push is below this
           limit then the objects will be unpacked into loose object
           files. However if the number of received objects equals or
           exceeds this limit then the received pack will be stored as a
           pack, after adding any missing delta bases. Storing the pack
           from a push can make the push operation complete faster,
           especially on slow filesystems. If not set, the value of
           <b>transfer.unpackLimit </b>is used instead.

       receive.maxInputSize
           If the size of the incoming pack stream is larger than this
           limit, then git-receive-pack will error out, instead of
           accepting the pack file. If not set or set to 0, then the
           size is unlimited.

       receive.denyDeletes
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that
           deletes the ref. Use this to prevent such a ref deletion via
           a push.

       receive.denyDeleteCurrent
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update that
           deletes the currently checked out branch of a non-bare
           repository.

       receive.denyCurrentBranch
           If set to true or "refuse", git-receive-pack will deny a ref
           update to the currently checked out branch of a non-bare
           repository. Such a push is potentially dangerous because it
           brings the HEAD out of sync with the index and working tree.
           If set to "warn", print a warning of such a push to stderr,
           but allow the push to proceed. If set to false or "ignore",
           allow such pushes with no message. Defaults to "refuse".

           Another option is "updateInstead" which will update the
           working tree if pushing into the current branch. This option
           is intended for synchronizing working directories when one
           side is not easily accessible via interactive ssh (e.g. a
           live web site, hence the requirement that the working
           directory be clean). This mode also comes in handy when
           developing inside a VM to test and fix code on different
           Operating Systems.

           By default, "updateInstead" will refuse the push if the
           working tree or the index have any difference from the HEAD,
           but the <b>push-to-checkout </b>hook can be used to customize this.
           See <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a>.

       receive.denyNonFastForwards
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update which
           is not a fast-forward. Use this to prevent such an update via
           a push, even if that push is forced. This configuration
           variable is set when initializing a shared repository.

       receive.hideRefs
           This variable is the same as <b>transfer.hideRefs</b>, but applies
           only to <b>receive-pack </b>(and so affects pushes, but not
           fetches). An attempt to update or delete a hidden ref by <b>git</b>
           <b>push </b>is rejected.

       receive.procReceiveRefs
           This is a multi-valued variable that defines reference
           prefixes to match the commands in <b>receive-pack</b>. Commands
           matching the prefixes will be executed by an external hook
           "proc-receive", instead of the internal <b>execute_commands</b>
           function. If this variable is not defined, the "proc-receive"
           hook will never be used, and all commands will be executed by
           the internal <b>execute_commands </b>function.

           For example, if this variable is set to "refs/for", pushing
           to reference such as "refs/for/master" will not create or
           update a reference named "refs/for/master", but may create or
           update a pull request directly by running the hook
           "proc-receive".

           Optional modifiers can be provided in the beginning of the
           value to filter commands for specific actions: create (a),
           modify (m), delete (d). A <b>!  </b>can be included in the modifiers
           to negate the reference prefix entry. E.g.:

               git config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs ad:refs/heads
               git config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs !:refs/heads

       receive.updateServerInfo
           If set to true, git-receive-pack will run
           git-update-server-info after receiving data from git-push and
           updating refs.

       receive.shallowUpdate
           If set to true, .git/shallow can be updated when new refs
           require new shallow roots. Otherwise those refs are rejected.

       reftable.blockSize
           The size in bytes used by the reftable backend when writing
           blocks. The block size is determined by the writer, and does
           not have to be a power of 2. The block size must be larger
           than the longest reference name or log entry used in the
           repository, as references cannot span blocks.

           Powers of two that are friendly to the virtual memory system
           or filesystem (such as 4kB or 8kB) are recommended. Larger
           sizes (64kB) can yield better compression, with a possible
           increased cost incurred by readers during access.

           The largest block size is <b>16777215 </b>bytes (15.99 MiB). The
           default value is <b>4096 </b>bytes (4kB). A value of <b>0 </b>will use the
           default value.

       reftable.restartInterval
           The interval at which to create restart points. The reftable
           backend determines the restart points at file creation. Every
           16 may be more suitable for smaller block sizes (4k or 8k),
           every 64 for larger block sizes (64k).

           More frequent restart points reduces prefix compression and
           increases space consumed by the restart table, both of which
           increase file size.

           Less frequent restart points makes prefix compression more
           effective, decreasing overall file size, with increased
           penalties for readers walking through more records after the
           binary search step.

           A maximum of <b>65535 </b>restart points per block is supported.

           The default value is to create restart points every 16
           records. A value of <b>0 </b>will use the default value.

       reftable.indexObjects
           Whether the reftable backend shall write object blocks.
           Object blocks are a reverse mapping of object ID to the
           references pointing to them.

           The default value is <b>true</b>.

       reftable.geometricFactor
           Whenever the reftable backend appends a new table to the
           stack, it performs auto compaction to ensure that there is
           only a handful of tables. The backend does this by ensuring
           that tables form a geometric sequence regarding the
           respective sizes of each table.

           By default, the geometric sequence uses a factor of 2,
           meaning that for any table, the next-biggest table must at
           least be twice as big. A maximum factor of 256 is supported.

       remote.pushDefault
           The remote to push to by default. Overrides
           <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote </b>for all branches, and is overridden by
           <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote </b>for specific branches.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.url
           The URL of a remote repository. See <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> or
           <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl
           The push URL of a remote repository. See <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy
           For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the URL
           to the proxy to use for that remote. Set to the empty string
           to disable proxying for that remote.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxyAuthMethod
           For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the
           method to use for authenticating against the proxy in use
           (probably set in <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy</b>). See
           <b>http.proxyAuthMethod</b>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.fetch
           The default set of "refspec" for <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>. See
           <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.push
           The default set of "refspec" for <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>. See
           <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.mirror
           If true, pushing to this remote will automatically behave as
           if the <b>--mirror </b>option was given on the command line.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipDefaultUpdate
           If true, this remote will be skipped by default when updating
           using <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> or the <b>update </b>subcommand of <a href="git-remote.1.html">git-remote(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipFetchAll
           If true, this remote will be skipped by default when updating
           using <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> or the <b>update </b>subcommand of <a href="git-remote.1.html">git-remote(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.receivepack
           The default program to execute on the remote side when
           pushing. See option --receive-pack of <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.uploadpack
           The default program to execute on the remote side when
           fetching. See option --upload-pack of <a href="git-fetch-pack.1.html">git-fetch-pack(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt
           Setting this value to --no-tags disables automatic tag
           following when fetching from remote &lt;name&gt;. Setting it to
           --tags will fetch every tag from remote &lt;name&gt;, even if they
           are not reachable from remote branch heads. Passing these
           flags directly to <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> can override this setting. See
           options --tags and --no-tags of <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.vcs
           Setting this to a value &lt;vcs&gt; will cause Git to interact with
           the remote with the git-remote-&lt;vcs&gt; helper.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune
           When set to true, fetching from this remote by default will
           also remove any remote-tracking references that no longer
           exist on the remote (as if the <b>--prune </b>option was given on
           the command line). Overrides <b>fetch.prune </b>settings, if any.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.pruneTags
           When set to true, fetching from this remote by default will
           also remove any local tags that no longer exist on the remote
           if pruning is activated in general via <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune</b>,
           <b>fetch.prune </b>or <b>--prune</b>. Overrides <b>fetch.pruneTags </b>settings,
           if any.

           See also <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune </b>and the PRUNING section of
           <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.promisor
           When set to true, this remote will be used to fetch promisor
           objects.

       remote.&lt;name&gt;.partialclonefilter
           The filter that will be applied when fetching from this
           promisor remote. Changing or clearing this value will only
           affect fetches for new commits. To fetch associated objects
           for commits already present in the local object database, use
           the <b>--refetch </b>option of <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>.

       remotes.&lt;group&gt;
           The list of remotes which are fetched by "git remote update
           &lt;group&gt;". See <a href="git-remote.1.html">git-remote(1)</a>.

       repack.useDeltaBaseOffset
           By default, <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a> creates packs that use delta-base
           offset. If you need to share your repository with Git older
           than version 1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb protocol
           such as http, then you need to set this option to "false" and
           repack. Access from old Git versions over the native protocol
           are unaffected by this option.

       repack.packKeptObjects
           If set to true, makes <b>git repack </b>act as if
           <b>--pack-kept-objects </b>was passed. See <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a> for
           details. Defaults to <b>false </b>normally, but <b>true </b>if a bitmap
           index is being written (either via <b>--write-bitmap-index </b>or
           <b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>).

       repack.useDeltaIslands
           If set to true, makes <b>git repack </b>act as if <b>--delta-islands</b>
           was passed. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       repack.writeBitmaps
           When true, git will write a bitmap index when packing all
           objects to disk (e.g., when <b>git repack -a </b>is run). This index
           can speed up the "counting objects" phase of subsequent packs
           created for clones and fetches, at the cost of some disk
           space and extra time spent on the initial repack. This has no
           effect if multiple packfiles are created. Defaults to true on
           bare repos, false otherwise.

       repack.updateServerInfo
           If set to false, <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a> will not run
           <a href="git-update-server-info.1.html">git-update-server-info(1)</a>. Defaults to true. Can be
           overridden when true by the <b>-n </b>option of <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>.

       repack.cruftWindow, repack.cruftWindowMemory, repack.cruftDepth,
       repack.cruftThreads
           Parameters used by <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> when generating a
           cruft pack and the respective parameters are not given over
           the command line. See similarly named <b>pack.*  </b>configuration
           variables for defaults and meaning.

       rerere.autoUpdate
           When set to true, <b>git-rerere </b>updates the index with the
           resulting contents after it cleanly resolves conflicts using
           previously recorded resolutions. Defaults to false.

       rerere.enabled
           Activate recording of resolved conflicts, so that identical
           conflict hunks can be resolved automatically, should they be
           encountered again. By default, <a href="git-rerere.1.html">git-rerere(1)</a> is enabled if
           there is an <b>rr-cache </b>directory under the <b>$GIT_DIR</b>, e.g. if
           "rerere" was previously used in the repository.

       revert.reference
           Setting this variable to true makes <b>git revert </b>behave as if
           the <b>--reference </b>option is given.

       safe.bareRepository
           Specifies which bare repositories Git will work with. The
           currently supported values are:

           •   <b>all</b>: Git works with all bare repositories. This is the
               default.

           •   <b>explicit</b>: Git only works with bare repositories specified
               via the top-level <b>--git-dir </b>command-line option, or the
               <b>GIT_DIR </b>environment variable (see <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>).

               If you do not use bare repositories in your workflow,
               then it may be beneficial to set <b>safe.bareRepository </b>to
               <b>explicit </b>in your global config. This will protect you
               from attacks that involve cloning a repository that
               contains a bare repository and running a Git command
               within that directory.

               This config setting is only respected in protected
               configuration (see the section called “SCOPES”). This
               prevents untrusted repositories from tampering with this
               value.

       safe.directory
           These config entries specify Git-tracked directories that are
           considered safe even if they are owned by someone other than
           the current user. By default, Git will refuse to even parse a
           Git config of a repository owned by someone else, let alone
           run its hooks, and this config setting allows users to
           specify exceptions, e.g. for intentionally shared
           repositories (see the <b>--shared </b>option in <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a>).

           This is a multi-valued setting, i.e. you can add more than
           one directory via <b>git config --add</b>. To reset the list of safe
           directories (e.g. to override any such directories specified
           in the system config), add a <b>safe.directory </b>entry with an
           empty value.

           This config setting is only respected in protected
           configuration (see the section called “SCOPES”). This
           prevents untrusted repositories from tampering with this
           value.

           The value of this setting is interpolated, i.e.  <b>~/&lt;path&gt;</b>
           expands to a path relative to the home directory and
           <b>%(prefix)/&lt;path&gt; </b>expands to a path relative to Git’s
           (runtime) prefix.

           To completely opt-out of this security check, set
           <b>safe.directory </b>to the string <b>*</b>. This will allow all
           repositories to be treated as if their directory was listed
           in the <b>safe.directory </b>list. If <b>safe.directory=* </b>is set in
           system config and you want to re-enable this protection, then
           initialize your list with an empty value before listing the
           repositories that you deem safe. Giving a directory with <b>/*</b>
           appended to it will allow access to all repositories under
           the named directory.

           As explained, Git only allows you to access repositories
           owned by yourself, i.e. the user who is running Git, by
           default. When Git is running as <i>root</i> in a non Windows
           platform that provides sudo, however, git checks the SUDO_UID
           environment variable that sudo creates and will allow access
           to the uid recorded as its value in addition to the id from
           <i>root</i>. This is to make it easy to perform a common sequence
           during installation "make &amp;&amp; sudo make install". A git
           process running under <i>sudo</i> runs as <i>root</i> but the <i>sudo</i> command
           exports the environment variable to record which id the
           original user has. If that is not what you would prefer and
           want git to only trust repositories that are owned by root
           instead, then you can remove the <b>SUDO_UID </b>variable from
           root’s environment before invoking git.

       sendemail.identity
           A configuration identity. When given, causes values in the
           <i>sendemail.&lt;identity&gt;</i> subsection to take precedence over
           values in the <i>sendemail</i> section. The default identity is the
           value of <b>sendemail.identity</b>.

       sendemail.smtpEncryption
           See <a href="git-send-email.1.html">git-send-email(1)</a> for description. Note that this setting
           is not subject to the <i>identity</i> mechanism.

       sendemail.smtpSSLCertPath
           Path to ca-certificates (either a directory or a single
           file). Set it to an empty string to disable certificate
           verification.

       sendemail.&lt;identity&gt;.*
           Identity-specific versions of the <i>sendemail.*</i>  parameters
           found below, taking precedence over those when this identity
           is selected, through either the command-line or
           <b>sendemail.identity</b>.

       sendemail.multiEdit
           If true (default), a single editor instance will be spawned
           to edit files you have to edit (patches when <b>--annotate </b>is
           used, and the summary when <b>--compose </b>is used). If false,
           files will be edited one after the other, spawning a new
           editor each time.

       sendemail.confirm
           Sets the default for whether to confirm before sending. Must
           be one of <i>always</i>, <i>never</i>, <i>cc</i>, <i>compose</i>, or <i>auto</i>. See <b>--confirm</b>
           in the <a href="git-send-email.1.html">git-send-email(1)</a> documentation for the meaning of
           these values.

       sendemail.aliasesFile
           To avoid typing long email addresses, point this to one or
           more email aliases files. You must also supply
           <b>sendemail.aliasFileType</b>.

       sendemail.aliasFileType
           Format of the file(s) specified in sendemail.aliasesFile.
           Must be one of <i>mutt</i>, <i>mailrc</i>, <i>pine</i>, <i>elm</i>, <i>gnus</i>, or <i>sendmail</i>.

           What an alias file in each format looks like can be found in
           the documentation of the email program of the same name. The
           differences and limitations from the standard formats are
           described below:

           sendmail

               •   Quoted aliases and quoted addresses are not
                   supported: lines that contain a <b>" </b>symbol are ignored.

               •   Redirection to a file (<b>/path/name</b>) or pipe (<b>|command</b>)
                   is not supported.

               •   File inclusion (<b>:include: /path/name</b>) is not
                   supported.

               •   Warnings are printed on the standard error output for
                   any explicitly unsupported constructs, and any other
                   lines that are not recognized by the parser.

       sendemail.annotate, sendemail.bcc, sendemail.cc, sendemail.ccCmd,
       sendemail.chainReplyTo, sendemail.envelopeSender, sendemail.from,
       sendemail.headerCmd, sendemail.signedOffByCc, sendemail.smtpPass,
       sendemail.suppressCc, sendemail.suppressFrom, sendemail.to,
       sendemail.toCmd, sendemail.smtpDomain, sendemail.smtpServer,
       sendemail.smtpServerPort, sendemail.smtpServerOption,
       sendemail.smtpUser, sendemail.thread, sendemail.transferEncoding,
       sendemail.validate, sendemail.xmailer
           These configuration variables all provide a default for
           <a href="git-send-email.1.html">git-send-email(1)</a> command-line options. See its documentation
           for details.

       sendemail.signedOffCc (deprecated)
           Deprecated alias for <b>sendemail.signedOffByCc</b>.

       sendemail.smtpBatchSize
           Number of messages to be sent per connection, after that a
           relogin will happen. If the value is 0 or undefined, send all
           messages in one connection. See also the <b>--batch-size </b>option
           of <a href="git-send-email.1.html">git-send-email(1)</a>.

       sendemail.smtpReloginDelay
           Seconds to wait before reconnecting to the smtp server. See
           also the <b>--relogin-delay </b>option of <a href="git-send-email.1.html">git-send-email(1)</a>.

       sendemail.forbidSendmailVariables
           To avoid common misconfiguration mistakes, <a href="git-send-email.1.html">git-send-email(1)</a>
           will abort with a warning if any configuration options for
           "sendmail" exist. Set this variable to bypass the check.

       sequence.editor
           Text editor used by <b>git rebase -i </b>for editing the rebase
           instruction file. The value is meant to be interpreted by the
           shell when it is used. It can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR </b>environment variable. When not
           configured, the default commit message editor is used
           instead.

       showBranch.default
           The default set of branches for <a href="git-show-branch.1.html">git-show-branch(1)</a>. See
           <a href="git-show-branch.1.html">git-show-branch(1)</a>.

       sparse.expectFilesOutsideOfPatterns
           Typically with sparse checkouts, files not matching any
           sparsity patterns are marked with a SKIP_WORKTREE bit in the
           index and are missing from the working tree. Accordingly, Git
           will ordinarily check whether files with the SKIP_WORKTREE
           bit are in fact present in the working tree contrary to
           expectations. If Git finds any, it marks those paths as
           present by clearing the relevant SKIP_WORKTREE bits. This
           option can be used to tell Git that such
           present-despite-skipped files are expected and to stop
           checking for them.

           The default is <b>false</b>, which allows Git to automatically
           recover from the list of files in the index and working tree
           falling out of sync.

           Set this to <b>true </b>if you are in a setup where some external
           factor relieves Git of the responsibility for maintaining the
           consistency between the presence of working tree files and
           sparsity patterns. For example, if you have a Git-aware
           virtual file system that has a robust mechanism for keeping
           the working tree and the sparsity patterns up to date based
           on access patterns.

           Regardless of this setting, Git does not check for
           present-despite-skipped files unless sparse checkout is
           enabled, so this config option has no effect unless
           <b>core.sparseCheckout </b>is <b>true</b>.

       splitIndex.maxPercentChange
           When the split index feature is used, this specifies the
           percent of entries the split index can contain compared to
           the total number of entries in both the split index and the
           shared index before a new shared index is written. The value
           should be between 0 and 100. If the value is 0, then a new
           shared index is always written; if it is 100, a new shared
           index is never written. By default, the value is 20, so a new
           shared index is written if the number of entries in the split
           index would be greater than 20 percent of the total number of
           entries. See <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.

       splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire
           When the split index feature is used, shared index files that
           were not modified since the time this variable specifies will
           be removed when a new shared index file is created. The value
           "now" expires all entries immediately, and "never" suppresses
           expiration altogether. The default value is "2.weeks.ago".
           Note that a shared index file is considered modified (for the
           purpose of expiration) each time a new split-index file is
           either created based on it or read from it. See
           <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.

       ssh.variant
           By default, Git determines the command line arguments to use
           based on the basename of the configured SSH command
           (configured using the environment variable <b>GIT_SSH </b>or
           <b>GIT_SSH_COMMAND </b>or the config setting <b>core.sshCommand</b>). If
           the basename is unrecognized, Git will attempt to detect
           support of OpenSSH options by first invoking the configured
           SSH command with the <b>-G </b>(print configuration) option and will
           subsequently use OpenSSH options (if that is successful) or
           no options besides the host and remote command (if it fails).

           The config variable <b>ssh.variant </b>can be set to override this
           detection. Valid values are <b>ssh </b>(to use OpenSSH options),
           <b>plink</b>, <b>putty</b>, <b>tortoiseplink</b>, <b>simple </b>(no options except the
           host and remote command). The default auto-detection can be
           explicitly requested using the value <b>auto</b>. Any other value is
           treated as <b>ssh</b>. This setting can also be overridden via the
           environment variable <b>GIT_SSH_VARIANT</b>.

           The current command-line parameters used for each variant are
           as follows:

           •   <b>ssh </b>- [-p port] [-4] [-6] [-o option] [username@]host
               command

           •   <b>simple </b>- [username@]host command

           •   <b>plink </b>or <b>putty </b>- [-P port] [-4] [-6] [username@]host
               command

           •   <b>tortoiseplink </b>- [-P port] [-4] [-6] -batch
               [username@]host command

           Except for the <b>simple </b>variant, command-line parameters are
           likely to change as git gains new features.

       stash.showIncludeUntracked
           If this is set to true, the <b>git stash show </b>command will show
           the untracked files of a stash entry. Defaults to false. See
           the description of the <i>show</i> command in <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a>.

       stash.showPatch
           If this is set to true, the <b>git stash show </b>command without an
           option will show the stash entry in patch form. Defaults to
           false. See the description of the <i>show</i> command in
           <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a>.

       stash.showStat
           If this is set to true, the <b>git stash show </b>command without an
           option will show a diffstat of the stash entry. Defaults to
           true. See the description of the <i>show</i> command in
           <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a>.

       status.relativePaths
           By default, <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> shows paths relative to the current
           directory. Setting this variable to <b>false </b>shows paths
           relative to the repository root (this was the default for Git
           prior to v1.5.4).

       status.short
           Set to true to enable --short by default in <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a>.
           The option --no-short takes precedence over this variable.

       status.branch
           Set to true to enable --branch by default in <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a>.
           The option --no-branch takes precedence over this variable.

       status.aheadBehind
           Set to true to enable <b>--ahead-behind </b>and false to enable
           <b>--no-ahead-behind </b>by default in <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> for
           non-porcelain status formats. Defaults to true.

       status.displayCommentPrefix
           If set to true, <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> will insert a comment prefix
           before each output line (starting with <b>core.commentChar</b>, i.e.
           <b># </b>by default). This was the behavior of <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> in Git
           1.8.4 and previous. Defaults to false.

       status.renameLimit
           The number of files to consider when performing rename
           detection in <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> and <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a>. Defaults to the
           value of diff.renameLimit.

       status.renames
           Whether and how Git detects renames in <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> and
           <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> . If set to "false", rename detection is
           disabled. If set to "true", basic rename detection is
           enabled. If set to "copies" or "copy", Git will detect
           copies, as well. Defaults to the value of diff.renames.

       status.showStash
           If set to true, <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> will display the number of
           entries currently stashed away. Defaults to false.

       status.showUntrackedFiles
           By default, <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> and <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> show files which
           are not currently tracked by Git. Directories which contain
           only untracked files, are shown with the directory name only.
           Showing untracked files means that Git needs to lstat() all
           the files in the whole repository, which might be slow on
           some systems. So, this variable controls how the commands
           display the untracked files. Possible values are:

           •   <b>no </b>- Show no untracked files.

           •   <b>normal </b>- Show untracked files and directories.

           •   <b>all </b>- Show also individual files in untracked
               directories.

           If this variable is not specified, it defaults to <i>normal</i>. All
           usual spellings for Boolean value <b>true </b>are taken as <b>normal</b>
           and <b>false </b>as <b>no</b>. This variable can be overridden with the
           -u|--untracked-files option of <a href="git-status.1.html">git-status(1)</a> and
           <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a>.

       status.submoduleSummary
           Defaults to false. If this is set to a non-zero number or
           true (identical to -1 or an unlimited number), the submodule
           summary will be enabled and a summary of commits for modified
           submodules will be shown (see --summary-limit option of
           <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a>). Please note that the summary output
           command will be suppressed for all submodules when
           <b>diff.ignoreSubmodules </b>is set to <i>all</i> or only for those
           submodules where <b>submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore=all</b>. The only
           exception to that rule is that status and commit will show
           staged submodule changes. To also view the summary for
           ignored submodules you can either use the
           --ignore-submodules=dirty command-line option or the <i>git</i>
           <i>submodule summary</i> command, which shows a similar output but
           does not honor these settings.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.url
           The URL for a submodule. This variable is copied from the
           .gitmodules file to the git config via <i>git submodule init</i>.
           The user can change the configured URL before obtaining the
           submodule via <i>git submodule update</i>. If neither
           submodule.&lt;name&gt;.active nor submodule.active are set, the
           presence of this variable is used as a fallback to indicate
           whether the submodule is of interest to git commands. See
           <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a> and <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a> for details.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.update
           The method by which a submodule is updated by <i>git submodule</i>
           <i>update</i>, which is the only affected command, others such as
           <i>git checkout --recurse-submodules</i> are unaffected. It exists
           for historical reasons, when <i>git submodule</i> was the only
           command to interact with submodules; settings like
           <b>submodule.active </b>and <b>pull.rebase </b>are more specific. It is
           populated by <b>git submodule init </b>from the <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a> file.
           See description of <i>update</i> command in <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a>.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.branch
           The remote branch name for a submodule, used by <b>git submodule</b>
           <b>update --remote</b>. Set this option to override the value found
           in the <b>.gitmodules </b>file. See <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a> and
           <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a> for details.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.fetchRecurseSubmodules
           This option can be used to control recursive fetching of this
           submodule. It can be overridden by using the
           --[no-]recurse-submodules command-line option to "git fetch"
           and "git pull". This setting will override that from in the
           <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a> file.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore
           Defines under what circumstances "git status" and the diff
           family show a submodule as modified. When set to "all", it
           will never be considered modified (but it will nonetheless
           show up in the output of status and commit when it has been
           staged), "dirty" will ignore all changes to the submodule’s
           work tree and takes only differences between the HEAD of the
           submodule and the commit recorded in the superproject into
           account. "untracked" will additionally let submodules with
           modified tracked files in their work tree show up. Using
           "none" (the default when this option is not set) also shows
           submodules that have untracked files in their work tree as
           changed. This setting overrides any setting made in
           .gitmodules for this submodule, both settings can be
           overridden on the command line by using the
           "--ignore-submodules" option. The <i>git submodule</i> commands are
           not affected by this setting.

       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.active
           Boolean value indicating if the submodule is of interest to
           git commands. This config option takes precedence over the
           submodule.active config option. See <a href="../man7/gitsubmodules.7.html">gitsubmodules(7)</a> for
           details.

       submodule.active
           A repeated field which contains a pathspec used to match
           against a submodule’s path to determine if the submodule is
           of interest to git commands. See <a href="../man7/gitsubmodules.7.html">gitsubmodules(7)</a> for
           details.

       submodule.recurse
           A boolean indicating if commands should enable the
           <b>--recurse-submodules </b>option by default. Defaults to false.

           When set to true, it can be deactivated via the
           <b>--no-recurse-submodules </b>option. Note that some Git commands
           lacking this option may call some of the above commands
           affected by <b>submodule.recurse</b>; for instance <b>git remote update</b>
           will call <b>git fetch </b>but does not have a
           <b>--no-recurse-submodules </b>option. For these commands a
           workaround is to temporarily change the configuration value
           by using <b>git -c submodule.recurse=0</b>.

           The following list shows the commands that accept
           <b>--recurse-submodules </b>and whether they are supported by this
           setting.

           •   <b>checkout</b>, <b>fetch</b>, <b>grep</b>, <b>pull</b>, <b>push</b>, <b>read-tree</b>, <b>reset</b>,
               <b>restore </b>and <b>switch </b>are always supported.

           •   <b>clone </b>and <b>ls-files </b>are not supported.

           •   <b>branch </b>is supported only if <b>submodule.propagateBranches</b>
               is enabled

       submodule.propagateBranches
           [EXPERIMENTAL] A boolean that enables branching support when
           using <b>--recurse-submodules </b>or <b>submodule.recurse=true</b>.
           Enabling this will allow certain commands to accept
           <b>--recurse-submodules </b>and certain commands that already accept
           <b>--recurse-submodules </b>will now consider branches. Defaults to
           false.

       submodule.fetchJobs
           Specifies how many submodules are fetched/cloned at the same
           time. A positive integer allows up to that number of
           submodules fetched in parallel. A value of 0 will give some
           reasonable default. If unset, it defaults to 1.

       submodule.alternateLocation
           Specifies how the submodules obtain alternates when
           submodules are cloned. Possible values are <b>no</b>, <b>superproject</b>.
           By default <b>no </b>is assumed, which doesn’t add references. When
           the value is set to <b>superproject </b>the submodule to be cloned
           computes its alternates location relative to the
           superprojects alternate.

       submodule.alternateErrorStrategy
           Specifies how to treat errors with the alternates for a
           submodule as computed via <b>submodule.alternateLocation</b>.
           Possible values are <b>ignore</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>die</b>. Default is <b>die</b>. Note
           that if set to <b>ignore </b>or <b>info</b>, and if there is an error with
           the computed alternate, the clone proceeds as if no alternate
           was specified.

       tag.forceSignAnnotated
           A boolean to specify whether annotated tags created should be
           GPG signed. If <b>--annotate </b>is specified on the command line,
           it takes precedence over this option.

       tag.sort
           This variable controls the sort ordering of tags when
           displayed by <a href="git-tag.1.html">git-tag(1)</a>. Without the "--sort=&lt;value&gt;" option
           provided, the value of this variable will be used as the
           default.

       tag.gpgSign
           A boolean to specify whether all tags should be GPG signed.
           Use of this option when running in an automated script can
           result in a large number of tags being signed. It is
           therefore convenient to use an agent to avoid typing your gpg
           passphrase several times. Note that this option doesn’t
           affect tag signing behavior enabled by "-u &lt;keyid&gt;" or
           "--local-user=&lt;keyid&gt;" options.

       tar.umask
           This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits of
           tar archive entries. The default is 0002, which turns off the
           world write bit. The special value "user" indicates that the
           archiving user’s umask will be used instead. See umask(2) and
           <a href="git-archive.1.html">git-archive(1)</a>.

       Trace2 config settings are only read from the system and global
       config files; repository local and worktree config files and <b>-c</b>
       command line arguments are not respected.

       trace2.normalTarget
           This variable controls the normal target destination. It may
           be overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2 </b>environment variable. The
           following table shows possible values.

       trace2.perfTarget
           This variable controls the performance target destination. It
           may be overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2_PERF </b>environment
           variable. The following table shows possible values.

       trace2.eventTarget
           This variable controls the event target destination. It may
           be overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2_EVENT </b>environment variable.
           The following table shows possible values.

           •   <b>0 </b>or <b>false </b>- Disables the target.

           •   <b>1 </b>or <b>true </b>- Writes to <b>STDERR</b>.

           •   <b>[2-9] </b>- Writes to the already opened file descriptor.

           •   <b>&lt;absolute-pathname&gt; </b>- Writes to the file in append mode.
               If the target already exists and is a directory, the
               traces will be written to files (one per process)
               underneath the given directory.

           •   <b>af_unix:[&lt;socket-type&gt;:]&lt;absolute-pathname&gt; </b>- Write to a
               Unix DomainSocket (on platforms that support them).
               Socket type can be either <b>stream </b>or <b>dgram</b>; if omitted Git
               will try both.

       trace2.normalBrief
           Boolean. When true <b>time</b>, <b>filename</b>, and <b>line </b>fields are
           omitted from normal output. May be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_TRACE2_BRIEF </b>environment variable. Defaults to false.

       trace2.perfBrief
           Boolean. When true <b>time</b>, <b>filename</b>, and <b>line </b>fields are
           omitted from PERF output. May be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_TRACE2_PERF_BRIEF </b>environment variable. Defaults to
           false.

       trace2.eventBrief
           Boolean. When true <b>time</b>, <b>filename</b>, and <b>line </b>fields are
           omitted from event output. May be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_TRACE2_EVENT_BRIEF </b>environment variable. Defaults to
           false.

       trace2.eventNesting
           Integer. Specifies desired depth of nested regions in the
           event output. Regions deeper than this value will be omitted.
           May be overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2_EVENT_NESTING </b>environment
           variable. Defaults to 2.

       trace2.configParams
           A comma-separated list of patterns of "important" config
           settings that should be recorded in the trace2 output. For
           example, <b>core.*,remote.*.url </b>would cause the trace2 output to
           contain events listing each configured remote. May be
           overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2_CONFIG_PARAMS </b>environment
           variable. Unset by default.

       trace2.envVars
           A comma-separated list of "important" environment variables
           that should be recorded in the trace2 output. For example,
           <b>GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT,GIT_CONFIG </b>would cause the trace2 output
           to contain events listing the overrides for HTTP user agent
           and the location of the Git configuration file (assuming any
           are set). May be overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2_ENV_VARS</b>
           environment variable. Unset by default.

       trace2.destinationDebug
           Boolean. When true Git will print error messages when a trace
           target destination cannot be opened for writing. By default,
           these errors are suppressed and tracing is silently disabled.
           May be overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2_DST_DEBUG </b>environment
           variable.

       trace2.maxFiles
           Integer. When writing trace files to a target directory, do
           not write additional traces if doing so would exceed this
           many files. Instead, write a sentinel file that will block
           further tracing to this directory. Defaults to 0, which
           disables this check.

       transfer.credentialsInUrl
           A configured URL can contain plaintext credentials in the
           form <b>&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;path&gt;</b>. You may
           want to warn or forbid the use of such configuration (in
           favor of using <a href="git-credential.1.html">git-credential(1)</a>). This will be used on
           <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>, <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a>, <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>, and any other direct
           use of the configured URL.

           Note that this is currently limited to detecting credentials
           in <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.url </b>configuration; it won’t detect
           credentials in <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl </b>configuration.

           You might want to enable this to prevent inadvertent
           credentials exposure, e.g. because:

           •   The OS or system where you’re running git may not provide
               a way or otherwise allow you to configure the permissions
               of the configuration file where the username and/or
               password are stored.

           •   Even if it does, having such data stored "at rest" might
               expose you in other ways, e.g. a backup process might
               copy the data to another system.

           •   The git programs will pass the full URL to one another as
               arguments on the command-line, meaning the credentials
               will be exposed to other unprivileged users on systems
               that allow them to see the full process list of other
               users. On linux the "hidepid" setting documented in
               procfs(5) allows for configuring this behavior.

               If such concerns don’t apply to you then you probably
               don’t need to be concerned about credentials exposure due
               to storing sensitive data in git’s configuration files.
               If you do want to use this, set <b>transfer.credentialsInUrl</b>
               to one of these values:

           •   <b>allow </b>(default): Git will proceed with its activity
               without warning.

           •   <b>warn</b>: Git will write a warning message to <b>stderr </b>when
               parsing a URL with a plaintext credential.

           •   <b>die</b>: Git will write a failure message to <b>stderr </b>when
               parsing a URL with a plaintext credential.

       transfer.fsckObjects
           When <b>fetch.fsckObjects </b>or <b>receive.fsckObjects </b>are not set,
           the value of this variable is used instead. Defaults to
           false.

           When set, the fetch or receive will abort in the case of a
           malformed object or a link to a nonexistent object. In
           addition, various other issues are checked for, including
           legacy issues (see <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>), and potential security
           issues like the existence of a <b>.GIT </b>directory or a malicious
           <b>.gitmodules </b>file (see the release notes for v2.2.1 and
           v2.17.1 for details). Other sanity and security checks may be
           added in future releases.

           On the receiving side, failing fsckObjects will make those
           objects unreachable, see "QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT" in
           <a href="git-receive-pack.1.html">git-receive-pack(1)</a>. On the fetch side, malformed objects
           will instead be left unreferenced in the repository.

           Due to the non-quarantine nature of the <b>fetch.fsckObjects</b>
           implementation it cannot be relied upon to leave the object
           store clean like <b>receive.fsckObjects </b>can.

           As objects are unpacked they’re written to the object store,
           so there can be cases where malicious objects get introduced
           even though the "fetch" failed, only to have a subsequent
           "fetch" succeed because only new incoming objects are
           checked, not those that have already been written to the
           object store. That difference in behavior should not be
           relied upon. In the future, such objects may be quarantined
           for "fetch" as well.

           For now, the paranoid need to find some way to emulate the
           quarantine environment if they’d like the same protection as
           "push". E.g. in the case of an internal mirror do the
           mirroring in two steps, one to fetch the untrusted objects,
           and then do a second "push" (which will use the quarantine)
           to another internal repo, and have internal clients consume
           this pushed-to repository, or embargo internal fetches and
           only allow them once a full "fsck" has run (and no new
           fetches have happened in the meantime).

       transfer.hideRefs
           String(s) <b>receive-pack </b>and <b>upload-pack </b>use to decide which
           refs to omit from their initial advertisements. Use more than
           one definition to specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that
           is under the hierarchies listed in the value of this variable
           is excluded, and is hidden when responding to <b>git push </b>or <b>git</b>
           <b>fetch</b>. See <b>receive.hideRefs </b>and <b>uploadpack.hideRefs </b>for
           program-specific versions of this config.

           You may also include a <b>!  </b>in front of the ref name to negate
           the entry, explicitly exposing it, even if an earlier entry
           marked it as hidden. If you have multiple hideRefs values,
           later entries override earlier ones (and entries in
           more-specific config files override less-specific ones).

           If a namespace is in use, the namespace prefix is stripped
           from each reference before it is matched against
           <b>transfer.hiderefs </b>patterns. In order to match refs before
           stripping, add a <b>^ </b>in front of the ref name. If you combine <b>!</b>
           and <b>^</b>, <b>!  </b>must be specified first.

           For example, if <b>refs/heads/master </b>is specified in
           <b>transfer.hideRefs </b>and the current namespace is <b>foo</b>, then
           <b>refs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master </b>is omitted from the
           advertisements. If <b>uploadpack.allowRefInWant </b>is set,
           <b>upload-pack </b>will treat <b>want-ref refs/heads/master </b>in a
           protocol v2 <b>fetch </b>command as if
           <b>refs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master </b>did not exist.
           <b>receive-pack</b>, on the other hand, will still advertise the
           object id the ref is pointing to without mentioning its name
           (a so-called ".have" line).

           Even if you hide refs, a client may still be able to steal
           the target objects via the techniques described in the
           "SECURITY" section of the <a href="../man7/gitnamespaces.7.html">gitnamespaces(7)</a> man page; it’s
           best to keep private data in a separate repository.

       transfer.unpackLimit
           When <b>fetch.unpackLimit </b>or <b>receive.unpackLimit </b>are not set,
           the value of this variable is used instead. The default value
           is 100.

       transfer.advertiseSID
           Boolean. When true, client and server processes will
           advertise their unique session IDs to their remote
           counterpart. Defaults to false.

       transfer.bundleURI
           When <b>true</b>, local <b>git clone </b>commands will request bundle
           information from the remote server (if advertised) and
           download bundles before continuing the clone through the Git
           protocol. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       transfer.advertiseObjectInfo
           When <b>true</b>, the <b>object-info </b>capability is advertised by
           servers. Defaults to false.

       uploadarchive.allowUnreachable
           If true, allow clients to use <b>git archive --remote </b>to request
           any tree, whether reachable from the ref tips or not. See the
           discussion in the "SECURITY" section of <a href="git-upload-archive.1.html">git-upload-archive(1)</a>
           for more details. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       uploadpack.hideRefs
           This variable is the same as <b>transfer.hideRefs</b>, but applies
           only to <b>upload-pack </b>(and so affects only fetches, not
           pushes). An attempt to fetch a hidden ref by <b>git fetch </b>will
           fail. See also <b>uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant</b>.

       uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant
           When <b>uploadpack.hideRefs </b>is in effect, allow <b>upload-pack </b>to
           accept a fetch request that asks for an object at the tip of
           a hidden ref (by default, such a request is rejected). See
           also <b>uploadpack.hideRefs</b>. Even if this is false, a client may
           be able to steal objects via the techniques described in the
           "SECURITY" section of the <a href="../man7/gitnamespaces.7.html">gitnamespaces(7)</a> man page; it’s
           best to keep private data in a separate repository.

       uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant
           Allow <b>upload-pack </b>to accept a fetch request that asks for an
           object that is reachable from any ref tip. However, note that
           calculating object reachability is computationally expensive.
           Defaults to <b>false</b>. Even if this is false, a client may be
           able to steal objects via the techniques described in the
           "SECURITY" section of the <a href="../man7/gitnamespaces.7.html">gitnamespaces(7)</a> man page; it’s
           best to keep private data in a separate repository.

       uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant
           Allow <b>upload-pack </b>to accept a fetch request that asks for any
           object at all. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       uploadpack.keepAlive
           When <b>upload-pack </b>has started <b>pack-objects</b>, there may be a
           quiet period while <b>pack-objects </b>prepares the pack. Normally
           it would output progress information, but if <b>--quiet </b>was used
           for the fetch, <b>pack-objects </b>will output nothing at all until
           the pack data begins. Some clients and networks may consider
           the server to be hung and give up. Setting this option
           instructs <b>upload-pack </b>to send an empty keepalive packet every
           <b>uploadpack.keepAlive </b>seconds. Setting this option to 0
           disables keepalive packets entirely. The default is 5
           seconds.

       uploadpack.packObjectsHook
           If this option is set, when <b>upload-pack </b>would run <b>git</b>
           <b>pack-objects </b>to create a packfile for a client, it will run
           this shell command instead. The <b>pack-objects </b>command and
           arguments it <i>would</i> have run (including the <b>git pack-objects</b>
           at the beginning) are appended to the shell command. The
           stdin and stdout of the hook are treated as if <b>pack-objects</b>
           itself was run. I.e., <b>upload-pack </b>will feed input intended
           for <b>pack-objects </b>to the hook, and expects a completed
           packfile on stdout.

           Note that this configuration variable is only respected when
           it is specified in protected configuration (see the section
           called “SCOPES”). This is a safety measure against fetching
           from untrusted repositories.

       uploadpack.allowFilter
           If this option is set, <b>upload-pack </b>will support partial clone
           and partial fetch object filtering.

       uploadpackfilter.allow
           Provides a default value for unspecified object filters (see:
           the below configuration variable). If set to <b>true</b>, this will
           also enable all filters which get added in the future.
           Defaults to <b>true</b>.

       uploadpackfilter.&lt;filter&gt;.allow
           Explicitly allow or ban the object filter corresponding to
           <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;filter&gt; </b>may be one of: <b>blob:none</b>,
           <b>blob:limit</b>, <b>object:type</b>, <b>tree</b>, <b>sparse:oid</b>, or <b>combine</b>. If
           using combined filters, both <b>combine </b>and all of the nested
           filter kinds must be allowed. Defaults to
           <b>uploadpackfilter.allow</b>.

       uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth
           Only allow <b>--filter=tree:&lt;n&gt; </b>when <b>&lt;n&gt; </b>is no more than the
           value of <b>uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth</b>. If set, this also
           implies <b>uploadpackfilter.tree.allow=true</b>, unless this
           configuration variable had already been set. Has no effect if
           unset.

       uploadpack.allowRefInWant
           If this option is set, <b>upload-pack </b>will support the
           <b>ref-in-want </b>feature of the protocol version 2 <b>fetch </b>command.
           This feature is intended for the benefit of load-balanced
           servers which may not have the same view of what OIDs their
           refs point to due to replication delay.

       url.&lt;base&gt;.insteadOf
           Any URL that starts with this value will be rewritten to
           start, instead, with &lt;base&gt;. In cases where some site serves
           a large number of repositories, and serves them with multiple
           access methods, and some users need to use different access
           methods, this feature allows people to specify any of the
           equivalent URLs and have Git automatically rewrite the URL to
           the best alternative for the particular user, even for a
           never-before-seen repository on the site. When more than one
           insteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest match is
           used.

           Note that any protocol restrictions will be applied to the
           rewritten URL. If the rewrite changes the URL to use a custom
           protocol or remote helper, you may need to adjust the
           <b>protocol.*.allow </b>config to permit the request. In particular,
           protocols you expect to use for submodules must be set to
           <b>always </b>rather than the default of <b>user</b>. See the description
           of <b>protocol.allow </b>above.

       url.&lt;base&gt;.pushInsteadOf
           Any URL that starts with this value will not be pushed to;
           instead, it will be rewritten to start with &lt;base&gt;, and the
           resulting URL will be pushed to. In cases where some site
           serves a large number of repositories, and serves them with
           multiple access methods, some of which do not allow push,
           this feature allows people to specify a pull-only URL and
           have Git automatically use an appropriate URL to push, even
           for a never-before-seen repository on the site. When more
           than one pushInsteadOf strings match a given URL, the longest
           match is used. If a remote has an explicit pushurl, Git will
           ignore this setting for that remote.

       user.name, user.email, author.name, author.email, committer.name,
       committer.email
           The <b>user.name </b>and <b>user.email </b>variables determine what ends up
           in the <b>author </b>and <b>committer </b>fields of commit objects. If you
           need the <b>author </b>or <b>committer </b>to be different, the
           <b>author.name</b>, <b>author.email</b>, <b>committer.name</b>, or <b>committer.email</b>
           variables can be set. All of these can be overridden by the
           <b>GIT_AUTHOR_NAME</b>, <b>GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL</b>, <b>GIT_COMMITTER_NAME</b>,
           <b>GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL</b>, and <b>EMAIL </b>environment variables.

           Note that the <b>name </b>forms of these variables conventionally
           refer to some form of a personal name. See <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> and
           the environment variables section of <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> for more
           information on these settings and the <b>credential.username</b>
           option if you’re looking for authentication credentials
           instead.

       user.useConfigOnly
           Instruct Git to avoid trying to guess defaults for <b>user.email</b>
           and <b>user.name</b>, and instead retrieve the values only from the
           configuration. For example, if you have multiple email
           addresses and would like to use a different one for each
           repository, then with this configuration option set to <b>true</b>
           in the global config along with a name, Git will prompt you
           to set up an email before making new commits in a newly
           cloned repository. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

       user.signingKey
           If <a href="git-tag.1.html">git-tag(1)</a> or <a href="git-commit.1.html">git-commit(1)</a> is not selecting the key you
           want it to automatically when creating a signed tag or
           commit, you can override the default selection with this
           variable. This option is passed unchanged to gpg’s
           --local-user parameter, so you may specify a key using any
           method that gpg supports. If gpg.format is set to <b>ssh </b>this
           can contain the path to either your private ssh key or the
           public key when ssh-agent is used. Alternatively it can
           contain a public key prefixed with <b>key:: </b>directly (e.g.:
           "key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier"). The private key needs to
           be available via ssh-agent. If not set Git will call
           gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand (e.g.: "ssh-add -L") and try to use
           the first key available. For backward compatibility, a raw
           key which begins with "ssh-", such as "ssh-rsa XXXXXX
           identifier", is treated as "key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier",
           but this form is deprecated; use the <b>key:: </b>form instead.

       versionsort.prereleaseSuffix (deprecated)
           Deprecated alias for <b>versionsort.suffix</b>. Ignored if
           <b>versionsort.suffix </b>is set.

       versionsort.suffix
           Even when version sort is used in <a href="git-tag.1.html">git-tag(1)</a>, tagnames with
           the same base version but different suffixes are still sorted
           lexicographically, resulting e.g. in prerelease tags
           appearing after the main release (e.g. "1.0-rc1" after
           "1.0"). This variable can be specified to determine the
           sorting order of tags with different suffixes.

           By specifying a single suffix in this variable, any tagname
           containing that suffix will appear before the corresponding
           main release. E.g. if the variable is set to "-rc", then all
           "1.0-rcX" tags will appear before "1.0". If specified
           multiple times, once per suffix, then the order of suffixes
           in the configuration will determine the sorting order of
           tagnames with those suffixes. E.g. if "-pre" appears before
           "-rc" in the configuration, then all "1.0-preX" tags will be
           listed before any "1.0-rcX" tags. The placement of the main
           release tag relative to tags with various suffixes can be
           determined by specifying the empty suffix among those other
           suffixes. E.g. if the suffixes "-rc", "", "-ck", and "-bfs"
           appear in the configuration in this order, then all
           "v4.8-rcX" tags are listed first, followed by "v4.8", then
           "v4.8-ckX" and finally "v4.8-bfsX".

           If more than one suffix matches the same tagname, then that
           tagname will be sorted according to the suffix which starts
           at the earliest position in the tagname. If more than one
           different matching suffix starts at that earliest position,
           then that tagname will be sorted according to the longest of
           those suffixes. The sorting order between different suffixes
           is undefined if they are in multiple config files.

       web.browser
           Specify a web browser that may be used by some commands.
           Currently only <a href="git-instaweb.1.html">git-instaweb(1)</a> and <a href="git-help.1.html">git-help(1)</a> may use it.

       worktree.guessRemote
           If no branch is specified and neither <b>-b </b>nor <b>-B </b>nor <b>--detach</b>
           is used, then <b>git worktree add </b>defaults to creating a new
           branch from HEAD. If <b>worktree.guessRemote </b>is set to true,
           <b>worktree add </b>tries to find a remote-tracking branch whose
           name uniquely matches the new branch name. If such a branch
           exists, it is checked out and set as "upstream" for the new
           branch. If no such match can be found, it falls back to
           creating a new branch from the current HEAD.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       When using the deprecated <b>[section.subsection] </b>syntax, changing a
       value will result in adding a multi-line key instead of a change,
       if the subsection is given with at least one uppercase character.
       For example when the config looks like

             [section.subsection]
               key = value1

       and running <b>git config section.Subsection.key value2 </b>will result
       in

             [section.subsection]
