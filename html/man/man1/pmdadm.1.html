NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdadm </b>- Device Mapper PMDA
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdadm </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       metric values for Device Mapper on the local system.

       This PMDA collects its data through the <a href="../man8/dmsetup.8.html">dmsetup(8)</a> utility and
       the dmstats API and requires that the program is installed in
       order to function.  In addition, at least one statistics region
       must be created using the <a href="../man8/dmstats.8.html">dmstats(8)</a> utility in order to get
       basic counter values.  See below for examples.

       Note that device-mapper statistics collection is not enabled by
       default and is not persistent across reboots (unless a system
       administrator has configured something to run in <b>rc.local </b>or
       equivalent).  This is because there are overheads associated with
       statistics collection.  In addition, the <b>pmdadm </b>PMDA does not
       automatically enable any statistics collection because it may not
       be the only consumer of the data.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       Install the DM PMDA by using the Install script as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dm</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, the following must be done as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dm</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdadm </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The <b>Install </b>and <b>Remove </b>scripts notify <b>pmcd </b>when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       This PMDA uses the dmstats API (the userspace device-mapper
       support library) to capture device-mapper performance data.
       Using this PMDA, users need the userspace device-mapper support
       library (libdevmapper) and the userspace command line tool
       <a href="../man8/dmstats.8.html">dmstats(8)</a>.  Before device-mapper metrics will be available for
       PCP, statistics regions have to be created.  For example, to
       enable basic statistics for all local device-mapper logical
       devices, use the following command:

            # dmstats create --alldevices

       To create statistics regions with specified histogram boundaries,
       use the following:

            # dmstats create --alldevices --bounds <i>histogram_boundaries</i>

       Specify the boundaries of a latency histogram to be tracked for
       the region as a comma separated list of latency values. Latency
       values are given in nanoseconds. An optional unit suffix of <b>ns</b>,
       <b>us</b>, <b>ms</b>, or <b>s </b>may be given after each value to specify units of
       nanoseconds, microseconds, miliseconds or seconds respectively.
       For example,

            # dmstats create --alldevices --bounds 10us,30us,50us,70us,90us

       Further details and more complex examples can be found in
       <a href="../man8/dmstats.8.html">dmstats(8)</a>.

METRICS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Basic Counters</b>
           Basic counters provide access to the raw counter data from
           the kernel, allowing further processing to be carried out by
           another program.
           The Kernel provides thirteen separate counters for each
           statistics area.  The first eleven of these match the
           counters provided in /proc/diskstats or /sys/block/*/*/stat.
           The final pair provide separate counters for read and write
           time.

           <b>dmstats.read</b>
               Count of reads completed this interval per device-mapper
               device.

           <b>dmstats.reads_merged</b>
               Count of reads merged this interval per device-mapper
               device.

           <b>dmstats.read_bytes</b>
               Count of kbytes read this interval per device-mapper
               device.

           <b>dmstats.reads_time</b>
               Accumulated duration of all read requests per device-
               mapper device.

           <b>dmstats.write</b>
               Count of writes completed this interval per device-mapper
               device.

           <b>dmstats.writes_merged</b>
               Count of writes completed this interval per device-mapper
               device.

           <b>dmstats.write_bytes</b>
               Count of kbytes write this interval per device-mapper
               device.

           <b>dmstats.writes_time</b>
               Accumulated duration of all write requests per device-
               mapper device.

           <b>dmstats.in_progress</b>
               Count of requests currently in progress per device-mapper
               device.

           <b>dmstats.io_ticks</b>
               Nanoseconds spent servicing request per device-mapper
               device.

           <b>dmstats.queue_ticks</b>
               This field is incremented at each I/O start, I/O
               completion, I/O merge, or read of these stats by the
               number of I/Os in progress multiplied by the number of
               nanoseconds spent doing I/O since the last update of this
               field. This can provide an easy measure of both I/O
               completion time and the backlog that may be accumulating.

           <b>dmstats.read_ticks</b>
               Nanoseconds spent servicing reads per device-mapper
               device.

           <b>dmstats.write_ticks</b>
               Nanoseconds spent servicing writes per device-mapper
               device.

       <b>Histogram fields</b>
           Histograms measure the frequency distribution of user
           specified I/O latency intervals.  Histogram bin boundaries
           are specified when a region is created.
           Instance name represents devicename, region id and bin
           boundaries.

           <b>dmstats.histogram.hist_count</b>
               A list of the histogram counts for the current statistics
               area in order of ascending latency value. Each value
               represents the number of I/Os with latency times falling
               into that bin's time range during the sample period.

           <b>dmstats.histogram.hist.bins</b>
               The number of latency histogram bins configured for the
               area.
