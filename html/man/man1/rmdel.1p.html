PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rmdel — remove a delta from an SCCS file (<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       rmdel -r <i>SID file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>rmdel</i> utility shall remove the delta specified by the SID
       from each named SCCS file. The delta to be removed shall be the
       most recent delta in its branch in the delta chain of each named
       SCCS file. In addition, the application shall ensure that the SID
       specified is not that of a version being edited for the purpose
       of making a delta; that is, if a <i>p-file</i> (see <a href="get.1p.html">get(1p)</a>) exists for
       the named SCCS file, the SID specified shall not appear in any
       entry of the <i>p-file</i>.

       Removal of a delta shall be restricted to:

        1. The user who made the delta

        2. The owner of the SCCS file

        3. The owner of the directory containing the SCCS file
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>rmdel</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-r </b><i>SID</i>    Specify the SCCS identification string (<i>SID</i>) of the
                 delta to be deleted.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
                 <i>file</i> is a directory, the <i>rmdel</i> utility shall behave as
                 though each file in the directory were specified as a
                 named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
                 of the pathname does not begin with <b>s.</b>)  and unreadable
                 files shall be silently ignored.

                 If exactly one <i>file</i> operand appears, and it is <b>'-'</b>, the
                 standard input shall be read; each line of the standard
                 input is taken to be the name of an SCCS file to be
                 processed. Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall be
                 silently ignored.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be a text file used only when the <i>file</i>
       operand is specified as <b>'-'</b>.  Each line of the text file shall be
       interpreted as an SCCS pathname.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The SCCS files shall be files of unspecified format.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>rmdel</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The SCCS files shall be files of unspecified format. During
       processing of a <i>file</i>, a temporary <i>x-file</i>, as described in
       <a href="admin.1p.html">admin(1p)</a>, may be created and deleted; a locking <i>z-file</i>, as
       described in <a href="get.1p.html">get(1p)</a>, may be created and deleted.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:
