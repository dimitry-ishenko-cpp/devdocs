NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fc — process the command history list
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       fc <b>[</b>-r<b>] [</b>-e <i>editor</i><b>] [</b><i>first</i> <b>[</b><i>last</i><b>]]</b>

       fc -l <b>[</b>-nr<b>] [</b><i>first</i> <b>[</b><i>last</i><b>]]</b>

       fc -s <b>[</b><i>old</i>=<i>new</i><b>] [</b><i>first</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fc</i> utility shall list, or shall edit and re-execute, commands
       previously entered to an interactive <i>sh</i>.

       The command history list shall reference commands by number. The
       first number in the list is selected arbitrarily. The
       relationship of a number to its command shall not change except
       when the user logs in and no other process is accessing the list,
       at which time the system may reset the numbering to start the
       oldest retained command at another number (usually 1). When the
       number reaches an implementation-defined upper limit, which shall
       be no smaller than the value in <i>HISTSIZE</i> or 32767 (whichever is
       greater), the shell may wrap the numbers, starting the next
       command with a lower number (usually 1). However, despite this
       optional wrapping of numbers, <i>fc</i> shall maintain the time-ordering
       sequence of the commands. For example, if four commands in
       sequence are given the numbers 32766, 32767, 1 (wrapped), and 2
       as they are executed, command 32767 is considered the command
       previous to 1, even though its number is higher.

       When commands are edited (when the <b>-l </b>option is not specified),
       the resulting lines shall be entered at the end of the history
       list and then re-executed by <i>sh</i>.  The <i>fc</i> command that caused the
       editing shall not be entered into the history list. If the editor
       returns a non-zero exit status, this shall suppress the entry
       into the history list and the command re-execution.  Any command
       line variable assignments or redirection operators used with <i>fc</i>
       shall affect both the <i>fc</i> command itself as well as the command
       that results; for example:

           fc -s -- -1 2&gt;/dev/null

       reinvokes the previous command, suppressing standard error for
       both <i>fc</i> and the previous command.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fc</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-e </b><i>editor</i> Use the editor named by <i>editor</i> to edit the commands.
                 The <i>editor</i> string is a utility name, subject to search
                 via the <i>PATH</i> variable (see the Base Definitions volume
                 of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 8</i>, <i>Environment Variables</i>).
                 The value in the <i>FCEDIT</i> variable shall be used as a
                 default when <b>-e </b>is not specified. If <i>FCEDIT</i> is null or
                 unset, <i>ed</i> shall be used as the editor.

       <b>-l        </b>(The letter ell.) List the commands rather than
                 invoking an editor on them. The commands shall be
                 written in the sequence indicated by the <i>first</i> and <i>last</i>
                 operands, as affected by <b>-r</b>, with each command preceded
                 by the command number.

       <b>-n        </b>Suppress command numbers when listing with <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-r        </b>Reverse the order of the commands listed (with <b>-l</b>) or
                 edited (with neither <b>-l </b>nor <b>-s</b>).

       <b>-s        </b>Re-execute the command without invoking an editor.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>first</i>, <i>last</i>
                 Select the commands to list or edit. The number of
                 previous commands that can be accessed shall be
                 determined by the value of the <i>HISTSIZE</i> variable. The
                 value of <i>first</i> or <i>last</i> or both shall be one of the
                 following:

                 <b>[+]</b><i>number</i> A positive number representing a command
                           number; command numbers can be displayed with
                           the <b>-l </b>option.

                 <b>-</b><i>number</i>   A negative decimal number representing the
                           command that was executed <i>number</i> of commands
                           previously. For example, -1 is the
                           immediately previous command.

                 <i>string</i>    A string indicating the most recently entered
                           command that begins with that string. If the
                           <i>old</i>=<i>new</i> operand is not also specified with
                           <b>-s</b>, the string form of the <i>first</i> operand
                           cannot contain an embedded &lt;equals-sign&gt;.

                 When the synopsis form with <b>-s </b>is used:

                  *  If <i>first</i> is omitted, the previous command shall be
                     used.

                 For the synopsis forms without <b>-s</b>:

                  *  If <i>last</i> is omitted, <i>last</i> shall default to the
                     previous command when <b>-l </b>is specified; otherwise,
                     it shall default to <i>first</i>.

                  *  If <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> are both omitted, the previous 16
                     commands shall be listed or the previous single
                     command shall be edited (based on the <b>-l </b>option).

                  *  If <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> are both present, all of the
                     commands from <i>first</i> to <i>last</i> shall be edited
                     (without <b>-l</b>) or listed (with <b>-l</b>).  Editing multiple
                     commands shall be accomplished by presenting to the
                     editor all of the commands at one time, each
                     command starting on a new line. If <i>first</i> represents
                     a newer command than <i>last</i>, the commands shall be
                     listed or edited in reverse sequence, equivalent to
                     using <b>-r</b>.  For example, the following commands on
                     the first line are equivalent to the corresponding
                     commands on the second:

                         fc -r 10 20    fc    30 40
                         fc    20 10    fc -r 40 30

                  *  When a range of commands is used, it shall not be
                     an error to specify <i>first</i> or <i>last</i> values that are
                     not in the history list; <i>fc</i> shall substitute the
                     value representing the oldest or newest command in
                     the list, as appropriate. For example, if there are
                     only ten commands in the history list, numbered 1
                     to 10:

                         fc -l
                         fc 1 99

                     shall list and edit, respectively, all ten
                     commands.

       <i>old</i>=<i>new</i>   Replace the first occurrence of string <i>old</i> in the
                 commands to be re-executed by the string <i>new</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>fc</i>:

       <i>FCEDIT</i>    This variable, when expanded by the shell, shall
                 determine the default value for the <b>-e </b><i>editor</i> option's
                 <i>editor</i> option-argument. If <i>FCEDIT</i> is null or unset, <i>ed</i>
                 shall be used as the editor.

       <i>HISTFILE</i>  Determine a pathname naming a command history file. If
                 the <i>HISTFILE</i> variable is not set, the shell may attempt
                 to access or create a file <b>.sh_history </b>in the directory
                 referred to by the <i>HOME</i> environment variable. If the
                 shell cannot obtain both read and write access to, or
                 create, the history file, it shall use an unspecified
                 mechanism that allows the history to operate properly.
                 (References to history ``file'' in this section shall
                 be understood to mean this unspecified mechanism in
                 such cases.) An implementation may choose to access
                 this variable only when initializing the history file;
                 this initialization shall occur when <i>fc</i> or <i>sh</i> first
                 attempt to retrieve entries from, or add entries to,
                 the file, as the result of commands issued by the user,
                 the file named by the <i>ENV</i> variable, or implementation-
                 defined system start-up files. In some historical
                 shells, the history file is initialized just after the
                 <i>ENV</i> file has been processed. Therefore, it is
                 implementation-defined whether changes made to <i>HISTFILE</i>
                 after the history file has been initialized are
                 effective.  Implementations may choose to disable the
                 history list mechanism for users with appropriate
                 privileges who do not set <i>HISTFILE</i>; the specific
                 circumstances under which this occurs are
                 implementation-defined. If more than one instance of
                 the shell is using the same history file, it is
                 unspecified how updates to the history file from those
                 shells interact. As entries are deleted from the
                 history file, they shall be deleted oldest first. It is
                 unspecified when history file entries are physically
                 removed from the history file.

       <i>HISTSIZE</i>  Determine a decimal number representing the limit to
                 the number of previous commands that are accessible. If
                 this variable is unset, an unspecified default greater
                 than or equal to 128 shall be used. The maximum number
                 of commands in the history list is unspecified, but
                 shall be at least 128. An implementation may choose to
                 access this variable only when initializing the history
                 file, as described under <i>HISTFILE</i>.  Therefore, it is
                 unspecified whether changes made to <i>HISTSIZE</i> after the
                 history file has been initialized are effective.

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since editors sometimes use file descriptors as integral parts of
       their editing, redirecting their file descriptors as part of the
       <i>fc</i> command can produce unexpected results. For example, if <i>vi</i> is
       the <i>FCEDIT</i> editor, the command:

           fc -s | more

       does not work correctly on many systems.

       Users on windowing systems may want to have separate history
       files for each window by setting <i>HISTFILE</i> as follows:

           HISTFILE=$HOME/.sh_hist$$
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       This utility is based on the <i>fc</i> built-in of the KornShell.

       An early proposal specified the <b>-e </b>option as <b>[-e </b><i>editor</i> <b>[</b><i>old</i>= <i>new</i>
       <b>]]</b>, which is not historical practice. Historical practice in <i>fc</i>
       of either <b>[-e </b><i>editor</i><b>] </b>or <b>[-e - [ </b><i>old</i>= <i>new</i> <b>]] </b>is acceptable, but
       not both together. To clarify this, a new option <b>-s </b>was
       introduced replacing the <b>[-e -]</b>.  This resolves the conflict and
       makes <i>fc</i> conform to the Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       <i>HISTFILE</i>  Some implementations of the KornShell check for the
                 superuser and do not create a history file unless
                 <i>HISTFILE</i> is set. This is done primarily to avoid
                 creating unlinked files in the root file system when
                 logging in during single-user mode.  <i>HISTFILE</i> must be
                 set for the superuser to have history.

       <i>HISTSIZE</i>  Needed to limit the size of history files. It is the
                 intent of the standard developers that when two shells
                 share the same history file, commands that are entered
                 in one shell shall be accessible by the other shell.
                 Because of the difficulties of synchronization over a
                 network, the exact nature of the interaction is
                 unspecified.

       The initialization process for the history file can be dependent
       on the system start-up files, in that they may contain commands
       that effectively preempt the settings the user has for <i>HISTFILE</i>
       and <i>HISTSIZE</i>.  For example, function definition commands are
       recorded in the history file. If the system administrator
       includes function definitions in some system start-up file called
       before the <i>ENV</i> file, the history file is initialized before the
       user can influence its characteristics. In some historical
       shells, the history file is initialized just after the <i>ENV</i> file
       has been processed. Because of these situations, the text
       requires the initialization process to be implementation-defined.

       Consideration was given to omitting the <i>fc</i> utility in favor of
       the command line editing feature in <i>sh</i>.  For example, in <i>vi</i>
       editing mode, typing <b>"&lt;ESC&gt;</b>v" is equivalent to:

           EDITOR=vi fc

       However, the <i>fc</i> utility allows the user the flexibility to edit
       multiple commands simultaneously (such as <i>fc</i> 10 20) and to use
       editors other than those supported by <i>sh</i> for command line
       editing.

       In the KornShell, the alias <b>r </b>(``re-do'') is preset to <i>fc</i> <b>-e -</b>
       (equivalent to the POSIX <i>fc</i> <b>-s</b>).  This is probably an easier
       command name to remember than <i>fc</i> (``fix command''), but it does
       not meet the Utility Syntax Guidelines.  Renaming <i>fc</i> to <i>hist</i> or
       <i>redo</i> was considered, but since this description closely matches
       historical KornShell practice already, such a renaming was seen
       as gratuitous.  Users are free to create aliases whenever odd
       historical names such as <i>fc</i>, <i>awk</i>, <i>cat</i>, <i>grep</i>, or <i>yacc</i> are
       standardized by POSIX.

       Command numbers have no ordering effects; they are like serial
       numbers.  The <b>-r </b>option and -<i>number</i> operand address the sequence
       of command execution, regardless of serial numbers. So, for
       example, if the command number wrapped back to 1 at some
       arbitrary point, there would be no ambiguity associated with
       traversing the wrap point. For example, if the command history
       were:

           32766: echo 1
           32767: echo 2
           1: echo 3

       the number -2 refers to command 32767 because it is the second
       previous command, regardless of serial number.
