DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdacisco </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics from one or more Cisco routers.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdacisco </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>cisco.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdacisco </b>is started, i.e.  <i>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</i>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-P   </b>By default, it is assumed that no user-level password is
            required to access the Cisco's telnet port.  If user-level
            passwords have been enabled on the Ciscos, then those
            passwords must be specified to <b>pmdacisco</b>.  If specified with
            the <b>-P </b>option, <i>password</i> will be used as the default user-
            level password for all Ciscos.  See also the INTERFACE
            IDENTIFICATION section below.

       <b>-r   pmdacisco </b>will refresh the current values for all
            performance metrics by contacting each Cisco router once
            every <i>refresh</i> seconds.  The default <i>refresh</i> is 120 seconds.

       <b>-s   </b>The Cisco command prompt ends with the string <i>prompt</i>.  The
            default value is ``&gt;''.  The only way <b>pmdacisco </b>can
            synchronize the sending of commands and the parsing of
            output is by recognizing <i>prompt</i> as a unique string that
            comes at the end of all output, i.e. as the command prompt
            when waiting for the next command.

       <b>-U   </b>By default, it is assumed that no username login is required
            to access the Cisco's telnet port.  If username login has
            been enabled on the Ciscos, then the corresponding usernames
            must be specified to <b>pmdacisco</b>.  If specified with the <b>-U</b>
            option, <i>username</i> will be used as the default username login
            for all Ciscos.  See also the INTERFACE IDENTIFICATION
            section below.

       <b>-M   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.

       <b>-x   </b>Connect to the Cisco via TCP port number <i>port</i> rather than
            the default 23 for a telnet connection.

       For each interface, once the telnet connection is established,
       <b>pmdacisco </b>is willing to wait up to 5 seconds for the Cisco to
       provide a new snapshot of the requested information.  If this
       does not happen, the telnet connection is broken and no values
       are returned.  This prevents <b>pmdacisco </b>tying up the Cisco's
       telnet ports waiting indefinitely when the response from the
       router is not what is expected, e.g. if the format of the ``show
       int'' output changes, or the command is in error because an
       interface is no longer configured on the router.
</pre> <h2>
INTERFACE IDENTIFICATION </h2>
<pre>
       As each Cisco router can support multiple network interfaces
       and/or multiple communications protocols, it is necessary to tell
       <b>pmdacisco </b>which interfaces are to be monitored.

       The <i>host:interface-spec</i> arguments on the command line define a
       particular interface on a particular Cisco router.  <i>host</i> should
       be a hostname or a ``dot-notation'' IP address that identifies
       the telnet port of a particular Cisco router.  There are several
       components of the <i>interface-spec</i> as follows.

       protocol
              One of the abbreviations <b>a</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>s </b>or <b>Vl</b>
              respectively for ATM, BRI (ISDN), FastEthernet, Ethernet,
              FDDI, GigabitEthernet, HSSI, serial or Vlan.

       interface
              Depending on the model of the Cisco, this will either be
              an integer, e.g. <b>s0</b>, or an integer followed by a slash
              (``/'') followed by a subinterface identification in one
              of a variety of syntactic forms, e.g. <b>e1/0</b>, <b>G0/0/1 </b>or
              <b>s4/2.1</b>.

              To discover the valid interfaces on a particular Cisco,
              connect to the telnet port (using <b>telnet</b>(1)) and enter the
              command "show int" and look for the interface identifiers
              following the keywords ``Ethernet'', ``Fddi'', ``Serial'',
              etc.

              Alternatively run the <b>probe </b>command.

       username
              If there is a username login, and it is different to the
              default (see <b>-U </b>above), it may be optionally specified
              here by appending ``@'' and the username to the end of
              <i>interface-spec</i>.

       password
              If there is a user-level password, and it is different to
              the default (see <b>-P </b>above), it may be optionally specified
              here by appending a question mark (``?'') and the password
              to the end of <i>interface-spec</i>.

       prompt If the Cisco command prompt is different to the default
              (see <b>-s </b>above), it may be optionally specified here by
              appending an exclamation mark (``!'') and the prompt to
              the end of <i>interface-spec</i>.

       The following are examples of valid <i>interface-spec</i> arguments.
                 my-router:e1/2
                 123.456.789.0:s0
                 wancisco:f2/3?trust_me
                 somecisco:G1/0!myprompt
                 cisco34.foo.bar.com:e2?way2cool
                 mycisco:s2/2.1@mylogin
                 yourcisco:E0/0@yourlogin?yourpassword
                 mycisco:E0/0@mylogin?mypassword!myprompt
</pre> <h2>
HELPER UTILITIES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>probe </b>command may be used to discover the names of all
       interfaces for a particular Cisco router identified by <i>host</i>.  The
       <b>-P </b>argument is the same as for <b>pmdacisco</b>.

       The <b>parse </b>command takes exactly the same arguments as <b>pmdacisco</b>,
       but executes outside the control of any <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and so may be
       used to diagnose problems with handling a particular Cisco router
       and/or one of its interfaces.

       Additional diagnostic verbosity may be produced using the <b>-D</b>
       <b>appl0,appl1,appl2 </b>command line option.  <b>appl0 </b>logs connect and
       disconnect events, login progress, high-level flow of control and
       extracted statistics.  <b>appl1 </b>traces all commands sent to the
       Cisco device.  <b>appl2 </b>logs tokenising and parsing of the output
       from the Cisco device.  Diagnostics are generated on standard
       error as each sample is fetched and parsed.

INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
       Cisco performance metrics, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco
            # ./Install

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cisco
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdacisco </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
