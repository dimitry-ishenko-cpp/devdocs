NAME </h2>
<pre>
       perf-c2c - Shared Data C2C/HITM Analyzer.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>perf c2c record</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;command&gt;
       <i>perf c2c record</i> [&lt;options&gt;] -- [&lt;record command options&gt;] &lt;command&gt;

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       C2C stands for Cache To Cache.

       The perf c2c tool provides means for Shared Data C2C/HITM
       analysis. It allows you to track down the cacheline contentions.

       On Intel, the tool is based on load latency and precise store
       facility events provided by Intel CPUs. On PowerPC, the tool uses
       random instruction sampling with thresholding feature. On AMD,
       the tool uses IBS op pmu (due to hardware limitations, perf c2c
       is not supported on Zen3 cpus). On Arm64 it uses SPE to sample
       load and store operations, therefore hardware and kernel support
       is required. See <a href="perf-arm-spe.1.html">perf-arm-spe(1)</a> for a setup guide. Due to the
       statistical nature of Arm SPE sampling, not every memory
       operation will be sampled.

       These events provide: - memory address of the access - type of
       the access (load and store details) - latency (in cycles) of the
       load access

       The c2c tool provide means to record this data and report back
       access details for cachelines with highest contention - highest
       number of HITM accesses.

       The basic workflow with this tool follows the standard
       record/report phase. User uses the record command to record
       events data and report command to display it.
</pre> <h2>
RECORD OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -e, --event=
           Select the PMU event. Use <i>perf c2c record -e list</i> to list
           available events.

       -v, --verbose
           Be more verbose (show counter open errors, etc).

       -l, --ldlat
           Configure mem-loads latency. Supported on Intel and Arm64
           processors only. Ignored on other archs.

       -k, --all-kernel
           Configure all used events to run in kernel space.

       -u, --all-user
           Configure all used events to run in user space.
</pre> <h2>
REPORT OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -k, --vmlinux=&lt;file&gt;
           vmlinux pathname

       -v, --verbose
           Be more verbose (show counter open errors, etc).

       -i, --input
           Specify the input file to process.

       -N, --node-info
           Show extra node info in report (see NODE INFO section)

       -c, --coalesce
           Specify sorting fields for single cacheline display.
           Following fields are available: tid,pid,iaddr,dso (see
           COALESCE)

       -g, --call-graph
           Setup callchains parameters. Please refer to perf-report man
           page for details.

       --stdio
           Force the stdio output (see STDIO OUTPUT)

       --stats
           Display only statistic tables and force stdio mode.

       --full-symbols
           Display full length of symbols.

       --no-source
           Do not display Source:Line column.

       --show-all
           Show all captured HITM lines, with no regard to HITM % 0.0005
           limit.

       -f, --force
           Don’t do ownership validation.

       -d, --display
           Switch to HITM type (rmt, lcl) or peer snooping type (peer)
           to display and sort on. Total HITMs (tot) as default, except
           Arm64 uses peer mode as default.

       --stitch-lbr
           Show callgraph with stitched LBRs, which may have more
           complete callgraph. The perf.data file must have been
           obtained using perf c2c record --call-graph lbr. Disabled by
           default. In common cases with call stack overflows, it can
           recreate better call stacks than the default lbr call stack
           output. But this approach is not foolproof. There can be
           cases where it creates incorrect call stacks from incorrect
           matches. The known limitations include exception handing such
           as setjmp/longjmp will have calls/returns not match.

       --double-cl
           Group the detection of shared cacheline events into double
           cacheline granularity. Some architectures have an Adjacent
           Cacheline Prefetch feature, which causes cacheline sharing to
           behave like the cacheline size is doubled.
</pre> <h2>
C2C RECORD </h2>
<pre>
       The perf c2c record command setup options related to HITM
       cacheline analysis and calls standard perf record command.

       Following perf record options are configured by default: (check
       perf record man page for details)

           -W,-d,--phys-data,--sample-cpu

       Unless specified otherwise with <i>-e</i> option, following events are
       monitored by default on Intel:

           cpu/mem-loads,ldlat=30/P
           cpu/mem-stores/P

       following on AMD:

           ibs_op//

       and following on PowerPC:

           cpu/mem-loads/
           cpu/mem-stores/

       User can pass any <i>perf record</i> option behind <i>--</i> mark, like (to
       enable callchains and system wide monitoring):

           $ perf c2c record -- -g -a

       Please check RECORD OPTIONS section for specific c2c record
       options.
</pre> <h2>
C2C REPORT </h2>
<pre>
       The perf c2c report command displays shared data analysis. It
       comes in two display modes: stdio and tui (default).

       The report command workflow is following: - sort all the data
       based on the cacheline address - store access details for each
       cacheline - sort all cachelines based on user settings - display
       data

       In general perf report output consist of 2 basic views: 1) most
       expensive cachelines list 2) offsets details for each cacheline

       For each cacheline in the 1) list we display following data:
       (Both stdio and TUI modes follow the same fields output)

           Index
           - zero based index to identify the cacheline

           Cacheline
           - cacheline address (hex number)

           - count of LLC load accesses, includes LLC hits and LLC HITMs

           RMT Load Hit - RmtHit, RmtHitm

             on Arm neoverse cores, RmtHit is used to account remote accesses,
             includes remote DRAM or any upward cache level in remote node

           Load Dram - Lcl, Rmt
           - count of local and remote DRAM accesses

       For each offset in the 2) list we display following data:

           - % of Remote/Local HITM accesses for given offset within cacheline

           Peer Snoop - Rmt, Lcl (Display with peer type)

             - nodes participating on the access (see NODE INFO section)
</pre> <h2>
NODE INFO </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>Node</i> field displays nodes that accesses given cacheline
       offset. Its output comes in 3 flavors: - node IDs separated by <i>,</i>
       - node IDs with stats for each ID, in following format: Node{cpus
       %hitms %stores} (Display with HITM types) Node{cpus %peers
       %stores} (Display with peer type) - node IDs with list of
       affected CPUs in following format: Node{cpu list}

       User can switch between above flavors with -N option or use <i>n</i> key
       to interactively switch in TUI mode.
</pre> <h2>
COALESCE </h2>
<pre>
       User can specify how to sort offsets for cacheline.

       Following fields are available and governs the final output
       fields set for cacheline offsets output:

           tid   - coalesced by process TIDs
           pid   - coalesced by process PIDs
           iaddr - coalesced by code address, following fields are displayed:
                      Code address, Code symbol, Shared Object, Source line
           dso   - coalesced by shared object

       By default the coalescing is setup with <i>pid,iaddr</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STDIO OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       The stdio output displays data on standard output.

       Following tables are displayed: Trace Event Information - overall
       statistics of memory accesses

           Global Shared Cache Line Event Information
           - overall statistics on shared cachelines

           Shared Data Cache Line Table
           - list of most expensive cachelines

           Shared Cache Line Distribution Pareto

</pre> <h2>
TUI OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       The TUI output provides interactive interface to navigate through
       cachelines list and to display offset details.

       For details please refer to the help window by pressing <i>?</i> key.
