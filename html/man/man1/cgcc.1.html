NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cgcc - Compiler wrapper to run Sparse after compiling
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cgcc </b>[<i>SPARSE OPTIONS</i>]... [<i>COMPILER OPTIONS</i>]... [<i>INPUT FILES</i>]...
       <b>make CC=cgcc</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>cgcc </b>provides a wrapper around a C compiler (<b>cc </b>by default) which
       also invokes the Sparse static analysis tool.

       <b>cgcc </b>accepts all Sparse command-line options, such as warning
       options, and passes all other options through to the compiler.

       By providing the same interface as the C compiler, <b>cgcc </b>allows
       projects to run Sparse as part of their build without modifying
       their build system, by using <b>cgcc </b>as the compiler.  For many
       projects, setting <b>CC=cgcc </b>on the <b>make </b>command-line will work.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>REAL_CC</b>
              If set, <b>cgcc </b>will use this as the compiler to invoke,
              rather than the default <b>cc</b>.

       <b>CHECK  </b>If set, <b>cgcc </b>will use this as the Sparse program to
              invoke, rather than the default <b>sparse</b>.
