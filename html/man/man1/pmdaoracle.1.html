</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaoracle </b>- Oracle database PMDA
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaoracle </b>is a Performance Co-Pilot PMDA which extracts live
       performance data from a running Oracle database.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaoracle </b>uses a configuration file from (in this order):
       •   /etc/pcpdbi.conf
       •   $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle/oracle.conf
       •   ./oracle.conf

       This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the
       settings listed at the start of pmdaoracle.pl, for example:
       •   $username - username to connect to the database [default:
           'SYSTEM']
       •   $password - password to connect to the database [default:
           'manager']
       •   $host - host the database is running on [default:
           'localhost']
       •   $port - port the database is listening on [default: '1521']
       •   $os_user - operating system username (PMDA will run with the
           corresponding user id) [default: oracle]
       •   @sids - an array of $ORACLE_SID database identifiers
           [default: ('master')]

       In order to test your local settings, a simple script is provided
       that will connect and disconnect from the database - verifying
       fundamental configuration is in place before continuing on.  If
       the <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle/connect.pl </b>script cannot connect, do
       not proceed with installation of the PMDA as it will be
       unsuccessful.  Correct your local settings first.

       Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
       oracle performance metrics by doing the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, the following must be done as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdaoracle </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
CONNECTION STATE </h2>
<pre>
       By default, <b>pmdaoracle </b>will aggressively attempt to maintain
       persistent connections to Oracle to ensure timely responses to
       its queries, and will automatically re-connect if a connection
       drops.

       However, in certain circumstances this may be undesirable, so a
       manual <a href="../man3/pmstore.3.html">pmStore(3)</a> mechanism is provided to explicitly control
       disconnecting and reconnecting to an Oracle instance.  This can
       be used, for example, to ensure that <b>pmdaoracle </b>is not connected
       at shutdown, to ensure a clean Oracle shutdown process.

       The <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> command can be used to disconnect and reconnect.
       Using the individual instances of the oracle.control.connected
       metric, one can set the connection state to either up (1) or down
       (0).  Additionally, <a href="pminfo.1.html">pminfo(1)</a> can report on the current status of
       Oracle connections.

            # pminfo ‐f oracle.control.connected

            oracle.control.connected
                inst [0 or "master"] value 1

            # pmstore oracle.control.connected 0
            oracle.control.connected inst [0 or "master"] old value=1 new value=0

</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by <b>PCP</b>. On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
