NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ocount - Event counting tool for Linux
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ocount </b>[ <i>options</i> ] [ --system-wide | --process-list &lt;pids&gt; |
       --thread-list &lt;tids&gt; | --cpu-list &lt;cpus&gt; | [ command [ args ] ] ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ocount </b>is an OProfile tool that can be used to count native
       hardware events occurring in either a given application, a set of
       processes or threads, a subset of active system processors, or
       the entire system. The data collected during a counting session
       is displayed to stdout by default or, optionally, to a file.

       When counting multiple events, the kernel may not be able to
       count all events simultaneously and, thus, may need to multiplex
       the counting of the events.  If this happens, the "Percent time
       enabled" column in the <b>ocount </b>output will be less than 100, but
       counts are scaled up to a 100% estimated value.
</pre> <h2>
RUN MODES </h2>
<pre>
       One (and only one) of the following <b>run modes </b>must be specified.
       If you run <b>ocount </b>using a run mode other than <b>command </b><i>[args]</i> ,
       press Ctrl-c to stop <b>ocount </b>when finished counting (e.g., when
       the monitored process ends).  If you background <b>ocount </b>(i.e.,
       with '&amp;') while using one these run modes, you <b>must </b>stop it in a
       controlled manner so that the data collection process can be shut
       down cleanly and final results can be displayed. Use <b>kill -SIGINT</b>
       <b>&lt;ocount-PID&gt; </b>for this purpose.

       <b>command </b><i>[args]</i>
              The <i>command</i> is the application for which to count events.
              <i>args</i> are the input arguments required by the application.
              The <i>command</i> and its arguments <b>must </b>be positioned at the
              end of the command line, after all ocount options.

       <b>--process-list / -p </b><i>pids</i>
              Use this option to count events for one or more already-
              running applications, specified via a comma-separated list
              ( <i>pids</i> ). Event counts will be collected for all children
              of the passed process(es) as well. You must have
              privileges for the user ID under which the specified
              process(es) are running; e.g., for a non-root user, the
              user ID of the process(es) is the same as that used for
              running ocount. A lack of privileges will result in the
              following failure message:
                      perf_event_open failed with Permission denied

       <b>--thread-list / -r </b><i>tids</i>
              Use this option to count events for one or more already-
              running threads, specified via a comma-separated list (
              <i>tids</i> ). Event counts will <b>not </b>be collected for any
              children of the passed thread(s). See the description of
              <i>--process-list</i> concerning required privileges.

       <b>--system-wide / -s</b>
              This option is for counting events for all processes
              running on your system.  You must have root authority to
              run ocount in this mode.

       <b>--cpu-list / -C </b><i>cpus</i>
              This option is for counting events on a subset of
              processors on your system. You must have root authority to
              run ocount in this mode. This is a comma-separated list,
              where each element in the list may be either a single
              processor number or a range of processor numbers; for
              example: '-C 2,3,4-11,15'.
</pre> <h2>
OTHER OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--events / -e </b><i>event1[,event2[,...]]</i>
              This option is for passing a comma-separated list of event
              specifications for counting. Each event spec is of the
              form:
                 <i>name[:unitmask[:kernel[:user]]]</i>
              <b>Note: </b>Do <b>not </b>include a <i>count</i> value in the event spec, as
              that parameter is only needed when profiling.

              You can specify <i>unitmask</i> values using either a numerical
              value (hex values <i>must</i> begin with "0x") or a symbolic name
              (if the <i>name=&lt;um_name&gt;</i> field is shown in the <b>ophelp</b>
              output). For some named unit masks, the hex value is not
              unique; thus, OProfile tools enforce specifying such unit
              masks value by name.  If no unit mask is specified, the
              default unit mask value for the event is used.

              The <i>kernel</i> and <i>user</i> parts of the event specification are
              binary values ('1' or '0') indicating whether or not to
              count events in kernel space and user space.
              <b>Note: </b>In order to specify the <i>kernel/user</i> bits, you must
              also specify a <i>unitmask</i> value, even if the running
              processor type does not use unit masks — in which case,
              use the value '0' to signify a null unit mask; for
              example:
                 -e INST_RETIRED_ANY_P:0:1:0
                                       ^ ^ ^
                                       | | |--- '0': do not count user
              space events
                                       | |-- '1': count kernel space
              events
                                       |-- '0': the null unit mask

              Event names for certain processor types include a <i>_GRP&lt;n&gt;</i>
              suffix.  For such cases, the <i>--events</i> option may be
              specified with or without the <i>_GRP&lt;n&gt;</i> suffix.

              When no event specification is given, the default event
              for the running processor type will be used for counting.
              Use <b>ophelp </b>to list the available events for your processor
              type.

       <b>--separate-thread / -t</b>
              This option can be used in conjunction with either the
              <i>--process-list</i> or <i>--thread-list</i> option to display event
              counts on a per-thread (per-process) basis.  Without this
              option, all counts are aggregated.

              <b>NOTE: </b>If new threads are started by the process(es) being
              monitored after counting begins, the counts for those
              threads are aggregated with their parent's counts.

       <b>--separate-cpu / -c</b>
              This option can be used in conjunction with either the
              <i>--system-wide</i> or <i>--cpu-list</i> option to display event counts
              on a per-cpu basis.  Without this option, all counts are
              aggregated.

       <b>--time-interval / -i </b><i>interval_length[:num_intervals]</i>

              <b>Note: </b>The <i>interval_length</i> is given in milliseconds.
              However, the current implementation only supports 100 ms
              granularity, so the given <i>interval_length</i> will be rounded
              to the nearest 100 ms.  Results collected for each time
              interval are printed immediately instead of the default of
              one dump of cumulative event counts at the end of the run.
              Counters are reset to zero at the start of each interval.

              If <i>num_intervals</i> is specified, <b>ocount </b>exits after the
              specified number of intervals occur.

       <b>--brief-format / -b</b>
              Use this option to print results in the following brief
              format:
                  [cpu or
              thread,]&lt;event_name&gt;[:umask[:K:U]],&lt;count&gt;,&lt;percent_time_enabled&gt;
                  [    &lt;u32&gt;    ,]&lt;  string  &gt;[&lt; u32&gt;[&lt;bb&gt;]],&lt; u64 &gt;,&lt;
              double       &gt;

              The umask, <b>K</b>ernel and <b>U</b>ser modes are only printed if the
              values were specified as part of the event.  The 'K' and
              'U' fields are binary fields separated by colons, where
              the value for each binary field may be either '0' or '1'.

              If <i>--timer-interval</i> is specified, a separate line
              formatted as
                  timestamp,&lt;num_seconds_since_epoch&gt;[.n]
              is printed ahead of each dump of event counts. If the time
              interval specified is less than one second, the timestamp
              will have 1/10 second precision.

       <b>--output-file / -f </b><i>outfile_name</i>
              Results are written to <i>outfile_name</i> instead of
              interactively to the terminal.

       <b>--verbose / -V</b>
              Use this option to increase the verbosity of the output.

       <b>--version / -v</b>
              Show ocount version.

       <b>--help / -h</b>
              Display brief usage message.

       <b>--usage / -u</b>
              Display brief usage message.
