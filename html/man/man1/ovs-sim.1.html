</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ovs-sim - Open vSwitch simulator environment
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ovs-sim </b>[<i>option</i>]… [<i>script</i>]…
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ovs-sim </b>provides a convenient environment for running one or more
       Open vSwitch instances and related software in a sandboxed
       simulation environment.

       To use <b>ovs-sim</b>, first build Open vSwitch, then invoke it directly
       from the build directory, e.g.:

          git clone <a href="https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs.git">https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs.git</a>
          cd ovs
          ./configure
          make
          utilities/ovs-sim

       When invoked in the most ordinary way as shown above, ovs-sim
       does  the following:

       1. Creates a directory <b>sandbox </b>as a subdirectory of the current
          directory (first destroying such a directory if it already
          exists) and makes it the current directory.

       2. Installs all of the Open vSwitch manpages into a <b>man</b>
          subdirectory of sandbox and adjusts the <b>MANPATH </b>environment
          variable so that <b>man </b>and other manpage viewers can find them.

       3. Creates a simulated Open vSwitch named <b>main </b>and sets it up as
          the default target for OVS commands, as if the following
          <b>ovs-sim </b>commands had been run:

             sim_add main
             as main
          See <i>Commands</i>, below, for an explanation.

       4. Runs  any  scripts  specified on the command line (see
          <i>Options</i>, below). The scripts can use arbitrary Bash  syntax,
          plus  the additional commands described under <i>Commands</i>, below.

       5. If no scripts were specified, or if <b>-i </b>or <b>--interactive </b>was
          specified, invokes an interactive Bash subshell. The user can
          use arbitrary Bash commands, plus the additional commands
          described under <i>Commands</i>, below.

       <b>ovs-sim </b>and the sandbox environment that it creates does not
       require superuser or other special privileges.  Generally, it
       should not be run with such privileges.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>script</i> Runs <i>script</i>, which should be a Bash script, within a
              subshell after initializing.  If multiple script arguments
              are given, then they are run in the order given.  If any
              script exits with a nonzero exit code, then <b>ovs-sim </b>exits
              immediately with the same exit code.

       <b>-i or --interactive</b>
              By default, if any script is specified, <b>ovs-sim </b>exits as
              soon as the scripts finish executing. With this option, or
              if no scripts are specified, <b>ovs-sim </b>instead starts an
              interactive Bash session.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       Scripts and interactive usage may use the following commands
       implemented by <b>ovs-sim</b>.  They are implemented as Bash shell
       functions exported to subshells.

   <b>Basic Commands</b>
       These  are  the  basic commands for working with sandboxed Open
       vSwitch instances.

       <b>sim_add </b><i>sandbox</i>
              Starts a new simulated Open vSwitch instance named
              <i>sandbox</i>.  Files related to the instance, such as logs,
              databases, sockets, and pidfiles, are created in a
              subdirectory also named <i>sandbox</i>. Afterward, the <b>as </b>command
              (see below) can be used to run Open vSwitch utilities in
              the context of the new sandbox.

              The new sandbox starts out without any bridges. Use
              <b>ovs-vsctl </b>in the context of the new sandbox to create a
              bridge, e.g.:

                 sim_add hv0           # Create sandbox hv0.
                 as hv0                # Set hv0 as default sandbox.
                 ovs-vsctl add-br br0  # Add bridge br0 inside hv0.

              The Open vSwitch instances that <b>sim_add </b>creates enable
              <b>dummy </b>devices.  This means that bridges and interfaces can
              be created with type <b>dummy </b>to indicate that they should be
              totally simulated, without any reference to system
              entities.  In fact, <b>ovs-sim </b>also configures Open vSwitch
              so that the default system type of bridges and interfaces
              are replaced by dummy devices.  Other types of devices,
              however, retain their usual functions, which means that,
              e.g., vxlan tunnels still act as tunnels (refer to the
              documentation).

       <b>as </b><i>sandbox</i>
              Sets sandbox as the default simulation target for Open
              vSwitch commands (e.g. <b>ovs-vsctl</b>, <b>ovs-ofctl</b>, <b>ovs-appctl</b>).

              This command updates the beginning of the shell prompt to
              indicate the new default target.

       <b>as </b><i>sandbox command arg</i><b>…</b>
              Runs the given command with <i>sandbox</i> as the simulation
              target, e.g.  <b>as hv0 ovs-vsctl add-br br0 </b>runs <b>ovs-vsctl</b>
              <b>add-br br0 </b>within sandbox <b>hv0</b>.  The default target is
              unchanged.

   <b>Interconnection Network Commands</b>
       When multiple sandboxed Open vSwitch instances exist, one will
       inevitably want to connect them together.  These commands allow
       for that.  Conceptually, an interconnection network is a switch
       that <b>ovs-sim </b>makes it easy to plug into other switches in other
       sandboxed Open vSwitch instances.  Interconnection networks are
       implemented as bridges in the <b>main </b>switch that <b>ovs-sim </b>creates by
       default, so to use interconnection networks please avoid working
       with <b>main </b>directly.

       <b>net_add </b><i>network</i>
              Creates a new interconnection network named <i>network</i>.

       <b>net_attach </b><i>network bridge</i>
              Adds a new port to <i>bridge</i> in the default sandbox (as set
              with <b>as</b>) and plugs it into interconnection network
              <i>network</i>, which must already have been created by a
              previous invocation of <b>net_add</b>. The default sandbox must
              not be <b>main</b>.
