SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       file <b>[</b>-dh<b>] [</b>-M <i>file</i><b>] [</b>-m <i>file</i><b>] </b><i>file</i>...

       file -i <b>[</b>-h<b>] </b><i>file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>file</i> utility shall perform a series of tests in sequence on
       each specified <i>file</i> in an attempt to classify it:

        1. If <i>file</i> does not exist, cannot be read, or its file status
           could not be determined, the output shall indicate that the
           file was processed, but that its type could not be
           determined.

        2. If the file is not a regular file, its file type shall be
           identified.  The file types directory, FIFO, socket, block
           special, and character special shall be identified as such.
           Other implementation-defined file types may also be
           identified. If <i>file</i> is a symbolic link, by default the link
           shall be resolved and <i>file</i> shall test the type of file
           referenced by the symbolic link. (See the <b>-h </b>and <b>-i </b>options
           below.)

        3. If the length of <i>file</i> is zero, it shall be identified as an
           empty file.

        4. The <i>file</i> utility shall examine an initial segment of <i>file</i> and
           shall make a guess at identifying its contents based on
           position-sensitive tests. (The answer is not guaranteed to be
           correct; see the <b>-d</b>, <b>-M</b>, and <b>-m </b>options below.)

        5. The <i>file</i> utility shall examine <i>file</i> and make a guess at
           identifying its contents based on context-sensitive default
           system tests. (The answer is not guaranteed to be correct.)

        6. The file shall be identified as a data file.

       If <i>file</i> does not exist, cannot be read, or its file status could
       not be determined, the output shall indicate that the file was
       processed, but that its type could not be determined.

       If <i>file</i> is a symbolic link, by default the link shall be resolved
       and <i>file</i> shall test the type of file referenced by the symbolic
       link.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>file</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       that the order of the <b>-m</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-M </b>options shall be
       significant.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-d        </b>Apply any position-sensitive default system tests and
                 context-sensitive default system tests to the file.
                 This is the default if no <b>-M </b>or <b>-m </b>option is specified.

       <b>-h        </b>When a symbolic link is encountered, identify the file
                 as a symbolic link. If <b>-h </b>is not specified and <i>file</i> is
                 a symbolic link that refers to a nonexistent file, <i>file</i>
                 shall identify the file as a symbolic link, as if <b>-h</b>
                 had been specified.

       <b>-i        </b>If a file is a regular file, do not attempt to classify
                 the type of the file further, but identify the file as
                 specified in the STDOUT section.

       <b>-M </b><i>file</i>   Specify the name of a file containing position-
                 sensitive tests that shall be applied to a file in
                 order to classify it (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION). No
                 position-sensitive default system tests nor context-
                 sensitive default system tests shall be applied unless
                 the <b>-d </b>option is also specified.

       <b>-m </b><i>file</i>   Specify the name of a file containing position-
                 sensitive tests that shall be applied to a file in
                 order to classify it (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION).

       If the <b>-m </b>option is specified without specifying the <b>-d </b>option or
       the <b>-M </b>option, position-sensitive default system tests shall be
       applied after the position-sensitive tests specified by the <b>-m</b>
       option. If the <b>-M </b>option is specified with the <b>-d </b>option, the <b>-m</b>
       option, or both, or the <b>-m </b>option is specified with the <b>-d</b>
       option, the concatenation of the position-sensitive tests
       specified by these options shall be applied in the order
       specified by the appearance of these options. If a <b>-M </b>or <b>-m </b><i>file</i>
       option-argument is <b>-</b>, the results are unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file to be tested.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-' </b>and the
       implementation treats the <b>'-' </b>as meaning standard input.
       Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>file</i> can be any file type.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>file</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error and informative messages written to
                 standard output.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       In the POSIX locale, the following format shall be used to
       identify each operand, <i>file</i> specified:

           "%s: %s\n", &lt;<i>file</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>type</i>&gt;

       The values for &lt;<i>type</i>&gt; are unspecified, except that in the POSIX
       locale, if <i>file</i> is identified as one of the types listed in the
       following table, &lt;<i>type</i>&gt; shall contain (but is not limited to) the
       corresponding string, unless the file is identified by a
       position-sensitive test specified by a <b>-M </b>or <b>-m </b>option. Each
       &lt;space&gt; shown in the strings shall be exactly one &lt;space&gt;.

       <b>Notes:</b>

                  1. This is a file type test.

                  2. This test is applied only if the <b>-i </b>option is
                     specified.

                  3. This test is applied only if the <b>-i </b>option is not
                     specified.

                  4. This is a position-sensitive default system test.

                  5. This is a context-sensitive default system test.

                  6. Position-sensitive default system tests and
                     context-sensitive default system tests are not
                     applied if the <b>-M </b>option is specified unless the <b>-d</b>
                     option is also specified.

       In the POSIX locale, if <i>file</i> is identified as a symbolic link
       (see the <b>-h </b>option), the following alternative output format
       shall be used:

           "%s: %s %s\n", &lt;<i>file</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>type</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>contents of link</i>&gt;"

       If the file named by the <i>file</i> operand does not exist, cannot be
       read, or the type of the file named by the <i>file</i> operand cannot be
       determined, this shall not be considered an error that affects
       the exit status.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A file specified as an option-argument to the <b>-m </b>or <b>-M </b>options
       shall contain one position-sensitive test per line, which shall
       be applied to the file. If the test succeeds, the message field
       of the line shall be printed and no further tests shall be
       applied, with the exception that tests on immediately following
       lines beginning with a single <b>'&gt;' </b>character shall be applied.

       Each line shall be composed of the following four &lt;tab&gt;-separated
       fields. (Implementations may allow any combination of one or more
       white-space characters other than &lt;newline&gt; to act as field
       separators.)

       <i>offset</i>    An unsigned number (optionally preceded by a single <b>'&gt;'</b>
                 character) specifying the <i>offset</i>, in bytes, of the
                 value in the file that is to be compared against the
                 <i>value</i> field of the line. If the file is shorter than
                 the specified offset, the test shall fail.

                 If the <i>offset</i> begins with the character <b>'&gt;'</b>, the test
                 contained in the line shall not be applied to the file
                 unless the test on the last line for which the <i>offset</i>
                 did not begin with a <b>'&gt;' </b>was successful. By default,
                 the <i>offset</i> shall be interpreted as an unsigned decimal
                 number. With a leading 0x or 0X, the <i>offset</i> shall be
                 interpreted as a hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a
                 leading 0, the <i>offset</i> shall be interpreted as an octal
                 number.

       <i>type</i>      The type of the value in the file to be tested. The
                 type shall consist of the type specification characters
                 <b>d</b>, <b>s</b>, and <b>u</b>, specifying signed decimal, string, and
                 unsigned decimal, respectively.

                 The <i>type</i> string shall be interpreted as the bytes from
                 the file starting at the specified <i>offset</i> and including
                 the same number of bytes specified by the <i>value</i> field.
                 If insufficient bytes remain in the file past the
                 <i>offset</i> to match the <i>value</i> field, the test shall fail.

                 The type specification characters <b>d </b>and <b>u </b>can be
                 followed by an optional unsigned decimal integer that
                 specifies the number of bytes represented by the type.
                 The type specification characters <b>d </b>and <b>u </b>can be
                 followed by an optional <b>C</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>I</b>, or <b>L</b>, indicating that
                 the value is of type <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, or <b>long</b>,
                 respectively.

                 The default number of bytes represented by the type
                 specifiers <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, and <b>u </b>shall correspond to their
                 respective C-language types as follows. If the system
                 claims conformance to the C-Language Development
                 Utilities option, those specifiers shall correspond to
                 the default sizes used in the <i>c99</i> utility. Otherwise,
                 the default sizes shall be implementation-defined.

                 For the type specifier characters <b>d </b>and <b>u</b>, the default
                 number of bytes shall correspond to the size of a basic
                 integer type of the implementation. For these specifier
                 characters, the implementation shall support values of
                 the optional number of bytes to be converted
                 corresponding to the number of bytes in the C-language
                 types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, or <b>long</b>.  These numbers can
                 also be specified by an application as the characters
                 <b>C</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>L</b>, respectively. The byte order used when
                 interpreting numeric values is implementation-defined,
                 but shall correspond to the order in which a constant
                 of the corresponding type is stored in memory on the
                 system.

                 All type specifiers, except for <b>s</b>, can be followed by a
                 mask specifier of the form &amp;<i>number</i>. The mask value
                 shall be AND'ed with the value of the input file before
                 the comparison with the <i>value</i> field of the line is
                 made. By default, the mask shall be interpreted as an
                 unsigned decimal number. With a leading 0x or 0X, the
                 mask shall be interpreted as an unsigned hexadecimal
                 number; otherwise, with a leading 0, the mask shall be
                 interpreted as an unsigned octal number.

                 The strings <b>byte</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>long</b>, and <b>string </b>shall also be
                 supported as type fields, being interpreted as <b>dC</b>, <b>dS</b>,
                 <b>dL</b>, and <b>s</b>, respectively.

       <i>value</i>     The <i>value</i> to be compared with the value from the file.

                 If the specifier from the type field is <b>s </b>or <b>string</b>,
                 then interpret the value as a string. Otherwise,
                 interpret it as a number. If the value is a string,
                 then the test shall succeed only when a string value
                 exactly matches the bytes from the file.

                 If the <i>value</i> is a string, it can contain the following
                 sequences:

                 \<i>character</i>  The &lt;backslash&gt;-escape sequences as
                             specified in the Base Definitions volume of
                             POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Table 5-1</i>, <i>Escape Sequences</i>

                             <b>'\f'</b>, <b>'\n'</b>, <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>).  In

                             character) shall be recognized to represent
                             a &lt;space&gt; character. The results of using
                             any other character, other than an octal

                             unspecified.

                 \<i>octal</i>      Octal sequences that can be used to
                             represent characters with specific coded
                             values. An octal sequence shall consist of
                             a &lt;backslash&gt; followed by the longest
                             sequence of one, two, or three octal-digit
                             characters (01234567).

                 By default, any value that is not a string shall be
                 interpreted as a signed decimal number. Any such value,
                 with a leading 0x or 0X, shall be interpreted as an
                 unsigned hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading
                 zero, the value shall be interpreted as an unsigned
                 octal number.

                 If the value is not a string, it can be preceded by a
                 character indicating the comparison to be performed.
                 Permissible characters and the comparisons they specify
                 are as follows:

                 =     The test shall succeed if the value from the file
                       equals the <i>value</i> field.

                 &lt;     The test shall succeed if the value from the file
                       is less than the <i>value</i> field.

                 &gt;     The test shall succeed if the value from the file
                       is greater than the <i>value</i> field.

                 &amp;     The test shall succeed if all of the set bits in
                       the <i>value</i> field are set in the value from the
                       file.

                 ^     The test shall succeed if at least one of the set
                       bits in the <i>value</i> field is not set in the value
                       from the file.

                 x     The test shall succeed if the file is large
                       enough to contain a value of the type specified
                       starting at the offset specified.

       <i>message</i>   The <i>message</i> to be printed if the test succeeds. The
                 <i>message</i> shall be interpreted using the notation for the
                 <i>printf</i> formatting specification; see <i>printf</i>.  If the
                 <i>value</i> field was a string, then the value from the file
                 shall be the argument for the <i>printf</i> formatting
                 specification; otherwise, the value from the file shall
                 be the argument.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>

       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>file</i> utility can only be required to guess at many of the
       file types because only exhaustive testing can determine some
       types with certainty. For example, binary data on some
       implementations might match the initial segment of an executable
       or a <i>tar</i> archive.

       Note that the table indicates that the output contains the stated
       string. Systems may add text before or after the string. For
       executables, as an example, the machine architecture and various
       facts about how the file was link-edited may be included. Note
       also that on systems that recognize shell script files starting
       with <b>"#!" </b>as executable files, these may be identified as
       executable binary files rather than as shell scripts.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Determine whether an argument is a binary executable file:

           file -- "$1" | grep -q ':.*executable' &amp;&amp;
               printf "%s is executable.\n$1"
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-f </b>option was omitted because the same effect can (and
       should) be obtained using the <i>xargs</i> utility.

       Historical versions of the <i>file</i> utility attempt to identify the
       following types of files: symbolic link, directory, character
       special, block special, socket, <i>tar</i> archive, <i>cpio</i> archive, SCCS
       archive, archive library, empty, <i>compress</i> output, <i>pack</i> output,
       binary data, C source, FORTRAN source, assembler source,
       <i>nroff</i>/<i>troff</i>/<i>eqn</i>/<i>tbl</i> source <i>troff</i> output, shell script, C shell
       script, English text, ASCII text, various executables, APL
       workspace, compiled terminfo entries, and CURSES screen images.
       Only those types that are reasonably well specified in POSIX or
       are directly related to POSIX utilities are listed in the table.

       Historical systems have used a ``magic file'' named <b>/etc/magic </b>to
       help identify file types. Because it is generally useful for
       users and scripts to be able to identify special file types, the
       <b>-m </b>flag and a portable format for user-created magic files has
       been specified. No requirement is made that an implementation of
       <i>file</i> use this method of identifying files, only that users be
       permitted to add their own classifying tests.

       In addition, three options have been added to historical
       practice. The <b>-d </b>flag has been added to permit users to cause
       their tests to follow any default system tests. The <b>-i </b>flag has
       been added to permit users to test portably for regular files in
       shell scripts. The <b>-M </b>flag has been added to permit users to
       ignore any default system tests.

       The POSIX.1‐2008 description of default system tests and the
       interaction between the <b>-d</b>, <b>-M</b>, and <b>-m </b>options did not clearly
       indicate that there were two types of ``default system tests''.
       The ``position-sensitive tests'' determine file types by looking
       for certain string or binary values at specific offsets in the
       file being examined. These position-sensitive tests were
       implemented in historical systems using the magic file described
       above.  Some of these tests are now built into the <i>file</i> utility
       itself on some implementations so the output can provide more
       detail than can be provided by magic files. For example, a magic
       file can easily identify a <b>core </b>file on most implementations, but
       cannot name the program file that dropped the core. A magic file
       could produce output such as:

           /home/dwc/core: ELF 32-bit MSB core file SPARC Version 1

       but by building the test into the <i>file</i> utility, you could get
       output such as:

           /home/dwc/core: ELF 32-bit MSB core file SPARC Version 1, from 'testprog'

       These extended built-in tests are still to be treated as
       position-sensitive default system tests even if they are not
       listed in <b>/etc/magic </b>or any other magic file.

       The context-sensitive default system tests were always built into
       the <i>file</i> utility. These tests looked for language constructs in
       text files trying to identify shell scripts, C, FORTRAN, and
       other computer language source files, and even plain text files.
       With the addition of the <b>-m </b>and <b>-M </b>options the distinction
       between position-sensitive and context-sensitive default system
       tests became important because the order of testing is important.
       The context-sensitive system default tests should never be
       applied before any position-sensitive tests even if the <b>-d </b>option
       is specified before a <b>-m </b>option or <b>-M </b>option due to the high
       probability that the context-sensitive system default tests will
       incorrectly identify arbitrary text files as text files before
       position-sensitive tests specified by the <b>-m </b>or <b>-M </b>option would
       be applied to give a more accurate identification.

       Leaving the meaning of <b>-M - </b>and <b>-m - </b>unspecified allows an
       existing prototype of these options to continue to work in a
       backwards-compatible manner. (In that implementation, <b>-M - </b>was
       roughly equivalent to <b>-d </b>in POSIX.1‐2008.)

       The historical <b>-c </b>option was omitted as not particularly useful
       to users or portable shell scripts. In addition, a reasonable
       implementation of the <i>file</i> utility would report any errors found
       each time the magic file is read.

       The historical format of the magic file was the same as that
       specified by the Rationale in the ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard for
       the <i>offset</i>, <i>value</i>, and <i>message</i> fields; however, it used less
       precise type fields than the format specified by the current
       normative text. The new type field values are a superset of the
       historical ones.

       The following is an example magic file:

           0  short     070707              cpio archive
           0  short     0143561             Byte-swapped cpio archive

           0  string    &lt;ar&gt;                System V Release 1 archive
           0  string    !&lt;arch&gt;\n__.SYMDEF  Archive random library
           0  string    !&lt;arch&gt;             Archive

           0  long      0x137A2951          Encrypted scalable OpenFont binary

       The use of a basic integer data type is intended to allow the
       implementation to choose a word size commonly used by
       applications on that architecture.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations
       with bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in
       this version.
