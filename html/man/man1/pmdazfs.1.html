NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdazfs </b>- ZFS filesystem performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
       for Linux
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/linux_zfs/pmdazfs </b>[<b>-d </b><i>domain</i>] [<b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdazfs </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the state of the ZFS
       filesystem from the stats files located in /proc.

       The <b>zfs </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure information about
       caching (ARC, L2ARC, ZIL, VDEV), buffering, RAIDZ, dnode
       operations and pools IO.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdazfs </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-d   </b>The performance metrics <i>domain</i> number must be set to a
            unique value.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>zfs.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdazfs </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       OpenZFS is not included in PCP, and has to be installed on the
       system from the available packages or source.  Once OpenZFS is
       installed and configured, the stats files should appear in /proc
       and PMDA can be added to PMCD using the Install script:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zfs
            # ./Install

       To remove PMDA use the Remove script:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zfs
            # ./Remove
