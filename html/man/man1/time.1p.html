       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       time — time a simple command
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       time <b>[</b>-p<b>] </b><i>utility</i> <b>[</b><i>argument</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>time</i> utility shall invoke the utility named by the <i>utility</i>
       operand with arguments supplied as the <i>argument</i> operands and
       write a message to standard error that lists timing statistics
       for the utility. The message shall include the following
       information:

        *  The elapsed (real) time between invocation of <i>utility</i> and its
           termination.

        *  The User CPU time, equivalent to the sum of the <i>tms_utime</i> and
           <i>tms_cutime</i> fields returned by the <i>times</i>() function defined in
           the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 for the process
           in which <i>utility</i> is executed.

        *  The System CPU time, equivalent to the sum of the <i>tms_stime</i>
           and <i>tms_cstime</i> fields returned by the <i>times</i>() function for
           the process in which <i>utility</i> is executed.

       The precision of the timing shall be no less than the granularity
       defined for the size of the clock tick unit on the system, but
       the results shall be reported in terms of standard time units
       (for example, 0.02 seconds, 00:00:00.02, 1m33.75s, 365.21
       seconds), not numbers of clock ticks.

       When <i>time</i> is used as part of a pipeline, the times reported are
       unspecified, except when it is the sole command within a grouping
       command (see <i>Section 2.9.4.1</i>, <i>Grouping Commands</i>) in that
       pipeline. For example, the commands on the left are unspecified;
       those on the right report on utilities <b>a </b>and <b>c</b>, respectively:

           time a | b | c    { time a; } | b | c
           a | b | time c    a | b | (time c)
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>time</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-p        </b>Write the timing output to standard error in the format
                 shown in the STDERR section.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>utility</i>   The name of a utility that is to be invoked. If the
                 <i>utility</i> operand names any of the special built-in
                 utilities in <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>Special Built-In Utilities</i>,
                 the results are undefined.

       <i>argument</i>  Any string to be supplied as an argument when invoking
                 the utility named by the <i>utility</i> operand.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>time</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic and informative
                 messages written to standard error.

       <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>
                 Determine the locale for numeric formatting.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>PATH</i>      Determine the search path that shall be used to locate
                 the utility to be invoked; see the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 8</i>, <i>Environment</i>
                 <i>Variables</i>.

ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       If the <i>utility</i> utility is invoked, the standard error shall be
       used to write the timing statistics and may be used to write a
       diagnostic message if the utility terminates abnormally;
       otherwise, the standard error shall be used to write diagnostic
       messages and may also be used to write the timing statistics.

       If <b>-p </b>is specified, the following format shall be used for the
       timing statistics in the POSIX locale:

           "real %f\nuser %f\nsys %f\n", &lt;<i>real seconds</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>user seconds</i>&gt;,
               &lt;<i>system seconds</i>&gt;

       where each floating-point number shall be expressed in seconds.
       The precision used may be less than the default six digits of <b>%f</b>,
       but shall be sufficiently precise to accommodate the size of the
       clock tick on the system (for example, if there were 60 clock
       ticks per second, at least two digits shall follow the radix
       character). The number of digits following the radix character
       shall be no less than one, even if this always results in a
       trailing zero. The implementation may append white space and
       additional information following the format shown here. The
       implementation may also prepend a single empty line before the
       format shown here.

EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       If the <i>utility</i> utility is invoked, the exit status of <i>time</i> shall
       be the exit status of <i>utility</i>; otherwise, the <i>time</i> utility shall
       exit with one of the following values:

       1‐125   An error occurred in the <i>time</i> utility.

         126   The utility specified by <i>utility</i> was found but could not
               be invoked.

         127   The utility specified by <i>utility</i> could not be found.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>command</i>, <i>env</i>, <i>nice</i>, <i>nohup</i>, <i>time</i>, and <i>xargs</i> utilities have
       been specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs so that
       applications can distinguish ``failure to find a utility'' from
       ``invoked utility exited with an error indication''. The value
       127 was chosen because it is not commonly used for other
       meanings; most utilities use small values for ``normal error
       conditions'' and the values above 128 can be confused with
       termination due to receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen
       in a similar manner to indicate that the utility could be found,
       but not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages
       differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between
       exit codes 126 and 127 is based on KornShell practice that uses
       127 when all attempts to <i>exec</i> the utility fail with <b>[ENOENT]</b>, and
       uses 126 when any attempt to <i>exec</i> the utility fails for any other
       reason.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       It is frequently desirable to apply <i>time</i> to pipelines or lists of
       commands. This can be done by placing pipelines and command lists
       in a single file; this file can then be invoked as a utility, and
       the <i>time</i> applies to everything in the file.

       Alternatively, the following command can be used to apply <i>time</i> to
       a complex command:

           time sh -c '<i>complex-command-line</i>'
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       When the <i>time</i> utility was originally proposed to be included in
       the ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard, questions were raised about its
       suitability for inclusion on the grounds that it was not useful
       for conforming applications, specifically:

        *  The underlying CPU definitions from the System Interfaces
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017 are vague, so the numeric output could
           not be compared accurately between systems or even between
           invocations.

        *  The creation of portable benchmark programs was outside the
           scope this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       However, <i>time</i> does fit in the scope of user portability. Human
       judgement can be applied to the analysis of the output, and it
       could be very useful in hands-on debugging of applications or in
       providing subjective measures of system performance. Hence it has
       been included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       The default output format has been left unspecified because
       historical implementations differ greatly in their style of
       depicting this numeric output. The <b>-p </b>option was invented to
       provide scripts with a common means of obtaining this
       information.

       In the KornShell, <i>time</i> is a shell reserved word that can be used
       to time an entire pipeline, rather than just a simple command.
       The POSIX definition has been worded to allow this
       implementation. Consideration was given to invalidating this
       approach because of the historical model from the C shell and
       System V shell. However, since the System V <i>time</i> utility
       historically has not produced accurate results in pipeline timing
       (because the constituent processes are not all owned by the same
       parent process, as allowed by POSIX), it did not seem worthwhile
       to break historical KornShell usage.

       The term <i>utility</i> is used, rather than <i>command</i>, to highlight the
       fact that shell compound commands, pipelines, special built-ins,
       and so on, cannot be used directly.  However, <i>utility</i> includes
       user application programs and shell scripts, not just the
       standard utilities.
