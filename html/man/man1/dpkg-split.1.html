NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-split - Debian package archive split/join tool
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-split </b>[<i>option</i>...] <i>command</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-split </b>splits Debian binary package files into smaller parts
       and reassembles them again, to support the storage of large
       package files on small media such as floppy disks.

       It can be operated manually using the <b>--split</b>, <b>--join </b>and <b>--info</b>
       options.

       It also has an automatic mode, invoked using the <b>--auto </b>option,
       where it maintains a queue of parts seen but not yet reassembled
       and reassembles a package file when it has seen all of its parts.
       The <b>--listq </b>and <b>--discard </b>options allow the management of the
       queue.

       All splitting, joining and queueing operations produce
       informative messages on standard output; these may safely be
       ignored.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-s</b>, <b>--split </b><i>complete-archive</i> [<i>prefix</i>]
           Splits a single Debian binary package into several parts.

           The parts are named <i>prefix</i><b>.</b><i>N</i><b>of</b><i>M</i><b>.deb </b>where <i>N</i> is the part
           number, starting at 1, and <i>M</i> is the total number of parts
           (both in decimal).

           If no <i>prefix</i> is supplied then the <i>complete-archive</i> filename
           is taken, including directory, with any trailing <b>.deb</b>
           removed.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--join </b><i>part</i>...
           Joins the parts of a package file together, reassembling the
           original file as it was before it was split.

           The part files given as arguments must be all the parts of
           exactly the same original binary file.  Each part must occur
           exactly once in the argument list, though the parts to not
           need to be listed in order.

           The parts must of course all have been generated with the
           same part size specified at split time, which means that they
           must usually have been generated by the same invocation of
           <b>dpkg-split --split</b>.

           The parts' filenames are not significant for the reassembly
           process.

           By default the output file is called
           <i>package</i><b>_</b><i>version</i><b>_</b><i>arch</i><b>.deb</b>.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--info </b><i>part</i>...
           Prints information, in a human-readable format, about the
           part file(s) specified.  Arguments which are not binary
           package parts produce a message saying so instead (but still
           on standard output).

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--auto -o </b><i>complete-output part</i>
           Automatically queue parts and reassemble a package if
           possible.

           The <i>part</i> specified is examined, and compared with other parts
           of the same package (if any) in the queue of packages file
           parts.

           If all parts of the package file of which <i>part</i> is a part are
           available then the package is reassembled and written to
           <i>complete-output</i> (which should not usually already exist,
           though this is not an error).

           If not then the <i>part</i> is copied into the queue and <i>complete-</i>
           <i>output</i> is not created.

           If <i>part</i> is not a split binary package part then <b>dpkg-split</b>
           will exit with status <b>1</b>; if some other trouble occurs then it
           will exit with status <b>2</b>.

           The <b>--output </b>or <b>-o </b>option must be supplied when using <b>--auto</b>.
           (If this were not mandatory the calling program would not
           know what output file to expect.)

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--listq</b>
           Lists the contents of the queue of packages to be
           reassembled.

           For each package file of which parts are in the queue the
           output gives the name of the package, the parts in the queue,
           and the total number of bytes stored in the queue.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--discard </b>[<i>package</i>...]
           This discards parts from the queue of those waiting for the
           remaining parts of their packages.

           If no <i>package</i> is specified then the queue is cleared
           completely; if any are specified then only parts of the
           relevant package(s) are deleted.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--depotdir </b><i>directory</i>
           Specifies an alternative directory for the queue of parts
           awaiting automatic reassembly.  The default is
           <b>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/parts</b>.

       <b>--admindir </b><i>directory</i>
           Set the administrative directory to <i>directory</i> (since dpkg
           1.21.10).  This is where the <i>statoverride</i> file is stored.
           Defaults to «<i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</i>» if <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR </b>has
           not been set.

       <b>--root </b><i>directory</i>
           Set the root directory to <b>directory </b>(since dpkg 1.21.10),
           which sets the installation directory to «<i>directory</i>» and the
           administrative directory to
           «<i>directory</i><b>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</b>» if <b>DPKG_ROOT </b>has not been
           set.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--partsize </b><i>kibibytes</i>
           Specifies the maximum part size when splitting, in kibibytes
           (1024 bytes).  The default is 450 KiB.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output </b><i>complete-output</i>
           Specifies the output file name for a reassembly.

           This overrides the default for a manual reassembly (<b>--join</b>)
           and is mandatory for an automatic queue-or-reassemble
           (<b>--auto</b>).

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--npquiet</b>
           When doing automatic queue-or-reassembly <b>dpkg-split </b>usually
           prints a message if it is given a <i>part</i> that is not a binary
           package part.  This option suppresses this message, to allow
           programs such as <b>dpkg </b>to cope with both split and unsplit
           packages without producing spurious messages.

       <b>--msdos</b>
           Forces the output filenames generated by <b>--split </b>to be MSDOS-
           compatible.

           This mangles the prefix - either the default derived from the
           input filename or the one supplied as an argument:
           alphanumerics are lowercased, plus signs are replaced by <b>x</b>'s
           and all other characters are discarded.

           The result is then truncated as much as is necessary, and
           filenames of the form <i>prefixN</i><b>of</b><i>M</i><b>.deb </b>are generated.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0   </b>The requested split, merge, or other command succeeded.
           <b>--info </b>commands count as successful even if the files are not
           binary package parts.

       <b>1   </b>Only occurs with <b>--auto </b>and indicates that the <i>part</i> file was
           not a binary package part.

       <b>2   </b>Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
           usage, a file that looked like a package part file but was
           corrupted, or interactions with the system, such as accesses
           to the database, memory allocations, etc.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
           If set and <b>--root </b>option has not been specified, it will be
           used as the filesystem root directory (since dpkg 1.21.10).

       <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR</b>
           If set and the <b>--admindir </b>or <b>--root </b>options have not been
           specified, it will be used as the <b>dpkg </b>data directory (since
           dpkg 1.21.10).

       <b>DPKG_DEBUG</b>
           Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
           The currently accepted flags are described in the <b>dpkg</b>
           <b>--debug </b>option, but not all these flags might have an effect
           on this program.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.22.7).  The accepted values are:
           <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>(default).

       <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>
           If set, it will be used as the timestamp (as seconds since
           the epoch) in the <a href="../man5/deb-split.5.html">deb-split(5)</a>'s <b>ar</b>(5) container.

           Since dpkg 1.18.11.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/parts</i>
           The default queue directory for part files awaiting automatic
           reassembly.

           The filenames used in this directory are in a format internal
           to <b>dpkg-split </b>and are unlikely to be useful to other
           programs, and in any case the filename format should not be
           relied upon.
</pre> <h2>
SECURITY </h2>
<pre>
       Examining or joining untrusted split package archives should be
       considered a security boundary, and any breakage of that boundary
       stemming from these operations should be considered a security
       vulnerability.  Performing these operations over untrusted data
       as root is strongly discouraged.

       Auto-accumulating and discarding split package parts are
       considered privileged operations that might allow root
       escalation.  These operations must never be delegated to an
       untrusted user or be done on untrusted packages, as that might
       allow root access to the system.

       Splitting package archives should only be performed over trusted
       data.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Full details of the packages in the queue are impossible to get
       without digging into the queue directory yourself.

       There is no easy way to test whether a file that may be a binary
       package part is one.
