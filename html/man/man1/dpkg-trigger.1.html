NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-trigger - a package trigger utility
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-trigger </b>[<i>option</i>...] <i>trigger-name</i>

       <b>dpkg-trigger </b>[<i>option</i>...] <i>command</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-trigger </b>is a tool to explicitly activate triggers and check
       for its support on the running <b>dpkg</b>.

       This can be used by maintainer scripts in complex and conditional
       situations where the file triggers, or the declarative <b>activate</b>
       triggers control file directive, are insufficiently rich.  It can
       also be used for testing and by system administrators (but note
       that the triggers won't actually be run by <b>dpkg-trigger</b>).

       Unrecognized trigger name syntaxes are an error for <b>dpkg-trigger</b>.

       This program was introduced in dpkg 1.14.17.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--check-supported</b>
           Check if the running <b>dpkg </b>supports triggers (usually called
           from a postinst).  Will exit <b>0 </b>if a triggers-capable <b>dpkg </b>has
           run, or <b>1 </b>with an error message to stderr if not.  Normally,
           however, it is better just to activate the desired trigger
           with <b>dpkg-trigger</b>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--admindir=</b><i>dir</i>
           Change the location of the <b>dpkg </b>database.  Defaults to
           <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</i> if <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR </b>has not been set.

       <b>--root=</b><i>directory</i>
           Set the root directory to <i>directory</i>, which sets the
           administrative directory to
           «<i>directory</i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg» (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>--by-package=</b><i>package</i>
           Override trigger awaiter (normally set by <b>dpkg </b>through the
           <b>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE </b>environment variable of the
           maintainer scripts, naming the package to which the script
           belongs, and this will be used by default).

       <b>--no-await</b>
           This option arranges that the calling package <i>T</i> (if any) need
           not await the processing of this trigger; the interested
           package(s) <i>I</i>, will not be added to <i>T</i>'s trigger processing
           awaited list and <i>T</i>'s status is unchanged.  <i>T</i> may be
           considered installed even though <i>I</i> may not yet have processed
           the trigger.

       <b>--await</b>
           This option does the inverse of <b>--no-await </b>(since dpkg
           1.17.21).  If the interested package has declared a “noawait”
           directive, then this option will not be effective.  It is
           currently the default behavior.

       <b>--no-act</b>
           Just test, do not actually change anything.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0   </b>The requested action was successfully performed.  Or a check
           or assertion command returned true.

       <b>1   </b>A check or assertion command returned false.

       <b>2   </b>Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
           usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to
           the database, memory allocations, etc.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
           If set and the <b>--root </b>option has not been specified, it will
           be used as the filesystem root directory (since dpkg 1.21.0).

       <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR</b>
           If set and the <b>--admindir </b>option has not been specified, it
           will be used as the <b>dpkg </b>data directory.

       <b>DPKG_DEBUG</b>
           Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
           The currently accepted flags are described in the <b>dpkg</b>
           <b>--debug </b>option, but not all these flags might have an effect
           on this program.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.22.7).  The accepted values are:
           <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>(default).
