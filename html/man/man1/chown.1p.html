PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       chown — change the file ownership
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       chown <b>[</b>-h<b>] </b><i>owner</i><b>[</b>:<i>group</i><b>] </b><i>file</i>...

       chown -R <b>[</b>-H|-L|-P<b>] </b><i>owner</i><b>[</b>:<i>group</i><b>] </b><i>file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>chown</i> utility shall set the user ID of the file named by each
       <i>file</i> operand to the user ID specified by the <i>owner</i> operand.

       For each <i>file</i> operand, or, if the <b>-R </b>option is used, each file
       encountered while walking the directory trees specified by the
       <i>file</i> operands, the <i>chown</i> utility shall perform actions equivalent
       to the <i>chown</i>() function defined in the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, called with the following arguments:

        1. The <i>file</i> operand shall be used as the <i>path</i> argument.

        2. The user ID indicated by the <i>owner</i> portion of the first
           operand shall be used as the <i>owner</i> argument.

        3. If the <i>group</i> portion of the first operand is given, the group
           ID indicated by it shall be used as the <i>group</i> argument;
           otherwise, the group ownership shall not be changed.

       Unless <i>chown</i> is invoked by a process with appropriate privileges,
       the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of a regular file shall be
       cleared upon successful completion; the set-user-ID and set-
       group-ID bits of other file types may be cleared.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>chown</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-h        </b>For each file operand that names a file of type
                 symbolic link, <i>chown</i> shall attempt to set the user ID
                 of the symbolic link. If a group ID was specified, for
                 each file operand that names a file of type symbolic
                 link, <i>chown</i> shall attempt to set the group ID of the
                 symbolic link.

       <b>-H        </b>If the <b>-R </b>option is specified and a symbolic link
                 referencing a file of type directory is specified on
                 the command line, <i>chown</i> shall change the user ID (and
                 group ID, if specified) of the directory referenced by
                 the symbolic link and all files in the file hierarchy
                 below it.

       <b>-L        </b>If the <b>-R </b>option is specified and a symbolic link
                 referencing a file of type directory is specified on
                 the command line or encountered during the traversal of
                 a file hierarchy, <i>chown</i> shall change the user ID (and
                 group ID, if specified) of the directory referenced by
                 the symbolic link and all files in the file hierarchy
                 below it.

       <b>-P        </b>If the <b>-R </b>option is specified and a symbolic link is
                 specified on the command line or encountered during the
                 traversal of a file hierarchy, <i>chown</i> shall change the
                 owner ID (and group ID, if specified) of the symbolic
                 link. The <i>chown</i> utility shall not follow the symbolic
                 link to any other part of the file hierarchy.

       <b>-R        </b>Recursively change file user and group IDs. For each
                 <i>file</i> operand that names a directory, <i>chown</i> shall change
                 the user ID (and group ID, if specified) of the
                 directory and all files in the file hierarchy below it.
                 Unless a <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, or <b>-P </b>option is specified, it is
                 unspecified which of these options will be used as the
                 default.

       Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <b>-H</b>,
       <b>-L</b>, and <b>-P </b>shall not be considered an error. The last option
       specified shall determine the behavior of the utility.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>owner</i><b>[</b>:<i>group</i><b>]</b>
                 A user ID and optional group ID to be assigned to <i>file</i>.
                 The <i>owner</i> portion of this operand shall be a user name
                 from the user database or a numeric user ID. Either
                 specifies a user ID which shall be given to each file
                 named by one of the <i>file</i> operands. If a numeric <i>owner</i>
                 operand exists in the user database as a user name, the
                 user ID number associated with that user name shall be
                 used as the user ID. Similarly, if the <i>group</i> portion of
                 this operand is present, it shall be a group name from
                 the group database or a numeric group ID. Either
                 specifies a group ID which shall be given to each file.
                 If a numeric group operand exists in the group database
                 as a group name, the group ID number associated with
                 that group name shall be used as the group ID.

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file whose user ID is to be modified.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>chown</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The utility executed successfully and all requested changes
             were made.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Only the owner of a file or the user with appropriate privileges
       may change the owner or group of a file.

       Some implementations restrict the use of <i>chown</i> to a user with
       appropriate privileges.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The System V and BSD versions use different exit status codes.
       Some implementations used the exit status as a count of the
       number of errors that occurred; this practice is unworkable since
       it can overflow the range of valid exit status values. These are
       masked by specifying only 0 and &gt;0 as exit values.

       The functionality of <i>chown</i> is described substantially through
       references to functions in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. In this way, there is no duplication of effort
       required for describing the interactions of permissions, multiple
       groups, and so on.

       The 4.3 BSD method of specifying both owner and group was
       included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because:

        *  There are cases where the desired end condition could not be
           achieved using the <i>chgrp</i> and <i>chown</i> (that only changed the
           user ID) utilities. (If the current owner is not a member of
           the desired group and the desired owner is not a member of
           the current group, the <i>chown</i>() function could fail unless
           both owner and group are changed at the same time.)

        *  Even if they could be changed independently, in cases where
           both are being changed, there is a 100% performance penalty
           caused by being forced to invoke both utilities.

       The BSD syntax <i>user</i>[.<i>group</i>] was changed to <i>user</i>[:<i>group</i>] in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because the &lt;period&gt; is a valid character
       in login names (as specified by the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, login names consist of characters in the portable
       filename character set). The &lt;colon&gt; character was chosen as the
       replacement for the &lt;period&gt; character because it would never be
       allowed as a character in a user name or group name on historical
       implementations.

       The <b>-R </b>option is considered by some observers as an undesirable
       departure from the historical UNIX system tools approach; since a
       tool, <i>find</i>, already exists to recurse over directories, there
       seemed to be no good reason to require other tools to have to
       duplicate that functionality.  However, the <b>-R </b>option was deemed
       an important user convenience, is far more efficient than forking
       a separate process for each element of the directory hierarchy,
       and is in widespread historical use.
