PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       delta — make a delta (change) to an SCCS file (<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       delta <b>[</b>-nps<b>] [</b>-g <i>list</i><b>] [</b>-m <i>mrlist</i><b>] [</b>-r <i>SID</i><b>] [</b>-y<b>[</b><i>comment</i><b>]] </b><i>file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>delta</i> utility shall be used to permanently introduce into the
       named SCCS files changes that were made to the files retrieved by
       <i>get</i> (called the <i>g-files</i>, or generated files).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>delta</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       that the <b>-y </b>option has an optional option-argument. This optional
       option-argument shall not be presented as a separate argument.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-r </b><i>SID</i>    Uniquely identify which delta is to be made to the SCCS
                 file. The use of this option shall be necessary only if
                 two or more outstanding <i>get</i> commands for editing (<i>get</i>
                 <b>-e</b>) on the same SCCS file were done by the same person
                 (login name). The SID value specified with the <b>-r</b>
                 option can be either the SID specified on the <i>get</i>
                 command line or the SID to be made as reported by the
                 <i>get</i> utility; see <a href="get.1p.html">get(1p)</a>.

       <b>-s        </b>Suppress the report to standard output of the activity
                 associated with each <i>file</i>.  See the STDOUT section.

       <b>-n        </b>Specify retention of the edited <i>g-file</i> (normally
                 removed at completion of delta processing).

       <b>-g </b><i>list</i>   Specify a <i>list</i> (see <a href="get.1p.html">get(1p)</a> for the definition of <i>list</i>)
                 of deltas that shall be ignored when the file is
                 accessed at the change level (SID) created by this
                 delta.

       <b>-m </b><i>mrlist</i> Specify a modification request (MR) number that the
                 application shall supply as the reason for creating the
                 new delta. This shall be used if the SCCS file has the
                 <b>v </b>flag set; see <a href="admin.1p.html">admin(1p)</a>.

                 If <b>-m </b>is not used and <b>'-' </b>is not specified as a file
                 argument, and the standard input is a terminal, the
                 prompt described in the STDOUT section shall be written
                 to standard output before the standard input is read;
                 if the standard input is not a terminal, no prompt
                 shall be issued.

                 MRs in a list shall be separated by &lt;blank&gt; characters
                 or escaped &lt;newline&gt; characters. An unescaped &lt;newline&gt;
                 shall terminate the MR list. The escape character is
                 &lt;backslash&gt;.

                 If the <b>v </b>flag has a value, it shall be taken to be the
                 name of a program which validates the correctness of
                 the MR numbers. If a non-zero exit status is returned
                 from the MR number validation program, the <i>delta</i>
                 utility shall terminate. (It is assumed that the MR
                 numbers were not all valid.)

       <b>-y[</b><i>comment</i><b>]</b>
                 Describe the reason for making the delta. The <i>comment</i>
                 shall be an arbitrary group of lines that would meet
                 the definition of a text file. Implementations shall
                 support <i>comment</i>s from zero to 512 bytes and may support
                 longer values. A null string (specified as either <b>-y</b>,
                 <b>-y""</b>, or in response to a prompt for a comment) shall
                 be considered a valid <i>comment</i>.

                 If <b>-y </b>is not specified and <b>'-' </b>is not specified as a
                 file argument, and the standard input is a terminal,
                 the prompt described in the STDOUT section shall be
                 written to standard output before the standard input is
                 read; if the standard input is not a terminal, no
                 prompt shall be issued. An unescaped &lt;newline&gt; shall
                 terminate the comment text. The escape character is
                 &lt;backslash&gt;.

                 The <b>-y </b>option shall be required if the <i>file</i> operand is
                 specified as <b>'-'</b>.

       <b>-p        </b>Write (to standard output) the SCCS file differences
                 before and after the delta is applied in <i>diff</i> format;
                 see <a href="diff.1p.html">diff(1p)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of an existing SCCS file or a directory. If
                 <i>file</i> is a directory, the <i>delta</i> utility shall behave as
                 though each file in the directory were specified as a
                 named file, except that non-SCCS files (last component
                 of the pathname does not begin with <b>s.</b>)  and unreadable
                 files shall be silently ignored.

                 If exactly one <i>file</i> operand appears, and it is <b>'-'</b>, the
                 standard input shall be read; each line of the standard
                 input shall be taken to be the name of an SCCS file to
                 be processed. Non-SCCS files and unreadable files shall
                 be silently ignored.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be a text file used only in the
       following cases:

        *  To read an <i>mrlist</i> or a <i>comment</i> (see the <b>-m </b>and <b>-y </b>options).

        *  A <i>file</i> operand shall be specified as <b>'-'</b>.  In this case, the
           <b>-y </b>option must be used to specify the comment, and if the
           SCCS file has the <b>v </b>flag set, the <b>-m </b>option must also be used
           to specify the MR list.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Input files shall be text files whose data is to be included in
       the SCCS files. If the first character of any line of an input
       file is &lt;SOH&gt; in the POSIX locale, the results are unspecified.
       If this file contains more than 99999 lines, the number of lines
       recorded in the header for this file shall be 99999 for this
       delta.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>delta</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error, and informative messages written to
                 standard output.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone in which the time and date are
                 written in the SCCS file. If the <i>TZ</i> variable is unset
                 or NULL, an unspecified system default timezone is
                 used.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       If SIGINT is caught, temporary files shall be cleaned up and
       <i>delta</i> shall exit with a non-zero exit code. The standard action
       shall be taken for all other signals; see <i>Section 1.4</i>, <i>Utility</i>
       <i>Description Defaults</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The standard output shall be used only for the following messages
       in the POSIX locale:

        *  Prompts (see the <b>-m </b>and <b>-y </b>options) in the following formats:

               "MRs? "

               "comments? "

           The MR prompt, if written, shall always precede the comments
           prompt.

        *  A report of each file's activities (unless the <b>-s </b>option is
           specified) in the following format:

               "%s\n%d inserted\n%d deleted\n%d unchanged\n", &lt;<i>New SID</i>&gt;,
                   &lt;<i>number of lines inserted</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>number of lines deleted</i>&gt;,
                   &lt;<i>number of lines unchanged</i>&gt;
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Any SCCS files updated shall be files of an unspecified format.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>System Date and Time</b>
       When a delta is added to an SCCS file, the system date and time
       shall be recorded for the new delta. If a <i>get</i> is performed using
       an SCCS file with a date recorded apparently in the future, the
       behavior is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Problems can arise if the system date and time have been modified
       (for example, put forward and then back again, or unsynchronized
       clocks across a network) and can also arise when different values
       of the <i>TZ</i> environment variable are used.

       Problems of a similar nature can also arise for the operation of
       the <i>get</i> utility, which records the date and time in the file
       body.
