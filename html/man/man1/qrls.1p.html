PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       qrls — release batch jobs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       qrls <b>[</b>-h <i>hold_list</i><b>] </b><i>job_identifier</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A batch job might have one or more holds, which prevent the batch
       job from executing. A batch job from which all the holds have
       been removed becomes eligible for execution and is said to have
       been released. A batch job hold is removed by sending a request
       to the batch server that manages the batch job. The <i>qrls</i> utility
       is a user-accessible client of batch services that requests holds
       be removed from one or more batch jobs.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall remove one or more holds from those batch
       jobs for which a batch <i>job_identifier</i> is presented to the
       utility.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall remove holds from batch jobs in the order
       in which their batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the
       utility.

       If the <i>qrls</i> utility fails to process a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall remove holds on each batch job by sending
       a <i>Release Job Request</i> to the batch server that manages the batch
       job.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall not exit until the holds have been removed
       from the batch job corresponding to each successfully processed
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-h </b><i>hold_list</i>
                 Define the types of holds to be removed from the batch
                 job.

                 The <i>qrls</i> <b>-h </b>option shall accept a value for the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                 (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <i>Section 6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>).

                 The <i>qrls</i> utility shall accept a value for the <i>hold_list</i>
                 option-argument that is a string of one or more of the
                 characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, or <b>'o'</b>, or the single character
                 <b>'n'</b>.

                 For each unique character in the <i>hold_list</i> option-
                 argument, the <i>qrls</i> utility shall add a value to the
                 <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute of the batch job as follows, each
                 representing a different hold type:

                 u     USER

                 s     SYSTEM

                 o     OPERATOR

                 If any of these characters are duplicated in the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument, the duplicates shall be
                 ignored.

                 An existing <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute can be cleared by the
                 following hold type:

                 n     NO_HOLD

                 The <i>qrls</i> utility shall consider it an error if any hold
                 type other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with hold type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                 of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument. The <i>qrls</i> utility shall
                 permit the repetition of characters, but shall not
                 assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other hold types. The
                 conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe any additional hold types, how they are
                 specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                 the behavior of the utility.

                 If the <b>-h </b>option is not presented to the <i>qrls</i> utility,
                 the implementation shall remove the USER hold in the
                 <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qrls</i> utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
       to the syntax for a batch <i>job_identifier</i> (see <i>Section 3.3.1</i>,
       <i>Batch Job Identifier</i>).
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>qrls</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LOGNAME</i>   Determine the login name of the user.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <i>qrls</i> utility shall not
       be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
       the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
       batch <i>job_identifier</i> does not exist on the server. Whether or not
       the <i>qrls</i> utility waits to output the diagnostic message while
       attempting to locate the job on other servers is implementation-
       defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qrls</i> utility allows users, operators, and administrators to
       remove holds from jobs.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility does not support any job selection options or
       wildcard arguments. Users may acquire a list of jobs selected by
       attributes using the <i>qselect</i> utility. For example, a user could
       select all of their held jobs.

       The <b>-h </b>option allows the user to specify the type of hold that is
       to be removed. This option allows for USER, SYSTEM, OPERATOR, and
       implementation-defined hold types. The batch server that manages
       the batch job will verify whether the user is authorized to
       remove the specified hold for the batch job. If more than one
       type of hold has been placed on the batch job, a user may wish to
       remove only some of them.

       Mail is not required on release because the administrator has the
       tools and libraries to build this option if required.

       The <i>qrls</i> utility is a new utility <i>vis-a-vis</i> existing practice; it
       has been defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 as the natural
       complement to the <i>qhold</i> utility.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qrls</i> utility may be removed in a future version.
