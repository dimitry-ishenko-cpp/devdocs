NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-prune-packed - Remove extra objects that are already in pack
       files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git prune-packed</i> [-n | --dry-run] [-q | --quiet]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This program searches the <b>$GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY </b>for all objects
       that currently exist in a pack file as well as in the independent
       object directories.

       All such extra objects are removed.

       A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with
       delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an
       associated index file.

       Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup
       engines, disk storage, etc.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -n, --dry-run
           Don’t actually remove any objects, only show those that would
           have been removed.

       -q, --quiet
           Squelch the progress indicator.
