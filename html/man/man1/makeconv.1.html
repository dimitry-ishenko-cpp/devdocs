NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>makeconv </b>- compile a converter table
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>makeconv </b>[ <b>-h</b>, <b>-?</b>, <b>--help </b>] [ <b>-c</b>, <b>--copyright </b>] [ <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose </b>]
       [ <b>-d</b>, <b>--destdir </b><i>destination</i> ] <i>convertertable</i> ...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>makeconv </b>converts the ICU converter table <i>convertertable</i> into a
       binary file. The binary file has the same base name as
       <i>convertertable</i> but has a <b>.cnv </b>extension (instead of the typical
       <b>.ucm </b>extension of the <i>convertertable</i> file).  This binary file can
       then be read directly by ICU, or used by <a href="pkgdata.1.html">pkgdata(1)</a> for
       incorporation into a larger archive or library.

       The <i>convertertable</i> must be in the ICU ucm (Unicode Codepage
       Mapping) format in order to be understood by <b>makeconv</b>.  The ICU
       ucm format is similar to the IBM NLTC upmap/tpmap/rpmap files.
       Comments in the <i>convertertable</i> are handled as follows. If a
       comment (starting with a `#' sign) that is after some text does
       contain the fallback indicator `|' then only the text starting
       with the `#' sign, and ending before the `|' sign, is ignored.
       Otherwise, or if the comment is the first thing on the line, the
       comment runs up to the end of the line. This special handling of
       comments is to accommodate the practice of putting fallback
       information in comments in the strict IBM NLTC ucmap format.

       Note that new converters will be automatically found by ICU after
       their installation in ICU's data directory. They do not need to
       be listed in the <b>convrtrs.txt</b>(5) converters aliases file in order
       to be available to applications using ICU.  They do need to be
       listed there if one wants to give them aliases, or tags, though.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print help about usage and exit.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--copyright</b>
              Include a copyright notice in the binary data.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Display extra informative messages during execution.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--destdir </b><i>destination</i>
              Set the destination directory to <i>destination</i>.  The default
              destination directory is specified by the environment
              variable <b>ICU_DATA</b>.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       If an existing converter table is changed and recompiled using
       <b>makeconv</b>, the resulting binary file must be packaged in the same
       way that it was packaged initially. For example, if converters
       were grouped together in an archive or a library with <a href="pkgdata.1.html">pkgdata(1)</a>,
       then the archive or library must be rebuilt with the new binary
       file.  A standalone binary converter file will not take
       precedence over a packaged one.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ICU_DATA</b>
              Specifies the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to
              <b>${prefix}/share/icu/76.0.1/</b>.  Some tools in ICU depend on
              the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus important
              to make sure that it is present if <b>ICU_DATA </b>is set.
