PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       hash — remember or report utility locations
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       hash <b>[</b><i>utility</i>...<b>]</b>

       hash -r
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>hash</i> utility shall affect the way the current shell
       environment remembers the locations of utilities found as
       described in <i>Section 2.9.1.1</i>, <i>Command Search and Execution</i>.
       Depending on the arguments specified, it shall add utility
       locations to its list of remembered locations or it shall purge
       the contents of the list. When no arguments are specified, it
       shall report on the contents of the list.

       Utilities provided as built-ins to the shell shall not be
       reported by <i>hash</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>hash</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-r        </b>Forget all previously remembered utility locations.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>utility</i>   The name of a utility to be searched for and added to
                 the list of remembered locations. If <i>utility</i> contains
                 one or more &lt;slash&gt; characters, the results are
                 unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>hash</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>PATH</i>      Determine the location of <i>utility</i>, as described in the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 8</i>,
                 <i>Environment Variables</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The standard output of <i>hash</i> shall be used when no arguments are
       specified. Its format is unspecified, but includes the pathname
       of each utility in the list of remembered locations for the
       current shell environment. This list shall consist of those
       utilities named in previous <i>hash</i> invocations that have been
       invoked, and may contain those invoked and found through the
       normal command search process.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since <i>hash</i> affects the current shell execution environment, it is
       always provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a
       separate utility execution environment, such as one of the
       following:

           nohup hash -r
           find . -type f | xargs hash

       it does not affect the command search process of the caller's
       environment.

       The <i>hash</i> utility may be implemented as an alias—for example,
       <i>alias</i> <b>-t -</b>, in which case utilities found through normal command
       search are not listed by the <i>hash</i> command.

       The effects of <i>hash</i> <b>-r </b>can also be achieved portably by resetting
       the value of <i>PATH</i>; in the simplest form, this can be:

           PATH="$PATH"

       The use of <i>hash</i> with <i>utility</i> names is unnecessary for most
       applications, but may provide a performance improvement on a few
       implementations; normally, the hashing process is included by
       default.
