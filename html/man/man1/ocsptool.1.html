NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ocsptool </b>- GnuTLS OCSP tool
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ocsptool </b>[<b>-flags</b>] [<b>-flag </b>[<i>value</i>]] [<b>--option-name</b>[[=| ]<i>value</i>]]

       All arguments must be options.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>On verification</b>
       Responses are typically signed/issued by designated certificates
       or certificate authorities and thus this tool requires on
       verification the certificate of the issuer or the full
       certificate chain in order to determine the appropriate signing
       authority. The specified certificate of the issuer is assumed
       trusted.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d </b><i>num</i>, <b>--debug</b>=<i>num</i> Enable debugging.  This option takes an
       integer number as its argument.  The value of <i>num</i> is constrained
       to being:
           in the range 0 through 9999

       Specifies the debug level.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose </b>More verbose output.

       <b>--infile</b>=<i>file</i> Input file.

       <b>--outfile</b>=<i>str</i> Output file.

       <b>--ask</b>=<i>server name|url</i> Ask an OCSP/HTTP server on a certificate
       validity.

       Connects to the specified HTTP OCSP server and queries on the
       validity of the loaded certificate.  Its argument can be a URL or
       a plain server name. It can be combined with --load-chain, where
       it checks all certificates in the provided chain, or with
       --load-cert and --load-issuer options. The latter checks the
       provided certificate against its specified issuer certificate.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--verify-response </b>Verify response.

       Verifies the provided OCSP response against the system trust
       anchors (unless --load-trust is provided). It requires the
       --load-signer or --load-chain options to obtain the signer of the
       OCSP response.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--request-info </b>Print information on a OCSP request.

       Display detailed information on the provided OCSP request.

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--response-info </b>Print information on a OCSP response.

       Display detailed information on the provided OCSP response.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--generate-request </b>Generates an OCSP request.

       <b>--nonce</b>, <b>--no-nonce </b>Use (or not) a nonce to OCSP request.  The
       <i>no-nonce</i> form will disable the option.

       <b>--load-chain</b>=<i>file</i> Reads a set of certificates forming a chain
       from file.

       <b>--load-issuer</b>=<i>file</i> Reads issuer's certificate from file.

       <b>--load-cert</b>=<i>file</i> Reads the certificate to check from file.

       <b>--load-trust</b>=<i>file</i> Read OCSP trust anchors from file.  This option
       must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
       load-signer.

       When verifying an OCSP response read the trust anchors from the
       provided file. When this is not provided, the system's trust
       anchors will be used.

       <b>--load-signer</b>=<i>file</i> Reads the OCSP response signer from file.
       This option must not appear in combination with any of the
       following options: load-trust.

       <b>--inder</b>, <b>--no-inder </b>Use DER format for input certificates and
       private keys.  The <i>no-inder</i> form will disable the option.

       <b>--outder </b>Use DER format for output of responses (this is the
       default).

       The output will be in DER encoded format. Unlike other GnuTLS
       tools, this is the default for this tool

       <b>--outpem </b>Use PEM format for output of responses.

       The output will be in PEM format.

       <b>-Q </b><i>file</i>, <b>--load-request</b>=<i>file</i> Reads the DER encoded OCSP request
       from file.

       <b>-S </b><i>file</i>, <b>--load-response</b>=<i>file</i> Reads the DER encoded OCSP response
       from file.

       <b>--ignore-errors </b>Ignore any verification errors.

       <b>--verify-allow-broken </b>Allow broken algorithms, such as MD5 for
       verification.

       This can be combined with --verify-response.

       <b>--attime</b>=<i>timestamp</i> Perform validation at the timestamp instead of
       the system time.

       timestamp is an instance in time encoded as Unix time or in a
       human
        readable timestring such as "29 Feb 2004", "2004-02-29".  Full
       documentation available at

       or locally via info '(coreutils) date invocation'.

       <b>-v </b><i>arg</i>, <b>--version</b>=<i>arg</i> Output version of program and exit.  The
       default mode is `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print
       copyright information and `n' will print the full copyright
       notice.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help </b>Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-!</b>, <b>--more-help </b>Pass the extended usage information through a
       pager.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
              <b>Print information about an OCSP request</b>

              To parse an OCSP request and print information about the
              content, the <b>-i </b>or <b>--request-info </b>parameter may be used as
              follows.  The <b>-Q </b>parameter specify the name of the file
              containing the OCSP request, and it should contain the
              OCSP request in binary DER format.

                  $ ocsptool -i -Q ocsp-request.der

              The input file may also be sent to standard input like
              this:

                  $ cat ocsp-request.der | ocsptool --request-info

              <b>Print information about an OCSP response</b>

              Similar to parsing OCSP requests, OCSP responses can be
              parsed using the <b>-j </b>or <b>--response-info </b>as follows.

                  $ ocsptool -j -Q ocsp-response.der
                  $ cat ocsp-response.der | ocsptool --response-info

              <b>Generate an OCSP request</b>

              The <b>-q </b>or <b>--generate-request </b>parameters are used to
              generate an OCSP request.  By default the OCSP request is
              written to standard output in binary DER format, but can
              be stored in a file using <b>--outfile</b>.  To generate an OCSP
              request the issuer of the certificate to check needs to be
              specified with <b>--load-issuer </b>and the certificate to check
              with <b>--load-cert</b>.  By default PEM format is used for these
              files, although <b>--inder </b>can be used to specify that the
              input files are in DER format.

                  $ ocsptool -q --load-issuer issuer.pem --load-cert client.pem            --outfile ocsp-request.der

              When generating OCSP requests, the tool will add an OCSP
              extension containing a nonce.  This behaviour can be
              disabled by specifying <b>--no-nonce</b>.

              <b>Verify signature in OCSP response</b>

              To verify the signature in an OCSP response the <b>-e </b>or
              <b>--verify-response </b>parameter is used.  The tool will read
              an OCSP response in DER format from standard input, or
              from the file specified by <b>--load-response</b>.  The OCSP
              response is verified against a set of trust anchors, which
              are specified using <b>--load-trust</b>.  The trust anchors are
              concatenated certificates in PEM format.  The certificate
              that signed the OCSP response needs to be in the set of
              trust anchors, or the issuer of the signer certificate
              needs to be in the set of trust anchors and the OCSP
              Extended Key Usage bit has to be asserted in the signer
              certificate.

                  $ ocsptool -e --load-trust issuer.pem            --load-response ocsp-response.der

              The tool will print status of verification.

              <b>Verify signature in OCSP response against given</b>
              <b>certificate</b>

              It is possible to override the normal trust logic if you
              know that a certain certificate is supposed to have signed
              the OCSP response, and you want to use it to check the
              signature.  This is achieved using <b>--load-signer </b>instead
              of <b>--load-trust</b>.  This will load one certificate and it
              will be used to verify the signature in the OCSP response.
              It will not check the Extended Key Usage bit.

                  $ ocsptool -e --load-signer ocsp-signer.pem            --load-response ocsp-response.der

              This approach is normally only relevant in two situations.
              The first is when the OCSP response does not contain a
              copy of the signer certificate, so the <b>--load-trust </b>code
              would fail.  The second is if you want to avoid the
              indirect mode where the OCSP response signer certificate
              is signed by a trust anchor.

              <b>Real-world example</b>

              Here is an example of how to generate an OCSP request for
              a certificate and to verify the response.  For
              illustration we'll use the <b>blog.josefsson.org </b>host, which
              (as of writing) uses a certificate from CACert.  First
              we'll use <b>gnutls-cli </b>to get a copy of the server
              certificate chain.  The server is not required to send
              this information, but this particular one is configured to
              do so.

                  $ echo | gnutls-cli -p 443 blog.josefsson.org --save-cert chain.pem

              The saved certificates normally contain a pointer to where
              the OCSP responder is located, in the Authority
              Information Access Information extension.  For example,
              from <b>certtool -i &lt; chain.pem </b>there is this information:

                            Authority Information Access Information (not critical):
                                 Access Method: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1 (id-ad-ocsp)
                                 Access Location URI: <a href="https://ocsp.CAcert.org/">https://ocsp.CAcert.org/</a>

              This means that ocsptool can discover the servers to
              contact over HTTP.  We can now request information on the
              chain certificates.

                  $ ocsptool --ask --load-chain chain.pem

              The request is sent via HTTP to the OCSP server address
              found in the certificates. It is possible to override the
              address of the OCSP server as well as ask information on a
              particular certificate using --load-cert and
              --load-issuer.

                  $ ocsptool --ask <a href="https://ocsp.CAcert.org/">https://ocsp.CAcert.org/</a> --load-chain chain.pem
