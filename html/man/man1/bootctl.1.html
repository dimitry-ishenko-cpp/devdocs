NAME </h2>
<pre>
       bootctl - Control EFI firmware boot settings and manage boot
       loader
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>bootctl </b>[OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>bootctl </b>can check the EFI firmware and boot loader status, list
       and manage available boot loaders and boot loader entries, and
       install, update, or remove the <a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a> boot loader on the
       current system.
</pre> <h2>
GENERIC EFI FIRMWARE/BOOT LOADER COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       These commands are available on any EFI system, regardless of the
       boot loader used.

       <b>status</b>
           Shows brief information about the system firmware, the boot
           loader that was used to boot the system, the boot loaders
           currently available in the ESP, the boot loaders listed in
           the firmware's list of boot loaders and the current default
           boot loader entry. If no command is specified, this is the
           implied default.

           See the example below for details of the output.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>reboot-to-firmware </b>[<i>BOOL</i>]
           Query or set the "Reboot-Into-Firmware-Setup" flag of the EFI
           firmware. Takes a boolean argument which controls whether to
           show the firmware setup on next system reboot. If the
           argument is omitted shows the current status of the flag, or
           whether the flag is supported. This controls the same flag as
           <b>systemctl reboot --firmware-setup</b>, but is more low-level and
           allows setting the flag independently from actually
           requesting a reboot.

           Hint: use <b>systemctl reboot --firmware-setup </b>to reboot into
           firmware setup once. See <a href="systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> for details.

           Added in version 251.
</pre> <h2>
BOOT LOADER SPECIFICATION COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       These commands are available for all boot loaders that implement
       the <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[1], such as <b>systemd-boot</b>.

       <b>list</b>
           Shows all available boot loader entries implementing the <b>Boot</b>
           <b>Loader Specification</b>[1], as well as any other entries
           discovered or automatically generated by a boot loader
           implementing the <b>Boot Loader Interface</b>[2]. JSON output may be
           requested with <b>--json=</b>.

           See the example below for details of the output.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>unlink </b><i>ID</i>
           Removes a boot loader entry including the files it refers to.
           Takes a single boot loader entry ID string or a glob pattern
           as argument. Referenced files such as kernel or initrd are
           only removed if no other entry refers to them.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>cleanup</b>
           Removes files from the ESP and XBOOTLDR partitions that
           belong to the entry token but are not referenced in any boot
           loader entries.

           Added in version 253.
</pre> <h2>
BOOT LOADER INTERFACE COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       These commands are available for all boot loaders that implement
       the <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[1] and the <b>Boot Loader</b>
       <b>Interface</b>[2], such as <b>systemd-boot</b>.

       <b>set-default </b><i>ID</i>, <b>set-oneshot </b><i>ID</i>
           Sets the default boot loader entry. Takes a single boot
           loader entry ID string or a glob pattern as argument. The
           <b>set-oneshot </b>command will set the default entry only for the
           next boot, the <b>set-default </b>will set it persistently for all
           future boots.

           <b>bootctl list </b>can be used to list available boot loader
           entries and their IDs.

           In addition, the boot loader entry ID may be specified as one
           of: <b>@default</b>, <b>@oneshot </b>or <b>@current</b>, which correspond to the
           current default boot loader entry for all future boots, the
           current default boot loader entry for the next boot, and the
           currently booted boot loader entry. These special IDs are
           resolved to the current values of the EFI variables
           <i>LoaderEntryDefault</i>, <i>LoaderEntryOneShot</i> and
           <i>LoaderEntrySelected</i>, see <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[1] for
           details. These special IDs are primarily useful as a quick
           way to persistently make the currently booted boot loader
           entry the default choice, or to upgrade the default boot
           loader entry for the next boot to the default boot loader
           entry for all future boots, but may be used for other
           operations too.

           If set to <b>@saved </b>the chosen entry will be saved as an EFI
           variable on every boot and automatically selected the next
           time the boot loader starts.

           When an empty string ("") is specified as the ID, then the
           corresponding EFI variable will be unset.

           Hint: use <b>systemctl reboot --boot-loader-entry=</b><i>ID</i> to reboot
           into a specific boot entry and <b>systemctl reboot</b>
           <b>--boot-loader-menu=</b><i>timeout</i> to reboot into the boot loader
           menu once. See <a href="systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a> for details.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>set-timeout </b><i>TIMEOUT</i>, <b>set-timeout-oneshot </b><i>TIMEOUT</i>
           Sets the boot loader menu timeout in seconds. The
           <b>set-timeout-oneshot </b>command will set the timeout only for the
           next boot. See <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a> for details about the syntax
           of time spans.

           If this is set to <b>menu-disabled </b>or <b>menu-hidden </b>or <b>0</b>, no menu
           is shown and the default entry will be booted immediately,
           while setting this to <b>menu-force </b>disables the timeout while
           always showing the menu. When an empty string ("") is
           specified the bootloader will revert to its default menu
           timeout.

           Added in version 250.
</pre> <h2>
SYSTEMD-BOOT COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       These commands manage the <b>systemd-boot </b>EFI boot loader, and do
       not work in conjunction with other boot loaders.

       <b>install</b>
           Installs <b>systemd-boot </b>into the EFI system partition. A copy
           of <b>systemd-boot </b>will be stored as the EFI default/fallback
           loader at <i>ESP</i>/EFI/BOOT/BOOT*.EFI. The boot loader is then
           added to the top of the firmware's boot loader list.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>update</b>
           Updates all installed versions of <a href="../man7/systemd-boot.7.html">systemd-boot(7)</a>, if the
           available version is newer than the version installed in the
           EFI system partition. This also includes the EFI
           default/fallback loader at <i>ESP</i>/EFI/BOOT/BOOT*.EFI. The boot
           loader is then added to end of the firmware's boot loader
           list if missing.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>remove</b>
           Removes all installed versions of <b>systemd-boot </b>from the EFI
           system partition and the firmware's boot loader list.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>is-installed</b>
           Checks whether <b>systemd-boot </b>is installed in the ESP. Note
           that a single ESP might host multiple boot loaders; this
           hence checks whether <b>systemd-boot </b>is one (of possibly many)
           installed boot loaders — and neither whether it is the
           default nor whether it is registered in any EFI variables.

           Added in version 243.

       <b>random-seed</b>
           Generates a random seed and stores it in the EFI System
           Partition (ESP), for use by the <b>systemd-boot </b>boot loader. If
           a random seed already exists in the ESP it is refreshed. Also
           generates a random 'system token' and stores it persistently
           as an EFI variable, if one has not been set before. If the
           boot loader finds the random seed in the ESP and the system
           token in the EFI variable it will derive a random seed to
           pass to the OS and a new seed to store in the ESP from the
           combination of both. The random seed passed to the OS is
           credited to the kernel's entropy pool by the system manager
           during early boot, and permits userspace to boot up with an
           entropy pool fully initialized very early on. Also see
           <a href="../man8/systemd-boot-random-seed.service.8.html">systemd-boot-random-seed.service(8)</a>.

           See <b>Random Seeds</b>[3] for further information.

           Added in version 243.
</pre> <h2>
KERNEL IMAGE COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>kernel-identify </b><i>kernel</i>
           Takes a kernel image as argument. Checks what kind of kernel
           the image is. Returns one of "uki", "pe", and "unknown".

           Added in version 253.

       <b>kernel-inspect </b><i>kernel</i>
           Takes a kernel image as argument. Prints details about the
           image.

           Added in version 253.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--esp-path=</b>
           Path to the EFI System Partition (ESP). If not specified,
           /efi/, /boot/, and /boot/efi/ are checked in turn. It is
           recommended to mount the ESP to /efi/, if possible.

       <b>--boot-path=</b>
           Path to the Extended Boot Loader partition, as defined in the
           <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[1]. If not specified, /boot/ is
           checked. It is recommended to mount the Extended Boot Loader
           partition to /boot/, if possible.

       <b>--root=</b><i>root</i>
           Takes a directory path as an argument. All paths will be
           prefixed with the given alternate <i>root</i> path, including config
           search paths.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--image=</b><i>image</i>
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If
           specified, all operations are applied to file system in the
           indicated disk image. This option is similar to <b>--root=</b>, but
           operates on file systems stored in disk images or block
           devices. The disk image should either contain just a file
           system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table,
           following the <b>Discoverable Partitions Specification</b>[4]. For
           further information on supported disk images, see
           <a href="systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a>'s switch of the same name.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--image-policy=</b><i>policy</i>
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per
           <a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy(7)</a>. The policy is enforced when
           operating on the disk image specified via <b>--image=</b>, see
           above. If not specified defaults to the "*" policy, i.e. all
           recognized file systems in the image are used.

       <b>--install-source=</b>
           When installing binaries with <b>--root= </b>or <b>--image=</b>, selects
           where to source them from. Takes one of "auto" (the default),
           "image" or "host". With "auto" binaries will be picked from
           the specified directory or image, and if not found they will
           be picked from the host. With "image" or "host" no fallback
           search will be performed if the binaries are not found in the
           selected source.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print-esp-path</b>
           This option modifies the behaviour of <b>status</b>. Only prints the
           path to the EFI System Partition (ESP) to standard output and
           exits.

           Added in version 236.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--print-boot-path</b>
           This option modifies the behaviour of <b>status</b>. Only prints the
           path to the Extended Boot Loader partition if it exists, and
           the path to the ESP otherwise to standard output and exit.
           This command is useful to determine where to place boot
           loader entries, as they are preferably placed in the Extended
           Boot Loader partition if it exists and in the ESP otherwise.

           Boot Loader Specification Type #1 entries should generally be
           placed in the directory "$(bootctl -x)/loader/entries/".
           Existence of that directory may also be used as indication
           that boot loader entry support is available on the system.
           Similarly, Boot Loader Specification Type #2 entries should
           be placed in the directory "$(bootctl -x)/EFI/Linux/".

           Note that this option (similarly to the <b>--print-esp-path</b>
           option mentioned above), is available independently from the
           boot loader used, i.e. also without <b>systemd-boot </b>being
           installed.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--print-root-device</b>
           Print the path to the block device node backing the root file
           system of the local OS. This prints a path such as
           /dev/nvme0n1p5. If the root file system is backed by
           dm-crypt/LUKS or dm-verity the underlying block device is
           returned. If the root file system is backed by multiple block
           devices (as supported by btrfs) the operation will fail. If
           the switch is specified twice (i.e.  <b>-RR</b>) and the discovered
           block device is a partition device the "whole" block device
           it belongs to is determined and printed (e.g.  /dev/nvme0n1).
           If the root file system is "tmpfs" (or a similar in-memory
           file system), the block device backing /usr/ is returned if
           applicable. If the root file system is a network file system
           (e.g. NFS, CIFS) the operation will fail.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--no-variables</b>
           Do not touch the firmware's boot loader list stored in EFI
           variables.

           Added in version 220.

       <b>--graceful</b>
           Ignore failure when the EFI System Partition cannot be found,
           when EFI variables cannot be written, or a different or newer
           boot loader is already installed. Currently only applies to
           <b>is-installed</b>, <b>update</b>, and <b>random-seed </b>verbs.

           Added in version 244.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppress printing of the results of various commands and also
           the hints about ESP being unavailable.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--make-entry-directory=yes|no</b>
           Controls creation and deletion of the <b>Boot Loader</b>
           <b>Specification</b>[1] Type #1 entry directory on the file system
           containing resources such as kernel and initrd images during
           <b>install </b>and <b>remove</b>, respectively. The directory is named
           after the entry token, as specified with <b>--entry-token=</b>
           parameter described below, and is placed immediately below
           the <i>$BOOT</i> root directory (i.e. beneath the file system
           returned by the <b>--print-boot-path </b>option, see above).
           Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--entry-token=</b>
           Controls how to name and identify boot loader entries for
           this OS installation. Accepted during <b>install</b>, and takes one
           of "auto", "machine-id", "os-id", "os-image-id" or an
           arbitrary string prefixed by "literal:" as argument.

           If set to <b>machine-id </b>the entries are named after the machine
           ID of the running system (e.g.
           "b0e793a9baf14b5fa13ecbe84ff637ac"). See <a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a> for
           details about the machine ID concept and file.

           If set to <b>os-id </b>the entries are named after the OS ID of the
           running system, i.e. the <i>ID=</i> field of <a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release(5)</a> (e.g.
           "fedora"). Similarly, if set to <b>os-image-id </b>the entries are
           named after the OS image ID of the running system, i.e. the
           <i>IMAGE_ID=</i> field of os-release (e.g.
           "vendorx-cashier-system").

           If set to <b>auto </b>(the default), the /etc/kernel/entry-token
           file will be read if it exists, and the stored value used.
           Otherwise if the local machine ID is initialized it is used.
           Otherwise <i>IMAGE_ID=</i> from os-release will be used, if set.
           Otherwise, <i>ID=</i> from os-release will be used, if set.

           Unless set to "machine-id", or when
           <b>--make-entry-directory=yes </b>is used the selected token string
           is written to a file /etc/kernel/entry-token, to ensure it
           will be used for future entries. This file is also read by
           <a href="../man8/kernel-install.8.html">kernel-install(8)</a>, in order to identify under which name to
           generate boot loader entries for newly installed kernels, or
           to determine the entry names for removing old ones.

           Using the machine ID for naming the entries is generally
           preferable, however there are cases where using the other
           identifiers is a good option. Specifically: if the
           identification data that the machine ID entails shall not be
           stored on the (unencrypted) <i>$BOOT</i> partition, or if the ID
           shall be generated on first boot and is not known when the
           entries are prepared. Note that using the machine ID has the
           benefit that multiple parallel installations of the same OS
           can coexist on the same medium, and they can update their
           boot loader entries independently. When using another
           identifier (such as the OS ID or the OS image ID), parallel
           installations of the same OS would try to use the same entry
           name. To support parallel installations, the installer must
           use a different entry token when adding a second
           installation.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--all-architectures</b>
           Install binaries for all supported EFI architectures (this
           implies <b>--no-variables</b>).

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--efi-boot-option-description=</b>
           Description of the entry added to the firmware's boot option
           list. Defaults to "Linux Boot Manager".

           Using the default entry name "Linux Boot Manager" is
           generally preferable as only one bootloader installed to a
           single ESP partition should be used to boot any number of OS
           installations found on the various disks installed in the
           system. Specifically distributions should not use this flag
           to install a branded entry in the boot option list. However
           in situations with multiple disks, each with their own ESP
           partition, it can be beneficial to make it easier to identify
           the bootloader being used in the firmware's boot option menu.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
           Dry run for <b>unlink </b>and <b>cleanup</b>.

           In dry run mode, the unlink and cleanup operations only print
           the files that would get deleted without actually deleting
           them.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--json=</b><i>MODE</i>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for
           the shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace
           or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same,
           with indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON
           output, the default).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
</pre> <h2>
SIGNED .EFI FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>bootctl install </b>and <b>update </b>will look for a <b>systemd-boot </b>file
       ending with the ".efi.signed" suffix first, and copy that instead
       of the normal ".efi" file. This allows distributions or end-users
       to provide signed images for UEFI SecureBoot.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
       <b>bootctl --print-root-device </b>returns exit status 80 in case the
       root file system is not backed by single block device, and other
       non-zero exit statuses on other errors.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>$SYSTEMD_RELAX_ESP_CHECKS=1</i> is set the validation checks for
       the ESP are relaxed, and the path specified with <b>--esp-path= </b>may
       refer to any kind of file system on any kind of partition.

       Similarly, <i>$SYSTEMD_RELAX_XBOOTLDR_CHECKS=1</i> turns off some
       validation checks for the Extended Boot Loader partition.
