NAME </h2>

       <b>dbprobe </b>- database response time and availability information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dbprobe.pl </b>[<i>delay</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>dbprobe </b>utility is used by <a href="pmdadbping.1.html">pmdadbping(1)</a> to measure response
       time from a database.  A given query is executed on the database
       at the requested interval (<i>delay</i>, which defaults to 60 seconds).
       This response time measure can be exported via the Performance
       Co-Pilot framework for live and historical monitoring using
       <i>pmdadbping</i>(1).
