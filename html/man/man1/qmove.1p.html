PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       qmove — move batch jobs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       qmove <i>destination job_identifier</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       To move a batch job is to remove the batch job from the batch
       queue in which it resides and instantiate the batch job in
       another batch queue.  A batch job is moved by a request to the
       batch server that manages the batch job. The <i>qmove</i> utility is a
       user-accessible batch client that requests the movement of one or
       more batch jobs.

       The <i>qmove</i> utility shall move those batch jobs, and only those
       batch jobs, for which a batch <i>job_identifier</i> is presented to the
       utility.

       The <i>qmove</i> utility shall move batch jobs in the order in which the
       corresponding batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the utility.

       If the <i>qmove</i> utility fails to process a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qmove</i> utility shall move batch jobs by sending a <i>Move Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> to the batch server that manages each batch job. The
       <i>qmove</i> utility shall not exit before the batch jobs corresponding
       to all successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i>s have been
       moved.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qmove</i> utility shall accept one operand that conforms to the
       syntax for a destination (see <i>Section 3.3.2</i>, <i>Destination</i>).

       The <i>qmove</i> utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
       to the syntax for a batch <i>job_identifier</i> (see <i>Section 3.3.1</i>,
       <i>Batch Job Identifier</i>).
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>qmove</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LOGNAME</i>   Determine the login name of the user.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <i>qmove</i> utility shall not
       be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
       the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
       batch <i>job_identifier</i> does not exist on the server. Whether or not
       the <i>qmove</i> utility waits to output the diagnostic message while
       attempting to locate the job on other servers is implementation-
       defined.

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qmove</i> utility allows users to move jobs between queues.

       The alternative to using the <i>qmove</i> utility—deleting the batch job
       and requeuing it—entails considerably more typing.

       Since the means of selecting jobs based on attributes has been
       encapsulated in the <i>qselect</i> utility, the only option of the <i>qmove</i>
       utility concerns authorization. The <b>-u </b>option provides the user
       with the convenience of changing the user identifier under which
       the batch job will execute. Minimalism and consistency have taken
       precedence over convenience; the <b>-u </b>option has been deleted
       because the equivalent capability exists with the <b>-u </b>option of
       the <i>qalter</i> utility.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qmove</i> utility may be removed in a future version.
