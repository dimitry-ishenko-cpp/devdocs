</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       umask — get or set the file mode creation mask
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       umask <b>[</b>-S<b>] [</b><i>mask</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>umask</i> utility shall set the file mode creation mask of the
       current shell execution environment (see <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell</i>
       <i>Execution Environment</i>) to the value specified by the <i>mask</i>
       operand. This mask shall affect the initial value of the file
       permission bits of subsequently created files. If <i>umask</i> is called
       in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as
       one of the following:

           (umask 002)
           nohup umask ...
           find . -exec umask ... \;

       it shall not affect the file mode creation mask of the caller's
       environment.

       If the <i>mask</i> operand is not specified, the <i>umask</i> utility shall
       write to standard output the value of the file mode creation mask
       of the invoking process.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>umask</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-S        </b>Produce symbolic output.

       The default output style is unspecified, but shall be recognized
       on a subsequent invocation of <i>umask</i> on the same system as a <i>mask</i>
       operand to restore the previous file mode creation mask.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>mask</i>      A string specifying the new file mode creation mask.
                 The string is treated in the same way as the <i>mode</i>
                 operand described in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section
                 for <i>chmod</i>.

                 For a <i>symbolic_mode</i> value, the new value of the file
                 mode creation mask shall be the logical complement of
                 the file permission bits portion of the file mode
                 specified by the <i>symbolic_mode</i> string.

                 In a <i>symbolic_mode</i> value, the permissions <i>op</i> characters
                 <b>'+' </b>and <b>'-' </b>shall be interpreted relative to the
                 current file mode creation mask; <b>'+' </b>shall cause the
                 bits for the indicated permissions to be cleared in the
                 mask; <b>'-' </b>shall cause the bits for the indicated
                 permissions to be set in the mask.

                 The interpretation of <i>mode</i> values that specify file
                 mode bits other than the file permission bits is
                 unspecified.

                 In the octal integer form of <i>mode</i>, the specified bits
                 are set in the file mode creation mask.

                 The file mode creation mask shall be set to the
                 resulting numeric value.

                 The default output of a prior invocation of <i>umask</i> on
                 the same system with no operand also shall be
                 recognized as a <i>mask</i> operand.

STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>umask</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       When the <i>mask</i> operand is not specified, the <i>umask</i> utility shall
       write a message to standard output that can later be used as a
       <i>umask mask</i> operand.

       If <b>-S </b>is specified, the message shall be in the following format:

           "u=%s,g=%s,o=%s\n", &lt;<i>owner permissions</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>group permissions</i>&gt;,
               &lt;<i>other permissions</i>&gt;

       where the three values shall be combinations of letters from the
       set {<i>r</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>}; the presence of a letter shall indicate that the
       corresponding bit is clear in the file mode creation mask.

       If a <i>mask</i> operand is specified, there shall be no output written
       to standard output.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The file mode creation mask was successfully changed, or no
             <i>mask</i> operand was supplied.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since <i>umask</i> affects the current shell execution environment, it
       is generally provided as a shell regular built-in.

       In contrast to the negative permission logic provided by the file
       mode creation mask and the octal number form of the <i>mask</i>
       argument, the symbolic form of the <i>mask</i> argument specifies those
       permissions that are left alone.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Either of the commands:

           umask a=rx,ug+w

           umask 002

       sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files have their
       S_IWOTH bit cleared.

       After setting the mode mask with either of the above commands,
       the <i>umask</i> command can be used to write out the current value of
       the mode mask:

           <b>$ </b>umask
           <b>0002</b>

       (The output format is unspecified, but historical implementations
       use the octal integer mode format.)

           <b>$ </b>umask -S
           <b>u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx</b>

       Either of these outputs can be used as the mask operand to a
       subsequent invocation of the <i>umask</i> utility.

       Assuming the mode mask is set as above, the command:

           umask g-w

       sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files have their
       S_IWGRP and S_IWOTH bits cleared.

       The command:

           umask -- -w

       sets the mode mask so that subsequently created files have all
       their write bits cleared. Note that <i>mask</i> operands <b>-r</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>-x </b>or
       anything beginning with a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;, must be preceded by
       <b>"--" </b>to keep it from being interpreted as an option.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Since <i>umask</i> affects the current shell execution environment, it
       is generally provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is
       called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment,
       such as one of the following:

           (umask 002)
           nohup umask ...
           find . -exec umask ... \;

       it does not affect the file mode creation mask of the environment
       of the caller.

       The description of the historical utility was modified to allow
       it to use the symbolic modes of <i>chmod</i>.  The <b>-s </b>option used in
       early proposals was changed to <b>-S </b>because <b>-s </b>could be confused
       with a <i>symbolic_mode</i> form of mask referring to the S_ISUID and
       S_ISGID bits.

       The default output style is unspecified to permit implementors to
       provide migration to the new symbolic style at the time most
       appropriate to their users. A <b>-o </b>flag to force octal mode output
       was omitted because the octal mode may not be sufficient to
       specify all of the information that may be present in the file
       mode creation mask when more secure file access permission checks
       are implemented.

       It has been suggested that trusted systems developers might
       appreciate ameliorating the requirement that the mode mask
       ``affects'' the file access permissions, since it seems access
       control lists might replace the mode mask to some degree. The
       wording has been changed to say that it affects the file
       permission bits, and it leaves the details of the behavior of how
       they affect the file access permissions to the description in the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
