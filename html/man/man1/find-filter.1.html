</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>find-filter </b>- fine-grained file selection based on time
       attributes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/find-filter </b>[<b>-v?</b>]  <i>predicate</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>find-filter </b>is a filter for a list of file names read on standard
       input, and if the files match the <i>predicate</i> their names are
       written on standard output.

       The supported <i>predicate</i> forms are based on the file's creation
       time or modification time, and take the form <b>ctime </b>or <b>mtime</b>
       followed by a time specification.  A time specification takes the
       form of a <b>+ </b>or <b>- </b>followed by days (a non-negative integer),
       optionally followed by a colon (<b>:</b>) and hours (an integer in the
       range 0 to 23), optionally followed by another colon (<b>:</b>) and
       minutes (an integer in the range 0 to 59).

       The semantics of the time specification are that a file matches
       the predicate if the chosen time attribute for the file is <i>less</i>
       <i>than</i> (<b>+</b>) the current time minus the time specification, else <i>more</i>
       <i>than or equal to</i> (<b>-</b>) the current time minus the time
       specification.  Alternatively, <b>+ </b>means <i>before</i> the current time
       minus the time specification, and <b>- </b>means <i>at</i> or <i>after</i> the current
       time minus the time specification.

       <b>find-filter </b>is intended to be used to provide finer-grain and
       platform independent selection compared to the <b>-mtime </b>or <b>-ctime</b>
       options of <a href="find.1.html">find(1)</a>.  <b>find-filter </b>is expected to be used as a
       post-filter for the output from <a href="find.1.html">find(1)</a>, and this is how it is
       used in the <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> scripts to select files to be
       compressed or culled.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following <i>predicate</i> examples illustrate some typical uses.

       <b>mtime +3    </b>Matches files modified more than 3 days ago.

       <b>ctime -0:2  </b>Matches files created in the last 2 hours.

       <b>ctime +0:0:15</b>
                   Matches files created more than 15 minutes ago.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       There are none, unless the <b>-v </b>option is used, in which case some
       diagnostics are written to standard error.

       Exit status is always zero, unless there are errors found when
       parsing the command line arguments.
