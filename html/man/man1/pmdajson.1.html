</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdajson </b>- JSON PMDA
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdajson </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metrics from arbitrary sources generating JavaScript
       Object Notation (JSON) syntax.

       At least one pair of JSON inputs are required for <b>pmdajson </b>to
       provide metrics for PCP clients; one describing metric metadata
       and one containing metric values data.  Metadata is read once
       from a file at PMDA startup while the data is read every time a
       request for metric values is made by a PCP client.  The data is
       read either from a JSON file or an external command generating
       JSON output.  More than one pair of JSON inputs can be used to
       support arbitrary number of metric sources in different
       configured directories.

       The overall JSON format description is at <b><a href="http://www.json.org/">http://www.json.org/</a> </b>.
</pre> <h2>
JSON DATA SOURCES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdajson </b>reads a mandatory JSON configuration file

           • $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/json/config.json</i>

       This file can contain the following PMDA options using the JSON
       syntax:

           • directory_list
           • trusted_directory_list

       <b>pmdajson </b>searches the directories listed for these options
       looking for files named <i>metadata.json</i> and (by default) <i>data.json</i>.
       The JSON metadata files describe the metric names, types, and
       other details of the associated JSON metric data.  The JSON data
       file name is configurable, and can also be an external command
       instead of a periodically updated (by external tools) data file.

       Each of these found JSON file/command pairs form a <i>JSON data</i>
       <i>source</i>.

       For example, let us assume the following simple JSON data file
       that contains values for two metrics, one of type string and one
       numeric:

         {
           "string_value": "testing, 1, 2, 3",
           "read_count": 0
         }

       For these metrics the metadata file needed by <b>pmdajson </b>would be:

         {
           "metrics": [
             {
               "name": "string_value",
               "pointer": "/string_value",
               "type": "string"
             },
             {
               "name": "read_count",
               "pointer": "/read_count",
               "type": "integer",
               "description": "Times values read"
             }
           ]
         }

       For further details on the JSON metadata format and options, see
       the README file included as part of <b>pmdajson </b>installation.
</pre> <h2>
SECURITY MODEL </h2>
<pre>
       JSON data sources listed for the <i>directory_list</i> option are not
       trusted, meaning that if external commands to generate the needed
       JSON data are used, these commands are run as user <b>nobody</b>.

       JSON data sources listed for the <i>trusted_directory_list</i> option
       are trusted, meaning that if external commands to generate the
       needed JSON data are used, these commands are run as user <b>root</b>.

       For further details on security and description on running
       external commands, see the README file included as part of
       <b>pmdajson </b>installation.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       Install the JSON PMDA by using the Install script as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/json</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, do the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/json</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdajson </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/json/README</i>
              additional documentation for <b>pmdajson </b>used JSON files

       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/json/config.json</i>
              configuration file for the <b>pmdajson </b>agent

       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/json/Install</i>
              installation script for the <b>pmdajson </b>agent

       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/json/Remove</i>
              undo installation script for the <b>pmdajson </b>agent

       $PCP_LOG_DIR<i>/pmcd/json.log</i>
              default log file for messages from the <b>pmdajson </b>agent
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
