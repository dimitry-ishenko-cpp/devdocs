</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-index-pack - Build pack index file for an existing packed
       archive
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git index-pack</i> [-v] [-o &lt;index-file&gt;] [--[no-]rev-index] &lt;pack-file&gt;
       <i>git index-pack</i> --stdin [--fix-thin] [--keep] [-v] [-o &lt;index-file&gt;]
                         [--[no-]rev-index] [&lt;pack-file&gt;]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, builds a
       pack index file (.idx) for it, and optionally writes a
       reverse-index (.rev) for the specified pack. The packed archive,
       together with the pack index, can then be placed in the
       objects/pack/ directory of a Git repository.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -v
           Be verbose about what is going on, including progress status.

       -o &lt;index-file&gt;
           Write the generated pack index into the specified file.
           Without this option the name of pack index file is
           constructed from the name of packed archive file by replacing
           .pack with .idx (and the program fails if the name of packed
           archive does not end with .pack).

       --[no-]rev-index
           When this flag is provided, generate a reverse index (a <b>.rev</b>
           file) corresponding to the given pack. If <b>--verify </b>is given,
           ensure that the existing reverse index is correct. Takes
           precedence over <b>pack.writeReverseIndex</b>.

       --stdin
           When this flag is provided, the pack is read from stdin
           instead and a copy is then written to &lt;pack-file&gt;. If
           &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified, the pack is written to
           objects/pack/ directory of the current Git repository with a
           default name determined from the pack content. If &lt;pack-file&gt;
           is not specified consider using --keep to prevent a race
           condition between this process and <i>git repack</i>.

       --fix-thin
           Fix a "thin" pack produced by <b>git pack-objects --thin </b>(see
           <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> for details) by adding the excluded
           objects the deltified objects are based on to the pack. This
           option only makes sense in conjunction with --stdin.

       --keep
           Before moving the index into its final destination create an
           empty .keep file for the associated pack file. This option is
           usually necessary with --stdin to prevent a simultaneous <i>git</i>
           <i>repack</i> process from deleting the newly constructed pack and
           index before refs can be updated to use objects contained in
           the pack.

       --keep=&lt;msg&gt;
           Like --keep, create a .keep file before moving the index into
           its final destination. However, instead of creating an empty
           file place <i>&lt;msg&gt;</i> followed by an LF into the .keep file. The
           <i>&lt;msg&gt;</i> message can later be searched for within all .keep
           files to locate any which have outlived their usefulness.

       --index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]
           This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It allows
           to force the version for the generated pack index, and to
           force 64-bit index entries on objects located above the given
           offset.

       --strict[=&lt;msg-id&gt;=&lt;severity&gt;...]
           Die, if the pack contains broken objects or links. An
           optional comma-separated list of <b>&lt;msg-id&gt;=&lt;severity&gt; </b>can be
           passed to change the severity of some possible issues, e.g.,
           <b>--strict="missingEmail=ignore,badTagName=error"</b>. See the
           entry for the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>configuration options in
           <a href="git-fsck.1.html">git-fsck(1)</a> for more information on the possible values of
           <b>&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;severity&gt;</b>.

       --progress-title
           For internal use only.

           Set the title of the progress bar. The title is "Receiving
           objects" by default and "Indexing objects" when <b>--stdin </b>is
           specified.

       --check-self-contained-and-connected
           Die if the pack contains broken links. For internal use only.

       --fsck-objects[=&lt;msg-id&gt;=&lt;severity&gt;...]
           Die if the pack contains broken objects, but unlike <b>--strict</b>,
           don’t choke on broken links. If the pack contains a tree
           pointing to a .gitmodules blob that does not exist, prints
           the hash of that blob (for the caller to check) after the
           hash that goes into the name of the pack/idx file (see
           "Notes").

           An optional comma-separated list of <b>&lt;msg-id&gt;=&lt;severity&gt; </b>can
           be passed to change the severity of some possible issues,
           e.g., <b>--fsck-objects="missingEmail=ignore,badTagName=ignore"</b>.
           See the entry for the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>configuration options in
           <a href="git-fsck.1.html">git-fsck(1)</a> for more information on the possible values of
           <b>&lt;msg-id&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;severity&gt;</b>.

       --threads=&lt;n&gt;
           Specifies the number of threads to spawn when resolving
           deltas. This requires that index-pack be compiled with
           pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning.
           This is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor
           machines. The required amount of memory for the delta search
           window is however multiplied by the number of threads.
           Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of
           CPU’s and use maximum 3 threads.

       --max-input-size=&lt;size&gt;
           Die, if the pack is larger than &lt;size&gt;.

       --object-format=&lt;hash-algorithm&gt;
           Specify the given object format (hash algorithm) for the
           pack. The valid values are <i>sha1</i> and (if enabled) <i>sha256</i>. The
           default is the algorithm for the current repository (set by
           <b>extensions.objectFormat</b>), or <i>sha1</i> if no value is set or
           outside a repository.

           This option cannot be used with --stdin.

           Note: At present, there is no interoperability between
           SHA-256 repositories and SHA-1 repositories.

       Historically, we warned that SHA-256 repositories may later need
       backward incompatible changes when we introduce such
       interoperability features. Today, we only expect compatible
       changes. Furthermore, if such changes prove to be necessary, it
       can be expected that SHA-256 repositories created with today’s
       Git will be usable by future versions of Git without data loss.

       --promisor[=&lt;message&gt;]
           Before committing the pack-index, create a .promisor file for
           this pack. Particularly helpful when writing a promisor pack
           with --fix-thin since the name of the pack is not final until
           the pack has been fully written. If a <b>&lt;message&gt; </b>is provided,
           then that content will be written to the .promisor file for
           future reference. See <b>partial clone</b>[1] for more information.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Once the index has been created, the hash that goes into the name
       of the pack/idx file is printed to stdout. If --stdin was also
       used then this is prefixed by either "pack\t", or "keep\t" if a
       new .keep file was successfully created. This is useful to remove
       a .keep file used as a lock to prevent the race with <i>git repack</i>
       mentioned above.
