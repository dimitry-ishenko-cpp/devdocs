NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdalibvirt </b>- libvirt PMDA
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdalibvirt </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts live performance data from libvirt hypervisor and
       domains (VMs).

       See the libvirt documentation for detailed description of each
       metric.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdalibvirt </b>reads an optional ini-style configuration file

           • $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/libvirt/libvirt.conf</i>

       This file can contain in its <b>[pmda] </b>section overriding values for
       the following PMDA options:

           • user
           • uri
           • backing

       By default, <b>root</b>, <b>qemu:///system</b>, and <b>False </b>are used as values
       for these options, respectively.

       The backing setting can be used to expand block device
       information to cover backing chains with recent libvirt versions.

       The old API setting can be used in environments where recent
       libvirt API additions are not available (e.g., RHEL 6 /
       libvirt-0.10.2) to provide some of the metrics available with the
       newer API.  Regardless of the API version, no guest agent is
       needed for the metrics.

       Note that using non-root user typically requires also libvirt
       side configuration; please refer to libvirt documentation for
       further details on this.

       Once the needed setup is ready, you can test the connection and
       install the PMDA to enable access to the names and values for the
       libvirt performance metrics.  To install, do the following as
       root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt</b>
           <b># ./connect</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, do the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/libvirt</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdalibvirt </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/libvirt/libvirt.conf</i>
              configuration file for the <b>pmdalibvirt </b>agent

       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/libvirt/connect</i>
              connection test helper using the <b>pmdalibvirt </b>agent
              configuration

       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/libvirt/Install</i>
              installation script for the <b>pmdalibvirt </b>agent

       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR<i>/libvirt/Remove</i>
              undo installation script for the <b>pmdalibvirt </b>agent

       $PCP_LOG_DIR<i>/pmcd/libvirt.log</i>
              default log file for messages from the <b>pmdalibvirt </b>agent
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
