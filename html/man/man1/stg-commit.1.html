NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-commit - Finalize patches to the stack base
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg commit</i> [OPTIONS] [patch]...
       <i>stg commit</i> [OPTIONS] -n &lt;number&gt;
       <i>stg commit</i> [OPTIONS] --all
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Finalize one or more patches into the base of the current stack
       and remove them from the series. This is the opposite of
       <a href="stg-uncommit.1.html">stg-uncommit(1)</a>. Use this command when a patch is completed and
       no longer needs to be managed with StGit.

       By default, the bottommost patch is committed. If patch names are
       given, the stack is rearranged so that those patches are at the
       bottom, and then they are committed.

       The -n/--number option specifies the number of applied patches to
       commit (counting from the bottom of the stack). If -a/--all is
       given, all applied patches are committed.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -n &lt;number&gt;, --number=&lt;number&gt;
           Commit the specified number of applied patches

       -a, --all
           Commit all applied patches

       --allow-empty
           Allow empty patches to be committed
