SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dnf [options] &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;...]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>DNF</i> is the next upcoming major version of <i>YUM</i>, a package manager
       for RPM-based Linux distributions. It roughly maintains CLI
       compatibility with YUM and defines a strict API for extensions
       and plugins.

       Plugins can modify or extend features of DNF or provide
       additional CLI commands on top of those mentioned below. If you
       know the name of such a command (including commands mentioned
       below), you may find/install the package which provides it using
       the appropriate virtual provide in the form of
       <b>dnf-command(&lt;alias&gt;)</b>, where <b>&lt;alias&gt; </b>is the name of the command;
       e.g.``dnf install 'dnf-command(versionlock)'`` installs a
       <b>versionlock </b>plugin. This approach also applies to specifying
       dependencies of packages that require a particular DNF command.

       Return values:

       • <b>0  </b>: Operation was successful.

       • <b>1  </b>: An error occurred, which was handled by dnf.

       • <b>3  </b>: An unknown unhandled error occurred during operation.

       • <b>100</b>: See <i>check-update</i>

       • <b>200</b>: There was a problem with acquiring or releasing of locks.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-4     </b>Resolve to IPv4 addresses only.

       <b>-6     </b>Resolve to IPv6 addresses only.

       <b>--advisory=&lt;advisory&gt;, --advisories=&lt;advisory&gt;</b>
              Include packages corresponding to the advisory ID, Eg.
              FEDORA-2201-123.  Applicable for the <b>install</b>, <b>repoquery</b>,
              <b>updateinfo</b>, <b>upgrade </b>and <b>offline-upgrade </b>(dnf-plugins-core)
              commands.

       <b>--allowerasing</b>
              Allow erasing of installed packages to resolve
              dependencies. This option could be used as an alternative
              to the <b>yum swap </b>command where packages to remove are not
              explicitly defined.

       <b>--assumeno</b>
              Automatically answer no for all questions.

       <b>-b, --best</b>
              Try the best available package versions in transactions.
              Specifically during <i>dnf upgrade</i>, which by default skips
              over updates that can not be installed for dependency
              reasons, the switch forces DNF to only consider the latest
              packages. When running into packages with broken
              dependencies, DNF will fail giving a reason why the latest
              version can not be installed.

              Note that the use of the newest available version is only
              guaranteed for the packages directly requested (e.g. as a
              command line arguments), and the solver may use older
              versions of dependencies to meet their requirements.

       <b>--bugfix</b>
              Include packages that fix a bugfix issue.  Applicable for
              the <b>install</b>, <b>repoquery</b>, <b>updateinfo</b>, <b>upgrade </b>and
              <b>offline-upgrade </b>(dnf-plugins-core) commands.

       <b>--bz=&lt;bugzilla&gt;, --bzs=&lt;bugzilla&gt;</b>
              Include packages that fix a Bugzilla ID, Eg. 123123.
              Applicable for the <b>install</b>, <b>repoquery</b>, <b>updateinfo</b>, <b>upgrade</b>
              and <b>offline-upgrade </b>(dnf-plugins-core) commands.

       <b>-C, --cacheonly</b>
              Run entirely from system cache, don't update the cache and
              use it even in case it is expired.

              DNF uses a separate cache for each user under which it
              executes. The cache for the root user is called the system
              cache. This switch allows a regular user read-only access
              to the system cache, which usually is more fresh than the
              user's and thus he does not have to wait for metadata
              sync.

       <b>--color=&lt;color&gt;</b>
              Control whether color is used in terminal output. Valid
              values are <b>always</b>, <b>never </b>and <b>auto </b>(default).

       <b>--comment=&lt;comment&gt;</b>
              Add a comment to the transaction history.

       <b>-c &lt;config file&gt;, --config=&lt;config file&gt;</b>
              Configuration file location.

       <b>--cve=&lt;cves&gt;, --cves=&lt;cves&gt;</b>
              Include packages that fix a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities
              and Exposures) ID (<i><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/about/">http://cve.mitre.org/about/</a> </i>), Eg.
              CVE-2201-0123.  Applicable for the <b>install</b>, <b>repoquery</b>,
              <b>updateinfo</b>, <b>upgrade </b>and <b>offline-upgrade </b>(dnf-plugins-core)
              commands.

       <b>-d &lt;debug level&gt;, --debuglevel=&lt;debug level&gt;</b>
              Debugging output level. This is an integer value between 0
              (no additional information strings) and 10 (shows all
              debugging information, even that not understandable to the
              user), default is 2. Deprecated, use <b>-v </b>instead.

       <b>--debugsolver</b>
              Dump data aiding in dependency solver debugging into
              <b>./debugdata</b>.

       <b>--disableexcludes=[all|main|&lt;repoid&gt;],</b>
       <b>--disableexcludepkgs=[all|main|&lt;repoid&gt;]</b>
          Disable the configuration file excludes. Takes one of the
          following three options:

          • <b>all</b>, disables all configuration file excludes

          • <b>main</b>, disables excludes defined in the <b>[main] </b>section

          • <b>repoid</b>, disables excludes defined for the given repository

       <b>--disable, --set-disabled</b>
              Disable specified repositories (automatically saves). The
              option has to be used together with the <b>config-manager</b>
              command (dnf-plugins-core).

       <b>--disableplugin=&lt;plugin names&gt;</b>
              Disable the listed plugins specified by names or globs.

       <b>--disablerepo=&lt;repoid&gt;</b>
              Temporarily disable active repositories for the purpose of
              the current dnf command.  Accepts an id, a comma-separated
              list of ids, or a glob of ids. This option can be
              specified multiple times, but is mutually exclusive with
              <b>--repo</b>.

       <b>--downloaddir=&lt;path&gt;, --destdir=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Redirect downloaded packages to provided directory. The
              option has to be used together with the -<i>-downloadonly</i>
              command line option, with the <b>download</b>, <b>modulesync</b>,
              <b>reposync </b>or <b>system-upgrade </b>commands (dnf-plugins-core).

       <b>--downloadonly</b>
              Download the resolved package set without performing any
              rpm transaction (install/upgrade/erase).

              Packages are removed after the next successful
              transaction. This applies also when used together with
              <b>--destdir </b>option as the directory is considered as a part
              of the DNF cache. To persist the packages, use the
              <b>download </b>command instead.

       <b>-e &lt;error level&gt;, --errorlevel=&lt;error level&gt;</b>
              Error output level. This is an integer value between 0 (no
              error output) and 10 (shows all error messages), default
              is 3. Deprecated, use <b>-v </b>instead.

       <b>--enable, --set-enabled</b>
              Enable specified repositories (automatically saves). The
              option has to be used together with the <b>config-manager</b>
              command (dnf-plugins-core).

       <b>--enableplugin=&lt;plugin names&gt;</b>
              Enable the listed plugins specified by names or globs.

       <b>--enablerepo=&lt;repoid&gt;</b>
              Temporarily enable additional repositories for the purpose
              of the current dnf command.  Accepts an id, a
              comma-separated list of ids, or a glob of ids. This option
              can be specified multiple times.

       <b>--enhancement</b>
              Include enhancement relevant packages.  Applicable for the
              <b>install</b>, <b>repoquery</b>, <b>updateinfo</b>, <b>upgrade </b>and
              <b>offline-upgrade </b>(dnf-plugins-core) commands.

       <b>-x &lt;package-file-spec&gt;, --exclude=&lt;package-file-spec&gt;</b>
              Exclude packages specified by <b>&lt;package-file-spec&gt; </b>from the
              operation.

       <b>--excludepkgs=&lt;package-file-spec&gt;</b>
              Deprecated option. It was replaced by the -<i>-exclude</i>
              option.

       <b>--forcearch=&lt;arch&gt;</b>
              Force the use of an architecture. Any architecture can be
              specified.  However, use of an architecture not supported
              natively by your CPU will require emulation of some kind.
              This is usually through QEMU. The behavior of <b>--forcearch</b>
              can be configured by using the <i>arch</i> and <i>ignorearch</i>
              configuration options with values <b>&lt;arch&gt; </b>and <b>True</b>
              respectively.

       <b>-h, --help, --help-cmd</b>
              Show the help.

       <b>--installroot=&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Specifies an alternative installroot, relative to where
              all packages will be installed. Think of this like doing
              <b>chroot &lt;root&gt; dnf</b>, except using <b>--installroot </b>allows dnf
              to work before the chroot is created. It requires absolute
              path.

       • <i>cachedir</i>, <i>log files</i>, <i>releasever</i>, and <i>gpgkey</i> are taken from or
         stored in the installroot. <i>Gpgkeys</i> are imported into the
         installroot from a path relative to the host which can be
         specified in the repository section of configuration files.

       • <i>configuration file</i> and <i>reposdir</i> are searched inside the
         installroot first. If they are not present, they are taken from
         the host system.  Note:  When a path is specified within a
         command line argument (<b>--config=&lt;config file&gt; </b>in case of
         <i>configuration file</i> and <b>--setopt=reposdir=&lt;reposdir&gt; </b>for
         <i>reposdir</i>) then this path is always relative to the host with no
         exceptions.

       • <i>vars</i> are taken from the host system or installroot according to
         <i>reposdir</i> . When <i>reposdir</i> path is specified within a command
         line argument, vars are taken from the installroot. When
         <i>varsdir</i> paths are specified within a command line argument
         (<b>--setopt=varsdir=&lt;reposdir&gt;</b>) then those path are always
         relative to the host with no exceptions.

       • The <i>pluginpath</i> and <i>pluginconfpath</i> are relative to the host.
          Note: You may also want to use the command-line option
          <b>--releasever=&lt;release&gt; </b>when creating the installroot,
          otherwise the <i>$releasever</i> value is taken from the rpmdb within
          the installroot (and thus it is empty at the time of creation
          and the transaction will fail). If <b>--releasever=/ </b>is used, the
          releasever will be detected from the host (<b>/</b>) system. The new
          installroot path at the time of creation does not contain the
          <i>repository</i>, <i>releasever</i> and <i>dnf.conf</i> files.

          On a modular system you may also want to use the
          <b>--setopt=module_platform_id=&lt;module_platform_name:stream&gt;</b>
          command-line option when creating the installroot, otherwise
          the <i>module_platform_id</i> value will be taken from the
          <b>/etc/os-release </b>file within the installroot (and thus it will
          be empty at the time of creation, the modular dependency could
          be unsatisfied and modules content could be excluded).

          Installroot examples:

          <b>dnf --installroot=&lt;installroot&gt; --releasever=&lt;release&gt; install</b>
          <b>system-release</b>
                 Permanently sets the <b>releasever </b>of the system in the
                 <b>&lt;installroot&gt; </b>directory to <b>&lt;release&gt;</b>.

          <b>dnf --installroot=&lt;installroot&gt; --setopt=reposdir=&lt;path&gt;</b>
          <b>--config /path/dnf.conf upgrade</b>
                 Upgrades packages inside the installroot from a
                 repository described by <b>--setopt </b>using configuration
                 from <b>/path/dnf.conf</b>.

       <b>--newpackage</b>
              Include newpackage relevant packages.  Applicable for the
              <b>install</b>, <b>repoquery</b>, <b>updateinfo</b>, <b>upgrade </b>and
              <b>offline-upgrade </b>(dnf-plugins-core) commands.

       <b>--noautoremove</b>
              Disable removal of dependencies that are no longer used.
              It sets <i>clean_requirements_on_remove</i> configuration option
              to <b>False</b>.

       <b>--nobest</b>
              Set best option to <b>False</b>, so that transactions are not
              limited to best candidates only.

       <b>--nodocs</b>
              Do not install documentation. Sets the rpm flag
              'RPMTRANS_FLAG_NODOCS'.

       <b>--nogpgcheck</b>
              Skip checking GPG signatures on packages (if RPM policy
              allows).

       <b>--noplugins</b>
              Disable all plugins.

       <b>--obsoletes</b>
              This option has an effect on an install/update, it enables
              dnf's obsoletes processing logic. For more information see
              the <i>obsoletes</i> option.

              This option also displays capabilities that the package
              obsoletes when used together with the <i>repoquery</i> command.

              Configuration Option: <i>obsoletes</i>

       <b>-q, --quiet</b>
              In combination with a non-interactive command, shows just
              the relevant content. Suppresses messages notifying about
              the current state or actions of DNF.

       <b>-R &lt;minutes&gt;, --randomwait=&lt;minutes&gt;</b>
              Maximum command wait time.

       <b>--refresh</b>
              Set metadata as expired before running the command.

       <b>--releasever=&lt;release&gt;</b>
              Configure DNF as if the distribution release was
              <b>&lt;release&gt;</b>. This can affect cache paths, values in
              configuration files and mirrorlist URLs.

       <b>--repofrompath &lt;repo&gt;,&lt;path/url&gt;</b>
              Specify a repository to add to the repositories for this
              query.  This option can be used multiple times.

       • The repository label is specified by <b>&lt;repo&gt;</b>.

       • The path or url to the repository is specified by <b>&lt;path/url&gt;</b>.
         It is the same path as a baseurl and can be also enriched by
         the <i>repo variables</i>.

       • The configuration for the repository can be adjusted using -‐
         <i>-setopt</i>=&lt;repo&gt;.&lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;.

       • If you want to view only packages from this repository, combine
         this with the <b>--repo=&lt;repo&gt; </b>or <b>--disablerepo="*" </b>switches.

       <b>--repo=&lt;repoid&gt;, --repoid=&lt;repoid&gt;</b>
              Enable just specific repositories by an id or a glob. Can
              be used multiple times with accumulative effect. It is
              basically a shortcut for <b>--disablerepo="*"</b>
              <b>--enablerepo=&lt;repoid&gt; </b>and is mutually exclusive with the
              <b>--disablerepo </b>option.

       <b>--rpmverbosity=&lt;name&gt;</b>
              RPM debug scriptlet output level. Sets the debug level to
              <b>&lt;name&gt; </b>for RPM scriptlets.  For available levels, see the
              <b>rpmverbosity </b>configuration option.

       <b>--sec-severity=&lt;severity&gt;, --secseverity=&lt;severity&gt;</b>
              Includes packages that provide a fix for an issue of the
              specified severity.  Applicable for the <b>install</b>,
              <b>repoquery</b>, <b>updateinfo</b>, <b>upgrade </b>and <b>offline-upgrade</b>
              (dnf-plugins-core) commands.

       <b>--security</b>
              Includes packages that provide a fix for a security issue.
              Applicable for the <b>install</b>, <b>repoquery</b>, <b>updateinfo</b>, <b>upgrade</b>
              and <b>offline-upgrade </b>(dnf-plugins-core) commands.

       <b>--setopt=&lt;option&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Override a configuration option from the configuration
              file. To override configuration options for repositories,
              use <b>repoid.option </b>for the <b>&lt;option&gt;</b>. Values for
              configuration options like <b>excludepkgs</b>, <b>includepkgs</b>,
              <b>installonlypkgs </b>and <b>tsflags </b>are appended to the original
              value, they do not override it. However, specifying an
              empty value (e.g. <b>--setopt=tsflags=</b>) will clear the
              option.

       <b>--skip-broken</b>
              Resolve depsolve problems by removing packages that are
              causing problems from the transaction.  It is an alias for
              the <i>strict</i> configuration option with value <b>False</b>.
              Additionally, with the <i>enable</i> and <i>disable</i> module
              subcommands it allows one to perform an action even in
              case of broken modular dependencies.

   <b>Alias Command</b>
       Command: <b>alias</b>

       Allows the user to define and manage a list of aliases (in the
       form <b>&lt;name=value&gt;</b>), which can be then used as dnf commands to
       abbreviate longer command sequences. For examples on using the
       alias command, see <i>Alias Examples</i>. For examples on the alias
       processing, see <i>Alias Processing Examples</i>.

       To use an alias (name=value), the name must be placed as the
       first "command" (e.g. the first argument that is not an option).
       It is then replaced by its value and the resulting sequence is
       again searched for aliases. The alias processing stops when the
       first found command is not a name of any alias.

       In case the processing would result in an infinite recursion, the
       original arguments are used instead.

       Also, like in shell aliases, if the result starts with a <b>\</b>, the
       alias processing will stop.

       All aliases are defined in configuration files in the
       <b>/etc/dnf/aliases.d/ </b>directory in the [aliases] section, and
       aliases created by the alias command are written to the <b>USER.conf</b>
       file. In case of conflicts, the <b>USER.conf </b>has the highest
       priority, and alphabetical ordering is used for the rest of the
       configuration files.

       Optionally, there is the <b>enabled </b>option in the <b>[main] </b>section
       defaulting to True. This can be set for each file separately in
       the respective file, or globally for all aliases in the
       <b>ALIASES.conf </b>file.

       <b>dnf alias [options] [list] [&lt;name&gt;...]</b>
          List aliases with their final result. The <b>[&lt;alias&gt;...]</b>
          parameter further limits the result to only those aliases
          matching it.

       <b>dnf alias [options] add &lt;name=value&gt;...</b>
          Create new aliases.

       <b>dnf alias [options] delete &lt;name&gt;...</b>
          Delete aliases.

   <b>Alias Examples</b>
       <b>dnf alias list</b>
              Lists all defined aliases.

       <b>dnf alias add rm=remove</b>
              Adds a new command alias called <b>rm </b>which works the same as
              the <b>remove </b>command.

       <b>dnf alias add upgrade="\upgrade --skip-broken</b>
       <b>--disableexcludes=all --obsoletes"</b>
              Adds a new command alias called <b>upgrade </b>which works the
              same as the <b>upgrade </b>command, with additional options. Note
              that the original <b>upgrade </b>command is prefixed with a <b>\ </b>to
              prevent an infinite loop in alias processing.

   <b>Alias Processing Examples</b>
       If there are defined aliases <b>in=install </b>and <b>FORCE="--skip-broken</b>
       <b>--disableexcludes=all"</b>:

       • <b>dnf FORCE in </b>will be replaced with <b>dnf --skip-broken</b>
         <b>--disableexcludes=all install</b>

       • <b>dnf in FORCE </b>will be replaced with <b>dnf install FORCE </b>(which
         will fail)

       If there is defined alias <b>in=install</b>:

       • <b>dnf in </b>will be replaced with <b>dnf install</b>

       • <b>dnf --repo updates in </b>will be replaced with <b>dnf --repo updates</b>
         <b>in </b>(which will fail)

   <b>Autoremove Command</b>
       Command: <b>autoremove</b>
       Aliases for <i>explicit NEVRA matching</i>: <b>autoremove-n</b>, <b>autoremove-na</b>, <b>autoremove-nevra</b>

       <b>dnf [options] autoremove</b>
          Removes all packages from the system that were originally
          installed as dependencies of user-installed packages, but
          which are no longer required by any such package.

       <b>dnf [options] autoremove &lt;spec&gt;...</b>
          This is an alias for the <i>Remove Command</i> command with
          clean_requirements_on_remove set to <b>True</b>. It removes the
          specified packages from the system along with any packages
          depending on the packages being removed. Each <b>&lt;spec&gt; </b>can be
          either a <b>&lt;package-spec&gt;</b>, which specifies a package directly,
          or a <b>@&lt;group-spec&gt;</b>, which specifies an (environment) group
          which contains it. It also removes any dependencies that are
          no longer needed.

          There are also a few specific autoremove commands
          <b>autoremove-n</b>, <b>autoremove-na </b>and <b>autoremove-nevra </b>that allow
          the specification of an exact argument in the NEVRA
          (name-epoch:version-release.architecture) format.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired
       metadata. See also <i>Metadata Synchronization</i>.

   <b>Check Command</b>
       Command: <b>check</b>

       <b>dnf [options] check [--dependencies] [--duplicates] [--obsoleted]</b>
       <b>[--provides]</b>
          Checks the local packagedb and produces information on any
          problems it finds. You can limit the checks to be performed by
          using the <b>--dependencies</b>, <b>--duplicates</b>, <b>--obsoleted </b>and
          <b>--provides </b>options (the default is to check everything).

   <b>Check-Update Command</b>
       Command: <b>check-update</b>
       Aliases: <b>check-upgrade</b>

       <b>dnf [options] check-update [--changelogs]</b>
       <b>[&lt;package-file-spec&gt;...]</b>
          Non-interactively checks if updates of the specified packages
          are available. If no <b>&lt;package-file-spec&gt; </b>is given, checks
          whether any updates at all are available for your system. DNF
          exit code will be 100 when there are updates available and a
          list of the updates will be printed, 0 if not and 1 if an
          error occurs. If <b>--changelogs </b>option is specified, also
          changelog delta of packages about to be updated is printed.

          Please note that having a specific newer version available for
          an installed package (and reported by <b>check-update</b>) does not
          imply that subsequent <b>dnf upgrade </b>will install it. The
          difference is that <b>dnf upgrade </b>has restrictions (like package
          dependencies being satisfied) to take into account.

          The output is affected by the <i>autocheck_running_kernel</i>
          configuration option.

   <b>Clean Command</b>
       Command: <b>clean</b>

       Performs cleanup of temporary files kept for repositories. This
       includes any such data left behind from disabled or removed
       repositories as well as for different distribution release
       versions.

       <b>dnf clean dbcache</b>
              Removes cache files generated from the repository
              metadata. This forces DNF to regenerate the cache files
              the next time it is run.

       <b>dnf clean expire-cache</b>
              Marks the repository metadata expired. DNF will
              re-validate the cache for each repository the next time it
              is used.

       <b>dnf clean metadata</b>
              Removes repository metadata. Those are the files which DNF
              uses to determine the remote availability of packages.
              Using this option will make DNF download all the metadata
              the next time it is run.

       <b>dnf clean packages</b>
              Removes any cached packages from the system.

       <b>dnf clean all</b>
              Does all of the above.

   <b>Deplist Command</b>
       <b>dnf [options] deplist [&lt;select-options&gt;] [&lt;query-options&gt;]</b>
       <b>[&lt;package-spec&gt;]</b>
              Deprecated alias for <i>dnf repoquery --deplist</i>.

   <b>Distro-Sync Command</b>
       Command: <b>distro-sync</b>
       Aliases: <b>dsync</b>
       Deprecated aliases: <b>distrosync</b>, <b>distribution-synchronization</b>

       <b>dnf distro-sync [&lt;package-spec&gt;...]</b>
              As necessary upgrades, downgrades or keeps selected
              installed packages to match the latest version available
              from any enabled repository. If no package is given, all
              installed packages are considered.

              See also <i>Configuration Files Replacement Policy</i>.

   <b>Downgrade Command</b>
       Command: <b>downgrade</b>
       Aliases: <b>dg</b>

       <b>dnf [options] downgrade &lt;package-spec&gt;...</b>
              Downgrades the specified packages to the highest
              installable package of all known lower versions if
              possible. When version is given and is lower than version
              of installed package then it downgrades to target version.

   <b>Group Command</b>
       Command: <b>group</b>
       Aliases: <b>grp</b>
       Deprecated aliases: <b>groups</b>, <b>grouplist</b>, <b>groupinstall</b>, <b>groupupdate</b>, <b>groupremove</b>, <b>grouperase</b>, <b>groupinfo</b>

       Groups are virtual collections of packages. DNF keeps track of
       groups that the user selected ("marked") installed and can
       manipulate the comprising packages with simple commands.

       <b>dnf [options] group [summary] &lt;group-spec&gt;</b>
              Display overview of how many groups are installed and
              available. With a spec, limit the output to the matching
              groups. <b>summary </b>is the default groups subcommand.

       <b>dnf [options] group info &lt;group-spec&gt;</b>
              Display package lists of a group. Shows which packages are
              installed or available from a repository when <b>-v </b>is used.

       <b>dnf [options] group install [--with-optional] &lt;group-spec&gt;...</b>
              Mark the specified group installed and install packages it
              contains. Also include <i>optional</i> packages of the group if
              <b>--with-optional </b>is specified. All <i>Mandatory</i> and <i>Default</i>
              packages will be installed whenever possible.  Conditional
              packages are installed if they meet their requirement.  If
              the group is already (partially) installed, the command
              installs the missing packages from the group.  Depending
              on the value of <i>obsoletes configuration option</i> group
              installation takes obsoletes into account.

       <b>dnf [options] group list &lt;group-spec&gt;...</b>
              List all matching groups, either among installed or
              available groups. If nothing is specified, list all known
              groups. <b>--installed </b>and <b>--available </b>options narrow down
              the requested list.  Records are ordered by the
              <i>display_order</i> tag defined in comps.xml file.  Provides a
              list of all hidden groups by using option <b>--hidden</b>.
              Provides group IDs when the <b>-v </b>or <b>--ids </b>options are used.

       <b>dnf [options] group remove &lt;group-spec&gt;...</b>
              Mark the group removed and remove those packages in the
              group from the system which do not belong to another
              installed group and were not installed explicitly by the
              user.

       <b>dnf [options] group upgrade &lt;group-spec&gt;...</b>
              Upgrades the packages from the group and upgrades the
              group itself. The latter comprises of installing packages
              that were added to the group by the distribution and
              removing packages that got removed from the group as far
              as they were not installed explicitly by the user.

       Groups can also be marked installed or removed without physically
       manipulating any packages:

       <b>dnf [options] group mark install &lt;group-spec&gt;...</b>
              Mark the specified group installed. No packages will be
              installed by this command, but the group is then
              considered installed.

       <b>dnf [options] group mark remove &lt;group-spec&gt;...</b>
              Mark the specified group removed. No packages will be
              removed by this command.

       See also <i>Configuration Files Replacement Policy</i>.

   <b>Help Command</b>
       Command: <b>help</b>

       <b>dnf help [&lt;command&gt;]</b>
              Displays the help text for all commands. If given a
              command name then only displays help for that particular
              command.

   <b>History Command</b>
       Command: <b>history</b>
       Aliases: <b>hist</b>

       The history command allows the user to view what has happened in
       past transactions and act according to this information (assuming
       the <b>history_record </b>configuration option is set).

       <b>dnf history [list] [--reverse] [&lt;spec&gt;...]</b>
              The default history action is listing information about
              given transactions in a table. Each <b>&lt;spec&gt; </b>can be either a
              <b>&lt;transaction-spec&gt;</b>, which specifies a transaction
              directly, or a <b>&lt;transaction-spec&gt;..&lt;transaction-spec&gt;</b>,
              which specifies a range of transactions, or a
              <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b>, which specifies a transaction by a
              package which it manipulated. When no transaction is
              specified, list all known transactions.

              The "Action(s)" column lists each type of action taken in
              the transaction. The possible values are:

              • Install (I): a new package was installed on the system

              • Downgrade (D): an older version of a package replaced
                the previously-installed version

              • Obsolete (O): an obsolete package was replaced by a new
                package

              • Upgrade (U): a newer version of the package replaced the
                previously-installed version

              • Remove (E): a package was removed from the system

              • Reinstall (R): a package was reinstalled with the same
                version

              • Reason change (C): a package was kept in the system but
                its reason for being installed changed

              The "Altered" column lists the number of actions taken in
              each transaction, possibly followed by one or two of the
              following symbols:

              • <b>&gt;</b>: The RPM database was changed, outside DNF, after the
                transaction

              • <b>&lt;</b>: The RPM database was changed, outside DNF, before the
                transaction

              • <b>*</b>: The transaction aborted before completion

              • <b>#</b>: The transaction completed, but with a non-zero status

              • <b>E</b>: The transaction completed successfully, but had
                warning/error output

              <b>--reverse</b>
                     The order of <b>history list </b>output is printed in
                     reverse order.

       <b>dnf history info [&lt;spec&gt;...]</b>
              Describe the given transactions. The meaning of <b>&lt;spec&gt; </b>is
              the same as in the <i>History List Command</i>. When no
              transaction is specified, describe what happened during
              the latest transaction.

       <b>dnf history redo &lt;transaction-spec&gt;|&lt;package-file-spec&gt;</b>
              Repeat the specified transaction. Uses the last
              transaction (with the highest ID) if more than one
              transaction for given &lt;package-file-spec&gt; is found. If it
              is not possible to redo some operations due to the current
              state of RPMDB, it will not redo the transaction.

       <b>dnf history replay [--ignore-installed] [--ignore-extras]</b>
       <b>[--skip-unavailable] &lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Replay a transaction stored in file <b>&lt;filename&gt; </b>by <i>History</i>
              <i>Store Command</i>. The replay will perform the exact same
              operations on the packages as in the original transaction
              and will return with an error if case of any differences
              in installed packages or their versions. See also the
              <i>Transaction JSON Format specification</i> of the file format.

              <b>--ignore-installed</b>
                     Don't check for the installed packages being in the
                     same state as those recorded in the transaction.
                     E.g. in case there is an upgrade <b>foo-1.0 </b>-&gt; <b>foo-2.0</b>
                     stored in the transaction, but there is <b>foo-1.1</b>
                     installed on the target system.

              <b>--ignore-extras</b>
                     Don't check for extra packages pulled into the
                     transaction on the target system. E.g. the target
                     system may not have some dependency, which was
                     installed on the source system. The replay errors
                     out on this by default, as the transaction would
                     not be the same.

              <b>--skip-unavailable</b>
                     In case some packages stored in the transaction are
                     not available on the target system, skip them
                     instead of erroring out.

       <b>dnf history rollback &lt;transaction-spec&gt;|&lt;package-file-spec&gt;</b>
              Undo all transactions performed after the specified
              transaction. Uses the last transaction (with the highest
              ID) if more than one transaction for given
              &lt;package-file-spec&gt; is found.  If it is not possible to
              undo some transactions due to the current state of RPMDB,
              it will not undo any transaction.

       <b>dnf history store [--output &lt;output-file&gt;] &lt;transaction-spec&gt;</b>
              Store a transaction specified by <b>&lt;transaction-spec&gt;</b>. The
              transaction can later be replayed by the <i>History Replay</i>
              <i>Command</i>.

              Warning: The stored transaction format is considered
              unstable and may change at any time. It will work if the
              same version of dnf is used to store and replay (or
              between versions as long as it stays the same).

              <b>-o &lt;output-file&gt;, --output=&lt;output-file&gt; </b>Store the
              serialized transaction into <b>&lt;output-file</b>. Default is
              <b>transaction.json</b>.

       <b>dnf history undo &lt;transaction-spec&gt;|&lt;package-file-spec&gt;</b>
              Perform the opposite operation to all operations performed
              in the specified transaction.  Uses the last transaction
              (with the highest ID) if more than one transaction for
              given &lt;package-file-spec&gt; is found. If it is not possible
              to undo some operations due to the current state of RPMDB,
              it will not undo the transaction.

       <b>dnf history userinstalled</b>
              Show all packages installed by user, installed from a
              group or a module profile, and packages installed outside
              of DNF. I.e. it lists packages that will stay on the
              system when <i>Autoremove Command</i> or <i>Remove Command</i> along
              with <i>clean_requirements_on_remove</i> configuration option set
              to True is executed. Note the same results can be
              accomplished with <b>dnf repoquery --userinstalled</b>, and the
              repoquery command is more powerful in formatting of the
              output.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired
       metadata, except for the redo, rollback, and undo subcommands.

   <b>Info Command</b>
       Command: <b>info</b>
       Aliases: <b>if</b>

       <b>dnf [options] info [&lt;package-file-spec&gt;...]</b>
              Lists description and summary information about installed
              and available packages.

       The info command limits the displayed packages the same way as
       the <i>list command</i>.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired
       metadata. See also <i>Metadata Synchronization</i>.

   <b>Install Command</b>

       Aliases for <i>explicit NEVRA matching</i>: <b>install-n</b>, <b>install-na</b>, <b>install-nevra</b>
       Deprecated aliases: <b>localinstall</b>

       <b>dnf [options] install &lt;spec&gt;...</b>
              Makes sure that the given packages and their dependencies
              are installed on the system. Each <b>&lt;spec&gt; </b>can be either a
              <i>&lt;package-spec&gt;</i>, or a @<i>&lt;module-spec&gt;</i>, or a @<i>&lt;group-spec&gt;</i>.
              See <i>Install Examples</i>.  If a given package or provide
              cannot be (and is not already) installed, the exit code
              will be non-zero.  If the <b>&lt;spec&gt; </b>matches both a @‐
              <i>&lt;module-spec&gt;</i> and a @<i>&lt;group-spec&gt;</i>, only the module is
              installed.

              When <i>&lt;package-spec&gt;</i> to specify the exact version of the
              package is given, DNF will install the desired version, no
              matter which version of the package is already installed.
              The former version of the package will be removed in the
              case of non-installonly package.

              On the other hand if <i>&lt;package-spec&gt;</i> specifies only a name,
              DNF also takes into account packages obsoleting it when
              picking which package to install.  This behaviour is
              specific to the install command.  Note that this can lead
              to seemingly unexpected results if a package has multiple
              versions and some older version is being obsoleted. It
              creates a split in the upgrade-path and both ways are
              considered correct, the resulting package is picked simply
              by lexicographical order.

              There are also a few specific install commands <b>install-n</b>,
              <b>install-na </b>and <b>install-nevra </b>that allow the specification
              of an exact argument in the NEVRA format. As a
              consequence, &lt;spec&gt; will be not matched with provides and
              file provides.

              See also <i>Configuration Files Replacement Policy</i>.

   <b>Install Examples</b>
       <b>dnf install tito</b>
              Install the <b>tito </b>package (tito is the package name).

       <b>dnf install ~/Downloads/tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm</b>
              Install a local rpm file tito-0.6.2-1.fc22.noarch.rpm from
              the ~/Downloads/ directory.

       <b>dnf install tito-0.5.6-1.fc22</b>
              Install the package with a specific version. If the
              package is already installed it will automatically try to
              downgrade or upgrade to the specific version.

       <b>dnf --best install tito</b>
              Install the latest available version of the package. If
              the package is already installed it will try to
              automatically upgrade to the latest version. If the latest
              version of the package cannot be installed, the
              installation will fail.

       <b>dnf install vim</b>
              DNF will automatically recognize that vim is not a package
              name, but will look up and install a package that provides
              vim with all the required dependencies. Note: Package name
              match has precedence over package provides match.

       <b>dnf install</b>
       <b><a href="https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/tito/0.6.0/1.fc22/noarch/tito-0.6.0-1.fc22.noarch.rpm">https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/tito/0.6.0/1.fc22/noarch/tito-0.6.0-1.fc22.noarch.rpm</a> </b>
              Install a package directly from a URL.

       <b>dnf install '@docker'</b>
              Install all default profiles of module 'docker' and their
              RPMs. Module streams get enabled accordingly.

       <b>dnf install '@Web Server'</b>
              Install the 'Web Server' environmental group.

       <b>dnf install /usr/bin/rpmsign</b>
              Install a package that provides the /usr/bin/rpmsign file.

       <b>dnf -y install tito --setopt=install_weak_deps=False</b>
              Install the <b>tito </b>package (tito is the package name)
              without weak deps. Weak deps are not required for core
              functionality of the package, but they enhance the
              original package (like extended documentation, plugins,
              additional functions, etc.).

       <b>dnf install --advisory=FEDORA-2018-b7b99fe852 \*</b>
              Install all packages that belong to the
              "FEDORA-2018-b7b99fe852" advisory.

   <b>List Command</b>
       Command: <b>list</b>
       Aliases: <b>ls</b>

       Prints lists of packages depending on the packages' relation to
       the system. A package is <b>installed </b>if it is present in the RPMDB,
       and it is <b>available </b>if it is not installed but is present in a
       repository that DNF knows about.

       The list command also limits the displayed packages according to
       specific criteria, e.g. to only those that update an installed
       package (respecting the repository <i>priority</i>). The <i>exclude</i> option
       in the configuration file can influence the result, but if the -‐
       <i>-disableexcludes</i> command line option is used, it ensures that all
       installed packages will be listed.

       <b>dnf [options] list [--all] [&lt;package-file-spec&gt;...]</b>
              Lists all packages, present in the RPMDB, in a repository
              or both.

       <b>dnf [options] list --installed [&lt;package-file-spec&gt;...]</b>
              Lists installed packages.

       <b>dnf [options] list --available [&lt;package-file-spec&gt;...]</b>
              Lists available packages.

       <b>dnf [options] list --extras [&lt;package-file-spec&gt;...]</b>
              Lists extras, that is packages installed on the system
              that are not available in any known repository.

       <b>dnf [options] list --obsoletes [&lt;package-file-spec&gt;...]</b>
              List packages installed on the system that are obsoleted
              by packages in any known repository.

       <b>dnf [options] list --recent [&lt;package-file-spec&gt;...]</b>
              List packages recently added into the repositories.

       <b>dnf [options] list --upgrades [&lt;package-file-spec&gt;...]</b>
              List upgrades available for the installed packages.

       <b>dnf [options] list --autoremove</b>
              List packages which will be removed by the <b>dnf autoremove</b>
              command.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired
       metadata. See also <i>Metadata Synchronization</i>.

   <b>Makecache Command</b>
       Command: <b>makecache</b>
       Aliases: <b>mc</b>

       <b>dnf [options] makecache</b>
              Downloads and caches metadata for enabled repositories.
              Tries to avoid downloading whenever possible (e.g. when
              the local metadata hasn't expired yet or when the metadata
              timestamp hasn't changed).

       <b>dnf [options] makecache --timer</b>
              Like plain <b>makecache</b>, but instructs DNF to be more
              resource-aware, meaning it will not do anything if running
              on battery power, it will terminate immediately if it's
              too soon after the last successful <b>makecache </b>run (see
              <b>dnf.conf</b>(5), <i>metadata_timer_sync</i>), and if the first mirror
              in a repository mirrorlist fails, it will not try to
              synchronize the metadata from more mirrors for that
              repository.

   <b>Mark Command</b>
       Command: <b>mark</b>

       <b>dnf mark install &lt;package-spec&gt;...</b>
              Marks the specified packages as installed by user. This
              can be useful if any package was installed as a dependency
              and is desired to stay on the system when <i>Autoremove</i>
              <i>Command</i> or <i>Remove Command</i> along with
              <i>clean_requirements_on_remove</i> configuration option set to
              <b>True </b>is executed.

       <b>dnf mark remove &lt;package-spec&gt;...</b>
              Unmarks the specified packages as installed by user.
              Whenever you as a user don't need a specific package you
              can mark it for removal. The package stays installed on
              the system but will be removed when <i>Autoremove Command</i> or
              <i>Remove Command</i> along with <i>clean_requirements_on_remove</i>
              configuration option set to <b>True </b>is executed. You should
              use this operation instead of <i>Remove Command</i> if you're not
              sure whether the package is a requirement of other user
              installed packages on the system.

       <b>dnf mark group &lt;package-spec&gt;...</b>
              Marks the specified packages as installed by group. This
              can be useful if any package was installed as a dependency
              or a user and is desired to be protected and handled as a
              group member like during group remove.

   <b>Module Command</b>
       Command: <b>module</b>

       Modularity overview is available at <i>man page dnf.modularity(7)</i>.
       Module subcommands take <i>&lt;module-spec&gt;</i>... arguments that specify
       modules or profiles.

       <b>dnf [options] module install &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              Install module profiles, including their packages.  In
              case no profile was provided, all default profiles get
              installed.  Module streams get enabled accordingly.

              This command cannot be used for switching module streams.
              Use the <i>dnf module switch-to</i> command for that.

       <b>dnf [options] module update &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              Update packages associated with an active module stream,
              optionally restricted to a profile.  If the <i>profile_name</i>
              is provided, only the packages referenced by that profile
              will be updated.

       <b>dnf [options] module switch-to &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              Switch to or enable a module stream, change versions of
              installed packages to versions provided by the new stream,
              and remove packages from the old stream that are no longer
              available. It also updates installed profiles if they are
              available for the new stream. When a profile was provided,
              it installs that profile and does not update any already
              installed profiles.

              This command can be used as a stronger version of the <i>dnf</i>
              <i>module enable</i> command, which not only enables modules, but
              also does a <i>distrosync</i> to all modular packages in the
              enabled modules.

              It can also be used as a stronger version of the <i>dnf</i>
              <i>module install</i> command, but it requires to specify
              profiles that are supposed to be installed, because
              <i>switch-to</i> command does not use <i>default profiles</i>. The
              <i>switch-to</i> command doesn't only install profiles, it also
              makes a <i>distrosync</i> to all modular packages in the
              installed module.

       <b>dnf [options] module remove &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              Remove installed module profiles, including packages that
              were installed with the <i>dnf module install</i> command. Will
              not remove packages required by other installed module
              profiles or by other user-installed packages.  In case no
              profile was provided, all installed profiles get removed.

       <b>dnf [options] module remove --all &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              Remove installed module profiles, including packages that
              were installed with the <i>dnf module install</i> command.  With
              --all option it additionally removes all packages whose
              names are provided by specified modules. Packages required
              by other installed module profiles and packages whose
              names are also provided by any other module are not
              removed.

       <b>dnf [options] module enable &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              Enable a module stream and make the stream RPMs available
              in the package set.

              Modular dependencies are resolved, dependencies checked
              and also recursively enabled. In case of modular
              dependency issue the operation will be rejected. To
              perform the action anyway please use -<i>-skip-broken</i> option.

              This command cannot be used for switching module streams.
              Use the <i>dnf module switch-to</i> command for that.

       <b>dnf [options] module disable &lt;module-name&gt;...</b>
              Disable a module. All related module streams will become
              unavailable.  Consequently, all installed profiles will be
              removed and the module RPMs will become unavailable in the
              package set. In case of modular dependency issue the
              operation will be rejected. To perform the action anyway
              please use -<i>-skip-broken</i> option.

       <b>dnf [options] module reset &lt;module-name&gt;...</b>
              Reset module state so it's no longer enabled or disabled.
              Consequently, all installed profiles will be removed and
              only RPMs from the default stream will be available in the
              package set.

       <b>dnf [options] module provides &lt;package-name-spec&gt;...</b>
              Lists all modular packages matching <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b>
              from all modules (including disabled), along with the
              modules and streams they belong to.

       <b>dnf [options] module list [--all] [module_name...]</b>
              Lists all module streams, their profiles and states
              (enabled, disabled, default).

       <b>dnf [options] module list --enabled [module_name...]</b>
              Lists module streams that are enabled.

       <b>dnf [options] module list --disabled [module_name...]</b>
              Lists module streams that are disabled.

       <b>dnf [options] module list --installed [module_name...]</b>
              List module streams with installed profiles.

       <b>dnf [options] module info &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              Print detailed information about given module stream.

       <b>dnf [options] module info --profile &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              Print detailed information about given module profiles.

       <b>dnf [options] module repoquery &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              List all available packages belonging to selected modules.

       <b>dnf [options] module repoquery --available &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              List all available packages belonging to selected modules.

       <b>dnf [options] module repoquery --installed &lt;module-spec&gt;...</b>
              List all installed packages with same name like packages
              belonging to selected modules.

   <b>Provides Command</b>
       Command: <b>provides</b>
       Aliases: <b>prov</b>, <b>whatprovides</b>, <b>wp</b>

       <b>dnf [options] provides &lt;provide-spec&gt;</b>
              Finds the packages providing the given <b>&lt;provide-spec&gt;</b>.
              This is useful when one knows a filename and wants to find
              what package (installed or not) provides this file.  The
              <b>&lt;provide-spec&gt; </b>is gradually looked for at following
              locations:

              1. The <b>&lt;provide-spec&gt; </b>is matched with all file provides of
                 any available package:

                    $ dnf provides /usr/bin/gzip
                    gzip-1.9-9.fc29.x86_64 : The GNU data compression program
                    Matched from:
                    Filename    : /usr/bin/gzip

              2. Then all provides of all available packages are
                 searched:

                    $ dnf provides "gzip(x86-64)"
                    gzip-1.9-9.fc29.x86_64 : The GNU data compression program
                    Matched from:
                    Provide     : gzip(x86-64) = 1.9-9.fc29

              3. DNF assumes that the <b>&lt;provide-spec&gt; </b>is a system
                 command, prepends it with <b>/usr/bin/</b>, <b>/usr/sbin/</b>
                 prefixes (one at a time) and does the file provides
                 search again. For legacy reasons (packages that didn't
                 do UsrMove) also <b>/bin </b>and <b>/sbin </b>prefixes are being
                 searched:

                    $ dnf provides zless
                    gzip-1.9-9.fc29.x86_64 : The GNU data compression program
                    Matched from:
                    Filename    : /usr/bin/zless

              4. If this last step also fails, DNF returns "Error: No
                 Matches found".

              This command by default does not force a sync of expired
              metadata. See also <i>Metadata Synchronization</i>.

   <b>Reinstall Command</b>
       Command: <b>reinstall</b>
       Aliases: <b>rei</b>

       <b>dnf [options] reinstall &lt;package-spec&gt;...</b>
              Installs the specified packages, fails if some of the
              packages are either not installed or not available (i.e.
              there is no repository where to download the same RPM).

   <b>Remove Command</b>
       Command: <b>remove</b>
       Aliases: <b>rm</b>
       Aliases for <i>explicit NEVRA matching</i>: <b>remove-n</b>, <b>remove-na</b>, <b>remove-nevra</b>
       Deprecated aliases: <b>erase</b>, <b>erase-n</b>, <b>erase-na</b>, <b>erase-nevra</b>

       <b>dnf [options] remove &lt;package-spec&gt;...</b>
              Removes the specified packages from the system along with
              any packages depending on the packages being removed. Each
              <b>&lt;spec&gt; </b>can be either a <b>&lt;package-spec&gt;</b>, which specifies a
              package directly, or a <b>@&lt;group-spec&gt;</b>, which specifies an
              (environment) group which contains it. If
              <b>clean_requirements_on_remove </b>is enabled (the default),
              also removes any dependencies that are no longer needed.

       <b>dnf [options] remove --duplicates</b>
              Removes older versions of duplicate packages. To ensure
              the integrity of the system it reinstalls the newest
              package. In some cases the command cannot resolve
              conflicts. In such cases the <i>dnf shell</i> command with <b>remove</b>
              <b>--duplicates </b>and <b>upgrade </b>dnf-shell sub-commands could
              help.

       <b>dnf [options] remove --oldinstallonly</b>
              Removes old installonly packages, keeping only latest
              versions and version of running kernel.

              There are also a few specific remove commands <b>remove-n</b>,
              <b>remove-na </b>and <b>remove-nevra </b>that allow the specification of
              an exact argument in the NEVRA format. As a consequence,
              &lt;spec&gt; will be not matched with provides and file
              provides.

   <b>Remove Examples</b>
       <b>dnf remove acpi tito</b>
              Remove the <b>acpi </b>and <b>tito </b>packages.

       <b>dnf remove $(dnf repoquery --extras --exclude=tito,acpi)</b>
              Remove packages not present in any repository, but don't
              remove the <b>tito </b>and <b>acpi </b>packages (they still might be
              removed if they depend on some of the removed packages).

       Remove older versions of duplicated packages (an equivalent of
       yum's <i>package-cleanup --cleandups</i>):

          dnf remove --duplicates

   <b>Repoinfo Command</b>
       Command: <b>repoinfo</b>

          An alias for the <i>repolist</i> command that provides more detailed
          information like <b>dnf repolist -v</b>.

   <b>Repolist Command</b>
       Command: <b>repolist</b>

       <b>dnf [options] repolist [--enabled|--disabled|--all]</b>
              Depending on the exact command lists enabled, disabled or
              all known repositories. Lists all enabled repositories by
              default. Provides more detailed information when <b>-v </b>option
              is used.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired
       metadata. See also <i>Metadata Synchronization</i>.

   <b>Repoquery Command</b>
       Command: <b>repoquery</b>
       Aliases: <b>rq</b>
       Aliases for <i>explicit NEVRA matching</i>: <b>repoquery-n</b>, <b>repoquery-na</b>, <b>repoquery-nevra</b>

       <b>dnf [options] repoquery [&lt;select-options&gt;] [&lt;query-options&gt;]</b>
       <b>[&lt;package-file-spec&gt;]</b>
              Searches available DNF repositories for selected packages
              and displays the requested information about them. It is
              an equivalent of <b>rpm -q </b>for remote repositories.

       <b>dnf [options] repoquery --groupmember &lt;package-spec&gt;...</b>
              List groups that contain &lt;package-spec&gt;.

       <b>dnf [options] repoquery --querytags</b>
              Provides the list of tags recognized by the -<i>-queryformat</i>
              repoquery option.

              There are also a few specific repoquery commands
              <b>repoquery-n</b>, <b>repoquery-na </b>and <b>repoquery-nevra </b>that allow
              the specification of an exact argument in the NEVRA format
              (does not affect arguments of options like --whatprovides
              &lt;arg&gt;, ...).  As a consequence, &lt;spec&gt; will be not matched
              with file provides.

   <b>Select Options</b>
       Together with <b>&lt;package-file-spec&gt;</b>, control what packages are
       displayed in the output. If <b>&lt;package-file-spec&gt; </b>is given, limits
       the resulting set of packages to those matching the
       specification. All packages are considered if no
       <b>&lt;package-file-spec&gt; </b>is specified.

       <b>&lt;package-file-spec&gt;</b>
              Package specification in the NEVRA format
              (name[-[epoch:]version[-release]][.arch]) or a file
              provide. See <i>Specifying Packages</i>.

       <b>-a, --all</b>
              Query all packages (for rpmquery compatibility, also a
              shorthand for repoquery '*' or repoquery without
              arguments).

       <b>--arch &lt;arch&gt;[,&lt;arch&gt;...], --archlist &lt;arch&gt;[,&lt;arch&gt;...]</b>
              Limit the resulting set only to packages of selected
              architectures (default is all architectures). In some
              cases the result is affected by the basearch of the
              running system, therefore to run repoquery for an arch
              incompatible with your system use the <b>--forcearch=&lt;arch&gt;</b>
              option to change the basearch.

       <b>--duplicates</b>
              Limit the resulting set to installed duplicate packages
              (i.e. more package versions for the same name and
              architecture). Installonly packages are excluded from this
              set.

       <b>--unneeded</b>
              Limit the resulting set to leaves packages that were
              installed as dependencies so they are no longer needed.
              This switch lists packages that are going to be removed
              after executing the <b>dnf autoremove </b>command.

       <b>--available</b>
              Limit the resulting set to available packages only (set by
              default).

       <b>--disable-modular-filtering</b>
              Disables filtering of modular packages, so that packages
              of inactive module streams are included in the result.

       <b>--extras</b>
              Limit the resulting set to packages that are not present
              in any of the available repositories.

       <b>-f &lt;file&gt;, --file &lt;file&gt;</b>
              Limit the resulting set only to the package that owns
              <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>.

       <b>--installed</b>
              Limit the resulting set to installed packages only. The
              <i>exclude</i> option in the configuration file might influence
              the result, but if the command line option  -‐
              <i>-disableexcludes</i> is used, it ensures that all installed
              packages will be listed.

       <b>--installonly</b>
              Limit the resulting set to installed installonly packages.

       <b>--latest-limit &lt;number&gt;</b>
              Limit the resulting set to &lt;number&gt; of latest packages for
              every package name and architecture.  If &lt;number&gt; is
              negative, skip &lt;number&gt; of latest packages. For a negative
              &lt;number&gt; use the <b>--latest-limit=&lt;number&gt; </b>syntax.

       <b>--recent</b>
              Limit the resulting set to packages that were recently
              edited.

       <b>--repo &lt;repoid&gt;</b>
              Limit the resulting set only to packages from a repository
              identified by <b>&lt;repoid&gt;</b>.  Can be used multiple times with
              accumulative effect.

       <b>--unsatisfied</b>
              Report unsatisfied dependencies among installed packages
              (i.e. missing requires and existing conflicts).

       <b>--upgrades</b>
              Limit the resulting set to packages that provide an
              upgrade for some already installed package.

       <b>--userinstalled</b>
              Limit the resulting set to packages installed by the user.
              The <i>exclude</i> option in the configuration file might
              influence the result, but if the command line option  -‐
              <i>-disableexcludes</i> is used, it ensures that all installed
              packages will be listed.

       <b>--whatdepends &lt;capability&gt;[,&lt;capability&gt;...]</b>
              Limit the resulting set only to packages that require,
              enhance, recommend, suggest or supplement any of
              <b>&lt;capabilities&gt;</b>.

       <b>--whatconflicts &lt;capability&gt;[,&lt;capability&gt;...]</b>
              Limit the resulting set only to packages that conflict
              with any of <b>&lt;capabilities&gt;</b>.

       <b>--whatenhances &lt;capability&gt;[,&lt;capability&gt;...]</b>
              Limit the resulting set only to packages that enhance any
              of <b>&lt;capabilities&gt;</b>. Use -<i>-whatdepends</i> if you want to list
              all depending packages.

       <b>--whatobsoletes &lt;capability&gt;[,&lt;capability&gt;...]</b>
              Limit the resulting set only to packages that obsolete any

              list all depending packages.

       <b>--whatrequires &lt;capability&gt;[,&lt;capability&gt;...]</b>
              Limit the resulting set only to packages that require any
              of <b>&lt;capabilities&gt;</b>. Use -<i>-whatdepends</i> if you want to list
              all depending packages.

       <b>--whatsuggests &lt;capability&gt;[,&lt;capability&gt;...]</b>
              Limit the resulting set only to packages that suggest any

   <b>Repository-Packages Command</b>
       Command: <b>repository-packages</b>
       Deprecated aliases: <b>repo-pkgs</b>, <b>repo-packages</b>, <b>repository-pkgs</b>

       The repository-packages command allows the user to run commands
       on top of all packages in the repository named <b>&lt;repoid&gt;</b>. However,
       any dependency resolution takes into account packages from all
       enabled repositories. The <b>&lt;package-file-spec&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;package-spec&gt;</b>
       specifications further limit the candidates to only those
       packages matching at least one of them.

       The <b>info </b>subcommand lists description and summary information
       about packages depending on the packages' relation to the
       repository. The <b>list </b>subcommand just prints lists of those
       packages.

   <b>Search Command</b>
       Command: <b>search</b>
       Aliases: <b>se</b>

       <b>dnf [options] search [--all] &lt;keywords&gt;...</b>
              Search package metadata for keywords. Keywords are matched
              as case-insensitive substrings, globbing is supported.  By
              default lists packages that match all requested keys (AND
              operation). Keys are searched in package names and
              summaries.  If the <b>--all </b>option is used, lists packages
              that match at least one of the keys (an OR operation).  In
              addition the keys are searched in the package descriptions
              and URLs.  The result is sorted from the most relevant
              results to the least.

       This command by default does not force a sync of expired
       metadata. See also <i>Metadata Synchronization</i>.

   <b>Shell Command</b>
       Command: <b>shell</b>
       Aliases: <b>sh</b>

       <b>dnf [options] shell [filename]</b>
              Open an interactive shell for conducting multiple commands
              during a single execution of DNF. These commands can be
              issued manually or passed to DNF from a file. The commands
              are much the same as the normal DNF command line options.
              There are a few additional commands documented below.

              <b>config [conf-option] [value]</b>

                     • Set a configuration option to a requested value.
                       If no value is given it prints the current value.

              <b>repo [list|enable|disable] [repo-id]</b>

                     • list: list repositories and their status

                     • enable: enable repository

                     • disable: disable repository

              <b>transaction [list|reset|solve|run]</b>

                     • list: resolve and list the content of the
                       transaction

                     • reset: reset the transaction

                     • run: resolve and run the transaction

              Note that all local packages must be used in the first
              shell transaction subcommand (e.g.  <i>install</i>
              <i>/tmp/nodejs-1-1.x86_64.rpm /tmp/acpi-1-1.noarch.rpm</i>)
              otherwise an error will occur.  Any <i>disable</i>, <i>enable</i>, and
              <i>reset</i> module operations (e.g. <i>module enable nodejs</i>) must
              also be performed before any other shell transaction
              subcommand is used.

   <b>Swap Command</b>
       Command: <b>swap</b>

       <b>dnf [options] swap &lt;remove-spec&gt; &lt;install-spec&gt;</b>
          Remove spec and install spec in one transaction. Each <b>&lt;spec&gt;</b>
          can be either a <i>&lt;package-spec&gt;</i>, which specifies a package
          directly, or a <b>@&lt;group-spec&gt;</b>, which specifies an (environment)
          group which contains it. Automatic conflict solving is
          provided in DNF by the --allowerasing option that provides the
          functionality of the swap command automatically.

   <b>Updateinfo Command</b>
       Command: <b>updateinfo</b>
       Aliases: <b>upif</b>
       Deprecated aliases: <b>list-updateinfo</b>, <b>list-security</b>, <b>list-sec</b>, <b>info-updateinfo</b>, <b>info-security</b>, <b>info-sec</b>, <b>summary-updateinfo</b>

       <b>dnf [options] updateinfo [--summary|--list|--info]</b>
       <b>[&lt;availability&gt;] [&lt;spec&gt;...]</b>
              Display information about update advisories.

              Depending on the output type, DNF displays just counts of
              advisory types (omitted or <b>--summary</b>), list of advisories
              (<b>--list</b>) or detailed information (<b>--info</b>). The <b>-v </b>option
              extends the output. When used with <b>--info</b>, the information
              is even more detailed. When used with <b>--list</b>, an
              additional column with date of the last advisory update is
              added.

              <b>&lt;availability&gt; </b>specifies whether advisories about newer
              versions of installed packages (omitted or <b>--available</b>),
              advisories about equal and older versions of installed
              packages (<b>--installed</b>), advisories about newer versions of
              those installed packages for which a newer version is
              available (<b>--updates</b>) or advisories about any versions of
              installed packages (<b>--all</b>) are taken into account. Most of
              the time, <b>--available </b>and <b>--updates </b>displays the same
              output. The outputs differ only in the cases when an
              advisory refers to a newer version but there is no enabled
              repository which contains any newer version.

              Note, that <b>--available </b>takes only the latest installed
              versions of packages into account. In case of the kernel
              packages (when multiple version could be installed
              simultaneously) also packages of the currently running
              version of kernel are added.

              To print only advisories referencing a CVE or a bugzilla
              use <b>--with-cve </b>or <b>--with-bz </b>options. When these switches
              are used also the output of the <b>--list </b>is altered - the ID
              of the CVE or the bugzilla is printed instead of the one
              of the advisory.

              If given and if neither ID, type (<b>bugfix</b>, <b>enhancement</b>,
              <b>security</b>/<b>sec</b>) nor a package name of an advisory matches
              <b>&lt;spec&gt;</b>, the advisory is not taken into account. The
              matching is case-sensitive and in the case of advisory IDs
              and package names, globbing is supported.

              Output of the <b>--summary </b>option is affected by the
              <i>autocheck_running_kernel</i> configuration option.

   <b>Upgrade Command</b>
       Command: <b>upgrade</b>
       Aliases: <b>up</b>
       Deprecated aliases: <b>update</b>, <b>upgrade-to</b>, <b>update-to</b>, <b>localupdate</b>

       <b>dnf [options] upgrade</b>

              security issue (security). Updates dependencies as
              necessary.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING PACKAGES </h2>
<pre>
       Many commands take a <b>&lt;package-spec&gt; </b>parameter that selects a
       package for the operation. The <b>&lt;package-spec&gt; </b>argument is matched
       against package NEVRAs, provides and file provides.

       <b>&lt;package-file-spec&gt; </b>is similar to <b>&lt;package-spec&gt;</b>, except provides
       matching is not performed. Therefore, <b>&lt;package-file-spec&gt; </b>is
       matched only against NEVRAs and file provides.

       <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt; </b>is matched against NEVRAs only.

   <b>Globs</b>
       Package specification supports the same glob pattern matching
       that shell does, in all three above mentioned packages it matches
       against (NEVRAs, provides and file provides).

       The following patterns are supported:

       <b>*      </b>Matches any number of characters.

       <b>?      </b>Matches any single character.

       <b>[]     </b>Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of
              characters separated by a hyphen denotes a range
              expression; any character that falls between those two
              characters, inclusive, is matched. If the first character
              following the <b>[ </b>is a <b>! </b>or a <b>^ </b>then any character not
              enclosed is matched.

       Note: Curly brackets (<b>{}</b>) are not supported. You can still use
       them in shells that support them and let the shell do the
       expansion, but if quoted or escaped, dnf will not expand them.

   <b>NEVRA Matching</b>
       When matching against NEVRAs, partial matching is supported. DNF
       tries to match the spec against the following list of NEVRA forms
       (in decreasing order of priority):

       • <b>name-[epoch:]version-release.arch</b>

       • <b>name.arch</b>

       • <b>name</b>

       • <b>name-[epoch:]version-release</b>

       • <b>name-[epoch:]version</b>

       Note that <b>name </b>can in general contain dashes (e.g.
       <b>package-with-dashes</b>).

       The first form that matches any packages is used and the
       remaining forms are not tried. If none of the forms match any
       packages, an attempt is made to match the <b>&lt;package-spec&gt; </b>against
       full package NEVRAs. This is only relevant if globs are present
       in the <b>&lt;package-spec&gt;</b>.

       <b>&lt;package-spec&gt; </b>matches NEVRAs the same way <b>&lt;package-name-spec&gt;</b>
       does, but in case matching NEVRAs fails, it attempts to match
       against provides and file provides of packages as well.

       You can specify globs as part of any of the five NEVRA
       components. You can also specify a glob pattern to match over
       multiple NEVRA components (in other words, to match across the
       NEVRA separators). In that case, however, you need to write the
       spec to match against full package NEVRAs, as it is not possible
       to split such spec into NEVRA forms.

   <b>Specifying NEVRA Matching Explicitly</b>
       Some commands (<b>autoremove</b>, <b>install</b>, <b>remove </b>and <b>repoquery</b>) also
       have aliases with suffixes <b>-n</b>, <b>-na </b>and <b>-nevra </b>that allow to
       explicitly specify how to parse the arguments:

       • Command <b>install-n </b>only matches against <b>name</b>.

       • Command <b>install-na </b>only matches against <b>name.arch</b>.

       • Command <b>install-nevra </b>only matches against
         <b>name-[epoch:]version-release.arch</b>.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING PROVIDES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>&lt;provide-spec&gt; </b>in command descriptions means the command operates
       on packages providing the given spec. This can either be an
       explicit provide, an implicit provide (i.e. name of the package)
       or a file provide. The selection is case-sensitive and globbing
       is supported.

   <b>Specifying File Provides</b>
       If a spec starts with either <b>/ </b>or <b>*/</b>, it is considered as a
       potential file provide.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING GROUPS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>&lt;group-spec&gt; </b>allows one to select (environment) groups a
       particular operation should work on. It is a case insensitive
       string (supporting globbing characters) that is matched against a
       group's ID, canonical name and name translated into the current
       LC_MESSAGES locale (if possible).
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING MODULES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>&lt;module-spec&gt; </b>allows one to select modules or profiles a
       particular operation should work on.

       It is in the form of <b>NAME:STREAM:VERSION:CONTEXT:ARCH/PROFILE </b>and
       supported partial forms are the following:

       • <b>NAME</b>

       • <b>NAME:STREAM</b>

       • <b>NAME:STREAM:VERSION</b>

       • <b>NAME:STREAM:VERSION:CONTEXT</b>

       • all above combinations with <b>::ARCH </b>(e.g. <b>NAME::ARCH</b>)

       • <b>NAME:STREAM:VERSION:CONTEXT:ARCH</b>

       • all above combinations with <b>/PROFILE </b>(e.g. <b>NAME/PROFILE</b>)

       In case stream is not specified, the enabled or the default
       stream is used, in this order. In case profile is not specified,
       the system default profile or the 'default' profile is used.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING TRANSACTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>&lt;transaction-spec&gt; </b>can be in one of several forms. If it is an
       integer, it specifies a transaction ID. Specifying <b>last </b>is the
       same as specifying the ID of the most recent transaction. The
       last form is <b>last-&lt;offset&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;offset&gt; </b>is a positive integer.
       It specifies offset-th transaction preceding the most recent
       transaction.
</pre> <h2>
PACKAGE FILTERING </h2>
<pre>
       Package filtering filters packages out from the available package
       set, making them invisible to most of dnf commands. They cannot
       be used in a transaction. Packages can be filtered out by either
       Exclude Filtering or Modular Filtering.

   <b>Exclude Filtering</b>
       Exclude Filtering is a mechanism used by a user or by a DNF
       plugin to modify the set of available packages. Exclude Filtering
       can be modified by either <i>includepkgs</i> or <i>excludepkgs</i>
       configuration options in <i>configuration files</i>. The -‐
       <i>-disableexcludes</i> command line option can be used to override
       excludes from configuration files. In addition to user-configured
       excludes, plugins can also extend the set of excluded packages.
       To disable excludes from a DNF plugin you can use the -‐
       <i>-disableplugin</i> command line option.

       To disable all excludes for e.g. the install command you can use
       the following combination of command line options:

       <b>dnf --disableexcludes=all --disableplugin="*" install bash</b>

   <b>Modular Filtering</b>
       Please see <i>the modularity documentation</i> for details on how
       Modular Filtering works.

       With modularity, only RPM packages from <b>active </b>module streams are
       included in the available package set. RPM packages from <b>inactive</b>
       module streams, as well as non-modular packages with the same
       name or provides as a package from an <b>active </b>module stream, are
       filtered out. Modular filtering is not applied to packages added
       from the command line, installed packages, or packages from
       repositories with <b>module_hotfixes=true </b>in their <b>.repo </b>file.

       Disabling of modular filtering is not recommended, because it
       could cause the system to get into a broken state. To disable
       modular filtering for a particular repository, specify
       <b>module_hotfixes=true </b>in the <b>.repo </b>file or use
       <b>--setopt=&lt;repo_id&gt;.module_hotfixes=true</b>.

       To discover the module which contains an excluded package use <i>dnf</i>
       <i>module provides</i>.
</pre> <h2>
METADATA SYNCHRONIZATION </h2>
<pre>
       Correct operation of DNF depends on having access to up-to-date
       data from all enabled repositories but contacting remote mirrors
       on every operation considerably slows it down and costs bandwidth
       for both the client and the repository provider. The
       <i>metadata_expire</i> (see <b>dnf.conf</b>(5)) repository configuration option
       is used by DNF to determine whether a particular local copy of
       repository data is due to be re-synced. It is crucial that the
       repository providers set the option well, namely to a value where
       it is guaranteed that if particular metadata was available in
       time <b>T </b>on the server, then all packages it references will still
       be available for download from the server in time <b>T +</b>
       <b>metadata_expire</b>.

       To further reduce the bandwidth load, some of the commands where
       having up-to-date metadata is not critical (e.g. the <b>list</b>
       command) do not look at whether a repository is expired and
       whenever any version of it is locally available to the user's
       account, it will be used. For non-root use, see also the
       <b>--cacheonly </b>switch. Note that in all situations the user can
       force synchronization of all enabled repositories with the
       <b>--refresh </b>switch.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILES REPLACEMENT POLICY </h2>
<pre>
       The updated packages could replace the old modified configuration
       files with the new ones or keep the older files. Neither of the
       files are actually replaced.  To the conflicting ones RPM gives
       additional suffix to the origin name. Which file should maintain
       the true name after transaction is not controlled by package
       manager but is specified by each package itself, following
       packaging guideline.
</pre> <h2>
