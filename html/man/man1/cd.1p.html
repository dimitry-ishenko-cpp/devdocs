SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       cd <b>[</b>-L|-P<b>] [</b><i>directory</i><b>]</b>

       cd -
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cd</i> utility shall change the working directory of the current
       shell execution environment (see <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution</i>
       <i>Environment</i>) by executing the following steps in sequence. (In
       the following steps, the symbol <b>curpath </b>represents an
       intermediate value used to simplify the description of the
       algorithm used by <i>cd</i>.  There is no requirement that <b>curpath </b>be
       made visible to the application.)

        1. If no <i>directory</i> operand is given and the <i>HOME</i> environment
           variable is empty or undefined, the default behavior is
           implementation-defined and no further steps shall be taken.

        2. If no <i>directory</i> operand is given and the <i>HOME</i> environment
           variable is set to a non-empty value, the <i>cd</i> utility shall
           behave as if the directory named in the <i>HOME</i> environment
           variable was specified as the <i>directory</i> operand.

        3. If the <i>directory</i> operand begins with a &lt;slash&gt; character, set
           <b>curpath </b>to the operand and proceed to step 7.

        4. If the first component of the <i>directory</i> operand is dot or
           dot-dot, proceed to step 6.

        5. Starting with the first pathname in the &lt;colon&gt;-separated
           pathnames of <i>CDPATH</i> (see the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section)
           if the pathname is non-null, test if the concatenation of
           that pathname, a &lt;slash&gt; character if that pathname did not
           end with a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the <i>directory</i> operand names
           a directory. If the pathname is null, test if the
           concatenation of dot, a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the operand
           names a directory. In either case, if the resulting string
           names an existing directory, set <b>curpath </b>to that string and
           proceed to step 7. Otherwise, repeat this step with the next
           pathname in <i>CDPATH</i> until all pathnames have been tested.

        6. Set <b>curpath </b>to the <i>directory</i> operand.

        7. If the <b>-P </b>option is in effect, proceed to step 10. If <b>curpath</b>
           does not begin with a &lt;slash&gt; character, set <b>curpath </b>to the
           string formed by the concatenation of the value of <i>PWD</i>, a
           &lt;slash&gt; character if the value of <i>PWD</i> did not end with a
           &lt;slash&gt; character, and <b>curpath</b>.

        8. The <b>curpath </b>value shall then be converted to canonical form
           as follows, considering each component from beginning to end,
           in sequence:

            a. Dot components and any &lt;slash&gt; characters that separate
               them from the next component shall be deleted.

            b. For each dot-dot component, if there is a preceding
               component and it is neither root nor dot-dot, then:

                i.  If the preceding component does not refer (in the
                    context of pathname resolution with symbolic links
                    followed) to a directory, then the <i>cd</i> utility shall
                    display an appropriate error message and no further
                    steps shall be taken.

               ii.  The preceding component, all &lt;slash&gt; characters
                    separating the preceding component from dot-dot,
                    dot-dot, and all &lt;slash&gt; characters separating dot-
                    dot from the following component (if any) shall be
                    deleted.

            c. An implementation may further simplify <b>curpath </b>by
               removing any trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters that are not
               also leading &lt;slash&gt; characters, replacing multiple non-
               leading consecutive &lt;slash&gt; characters with a single
               &lt;slash&gt;, and replacing three or more leading &lt;slash&gt;
               characters with a single &lt;slash&gt;.  If, as a result of
               this canonicalization, the <b>curpath </b>variable is null, no
               further steps shall be taken.

        9. If <b>curpath </b>is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (including the
           terminating null) and the <i>directory</i> operand was not longer
           than {PATH_MAX} bytes (including the terminating null), then
           <b>curpath </b>shall be converted from an absolute pathname to an
           equivalent relative pathname if possible. This conversion
           shall always be considered possible if the value of <i>PWD</i>, with
           a trailing &lt;slash&gt; added if it does not already have one, is
           an initial substring of <b>curpath</b>.  Whether or not it is
           considered possible under other circumstances is unspecified.
           Implementations may also apply this conversion if <b>curpath </b>is
           not longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes or the <i>directory</i> operand was
           longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes.

       10. The <i>cd</i> utility shall then perform actions equivalent to the
           <i>chdir</i>() function called with <b>curpath </b>as the <i>path</i> argument. If
           these actions fail for any reason, the <i>cd</i> utility shall
           display an appropriate error message and the remainder of
           this step shall not be executed. If the <b>-P </b>option is not in
           effect, the <i>PWD</i> environment variable shall be set to the
           value that <b>curpath </b>had on entry to step 9 (i.e., before
           conversion to a relative pathname). If the <b>-P </b>option is in
           effect, the <i>PWD</i> environment variable shall be set to the
           string that would be output by <i>pwd</i> <b>-P</b>.  If there is
           insufficient permission on the new directory, or on any
           parent of that directory, to determine the current working
           directory, the value of the <i>PWD</i> environment variable is
           unspecified.

       If, during the execution of the above steps, the <i>PWD</i> environment
       variable is set, the <i>OLDPWD</i> environment variable shall also be
       set to the value of the old working directory (that is the
       current working directory immediately prior to the call to <i>cd</i>).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cd</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-L        </b>Handle the operand dot-dot logically; symbolic link
                 components shall not be resolved before dot-dot
                 components are processed (see steps 8.  and 9. in the
                 DESCRIPTION).

       <b>-P        </b>Handle the operand dot-dot physically; symbolic link
                 components shall be resolved before dot-dot components
                 are processed (see step 7. in the DESCRIPTION).

       If both <b>-L </b>and <b>-P </b>options are specified, the last of these
       options shall be used and all others ignored. If neither <b>-L </b>nor
       <b>-P </b>is specified, the operand shall be handled dot-dot logically;
       see the DESCRIPTION.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>directory</i> An absolute or relative pathname of the directory that
                 shall become the new working directory. The
                 interpretation of a relative pathname by <i>cd</i> depends on
                 the <b>-L </b>option and the <i>CDPATH</i> and <i>PWD</i> environment
                 variables. If <i>directory</i> is an empty string, the results
                 are unspecified.

       -         When a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; is used as the operand, this
                 shall be equivalent to the command:

                     cd "$OLDPWD" &amp;&amp; pwd

                 which changes to the previous working directory and
                 then writes its name.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>cd</i>:

       <i>CDPATH</i>    A &lt;colon&gt;-separated list of pathnames that refer to
                 directories. The <i>cd</i> utility shall use this list in its
                 attempt to change the directory, as described in the
                 DESCRIPTION. An empty string in place of a directory
                 pathname represents the current directory. If <i>CDPATH</i> is
                 not set, it shall be treated as if it were an empty
                 string.

       <i>HOME</i>      The name of the directory, used when no <i>directory</i>
                 operand is specified.

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>OLDPWD</i>    A pathname of the previous working directory, used by
                 <i>cd</i> <b>-</b>.

       <i>PWD</i>       This variable shall be set as specified in the
                 DESCRIPTION. If an application sets or unsets the value
                 of <i>PWD</i>, the behavior of <i>cd</i> is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If a non-empty directory name from <i>CDPATH</i> is used, or if <i>cd</i> <b>- </b>is
       used, an absolute pathname of the new working directory shall be
       written to the standard output as follows:

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>new directory</i>&gt;

       Otherwise, there shall be no output.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The directory was successfully changed.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The working directory shall remain unchanged.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Since <i>cd</i> affects the current shell execution environment, it is
       always provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a
       subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as one
       of the following:

           (cd /tmp)
           nohup cd
           find . -exec cd {} \;

       it does not affect the working directory of the caller's
       environment.

       The user must have execute (search) permission in <i>directory</i> in
       order to change to it.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following template can be used to perform processing in the
       directory specified by <i>location</i> and end up in the current working
       directory in use before the first <i>cd</i> command was issued:

           cd <i>location</i>
           if [ $? -ne 0 ]
           then
               print error message
               exit 1
           fi
           ... do whatever is desired as long as the OLDPWD environment variable
               is not modified
           cd -
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The use of the <i>CDPATH</i> was introduced in the System V shell. Its
       use is analogous to the use of the <i>PATH</i> variable in the shell.
       The BSD C shell used a shell parameter <i>cdpath</i> for this purpose.

       A common extension when <i>HOME</i> is undefined is to get the login
       directory from the user database for the invoking user. This does
       not occur on System V implementations.

       Some historical shells, such as the KornShell, took special
       actions when the directory name contained a dot-dot component,
       selecting the logical parent of the directory, rather than the
       actual parent directory; that is, it moved up one level toward
       the <b>'/' </b>in the pathname, remembering what the user typed, rather
       than performing the equivalent of:

           chdir("..");

       In such a shell, the following commands would not necessarily
       produce equivalent output for all directories:

           cd .. &amp;&amp; ls      ls ..

       This behavior is now the default. It is not consistent with the
       definition of dot-dot in most historical practice; that is, while
       this behavior has been optionally available in the KornShell,
       other shells have historically not supported this functionality.
       The logical pathname is stored in the <i>PWD</i> environment variable
       when the <i>cd</i> utility completes and this value is used to construct
       the next directory name if <i>cd</i> is invoked with the <b>-L </b>option.
