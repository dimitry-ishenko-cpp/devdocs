       <b>chacl -r pathname...</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>chacl</i> is an IRIX-compatibility command, and is maintained for
       those users who are familiar with its use from either XFS or
       IRIX.  Refer to the <b>SEE ALSO </b>section below for a description of
       tools which conform more closely to the (withdrawn draft) POSIX
       1003.1e standard which describes Access Control Lists (ACLs).

       <i>chacl</i> changes the ACL(s) for a file or directory.  The ACL(s)
       specified are applied to each file in the <i><b>pathname</b> </i>arguments.

       Each ACL is a string which is interpreted using the
       <a href="../man3/acl_from_text.3.html">acl_from_text(3)</a> routine.  These strings are made up of comma
       separated clauses each of which is of the form, tag:name:perm.
       Where <i><b>tag</b> </i>can be:

       "user" (or "u")
              indicating that the entry is a "user" ACL entry.

       "group" (or "g")
              indicating that the entry is a "group" ACL entry.

       "other" (or "o")
              indicating that the entry is an "other" ACL entry.

       "mask" (or "m")
              indicating that the entry is a "mask" ACL entry.

       <i><b>name</b> </i>is a string which is the user or group name for the ACL
       entry.  A null <i><b>name</b> </i>in a user or group ACL entry indicates the
       file's owner or file's group.  <i><b>perm</b> </i>is the string "rwx" where
       each of the entries may be replaced by a "-" indicating no access
       of that type, e.g. "r-x", "--x", "---".
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-b     </b>Indicates that there are two ACLs to change, the first is
              the file access ACL and the second the directory default
              ACL.

       <b>-d     </b>Used to set only the default ACL of a directory.

       <b>-R     </b>Removes the file access ACL only.

       <b>-D     </b>Removes directory default ACL only.

       <b>-B     </b>Remove all ACLs.

       <b>-l     </b>Lists the access ACL and possibly the default ACL
              associated with the specified files or directories.  This
              option was added during the Linux port of XFS, and is not
              IRIX compatible.

       <b>-r     </b>Set the access ACL recursively for each subtree rooted at
              <i><b>pathname</b></i>(s).  This option was also added during the Linux
              port of XFS, and is not compatible with IRIX.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       A minimum ACL:

         <b>chacl u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r-- file</b>

       The file ACL is set so that the file's owner has "rwx", the
       file's group has read and execute, and others have read only
       access to the file.

       An ACL that is not a minimum ACL, that is, one that specifies a
       user or group other than the file's owner or owner's group, must
       contain a mask entry:

         <b>chacl u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r--,u:bob:r--,m::r-x file1 file2</b>

       To set the default and access ACLs on <i><b>newdir</b> </i>to be the same as on
       <i><b>olddir</b></i>, you could type:

         <b>chacl -b `chacl -l olddir | \</b>
             <b>sed -e 's/.*\[//' -e 's#/# #' -e 's/]$//'` newdir</b>
</pre> <h2>
CAUTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>chacl</i> can replace the existing ACL.  To add or delete entries,
       you must first do <i><b>chacl -l</b> </i>to get the existing ACL, and use the
       output to form the arguments to <i>chacl</i>.

       Changing the permission bits of a file will change the file
       access ACL settings (see <a href="chmod.1.html">chmod(1)</a>).  However, file creation mode
       masks (see <b>umask</b>(1)) will not affect the access ACL settings of
       files created using directory default ACLs.

       ACLs are filesystem extended attributes and hence are not
       typically archived or restored using the conventional archiving
       utilities.  See <b>attr</b>(5) for more information about extended
       attributes and see <a href="../man8/xfsdump.8.html">xfsdump(8)</a> for a method of backing them up
       under XFS.
