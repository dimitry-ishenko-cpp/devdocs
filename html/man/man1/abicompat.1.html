NAME </h2>
<pre>
       abicompat - check ABI compatibility

       abicompat checks that an application that links against a given
       shared library is still ABI compatible with a subsequent version
       of that library.  If the new version of the library introduces an
       ABI incompatibility, then abicompat hints the user at what
       exactly that incompatibility is.
</pre> <h2>
INVOCATION </h2>
<pre>
          abicompat [options] [&lt;application&gt; &lt;shared-library-first-version&gt; &lt;shared-library-second-version&gt;]
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
          • <b>--help</b>

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          • <i>--version | -v</i>

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          • <b>--list-undefined-symbols | -u</b>

            Display the list of undefined symbols of the application and
            exit.

          • <b>--show-base-names | -b</b>

            In the resulting report emitted by the tool, this option
            makes the application and libraries be referred to by their
            base names only; not by a full absolute name.  This can be
            useful for use in scripts that wants to compare names of the
            application and libraries independently of what their
            directory names are.

          • <b>--app-debug-info-dir | --appd</b>
            &lt;path-to-app-debug-info-directory&gt;

            Set the path to the directory under which the debug
            information of the application is supposed to be laid out.
            This is useful for application binaries for which the debug
            info is in a separate set of files.

          • <b>--lib-debug-info-dir1 | --libd1 </b>&lt;path-to-lib1-debug-info&gt;

            Set the path to the directory under which the debug
            information of the first version of the shared library is
            supposed to be laid out.  This is useful for shared library
            binaries for which the debug info is in a separate set of
            files.

          • <b>--lib-debug-info-dir2 | --libd2 </b>&lt;path-to-lib1-debug-info&gt;

            Set the path to the directory under which the debug
            information of the second version of the shared library is
            supposed to be laid out.  This is useful for shared library
            binaries for which the debug info is in a separate set of
            files.

          • <b>--suppressions | --suppr </b>&lt;<i>path-to-suppressions</i>&gt;

            Use a <i>suppression specification</i> file located at
            <i>path-to-suppressions</i>.  Note that this option can appear
            multiple times on the command line; all the suppression
            specification files are then taken into account.

          • <b>--no-show-locs</b>
              Do not show information about where in the <i>second shared</i>
              <i>library</i> the respective type was changed.

          • <b>--btf</b>

            When comparing binaries, extract ABI information from BTF
            debug information, if present.

          • <b>--ctf</b>

            When comparing binaries, extract ABI information from CTF
            debug information, if present.

          • <b>--fail-no-debug-info</b>

            If no debug info was found, then this option makes the
            program to fail.  Otherwise, without this option, the
            program will attempt to compare properties of the binaries
            that are not related to debug info, like pure ELF
            properties.

          • <b>--ignore-soname</b>

            Ignore differences in the SONAME when doing a comparison

          • <b>--weak-mode</b>

            This triggers the weak mode of <b>abicompat</b>.  In this mode,
            only one version of the library is required.  That is,
            abicompat is invoked like this:

                abicompat --weak-mode &lt;the-application&gt; &lt;the-library&gt;

            Note that the <b>--weak-mode </b>option can even be omitted if only
            one version of the library is given, along with the
            application; in that case, <b>abicompat </b>automatically switches
            to operate in weak mode:

                abicompat &lt;the-application&gt; &lt;the-library&gt;

            In this weak mode, the types of functions and variables
            exported by the library and consumed by the application (as
            in, the symbols of the these functions and variables are
            undefined in the application and are defined and exported by
            the library) are compared to the version of these types as
            expected by the application.  And if these two versions of
            types are different, <b>abicompat </b>tells the user what the
            differences are.

            In other words, in this mode, <b>abicompat </b>checks that the
            types of the functions and variables exported by the library
            mean the same thing as what the application expects, as far
            as the ABI is concerned.

            Note that in this mode, <i>abicompat</i> doesn't detect exported
            functions or variables (symbols) that are expected by the
            application but that are removed from the library.  That is
            why it is called <b>weak </b>mode.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUES </h2>
<pre>
       The exit code of the <b>abicompat </b>command is either 0 if the ABI of
       the binaries being compared are equal, or non-zero if they differ
       or if the tool encountered an error.

       In the later case, the exit code is a 8-bits-wide bit field in
       which each bit has a specific meaning.

       The first bit, of value 1, named <b>ABIDIFF_ERROR </b>means there was an
       error.

       The second bit, of value 2, named <b>ABIDIFF_USAGE_ERROR </b>means there
       was an error in the way the user invoked the tool.  It might be
       set, for instance, if the user invoked the tool with an unknown
       command line switch, with a wrong number or argument, etc.  If
       this bit is set, then the <b>ABIDIFF_ERROR </b>bit must be set as well.

       The third bit, of value 4, named <b>ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE </b>means the ABI
       of the binaries being compared are different.

       The fourth bit, of value 8, named <b>ABIDIFF_ABI_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE</b>
       means the ABI of the binaries compared are different in an
       incompatible way.  If this bit is set, then the
       <b>ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE </b>bit must be set as well.  If the
       <b>ABIDIFF_ABI_CHANGE </b>is set and the <b>ABIDIFF_INCOMPATIBLE_CHANGE </b>is
       <i>NOT</i> set, then it means that the ABIs being compared might or
       might not be compatible.  In that case, a human being needs to
       review the ABI changes to decide if they are compatible or not.

       The remaining bits are not used for the moment.

            • Compile the first and second versions of the libraries:
              <b>libtest-0.so </b>and <b>libtest-1.so</b>:

                  $ g++ -g -Wall -shared -o libtest-0.so test0.cc
                  $ g++ -g -Wall -shared -o libtest-1.so test1.cc

            • Compile the application and link it against the first
              version of the library, creating the <b>test-app </b>binary:

                  $ g++ -g -Wall -o test-app -L. -ltest-0.so test-app.cc

            • Now, use <b>abicompat </b>to see if libtest-1.so is ABI
              compatible with app, with respect to the ABI of
              libtest-0.so:

                  $ abicompat test-app libtest-0.so libtest-1.so
                  ELF file 'test-app' might not be ABI compatible with 'libtest-1.so' due to differences with 'libtest-0.so' below:
                  Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 2 Changed, 0 Added functions
                  Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable

                  2 functions with some indirect sub-type change:

                    [C]'function foo* first_func()' has some indirect sub-type changes:
                      return type changed:
                        in pointed to type 'struct foo':
                          size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                          1 data member insertion:
                            'char foo::m1', at offset 32 (in bits)
                    [C]'function void second_func(foo&amp;)' has some indirect sub-type changes:
                      parameter 0 of type 'foo&amp;' has sub-type changes:
                        referenced type 'struct foo' changed, as reported earlier

                  $

            • Now use the weak mode of abicompat, that is, providing
              just the application and the new version of the library:

                  $ abicompat --weak-mode test-app libtest-1.so
                  functions defined in library
                      'libtest-1.so'
                  have sub-types that are different from what application
                      'test-app'
                  expects:

                    function foo* first_func():
                      return type changed:
                        in pointed to type 'struct foo':
                          size changed from 32 to 64 bits
                          1 data member insertion:
                            'char foo::m1', at offset 32 (in bits)
