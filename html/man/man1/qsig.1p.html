PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       qsig — signal batch jobs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       qsig <b>[</b>-s <i>signal</i><b>] </b><i>job_identifier</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       To signal a batch job is to send a signal to the session leader
       of the batch job. A batch job is signaled by sending a request to
       the batch server that manages the batch job. The <i>qsig</i> utility is
       a user-accessible batch client that requests the signaling of a
       batch job.

       The <i>qsig</i> utility shall signal those batch jobs for which a batch
       <i>job_identifier</i> is presented to the utility. The <i>qsig</i> utility
       shall not signal any batch jobs whose batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are
       not presented to the utility.

       The <i>qsig</i> utility shall signal batch jobs in the order in which
       the corresponding batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the
       utility. If the <i>qsig</i> utility fails to process a batch
       <i>job_identifier</i> successfully, the utility shall proceed to process
       the remaining batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qsig</i> utility shall signal batch jobs by sending a <i>Signal Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> to the batch server that manages the batch job.

       For each successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i>, the <i>qsig</i>
       utility shall have received a completion reply to each <i>Signal Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> sent to a batch server at the time the utility exits.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qsig</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-s </b><i>signal</i> Define the signal to be sent to the batch job.

                 The <i>qsig</i> utility shall accept a <i>signal</i> option-argument
                 that is either a symbolic signal name or an unsigned
                 integer signal number (see the POSIX.1‐1990 standard,
                 Section 3.3.1.1). The <i>qsig</i> utility shall accept signal
                 names for which the SIG prefix has been omitted.

                 If the <i>signal</i> option-argument is a signal name, the
                 <i>qsig</i> utility shall send that name.

                 If the <i>signal</i> option-argument is a number, the <i>qsig</i>
                 utility shall send the signal value represented by the
                 number.

                 If the <b>-s </b>option is not presented to the <i>qsig</i> utility,
                 the utility shall send the signal SIGTERM to each
                 signaled batch job.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qsig</i> utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
       to the syntax for a batch <i>job_identifier</i> (see <i>Section 3.3.1</i>,
       <i>Batch Job Identifier</i>).
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>qsig</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LOGNAME</i>   Determine the login name of the user.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       An implementation of the <i>qsig</i> utility may write informative
       messages to standard output.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <i>qsig</i> utility shall not
       be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
       the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
       batch <i>job_identifier</i> does not exist on the server. Whether or not
       the <i>qsig</i> utility waits to output the diagnostic message while
       attempting to locate the batch job on other servers is
       implementation-defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qsig</i> utility allows users to signal batch jobs.

       A user may be unable to signal a batch job with the <i>kill</i> utility
       of the operating system for a number of reasons. First, the
       process ID of the batch job may be unknown to the user. Second,
       the processes of the batch job may be on a remote node. However,
       by virtue of communication between batch nodes, the <i>qsig</i> utility
       can arrange for the signaling of a process.

       Because a batch job that is not running cannot be signaled, and
       because the signal may not terminate the batch job, the <i>qsig</i>
       utility is not a substitute for the <i>qdel</i> utility.

       The options of the <i>qsig</i> utility allow the user to specify the
       signal that is to be sent to the batch job.

       The <b>-s </b>option allows users to specify a signal by name or by
       number, and thus override the default signal. The POSIX.1‐1990
       standard defines signals by both name and number.

       The <i>qsig</i> utility is a new utility, <i>vis-a-vis</i> existing practice;
       it has been defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 in response to
       user-perceived shortcomings in existing practice.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qsig</i> utility may be removed in a future version.
