NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-quiltimport - Applies a quilt patchset onto the current
       branch
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git quiltimport</i> [--dry-run | -n] [--author &lt;author&gt;] [--patches &lt;dir&gt;]
                       [--series &lt;file&gt;] [--keep-non-patch]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Applies a quilt patchset onto the current Git branch, preserving
       the patch boundaries, patch order, and patch descriptions present
       in the quilt patchset.

       For each patch the code attempts to extract the author from the
       patch description. If that fails it falls back to the author
       specified with --author. If the --author flag was not given the
       patch description is displayed and the user is asked to
       interactively enter the author of the patch.

       If a subject is not found in the patch description the patch name
       is preserved as the 1 line subject in the Git description.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -n, --dry-run
           Walk through the patches in the series and warn if we cannot
           find all of the necessary information to commit a patch. At
           the time of this writing only missing author information is
           warned about.

       --author <i>Author Name &lt;Author Email&gt;</i>
           The author name and email address to use when no author
           information can be found in the patch description.

       --patches &lt;dir&gt;
           The directory to find the quilt patches.

           The default for the patch directory is <i>patches</i> or the value
           of the <b>$QUILT_PATCHES </b>environment variable.

       --series &lt;file&gt;
           The quilt series file.

           The default for the series file is &lt;patches&gt;/series or the
           value of the <b>$QUILT_SERIES </b>environment variable.

       --keep-non-patch
           Pass <b>-b </b>flag to <i>git mailinfo</i> (see <a href="git-mailinfo.1.html">git-mailinfo(1)</a>).
