NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-archimport - Import a GNU Arch repository into Git
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git archimport</i> [-h] [-v] [-o] [-a] [-f] [-T] [-D &lt;depth&gt;] [-t &lt;tempdir&gt;]
                      &lt;archive&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;[:&lt;git-branch&gt;]...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Imports a project from one or more GNU Arch repositories. It will
       follow branches and repositories within the namespaces defined by
       the &lt;archive&gt;/&lt;branch&gt; parameters supplied. If it cannot find the
       remote branch a merge comes from it will just import it as a
       regular commit. If it can find it, it will mark it as a merge
       whenever possible (see discussion below).

       The script expects you to provide the key roots where it can
       start the import from an <i>initial import</i> or <i>tag</i> type of Arch
       commit. It will follow and import new branches within the
       provided roots.

       It expects to be dealing with one project only. If it sees
       branches that have different roots, it will refuse to run. In
       that case, edit your &lt;archive&gt;/&lt;branch&gt; parameters to define
       clearly the scope of the import.

       <i>git archimport</i> uses <b>tla </b>extensively in the background to access
       the Arch repository. Make sure you have a recent version of <b>tla</b>
       available in the path. <b>tla </b>must know about the repositories you
       pass to <i>git archimport</i>.

       For the initial import, <i>git archimport</i> expects to find itself in
       an empty directory. To follow the development of a project that
       uses Arch, rerun <i>git archimport</i> with the same parameters as the
       initial import to perform incremental imports.

       While <i>git archimport</i> will try to create sensible branch names for
       the archives that it imports, it is also possible to specify Git
       branch names manually. To do so, write a Git branch name after
       each &lt;archive&gt;/&lt;branch&gt; parameter, separated by a colon. This
       way, you can shorten the Arch branch names and convert Arch
       jargon to Git jargon, for example mapping a
       "PROJECT--devo--VERSION" branch to "master".

       Associating multiple Arch branches to one Git branch is possible;
       the result will make the most sense only if no commits are made
       to the first branch, after the second branch is created. Still,
       this is useful to convert Arch repositories that had been rotated
       periodically.
</pre> <h2>
MERGES </h2>
<pre>
       Patch merge data from Arch is used to mark merges in Git as well.
       Git does not care much about tracking patches, and only considers
       a merge when a branch incorporates all the commits since the
       point they forked. The end result is that Git will have a good
       idea of how far branches have diverged. So the import process
       does lose some patch-trading metadata.

       Fortunately, when you try and merge branches imported from Arch,
       Git will find a good merge base, and it has a good chance of
       identifying patches that have been traded out-of-sequence between
       the branches.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -h
           Display usage.

       -v
           Verbose output.

       -T
           Many tags. Will create a tag for every commit, reflecting the
           commit name in the Arch repository.

       -f
           Use the fast patchset import strategy. This can be
           significantly faster for large trees, but cannot handle
           directory renames or permissions changes. The default
           strategy is slow and safe.

       -o
           Use this for compatibility with old-style branch names used
           by earlier versions of <i>git archimport</i>. Old-style branch names
           were category--branch, whereas new-style branch names are
           archive,category--branch--version. In both cases, names given
           on the command-line will override the automatically-generated
           ones.

       -D &lt;depth&gt;
           Follow merge ancestry and attempt to import trees that have
           been merged from. Specify a depth greater than 1 if patch
           logs have been pruned.

       -a
           Attempt to auto-register archives at
           <b>http://mirrors.sourcecontrol.net </b>This is particularly useful
           with the -D option.

       -t &lt;tmpdir&gt;
           Override the default tempdir.

       &lt;archive&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
           &lt;archive&gt;/&lt;branch&gt; identifier in a format that <b>tla log</b>
           understands.
