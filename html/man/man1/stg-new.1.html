NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-new - Create a new patch at top of the stack
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg new</i> [OPTIONS] [patchname] [-- &lt;path&gt;...]
       <i>stg new</i> [OPTIONS] [--name &lt;patchname&gt;] [-- &lt;path&gt;...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Create a new, empty patch on the current stack. The new patch is
       created on top of the currently applied patches, and is made the
       new top of the stack. Uncommitted changes in the work tree are
       not included in the patch — that is handled by stg-refresh.

       The given patch name must be unique in the stack. If no name is
       given, one is generated from the first line of the patch’s commit
       message.

       Patch names follow the rules for Git references with the
       additional constraint that patch names may not contain the <i>/</i>
       character. See <a href="git-check-ref-format.1.html">git-check-ref-format(1)</a> for details.

       Patch names may start with a leading <i>-</i>. When specifying such a
       patch name on the command line, the leading <i>-</i> may be escaped with
       a single backslash as in <i>\-patch-name</i> to disambiguate the patch
       name from command line options.

       An editor will be launched to edit the commit message to be used
       for the patch, unless the <i>--message</i> flag already specified one.
       The <i>patchdescr.tmpl</i> template file (if available) is used to
       pre-fill the editor.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -n &lt;name&gt;, --name=&lt;name&gt;
           Alternative to the [patchname] argument for specifying the
           name of the new patch. This option allows the patch name to
           start with an unescaped leading <i>-</i>.

       -r, --refresh
           Refresh the new patch with changes from work tree. New
           patches are empty by default, but with this option the new
           patch will capture outstanding changes in the work tree as if
           <a href="stg-refresh.1.html">stg-refresh(1)</a> was run. Use <i>--index</i> to refresh from the index
           instead of the work tree.

       -i, --index
           Instead of refreshing the patch with the current contents of
           the worktree, use the current contents of the index.

       -F, --force
           Force refresh with staged and unstaged changes.

           By default, if there are staged changes in the index along
           with unstaged changes in the work tree, the command will
           abort. This option forces the command to proceed using both
           the staged and unstaged changes.

       --submodules
           Include submodules in patch content

       --no-submodules
           Exclude submodules in patch content

       -e, --edit
           Invoke editor for patch description

       -d, --diff
           Show diff when editing patch description

       -m &lt;message&gt;, --message=&lt;message&gt;
           Use message instead of invoking the editor

       -f &lt;path&gt;, --file=&lt;path&gt;
           Use the contents of file instead of invoking the editor. Use
           "-" to read from stdin.

       --no-verify
           Disable commit-msg hook

       -s[=&lt;value&gt;], --signoff[=&lt;value&gt;]
           Add "Signed-off-by" message trailer.

           The value is optional and defaults to the committer name and
           email. This option may be provided multiple times.

       --ack[=&lt;value&gt;]
           Add "Acked-by" message trailer.

           The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
           and email. This option may be provided multiple times.

       --review[=&lt;value&gt;]
           Add "Reviewed-by" message trailer.

           The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
           and email. This option may be provided multiple times.

       --author=&lt;name-and-email&gt;
           Set the author "name &lt;email&gt;"

       --authname=&lt;name&gt;
           Set the author name

       --authemail=&lt;email&gt;
           Set the author email

       --authdate=&lt;date&gt;
           Set the date the patch was authored.

           Use "now" to use the current time and date.

       --committer-date-is-author-date
           Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
           the author date of the commit as the committer date.

       --save-template=&lt;file&gt;
           Instead of running the command, just write the patch
           description to FILE, and exit. (If FILE is "-", write to
           stdout.)

           When driving StGit from another program, it may be useful to
           first call a command with <i>--save-template</i>, then let the user
           edit the message, and then call the same command with <i>--file</i>.
