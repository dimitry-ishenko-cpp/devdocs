NAME </h2>
<pre>
       tabs — set terminal tabs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       tabs <b>[</b>-<i>n</i>|-a|-a2|-c|-c2|-c3|-f|-p|-s|-u<b>] [</b>-T <i>type</i><b>]</b>

       tabs <b>[</b>-T <i>type</i><b>] </b><i>n</i><b>[[</b><i>sep</i><b>[</b>+<b>]</b><i>n</i><b>]</b>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tabs</i> utility shall display a series of characters that first
       clears the hardware terminal tab settings and then initializes
       the tab stops at the specified positions and optionally adjusts
       the margin.

       The phrase ``tab-stop position <i>N</i>'' shall be taken to mean that,
       from the start of a line of output, tabbing to position <i>N</i> shall
       cause the next character output to be in the (<i>N</i>+1)th column
       position on that line. The maximum number of tab stops allowed is
       terminal-dependent.

       It need not be possible to implement <i>tabs</i> on certain terminals.
       If the terminal type obtained from the <i>TERM</i> environment variable
       or <b>-T </b>option represents such a terminal, an appropriate
       diagnostic message shall be written to standard error and <i>tabs</i>
       shall exit with a status greater than zero.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tabs</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except for
       various extensions: the options <b>-a2</b>, <b>-c2</b>, and <b>-c3 </b>are multi-
       character.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-</b><i>n</i>        Specify repetitive tab stops separated by a uniform
                 number of column positions, <i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a single-
                 digit decimal number. The default usage of <i>tabs</i> with no
                 arguments shall be equivalent to <i>tabs</i> -8. When <b>-0 </b>is
                 used, the tab stops shall be cleared and no new ones
                 set.

       <b>-a        </b>1,10,16,36,72
                 Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.

       <b>-a2       </b>1,10,16,40,72
                 Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.

       <b>-c        </b>1,8,12,16,20,55
                 COBOL, normal format.

       <b>-c2       </b>1,6,10,14,49
                 COBOL, compact format (columns 1 to 6 omitted).

       <b>-c3       </b>1,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34,38,42,46,50,54,58,62,67
                 COBOL compact format (columns 1 to 6 omitted), with
                 more tabs than <b>-c2</b>.

       <b>-f        </b>1,7,11,15,19,23
                 FORTRAN

       <b>-p        </b>1,5,9,13,17,21,25,29,33,37,41,45,49,53,57,61
                 PL/1

       <b>-s        </b>1,10,55
                 SNOBOL

       <b>-u        </b>1,12,20,44
                 Assembler, applicable to some mainframes.

       <b>-T </b><i>type</i>   Indicate the type of terminal. If this option is not
                 supplied and the <i>TERM</i> variable is unset or null, an
                 unspecified default terminal type shall be used. The
                 setting of <i>type</i> shall take precedence over the value in
                 <i>TERM</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>n</i><b>[[</b><i>sep</i><b>[</b>+<b>]</b><i>n</i><b>]</b>...<b>]</b>
                 A single command line argument that consists of one or
                 more tab-stop values (<i>n</i>) separated by a separator
                 character (<i>sep</i>) which is either a &lt;comma&gt; or a &lt;blank&gt;
                 character. The application shall ensure that the tab-
                 stop values are positive decimal integers in strictly
                 ascending order. If any tab-stop value (except the
                 first one) is preceded by a &lt;plus-sign&gt;, it is taken as
                 an increment to be added to the previous value. For
                 example, the tab lists 1,10,20,30 and <b>"1</b>10<b>+10</b>+10" are
                 considered to be identical.

INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>tabs</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TERM</i>      Determine the terminal type. If this variable is unset
                 or null, and if the <b>-T </b>option is not specified, an
                 unspecified default terminal type shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If standard output is a terminal, the appropriate sequence to
       clear and set the tab stops may be written to standard output in
       an unspecified format. If standard output is not a terminal,
       undefined results occur.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       This utility makes use of the terminal's hardware tabs and the
       <i>stty tabs</i> option.

       This utility is not recommended for application use.

       Some integrated display units might not have escape sequences to
       set tab stops, but may be set by internal system calls. On these
       terminals, <i>tabs</i> works if standard output is directed to the
       terminal; if output is directed to another file, however, <i>tabs</i>
       fails.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Consideration was given to having the <i>tput</i> utility handle all of
       the functions described in <i>tabs</i>.  However, the separate <i>tabs</i>
       utility was retained because it seems more intuitive to use a
       command named <i>tabs</i> than <i>tput</i> with a new option. The <i>tput</i> utility
       does not support setting or clearing tabs, and no known
       historical version of <i>tabs</i> supports the capability of setting
       arbitrary tab stops.

       The System V <i>tabs</i> interface is very complex; the version in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 has a reduced feature list, but many of
       the features omitted were restored as part of the XSI option even
       though the supported languages and coding styles are primarily
       historical.

       There was considerable sentiment for specifying only a means of
       resetting the tabs back to a known state—presumably the
       ``standard'' of tabs every eight positions. The following
       features were omitted:

        *  Setting tab stops via the first line in a file, using --<i>file</i>.
           Since even the SVID has no complete explanation of this
           feature, it is doubtful that it is in widespread use.

       In an early proposal, a <b>-t </b><i>tablist</i> option was added for
       consistency with <i>expand</i>; this was later removed when
       inconsistencies with the historical list of tabs were identified.

       Consideration was given to adding a <b>-p </b>option that would output
       the current tab settings so that they could be saved and then
       later restored. This was not accepted because querying the tab
       stops of the terminal is not a capability in historical <i>terminfo</i>
       or <i>termcap</i> facilities and might not be supported on a wide range
       of terminals.
