NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogreduce </b>- temporal reduction of Performance Co-Pilot archives
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogreduce </b>[<b>-z?</b>]  [<b>-A </b><i>align</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>samples</i>] [<b>-S </b><i>starttime</i>] [<b>-t</b>
       <i>interval</i>] [<b>-T </b><i>endtime</i>] [<b>-v </b><i>volsamples</i>] [<b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i>] <i>input output</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogreduce </b>reads one set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archives
       identified by <i>input</i> and creates a temporally reduced PCP archive
       in <i>output</i>.  <i>input</i> is a comma-separated list of names, each of
       which may be the base name of an archive or the name of a
       directory containing one or more archives.  The data reduction
       involves statistical and temporal reduction of samples with an
       output sampling interval defined by the <b>-t </b>option in the <i>output</i>
       archive (independent of the sampling intervals in the <i>input</i>
       archives), and is further controlled by other command line
       arguments.

       For some metrics, temporal data reduction is not going to be
       helpful, so for metrics with types <b>PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE </b>or
       <b>PM_TYPE_EVENT</b>, a warning is issued if these metrics are found in
       <i>input</i> and they will be skipped and not appear in the <i>output</i>
       archive.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-A </b><i>align</i>, <b>--align</b>=<i>align</i>
            Specify a ``natural'' alignment of the output sample times;
            refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>.

       <b>-s </b><i>samples</i>, <b>--samples</b>=<i>samples</i>
            The argument <i>samples</i> defines the number of samples to be
            written to <i>output</i>.  If <i>samples</i> is 0 or <b>-s </b>is not specified,
            <b>pmlogreduce </b>will sample until the end of the set of PCP
            archives, or the end of the time window as specified by <b>-T</b>,
            whichever comes first.  The <b>-s </b>option will override the <b>-T</b>
            option if it occurs sooner.

       <b>-S </b><i>starttime</i>, <b>--start</b>=<i>starttime</i>
            Define the start of a time window to restrict the samples
            retrieved from the <i>input</i> archives; refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>.

       <b>-t </b><i>interval</i>, <b>--interval</b>=<i>interval</i>
            Consecutive samples in the <i>output</i> archive will appear with a
            time delta defined by <i>interval</i>; refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>.  Note
            the default value is 600 (seconds, i.e. 10 minutes).

       <b>-T </b><i>endtime</i>, <b>--finish</b>=<i>endtime</i>
            Define the termination of a time window to restrict the
            samples retrieved from the <i>input</i> archives; refer to
            <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>.

       <b>-v </b><i>volsamples</i>
            The <i>output</i> archive is potentially a multi-volume data set,
            and the <b>-v </b>option causes <b>pmlogreduce </b>to start a new volume
            after <i>volsamples</i> records have been written to the <i>output</i>
            archive.

              Independent of any <b>-v </b>option, each volume of an archive is
              limited to no more than 2^31 bytes, so <i>pmlogreduce</i> will
              automatically create a new volume for the archive before
              this limit is reached.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--hostzone</b>
            Use the local timezone of the host from the <i>input</i> archives
            when displaying the date and time, or interpreting the <b>-S</b>
            and <b>-T </b>options.  The default is to initially use the
            timezone of the local host.

       <b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i>, <b>--timezone</b>=<i>timezone</i>
            Use <i>timezone</i> when displaying the date and time, or
            interpreting the <b>-S </b>and <b>-T </b>options.  <i>Timezone</i> is in the
            format of the environment variable <b>TZ </b>as described in
            <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
DATA REDUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       The statistical and temporal reduction follows the following
       rules:

       1.  Consecutive records from <i>input</i> are read without
           interpolation, and at most one output record is written for
           each <i>interval</i>, summarizing the performance data over that
           period.

       2.  If the semantics of a metric indicates it is <b>instantaneous </b>or
           <b>discrete </b>then <i>output</i> value is computed as the arithmetic mean
           of the observations (if any) over each <i>interval</i>.

       3.  If the semantics of a metric indicates it is a <b>counter </b>then
           the following transformations are applied:
           a)  Metrics with 32-bit precision are promoted to 64-bit
               precision.
           b)  Any counter wrap (overflow) is noted, and appropriate
               adjustment made in the value of the metric over each
               <i>interval</i>.  This will be correct in the case of a single
               counter wrap, but will silently <b>underestimate </b>in the case
               where more than one counter wrap occurs between
               consecutive observations in the <i>input</i> archives, and
               silently <b>overestimate </b>in the case where a counter reset
               occurs between consecutive observations in the <i>input</i>
               archives; unfortunately these situations cannot be
               detected, but are believed to be rare events for the sort
               of production monitoring environments where <b>pmlogreduce</b>
               is most likely to be deployed.

       4.  Any changes in instance domains, and indeed all metadata, is
           preserved.

       5.  Any ``mark'' records in the <i>input</i> archives (as created by
           <a href="pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a>) will be preserved in the <i>output</i> archive, so
           periods where no data is available are maintained, and data
           interpolation will <b>not </b>occur across these periods when the
           <i>output</i> archive is subsequently processed with PCP
           applications.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       The preamble metrics (pmcd.pmlogger.archive, pmcd.pmlogger.host,
       and pmcd.pmlogger.port), which are automatically recorded by
       <b>pmlogger </b>at the start of the archive, may not be present in the
       archive output by <b>pmlogreduce</b>.  These metrics are only relevant
       while the archive is being created, and have no significance once
       recording has finished.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       All error conditions detected by <b>pmlogreduce </b>are reported on
       <i>stderr</i> with textual (if sometimes terse) explanation.

       Should the <i>input</i> archives be corrupted (this can happen if the
       <b>pmlogger </b>instance writing the archive suddenly dies), then
       <b>pmlogreduce </b>will detect and report the position of the corruption
       in the file, and any subsequent information from the <i>input</i>
       archives will not be processed.

       If any error is detected, <b>pmlogreduce </b>will exit with a non-zero
       status.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       For each of the <i>input</i> and <i>output</i> archives, several physical files
       are used.

       <i>archive</i><b>.meta</b>
            metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for
            the archive

       <i>archive</i><b>.0</b>
            initial volume of metrics values (subsequent volumes have
            suffixes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, ...) - for <i>input</i> these files may have been
            previously compressed with <b>bzip2</b>(1) or <b>gzip</b>(1) and thus may
            have an additional <b>.bz2 </b>or <b>.gz </b>suffix.

       <i>archive</i><b>.index</b>
            temporal index to support rapid random access to the other
            files in the archive.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
