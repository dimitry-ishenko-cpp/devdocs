       capsh - capability shell wrapper
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>capsh </b>[<i>OPTION</i>]...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Linux capability support and use can be explored and constrained
       with this tool. This tool provides a handy wrapper for certain
       types of capability testing and environment creation. It also
       provides some debugging features useful for summarizing
       capability state.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>capsh </b>takes a number of optional arguments, acting on them in the
       order they are provided. They are as follows:

       <b>--help </b>Display the list of commands supported by <b>capsh</b>.

       <b>--print</b>
              Display prevailing capability and related state.

       <b>--current</b>
              Display prevailing capability state, 1e capabilities and
              IAB vector.

       <b>-- </b><i>[args]</i>
              Execute <b>/bin/bash </b>with trailing arguments. Note, you can
              use <b>-c 'command to execute' </b>for specific commands.

       <b>-+ </b><i>[args]</i>
              Uses <a href="../man3/cap_launch.3.html">cap_launch(3)</a> to fork a child to execute the shell.
              When the child exits, <b>capsh </b>exits with the status of the
              child or 1 in the case that the child was terminated by a
              signal.

       <b>== </b><i>[args]</i>
              Execute <b>capsh </b>again with the remaining arguments. Useful
              for testing <b>exec</b>() behavior. Note, PATH is searched when
              the running <b>capsh </b>was found via the shell's PATH
              searching. If the <b>exec </b>occurs after a <b>--chroot=</b><i>/some/path</i>
              argument the PATH located binary may not be resolve to the
              same binary as that running initially. This behavior is an
              intended feature as it can complete the chroot transition.

       <b>=+ </b><i>[args]</i>
              Uses <a href="../man3/cap_launch.3.html">cap_launch(3)</a> to fork a child to re-execute <b>capsh</b>.
              When this child exits, <b>capsh </b>exits with the status of the
              child or 1 in the case that the child was terminated by a
              signal.

       <b>--caps=</b><i>cap-set</i>
              Set the prevailing process capabilities to those specified
              by <i>cap-set</i>.  Where <i>cap-set</i> is a text-representation of
              capability state as per <a href="../man3/cap_from_text.3.html">cap_from_text(3)</a>.

       <b>--drop=</b><i>cap-list</i>
              Remove the listed capabilities from the prevailing
              bounding set. The capabilities are a comma-separated list
              of capabilities as recognized by the <a href="../man3/cap_from_name.3.html">cap_from_name(3)</a>
              function. Use of this feature requires that <b>capsh </b>is
              operating with <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>in its effective set.

       <b>--inh=</b><i>cap-list</i>
              Set the inheritable set of capabilities for the current
              process to equal those provided in the comma separated
              list. For this action to succeed, the prevailing process
              should already have each of these capabilities in the
              union of the current inheritable and permitted capability
              sets, or <b>capsh </b>should be operating with <b>CAP_SETPCAP </b>in its
              effective set.

       <b>--user=</b><i>username</i>
              Assume the identity of the named user. That is, look up
              the user's UID and GID with <a href="../man3/getpwuid.3.html">getpwuid(3)</a> and their group
              memberships with <a href="../man3/getgrouplist.3.html">getgrouplist(3)</a> and set them all using
              <a href="../man3/cap_setuid.3.html">cap_setuid(3)</a> and <a href="../man3/cap_setgroups.3.html">cap_setgroups(3)</a>.  Following this
              command, the effective capabilities will be cleared, but
              the permitted set will not be, so the running program is
              still privileged.

       <b>--mode </b>Display the prevailing libcap mode as guessed by the
              <a href="../man3/cap_get_mode.3.html">cap_get_mode(3)</a> function.

       <b>--mode=</b>&lt;mode&gt;
              Force the program into a <a href="../man3/cap_set_mode.3.html">cap_set_mode(3)</a> security mode.
              This is a set of securebits and prevailing capability
              arrangement recommended for its pre-determined security
              stance.

       <b>--modes</b>
              Lists all of the libcap modes supported by <b>--mode=</b>&lt;mode&gt;.

       <b>--inmode=</b>&lt;mode&gt;
              Confirm that the prevailing mode is that specified in
              <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i>, or exit with a status 1.

       <b>--uid=</b><i>id</i>
              Force all UID values to equal <i>id</i> using the <a href="../man2/setuid.2.html">setuid(2)</a>
              system call. This argument may require explicit
              preparation of the effective set.

       <b>--cap-uid=</b>&lt;uid&gt;
              use the <a href="../man3/cap_setuid.3.html">cap_setuid(3)</a> function to set the UID of the
              current process. This performs all preparations for
              setting the UID without dropping capabilities in the
              process. Following this command the prevailing effective
              capabilities will be lowered.

       <b>--is-uid=</b><i>&lt;id&gt;</i>
              Exit with status 1 unless the current UID equals <i>&lt;id&gt;</i>.

       <b>--gid=</b><i>&lt;id&gt;</i>
              Force all GID values to equal <i>id</i> using the <a href="../man2/setgid.2.html">setgid(2)</a>
              system call.

       <b>--is-gid=</b><i>&lt;id&gt;</i>
              Exit with status 1 unless the current GIQ equals <i>&lt;id&gt;</i>.

       <b>--groups=</b><i>&lt;gid-list&gt;</i>
              Set the supplementary groups to the numerical list
              provided. The groups are set with the <a href="../man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups(2)</a> system
              call. See <b>--user </b>for a more convenient way of doing this.

       <b>--keep=</b><i>&lt;0|1&gt;</i>
              In a non-pure capability mode, the kernel provides liberal
              privilege to the super-user. However, it is normally the
              case that when the super-user changes UID to some lesser
              user, then capabilities are dropped. For these situations,
              the kernel can permit the process to retain its
              capabilities after a <a href="../man2/setuid.2.html">setuid(2)</a> system call. This feature
              is known as <i>keep-caps</i> support. The way to activate it
              using this program is with this argument. Setting the
              value to 1 will cause <i>keep-caps</i> to be active. Setting it
              to 0 will cause keep-caps to deactivate for the current
              process. In all cases, <i>keep-caps</i> is deactivated when an
              <b>exec</b>() is performed. See <b>--secbits</b>and<b>--mode </b>for ways to
              disable this feature.

       <b>--secbits=</b><i>N</i>
              Set the security-bits for the program.  This is done using
              the <a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_SECUREBITS </b>operation.  The list of
              supported bits and their meaning can be found in the
              <b>&lt;sys/secbits.h&gt; </b>header file. The program will list these
              bits via the <b>--print </b>command.  The argument is expressed
              as a numeric bitmask, in any of the formats permitted by
              <a href="../man3/strtoul.3.html">strtoul(3)</a>.  An alternative to this bit-twiddling is
              embedded in the <b>--mode* </b>commandline arguments.

       <b>--chroot=</b><i>/some/path</i>
              Execute the <a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot(2)</a> system call with the new root-
              directory (/) equal to <i>path</i>.  This operation requires
              <b>CAP_SYS_CHROOT </b>to be in effect.

       <b>--forkfor=</b><i>sec</i>
              This command causes the program to fork a child process
              for so many seconds. The child will sleep that long and
              then exit with status 0. The purpose of this command is to
              support exploring the way processes are killable in the
              face of capability changes. See the <b>--killit </b>command. Only
              one fork can be active at a time.

       <b>--killit=</b><i>sig</i>
              This commands causes a <b>--forkfor </b>child to be <a href="../man2/kill.2.html">kill(2)</a>d with
              the specified signal. The command then waits for the child
              to exit.  If the exit status does not match the signal
              being used to kill it, the <b>capsh </b>program exits with status
              1.

       <b>--explain=</b><i>cap_xxx</i>
              Give a brief textual description of what privileges the
              specified capability makes available to a running program.
              Note, instead of <i>cap_xxx</i>, one can provide a decimal number
              and <b>capsh </b>will look up the corresponding capability's
              description.

       <b>--shell</b><i>=/full/path</i>
              This option changes the shell that is invoked when the
              argument <b>== </b>is encountered.

       <b>--strict</b>
              This option toggles the suppression of subsequent attempts
              to fixup <b>--caps= </b>and <b>--inh= </b>arguments. That is, when the
              prevailing Effective flag does not contain <b>CAP_SETPCAP the</b>
              <b>to be raised Inheritable Flag values (in strict mode) are</b>
              <b>limited to those in the Permitted set. The strict mode</b>
              <b>defaults to off. Supplying this argument an even number of</b>
              <b>times restores this default behavior.</b>

       <b>--suggest=</b><i>phrase</i>
              Scan each of the textual descriptions of capabilities,
              known to <b>capsh</b>, and display all descriptions that include
              <i>phrase</i>.

       <b>--decode=</b><i>N</i>
              This is a convenience feature. If you look at
              <b>/proc/1/status </b>there are some capability related fields of
              the following form:

              CapInh:   0000000000000000
              CapPrm:   0000003fffffffff
              CapEff:   0000003fffffffff
              CapBnd:   0000003fffffffff
              CapAmb:   0000000000000000

              This option provides a quick way to decode a capability
              vector represented in this hexadecimal form.  Here's an
              example that decodes the two lowest capability bits:

              $ <b>capsh --decode=3</b>
              0x0000000000000003=cap_chown,cap_dac_override

       <b>--supports=</b><i>xxx</i>
              As the kernel evolves, more capabilities are added. This
              option can be used to verify the existence of a capability
              on the system. For example, <b>--supports=</b><i>cap_syslog</i> will
              cause <b>capsh </b>to promptly exit with a status of 1 when run
              on kernel 2.6.27.  However, when run on kernel 2.6.38 it
              will silently succeed.

       <b>--has-p=</b><i>xxx</i>
              Exit with status 1 unless the <i>permitted</i> vector has
              capability <b>xxx </b>raised.

       <b>--has-ambient</b>
              Performs a check to see if the running kernel supports
              ambient capabilities. If not, <b>capsh </b>exits with status 1.

       <b>--has-a=</b><i>xxx</i>
              Exit with status 1 unless the <i>ambient</i> vector has
              capability <b>xxx </b>raised.

       <b>--has-b=</b><i>xxx</i>
              Exit with status 1 unless the <i>bounding</i> vector has
              capability <b>xxx </b>in its (default) non-blocked state.

       <b>--iab=</b><i>xxx</i>
              Attempts to set the IAB tuple of inheritable capability
              vectors.  The text conventions used for <i>xxx</i> are those of
              <a href="../man3/cap_iab_from_text.3.html">cap_iab_from_text(3)</a>.

       <b>--addamb=</b><i>xxx</i>
              Adds the specified ambient capability to the running
              process.

       <b>--delamb=</b><i>xxx</i>
              Removes the specified ambient capability from the running
              process.

       <b>--noamb</b>
              Drops all ambient capabilities from the running process.

       <b>--noenv</b>
              Suppresses overriding of the HOME and USER environment
              variables when a subsequent <b>--user </b>argument is processed.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              This argument is ignored unless it is the first one. If
              present, it suppresses the capsh runtime check to confirm
              the running libcap is recent enough that it can name all
              of the kernel supported capability values.
