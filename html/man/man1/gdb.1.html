NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gdb - The GNU Debugger
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       gdb [OPTIONS] [<i>prog</i>|<i>prog procID</i>|<i>prog core</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what
       is going on "inside" another program while it executes -- or what
       another program was doing at the moment it crashed.

       GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in
       support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

       •   Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
           behavior.

       •   Make your program stop on specified conditions.

       •   Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

       •   Change things in your program, so you can experiment with
           correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about
           another.

       You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C++, Fortran and
       Modula-2.

       GDB is invoked with the shell command "gdb".  Once started, it
       reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit with
       the GDB command "quit" or "exit".  You can get online help from
       GDB itself by using the command "help".

       You can run "gdb" with no arguments or options; but the most
       usual way to start GDB is with one argument or two, specifying an
       executable program as the argument:

               gdb program

       You can also start with both an executable program and a core
       file specified:

               gdb program core

       You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument or
       use option "-p", if you want to debug a running process:

               gdb program 1234
               gdb -p 1234

       would attach GDB to process 1234.  With option <b>-p </b>you can omit
       the <i>program</i> filename.

       Here are some of the most frequently needed GDB commands:

       <b>break [</b><i>file</i><b>:][</b><i>function</i><b>|</b><i>line</i><b>]</b>
           Set a breakpoint at <i>function</i> or <i>line</i> (in <i>file</i>).

       <b>run [</b><i>arglist</i><b>]</b>
           Start your program (with <i>arglist</i>, if specified).

       <b>bt  </b>Backtrace: display the program stack.

       <b>print </b><i>expr</i>
           Display the value of an expression.

       <b>c   </b>Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at a
           breakpoint).

       <b>next</b>
           Execute next program line (after stopping); step <i>over</i> any
           function calls in the line.

       <b>edit [</b><i>file</i><b>:]</b><i>function</i>
           look at the program line where it is presently stopped.

       <b>list [</b><i>file</i><b>:]</b><i>function</i>
           type the text of the program in the vicinity of where it is
           presently stopped.

       <b>step</b>
           Execute next program line (after stopping); step <i>into</i> any
           function calls in the line.

       <b>help [</b><i>name</i><b>]</b>
           Show information about GDB command <i>name</i>, or general
           information about using GDB.

       <b>quit</b>
       <b>exit</b>
           Exit from GDB.

       For full details on GDB, see <i>Using GDB: A Guide to the GNU</i>
       <i>Source-Level Debugger</i>, by Richard M. Stallman and Roland H.
       Pesch.  The same text is available online as the "gdb" entry in
       the "info" program.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Any arguments other than options specify an executable file and
       core file (or process ID); that is, the first argument
       encountered with no associated option flag is equivalent to a
       <b>--se </b>option, and the second, if any, is equivalent to a <b>-c </b>option
       if it's the name of a file.  Many options have both long and
       abbreviated forms; both are shown here.  The long forms are also
       recognized if you truncate them, so long as enough of the option
       is present to be unambiguous.

       The abbreviated forms are shown here with <b>- </b>and long forms are
       shown with <b>-- </b>to reflect how they are shown in <b>--help</b>. However,
       GDB recognizes all of the following conventions for most options:

       "--option=<i>value</i>"
       "--option <i>value</i>"
       "-option=<i>value</i>"
       "-option <i>value</i>"
       "--o=<i>value</i>"
       "--o <i>value</i>"
       "-o=<i>value</i>"
       "-o <i>value</i>"

       All the options and command line arguments you give are processed
       in sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the <b>-x</b>
       option is used.

       <b>--help</b>
       <b>-h  </b>List all options, with brief explanations.

       <b>--symbols=</b><i>file</i>
       <b>-s </b><i>file</i>
           Read symbol table from <i>file</i>.

       <b>--write</b>
           Enable writing into executable and core files.

       <b>--exec=</b><i>file</i>
       <b>-e </b><i>file</i>
           Use <i>file</i> as the executable file to execute when appropriate,
           and for examining pure data in conjunction with a core dump.

       <b>--se=</b><i>file</i>
           Read symbol table from <i>file</i> and use it as the executable
           file.

       <b>--core=</b><i>file</i>
       <b>-c </b><i>file</i>
           Use <i>file</i> as a core dump to examine.

       <b>--command=</b><i>file</i>
       <b>-x </b><i>file</i>
           Execute GDB commands from <i>file</i>.

       <b>--eval-command=</b><i>command</i>
       <b>-ex </b><i>command</i>
           Execute given GDB <i>command</i>.

       <b>--init-eval-command=</b><i>command</i>
       <b>-iex</b>
           Execute GDB <i>command</i> before loading the inferior.

       <b>--directory=</b><i>directory</i>
       <b>-d </b><i>directory</i>
           Add <i>directory</i> to the path to search for source files.

       <b>--nh</b>
           Do not execute commands from <i>~/.config/gdb/gdbinit</i>,
           <i>~/.gdbinit</i>, <i>~/.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit</i>, or <i>~/.gdbearlyinit</i>

       <b>--nx</b>
       <b>-n  </b>Do not execute commands from any <i>.gdbinit</i> or <i>.gdbearlyinit</i>
           initialization files.

       <b>--quiet</b>
       <b>--silent</b>
       <b>-q  </b>"Quiet".  Do not print the introductory and copyright
           messages.  These messages are also suppressed in batch mode.

       <b>--batch</b>
           Run in batch mode.  Exit with status 0 after processing all
           the command files specified with <b>-x </b>(and <i>.gdbinit</i>, if not
           inhibited).  Exit with nonzero status if an error occurs in
           executing the GDB commands in the command files.

           Batch mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter, for
           example to download and run a program on another computer; in
           order to make this more useful, the message

                   Program exited normally.

           (which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under
           GDB control terminates) is not issued when running in batch
           mode.

       <b>--batch-silent</b>
           Run in batch mode, just like <b>--batch</b>, but totally silent.
           All GDB output is suppressed (stderr is unaffected).  This is
           much quieter than <b>--silent </b>and would be useless for an
           interactive session.

           This is particularly useful when using targets that give
           <b>Loading section </b>messages, for example.

           Note that targets that give their output via GDB, as opposed
           to writing directly to "stdout", will also be made silent.

       <b>--args </b><i>prog</i> <b>[</b><i>arglist</i><b>]</b>
           Change interpretation of command line so that arguments
           following this option are passed as arguments to the
           inferior.  As an example, take the following command:

                   gdb ./a.out -q

           It would start GDB with <b>-q</b>, not printing the introductory
           message.  On the other hand, using:

                   gdb --args ./a.out -q

           starts GDB with the introductory message, and passes the
           option to the inferior.

       <b>--pid=</b><i>pid</i>
           Attach GDB to an already running program, with the PID <i>pid</i>.

       <b>--tui</b>
           Open the terminal user interface.

       <b>--readnow</b>
           Read all symbols from the given symfile on the first access.

       <b>--readnever</b>
           Do not read symbol files.

       <b>--return-child-result</b>
           GDB's exit code will be the same as the child's exit code.

       <b>--configuration</b>
           Print details about GDB configuration and then exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print version information and then exit.

       <b>--cd=</b><i>directory</i>
           Run GDB using <i>directory</i> as its working directory, instead of
           the current directory.

       <b>--data-directory=</b><i>directory</i>
       <b>-D  </b>Run GDB using <i>directory</i> as its data directory.  The data
           directory is where GDB searches for its auxiliary files.

       <b>--fullname</b>
       <b>-f  </b>Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a subprocess.  It
           tells GDB to output the full file name and line number in a
           standard, recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is
           displayed (which includes each time the program stops).  This
           recognizable format looks like two <b>\032 </b>characters, followed
           by the file name, line number and character position
           separated by colons, and a newline.  The Emacs-to-GDB
           interface program uses the two <b>\032 </b>characters as a signal to
           display the source code for the frame.

       <b>-b </b><i>baudrate</i>
           Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any
           serial interface used by GDB for remote debugging.

       <b>-l </b><i>timeout</i>
           Set timeout, in seconds, for remote debugging.

       <b>--tty=</b><i>device</i>
           Run using <i>device</i> for your program's standard input and
           output.
