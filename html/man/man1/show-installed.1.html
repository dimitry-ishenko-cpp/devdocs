       <b>show-installed </b>[options]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>

       <b>show-installed </b>gives a compact description of the packages
       installed (or given) making use of the comps groups found in the
       repositories.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-h, --help</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>-f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT</b>
              yum, kickstart or human; yum gives the result as a yum
              command line; kickstart the content of a %packages
              section; "human" readable is default.

       <b>-i INPUT, --input=INPUT</b>
              File to read the package list from instead of using the
              rpmdb. - for stdin. The file must contain package names
              only separated by white space (including newlines). rpm
              -qa --qf='%{name}\n' produces proper output.

       <b>-o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT</b>
              File to write the result to. Stdout is used if option is
              omitted.

       <b>-q, --quiet</b>
              Do not show warnings.

       <b>-e, --no-excludes</b>
              Only show groups that are installed completely. Do not use
              exclude lines.

       <b>--global-excludes</b>
              Print exclude lines at the end and not after the groups
              requiring them.

       <b>--global-addons</b>
              Print package names at the end and not after the groups
              offering them as addon.

       <b>--addons-by-group</b>
              Also show groups not selected to sort packages contained
              by them. Those groups are commented out with a "# " at the
              begin of the line.

       <b>-m, --allow-mandatories</b>
              Check if just installing the mandatory packages gives
              better results. Uses "." to mark those groups.

       <b>-a, --allow-all</b>
              Check if installing all packages in the groups gives
              better results. Uses "*" to mark those groups.

       <b>--ignore-missing</b>
              Ignore packages missing in the repos.

       <b>--ignore-missing-excludes</b>
              Do not produce exclude lines for packages not in the
              repository.
