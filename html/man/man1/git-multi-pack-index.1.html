NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-multi-pack-index - Write and verify multi-pack-indexes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git multi-pack-index</i> [--object-dir=&lt;dir&gt;] [--[no-]bitmap] &lt;sub-command&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Write or verify a multi-pack-index (MIDX) file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --object-dir=&lt;dir&gt;
           Use given directory for the location of Git objects. We check
           <b>&lt;dir&gt;/packs/multi-pack-index </b>for the current MIDX file, and
           <b>&lt;dir&gt;/packs </b>for the pack-files to index.

           <b>&lt;dir&gt; </b>must be an alternate of the current repository.

       --[no-]progress
           Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
           progress is shown if standard error is connected to a
           terminal. Supported by sub-commands <b>write</b>, <b>verify</b>, <b>expire</b>,
           and `repack.

       The following subcommands are available:

       write
           Write a new MIDX file. The following options are available
           for the <b>write </b>sub-command:

           --preferred-pack=&lt;pack&gt;
               Optionally specify the tie-breaking pack used when
               multiple packs contain the same object.  <b>&lt;pack&gt; </b>must
               contain at least one object. If not given, ties are
               broken in favor of the pack with the lowest mtime.

           --[no-]bitmap
               Control whether or not a multi-pack bitmap is written.

           --stdin-packs
               Write a multi-pack index containing only the set of
               line-delimited pack index basenames provided over stdin.

           --refs-snapshot=&lt;path&gt;
               With <b>--bitmap</b>, optionally specify a file which contains a
               "refs snapshot" taken prior to repacking.

               A reference snapshot is composed of line-delimited OIDs
               corresponding to the reference tips, usually taken by <b>git</b>
               <b>repack </b>prior to generating a new pack. A line may
               optionally start with a <b>+ </b>character to indicate that the
               reference which corresponds to that OID is "preferred"
               (see <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>'s <b>pack.preferBitmapTips</b>.)

               The file given at <b>&lt;path&gt; </b>is expected to be readable, and
               can contain duplicates. (If a given OID is given more
               than once, it is marked as preferred if at least one
               instance of it begins with the special <b>+ </b>marker).

       verify
           Verify the contents of the MIDX file.

       expire
           Delete the pack-files that are tracked by the MIDX file, but
           have no objects referenced by the MIDX (with the exception of
           <b>.keep </b>packs and cruft packs). Rewrite the MIDX file afterward
           to remove all references to these pack-files.

       repack
           Create a new pack-file containing objects in small pack-files
           referenced by the multi-pack-index. If the size given by the
           <b>--batch-size=&lt;size&gt; </b>argument is zero, then create a pack
           containing all objects referenced by the multi-pack-index.
           For a non-zero batch size, Select the pack-files by examining
           packs from oldest-to-newest, computing the "expected size" by
           counting the number of objects in the pack referenced by the
           multi-pack-index, then divide by the total number of objects
           in the pack and multiply by the pack size. We select packs
           with expected size below the batch size until the set of
           packs have total expected size at least the batch size, or
           all pack-files are considered. If only one pack-file is
           selected, then do nothing. If a new pack-file is created,
           rewrite the multi-pack-index to reference the new pack-file.
           A later run of <i>git multi-pack-index expire</i> will delete the
           pack-files that were part of this batch.

           If <b>repack.packKeptObjects </b>is <b>false</b>, then any pack-files with
           an associated <b>.keep </b>file will not be selected for the batch
           to repack.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       •   Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in the current <b>.git</b>
           directory.

               $ git multi-pack-index write

       •   Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in the current <b>.git</b>
           directory with a corresponding bitmap.

               $ git multi-pack-index write --preferred-pack=&lt;pack&gt; --bitmap

       •   Write a MIDX file for the packfiles in an alternate object
           store.

               $ git multi-pack-index --object-dir &lt;alt&gt; write

       •   Verify the MIDX file for the packfiles in the current <b>.git</b>
           directory.

               $ git multi-pack-index verify
