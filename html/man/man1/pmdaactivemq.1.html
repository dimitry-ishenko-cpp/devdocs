NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaactivemq </b>- ActiveMQ performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaactivemq </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports performance metrics from ActiveMQ.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       This PMDA requires that ActiveMQ has been installed with the
       Jolokia JMX-HTTP bridge enabled. By default the PMDA will connect
       to localhost at port 8161 with a username and password of
       'admin'. This can be configured in
       PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq/activemq.conf

       Install the ActiveMQ PMDA by using the Install script as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, do the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/activemq</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdaactivemq </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by <b>PCP</b>. On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
