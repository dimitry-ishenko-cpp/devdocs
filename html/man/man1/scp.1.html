DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>scp </b>copies files between hosts on a network.

       <b>scp </b>uses the SFTP protocol over a <i>ssh</i>(1) connection for data
       transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same
       security as a login session.

       <b>scp </b>will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
       authentication.

       The <i>source</i> and <i>target</i> may be specified as a local pathname, a
       remote host with optional path in the form [user@]host:[path], or
       a URI in the form scp://[user@]host[:port][/path].  Local file
       names can be made explicit using absolute or relative pathnames
       to avoid <b>scp </b>treating file names containing ‘:’ as host
       specifiers.

       When copying between two remote hosts, if the URI format is used,
       a <i>port</i> cannot be specified on the <i>target</i> if the <b>-R </b>option is
       used.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-3      </b>Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through
               the local host.  Without this option the data is copied
               directly between the two remote hosts.  Note that, when
               using the legacy SCP protocol (via the <b>-O </b>flag), this
               option selects batch mode for the second host as <b>scp</b>
               cannot ask for passwords or passphrases for both hosts.
               This mode is the default.

       <b>-4      </b>Forces <b>scp </b>to use IPv4 addresses only.

       <b>-6      </b>Forces <b>scp </b>to use IPv6 addresses only.

       <b>-A      </b>Allows forwarding of <i>ssh-agent</i>(1) to the remote system.
               The default is not to forward an authentication agent.

       <b>-B      </b>Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
               passphrases).

       <b>-C      </b>Compression enable.  Passes the <b>-C </b>flag to <i>ssh</i>(1) to
               enable compression.

       <b>-c </b><i>cipher</i>
               Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data
               transfer.  This option is directly passed to <i>ssh</i>(1).

       <b>-D </b><i>sftp_server_path</i>
               Connect directly to a local SFTP server program rather
               than a remote one via <i>ssh</i>(1).  This option may be useful
               in debugging the client and server.

       <b>-F </b><i>ssh_config</i>
               Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for
               <b>ssh</b>.  This option is directly passed to <i>ssh</i>(1).

       <b>-i </b><i>identity_file</i>
               Selects the file from which the identity (private key)
               for public key authentication is read.  This option is
               directly passed to <i>ssh</i>(1).

       <b>-J </b><i>destination</i>
               Connect to the target host by first making an <b>scp</b>
               connection to the jump host described by <i>destination</i> and
               then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate
               destination from there.  Multiple jump hops may be
               specified separated by comma characters.  This is a
               shortcut to specify a <b>ProxyJump </b>configuration directive.
               This option is directly passed to <i>ssh</i>(1).

       <b>-l </b><i>limit</i>
               Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

       <b>-O      </b>Use the legacy SCP protocol for file transfers instead of
               the SFTP protocol.  Forcing the use of the SCP protocol
               may be necessary for servers that do not implement SFTP,
               for backwards-compatibility for particular filename
               wildcard patterns and for expanding paths with a ‘~’
               prefix for older SFTP servers.

       <b>-o </b><i>ssh_option</i>
               Can be used to pass options to <b>ssh </b>in the format used in
               <i>ssh_config</i>(5).  This is useful for specifying options for
               which there is no separate <b>scp </b>command-line flag.  For
               full details of the options listed below, and their
               possible values, see <i>ssh_config</i>(5).

       <b>-P </b><i>port</i>
               Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
               Note that this option is written with a capital ‘P’,
               because <b>-p </b>is already reserved for preserving the times
               and mode bits of the file.

       <b>-p      </b>Preserves modification times, access times, and file mode
               bits from the source file.

       <b>-q      </b>Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as
               warning and diagnostic messages from <i>ssh</i>(1).

       <b>-R      </b>Copies between two remote hosts are performed by
               connecting to the origin host and executing <b>scp </b>there.
               This requires that <b>scp </b>running on the origin host can
               authenticate to the destination host without requiring a
               password.

       <b>-r      </b>Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that <b>scp</b>
               follows symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.

       <b>-S </b><i>program</i>
               Name of <i>program</i> to use for the encrypted connection.  The
               program must understand <i>ssh</i>(1) options.

       <b>-T      </b>Disable strict filename checking.  By default when
               copying files from a remote host to a local directory <b>scp</b>
               checks that the received filenames match those requested
               on the command-line to prevent the remote end from
               sending unexpected or unwanted files.  Because of
               differences in how various operating systems and shells
               interpret filename wildcards, these checks may cause
               wanted files to be rejected.  This option disables these
               checks at the expense of fully trusting that the server
               will not send unexpected filenames.

       <b>-v      </b>Verbose mode.  Causes <b>scp </b>and <i>ssh</i>(1) to print debugging
               messages about their progress.  This is helpful in
               debugging connection, authentication, and configuration
               problems.

       <b>-X </b><i>sftp_option</i>
               Specify an option that controls aspects of SFTP protocol
               behaviour.  The valid options are:

               <b>nrequests</b>=<i>value</i>
                       Controls how many concurrent SFTP read or write
                       requests may be in progress at any point in time
                       during a download or upload.  By default 64
                       requests may be active concurrently.

               <b>buffer</b>=<i>value</i>
                       Controls the maximum buffer size for a single
                       SFTP read/write operation used during download or
                       upload.  By default a 32KB buffer is used.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>scp </b>is based on the rcp program in BSD source code from the
       Regents of the University of California.

       Since OpenSSH 9.0, <b>scp </b>has used the SFTP protocol for transfers
       by default.

</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       The legacy SCP protocol (selected by the <b>-O </b>flag) requires
       execution of the remote user's shell to perform <i>glob</i>(3) pattern
       matching.  This requires careful quoting of any characters that
       have special meaning to the remote shell, such as quote
       characters.
