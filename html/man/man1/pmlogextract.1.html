       <b>pmlogextract </b>- reduce, extract, concatenate and merge Performance
       Co-Pilot archives
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogextract </b>[<b>-dfmwxz?</b>]  [<b>-c </b><i>configfile</i>] [<b>-S </b><i>starttime</i>] [<b>-s</b>
       <i>samples</i>] [<b>-T </b><i>endtime</i>] [<b>-V </b><i>version</i>] [<b>-v </b><i>volsamples</i>] [<b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i>]
       <i>input</i> [...] <i>output</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogextract </b>reads one or more Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
       archives identified by <i>input</i> and creates a merged and/or reduced
       PCP archive in <i>output</i>.  Each <i>input</i> argument is either a name or a
       comma-separated list of names, and each name is the name of one
       file from an archive or the base name of an archive or the name
       of a directory containing one or more archives.  The nature of
       merging is controlled by the number of <i>input</i> archives, while the
       nature of data reduction is controlled by the command line
       arguments.  The <i>input</i> arguments must be archives created by
       <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> with performance data collected from the <b>same </b>host,
       but usually over different time periods and possibly (although
       not usually) with different performance metrics being logged.

       If only one <i>input</i> is specified, then the default behavior simply
       copies the <i>input</i> PCP archive (with possible conversion to a newer
       version of the archive format, see <b>-V </b>below), into the <i>output</i> PCP
       archive.  When two or more PCP archives are specified as <i>input</i>,
       the archives are merged (or concatenated) and written to <i>output</i>.

       In the <i>output</i> archive a <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>record may be inserted at a time
       just past the end of each of the <i>input</i> archive to indicate a
       possible temporal discontinuity between the end of one <i>input</i>
       archive and the start of the next <i>input</i> archive.  See the <b>MARK</b>
       <b>RECORDS </b>section below for more information.  There is no <b>&lt;mark&gt;</b>
       record after the end of the <b>last </b>(in temporal order) of the
       records from the <i>input</i> archive(s).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-c </b><i>config</i>, <b>--config</b>=<i>config</i>
            Extract only the metrics specified in <i>config</i> from the <i>input</i>
            PCP archive(s).  The <i>config</i> syntax accepted by <b>pmlogextract</b>
            is explained in more detail in the <b>CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX</b>
            section.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--desperate</b>
            Desperate mode.  Normally if a fatal error occurs, all trace
            of the partially written PCP archive <i>output</i> is removed.
            With the <b>-d </b>option, the <i>output</i> archive is not removed.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--first</b>
            For most common uses, all of the <i>input</i> archives will have
            been collected in the same timezone.  But if this is not the
            case, then <b>pmlogextract </b>must choose one of the timezones
            from the <i>input</i> archives to be used as the timezone for the
            <i>output</i> archive.  The default is to use the timezone from the
            <b>last </b><i>input</i> archive.  The <b>-f </b>option forces the timezone from
            the <b>first </b><i>input</i> archive to be used.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mark</b>
            As described in the <b>MARK RECORDS </b>section below, sometimes it
            is possible to safely omit <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>records from the <i>output</i>
            archive.  If the <b>-m </b>option is specified, then the <b>epilogue</b>
            and <b>prologue </b>test is skipped and a <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>record will always
            be inserted at the end of each <i>input</i> archive (except the
            last).  This is the original behaviour for <b>pmlogextract</b>.

       <b>-S </b><i>starttime</i>, <b>--start</b>=<i>starttime</i>
            Define the start of a time window to restrict the records
            processed; refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>.  See also the <b>-w </b>option.

       <b>-s </b><i>samples</i>, <b>--samples</b>=<i>samples</i>
            The argument <i>samples</i> defines the number of samples (or
            records) to be written to <i>output</i>.  If <i>samples</i> is 0 or <b>-s </b>is
            not specified, <b>pmlogextract </b>will continue until the end of
            all the <i>input</i> archives or until the end of the time window
            as specified by <b>-T</b>, whichever comes first.  The <b>-s </b>option
            will override the <b>-T </b>option if it occurs sooner.

       <b>-T </b><i>endtime</i>, <b>--finish</b>=<i>endtime</i>
            Define the end of a time window to restrict the records
            processed; refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>.  See also the <b>-w </b>option.

       <b>-V </b><i>version</i>, <b>--outputversion</b>=<i>version</i>
            Each PCP archive has a version for the physical record
            format, currently 2 or 3.  By default, the <i>output</i> archive is
            created with a version equal to the <b>maximum </b>of the version
            of the <i>input</i> archives.  The <b>-V </b>option may be used to
            explicitly force the version for <i>output</i>, provided <i>version</i> is
            no smaller than the archive version that would have been
            chosen by the default rule.

            For example, specifying <b>-V 3 </b>may be used to produce a
            version 3 <i>output</i> archive from <i>input</i> archives that could be a
            mixture of version 2 and/or version 3.

       <b>-v </b><i>volsamples</i>
            The <i>output</i> archive is potentially a multi-volume data set,
            and the <b>-v </b>option causes <b>pmlogextract </b>to start a new volume
            after <i>volsamples</i> records have been written to the archive.

            Independent of any <b>-v </b>option, each volume of an archive is
            limited to no more than 2^31 bytes, so <b>pmlogextract </b>will
            automatically create a new volume for the archive before
            this limit is reached.

       <b>-w   </b>Where <b>-S </b>and <b>-T </b>specify a time window within the same day,
            the <b>-w </b>flag will cause the data within the time window to be
            extracted, for <b>every </b>day in the archive.  For example, the
            options <b>-w -S @11:00 -T @15:00 </b>specify that <b>pmlogextract</b>
            should include archive records only for the periods from
            11am to 3pm on each day.  When <b>-w </b>is used, the <i>output</i>
            archive will contain <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>records to indicate the temporal
            discontinuity between the end of one time window and the
            start of the next.

       <b>-x   </b>It is expected that the metadata (name, PMID, type,
            semantics and units) for each metric will be consistent
            across all of the <i>input</i> PCP archive(s) in which that metric
            appears.  In rare cases, e.g. in development, in QA and when
            a PMDA is upgraded, this may not be the case and
            <b>pmlogextract </b>will report the issue and abort without
            creating the <i>output</i> archive.  This is done so the problem
            can be fixed with <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> before retrying the merge.
            In unattended or QA environments it may be preferable to
            force the merge and omit the metrics with the mismatched
            metadata.  The <b>-x </b>option does this.

       <b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i>, <b>--timezone</b>=<i>timezone</i>
            Use <i>timezone</i> when displaying the date and time in
            diagnostics.  <i>Timezone</i> is in the format of the environment
            variable <b>TZ </b>as described in <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.  The default is to
            initially use the timezone of the local host.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--hostzone</b>
            Use the local timezone of the host from the <i>input</i> archive(s)
            when displaying the date and time in diagnostics.  The
            default is to initially use the timezone of the local host.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>configfile</i> contains metrics of interest - only those metrics
       (or instances) mentioned explicitly or implicitly in the
       configuration file will be included in the <i>output</i> archive.  Each
       specification must begin on a new line, and may span multiple
       lines in the configuration file.  Instances may also be
       specified, but they are optional.  The format for each
       specification is

               metric
       or
               metric <b>[ </b>instance ... <b>]</b>

       where <i>metric</i> may be a leaf or a non-leaf name of a metric in the
       Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS, see <a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>).  If a <i>metric</i>
       refers to a non-leaf node in the PMNS, <b>pmlogextract </b>will
       recursively descend the PMNS and include all metrics
       corresponding to descendent leaf nodes.

       Instances are optional and are specified as a list space (or
       comma) separated of <i>instance</i> identifiers, with the list enclosed
       by square brackets.  Each <i>instance</i> identifier may be a number or
       a string (enclosed in single or double quotes).  <i>instance</i>
       identifiers that are numbers are assumed to be internal instance
       identifiers, else the string values are assumed to be external
       instance identifiers; see <a href="../man3/pmgetindom.3.html">pmGetInDom(3)</a> for more information.  If
       no instances are given, then <b>all </b>instances of the associated
       metric(s) will be extracted.

       Any additional white space is ignored and comments may be added
       with a `#' prefix.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       This is an example of a valid <i>configfile</i>:

               #
               # config file for pmlogextract
               #

               kernel.all.cpu
               kernel.percpu.cpu.sys ["cpu0","cpu1"]
               disk.dev ["dks0d1"]
</pre> <h2>
MARK RECORDS </h2>
<pre>
       When more than one <i>input</i> archive contributes performance data to
       the <i>output</i> archive, then <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>records may be inserted to
       indicate a possible temporal discontinuity in the performance
       data.

       A <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>record contains a timestamp and no performance data and
       is used to indicate that there is a time period in the PCP
       archive where we do not know the values of <b>any </b>performance
       metrics, because there was no <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> collecting performance
       data during this period.  Since these periods are often
       associated with the restart of a service or <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> or a system
       reboot, there may be considerable doubt as to the continuity of
       performance data across this time period.

       Most current archives are created with a <b>prologue </b>record at the
       beginning and an <b>epilogue </b>record at the end.  These records
       identify the state of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> at the time, and may be used by
       <b>pmlogextract </b>to determine that there is no discontinuity between
       the end of one archive and the next output record, and as a
       consequence the <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>record can safely be omitted from the
       <i>output</i> archive.

       The rationale behind <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>records may be demonstrated with an
       example.  Consider one <i>input</i> archive that starts at 00:10 and
       ends at 09:15 on the same day, and another <i>input</i> archive that
       starts at 09:20 on the same day and ends at 00:10 the following
       morning.  This would be a very common case for archives managed
       and rotated by <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> and <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a>.

       The <i>output</i> archive created by <b>pmlogextract </b>would contain:
       00:10.000    first record from first input archive
       ...
       09:15.000    last record from first input archive
       09:15.001    &lt;mark&gt; record
       09:20.000    first record from second input archive
       ...
       01:10.000    last record from second input archive

       The time period where the performance data is missing starts just
       after 09:15 and ends just before 09:20.  When the <i>output</i> archive
       is processed with any of the PCP reporting tools, the <b>&lt;mark&gt;</b>
       record is used to indicate a period of missing data.  For example
       using the <i>output</i> archive above, imagine one was reporting the
       average I/O rate at 30 minute intervals aligned on the hour and
       half-hour.  The I/O count metric is a counter, so the average I/O
       rate requires two valid values from consecutive sample times.
       There would be values for all the intervals ending at 09:00, then
       no values at 09:30 because of the <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>record, then no values
       at 10:00 because the ``prior'' value at 09:30 is not available,
       then the rate would be reported again at 10:30 and continue every
       30 minutes until the last reported value at 01:00.

       The presence of <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>records in a PCP archive can be
       established using <a href="pmlogdump.1.html">pmlogdump(1)</a> where a timestamp and the
       annotation <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>is used to indicate a <b>&lt;mark&gt; </b>record.
</pre> <h2>
METADATA CHECKS </h2>
<pre>
       When more than one <i>input</i> archive is specified, <b>pmlogextract</b>
       performs a number of checks to ensure the metadata is consistent
       for metrics appearing in more than one of the <i>input</i> archives.
       These checks include:

       * metric data type is the same
       * metric semantics are the same
       * metric units are the same
       * metric is either always singular or always has the same
         instance domain
       * metrics with the same name have the same PMID
       * metrics with the same PMID have the same name

       If any of these checks fail, <b>pmlogextract </b>reports the details and
       aborts without creating the <i>output</i> archive.

       To address these semantic issues, use <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> to
       translate the <i>input</i> archives into equivalent archives with
       consistent metadata before using <b>pmlogextract</b>.

       Refer to the <b>-x </b>and <b>-d </b>command line options above for
       alternatives to the default handling of errors during metadata
       checks.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>prologue </b>metrics (pmcd.pmlogger.archive, pmcd.pmlogger.host,
       and pmcd.pmlogger.port), which are automatically recorded by
       <b>pmlogger </b>at the start of the archive, may not be present in the
       archive output by <b>pmlogextract</b>.  These metrics are only relevant
       while the archive is being created, and have no significance once
       recording has finished.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       All error conditions detected by <b>pmlogextract </b>are reported on
       <i>stderr</i> with textual (if sometimes terse) explanation.

       If one of the <i>input</i> archives contains no archive records then an
       ``empty archive'' warning is issued and that archive is skipped.

       Should one of the <i>input</i> archive(s) be corrupted (this can happen
       if the <b>pmlogger </b>instance writing the archive suddenly dies), then
       <b>pmlogextract </b>will detect and report the position of the
       corruption in the file, and any subsequent information from that
       archive will not be processed.

       If any error is detected, <b>pmlogextract </b>will exit with a non-zero
       status.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       For each of the <i>input</i> and <i>output</i> archive, several physical files
       are used.

       <i>archive</i><b>.meta</b>
            metadata (metric descriptions, instance domains, etc.) for
            the archive

       <i>archive</i><b>.0</b>
            initial volume of metrics values (subsequent volumes have
            suffixes <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, ...) - for <i>input</i> these files may have been
            previously compressed with <b>bzip2</b>(1) or <b>gzip</b>(1) and thus may
            have an additional <b>.bz2 </b>or <b>.gz </b>suffix.

       <i>archive</i><b>.index</b>
            temporal index to support rapid random access to the other
            files in the archive.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
       <a href="../man3/pmgetoptions.3.html">pmGetOptions(3)</a>.
