NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-send-pack - Push objects over Git protocol to another
       repository
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git send-pack</i> [--mirror] [--dry-run] [--force]
                       [--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;]
                       [--verbose] [--thin] [--atomic]
                       [--[no-]signed | --signed=(true|false|if-asked)]
                       [&lt;host&gt;:]&lt;directory&gt; (--all | &lt;ref&gt;...)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Usually you would want to use <i>git push</i>, which is a higher-level
       wrapper of this command, instead. See <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>.

       Invokes <i>git-receive-pack</i> on a possibly remote repository, and
       updates it from the current repository, sending named refs.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;
           Path to the <i>git-receive-pack</i> program on the remote end.
           Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote repository over
           ssh, and you do not have the program in a directory on the
           default $PATH.

       --exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;
           Same as --receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;.

       --all
           Instead of explicitly specifying which refs to update, update
           all heads that locally exist.

       --stdin
           Take the list of refs from stdin, one per line. If there are
           refs specified on the command line in addition to this
           option, then the refs from stdin are processed after those on
           the command line.

           If <b>--stateless-rpc </b>is specified together with this option
           then the list of refs must be in packet format (pkt-line).
           Each ref must be in a separate packet, and the list must end
           with a flush packet.

       --dry-run
           Do everything except actually send the updates.

       --force
           Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is
           not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. This
           flag disables the check. This means that the remote
           repository can lose commits; use it with care.

       --verbose
           Run verbosely.

       --thin
           Send a "thin" pack, which records objects in deltified form
           based on objects not included in the pack to reduce network
           traffic.

       --atomic
           Use an atomic transaction for updating the refs. If any of
           the refs fails to update then the entire push will fail
           without changing any refs.

       --[no-]signed, --signed=(true|false|if-asked)
           GPG-sign the push request to update refs on the receiving
           side, to allow it to be checked by the hooks and/or be
           logged. If <b>false </b>or <b>--no-signed</b>, no signing will be
           attempted. If <b>true </b>or <b>--signed</b>, the push will fail if the
           server does not support signed pushes. If set to <b>if-asked</b>,
           sign if and only if the server supports signed pushes. The
           push will also fail if the actual call to <b>gpg --sign </b>fails.
           See <a href="git-receive-pack.1.html">git-receive-pack(1)</a> for the details on the receiving end.

       --push-option=&lt;string&gt;
           Pass the specified string as a push option for consumption by
           hooks on the server side. If the server doesn’t support push
           options, error out. See <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> and <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a> for
           details.

       &lt;host&gt;
           A remote host to house the repository. When this part is
           specified, <i>git-receive-pack</i> is invoked via ssh.

       &lt;directory&gt;
           The repository to update.

       &lt;ref&gt;...
           The remote refs to update.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING THE REFS </h2>
<pre>
       There are three ways to specify which refs to update on the
       remote end.

       With the <b>--all </b>flag, all refs that exist locally are transferred
       to the remote side. You cannot specify any <i>&lt;ref&gt;</i> if you use this
       flag.

       Without <b>--all </b>and without any <i>&lt;ref&gt;</i>, the heads that exist both on
       the local side and on the remote side are updated.

       When one or more <i>&lt;ref&gt;</i> are specified explicitly (whether on the
       command line or via <b>--stdin</b>), it can be either a single pattern,
       or a pair of such patterns separated by a colon ":" (this means
       that a ref name cannot have a colon in it). A single pattern
       <i>&lt;name&gt;</i> is just shorthand for <i>&lt;name&gt;:&lt;name&gt;</i>.

       Each pattern pair consists of the source side (before the colon)
       and the destination side (after the colon). The ref to be pushed
       is determined by finding a match that matches the source side,
       and where it is pushed is determined by using the destination
       side. The rules used to match a ref are the same rules used by
       <i>git rev-parse</i> to resolve a symbolic ref name. See
       <a href="git-rev-parse.1.html">git-rev-parse(1)</a>.

       •   It is an error if &lt;src&gt; does not match exactly one of the
           local refs.

       •   It is an error if &lt;dst&gt; matches more than one remote ref.

       •   If &lt;dst&gt; does not match any remote ref, either

           •   it has to start with "refs/"; &lt;dst&gt; is used as the
               destination literally in this case.

           •   &lt;src&gt; == &lt;dst&gt; and the ref that matched the &lt;src&gt; must
               not exist in the set of remote refs; the ref matched
               &lt;src&gt; locally is used as the name of the destination.

       Without <b>--force</b>, the &lt;src&gt; ref is stored at the remote only if
       &lt;dst&gt; does not exist, or &lt;dst&gt; is a proper subset (i.e. an
       ancestor) of &lt;src&gt;. This check, known as the "fast-forward
       check", is performed to avoid accidentally overwriting the remote
       ref and losing other people’s commits from there.

       With <b>--force</b>, the fast-forward check is disabled for all refs.

       Optionally, a &lt;ref&gt; parameter can be prefixed with a plus <i>+</i> sign
       to disable the fast-forward check only on that ref.
