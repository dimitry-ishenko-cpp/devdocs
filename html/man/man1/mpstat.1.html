NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mpstat - Report processors related statistics.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mpstat [ -A ] [ --dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 } ] [ -H ] [ -n ] [ -u ] [ -T ]</b>
       <b>[ -V ] [ -I { </b><i>keyword</i><b>[,...] | ALL } ] [ -N { </b><i>node_list</i> <b>| ALL } ]</b>
       <b>[ -o JSON ] [ -P { </b><i>cpu_list</i> <b>| ALL } ] [ </b><i>interval</i> <b>[ </b><i>count</i> <b>] ]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>mpstat </b>command writes to standard output activities for each
       available processor, processor 0 being the first one.  Global
       average activities among all processors are also reported.  The
       <b>mpstat </b>command can be used on both SMP and UP machines, but in
       the latter, only global average activities will be printed. If no
       activity has been selected, then the default report is the CPU
       utilization report.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report.  A value of 0 (or no parameters at all)
       indicates that processors statistics are to be reported for the
       time since system startup (boot). The <i>count</i> parameter can be
       specified in conjunction with the <i>interval</i> parameter if this one
       is not set to zero. The value of <i>count</i> determines the number of
       reports generated at <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i>
       parameter is specified without the <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>mpstat</b>
       command generates reports continuously.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-A     </b>This option is equivalent to specifying <b>-n -u -I ALL</b>.
              This option also implies specifying <b>-N ALL -P ALL </b>unless
              these options are explicitly set on the command line.

       <b>--dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 }</b>
              Specify the number of decimal places to use (0 to 2,
              default value is 2).

       <b>-H     </b>Also detect and display statistics for physically
              hotplugged vCPUs.

       <b>-I { </b><i>keyword</i><b>[,...] | ALL }</b>
              Report interrupts statistics.  Possible <i>keywords</i> are <b>CPU</b>,
              <b>SCPU</b>, and <b>SUM</b>.

              With the <b>CPU </b>keyword, the number of each individual
              interrupt received per second by the CPU or CPUs is
              displayed. Interrupts are those listed in <i>/proc/interrupts</i>
              file.

              With the <b>SCPU </b>keyword, the number of each individual
              software interrupt received per second by the CPU or CPUs
              is displayed. This option works only with kernels 2.6.31
              and later. Software interrupts are those listed in
              <i>/proc/softirqs</i> file.

              With the <b>SUM </b>keyword, the <b>mpstat </b>command reports the total
              number of interrupts per processor.  The following values
              are displayed:

              CPU    Processor number. The keyword <b>all </b>indicates that
                     statistics are calculated as averages among all
                     processors.

              intr/s Show the total number of interrupts received per
                     second by the CPU or CPUs.

              The <b>ALL </b>keyword is equivalent to specifying all the
              keywords above and therefore all the interrupts statistics
              are displayed.

       <b>-N { </b><i>node_list</i> <b>| ALL }</b>
              Indicate the NUMA nodes for which statistics are to be
              reported.  <i>node_list</i> is a list of comma-separated values
              or range of values (e.g., <b>0,2,4-7,12-</b>). Note that node <b>all</b>
              is the global average among all nodes. The <b>ALL </b>keyword
              indicates that statistics are to be reported for all
              nodes.

       <b>-n     </b>Report summary CPU statistics based on NUMA node
              placement. The following values are displayed:

              NODE   Logical NUMA node number. The keyword <b>all </b>indicates
                     that statistics are calculated as averages among
                     all nodes.

              All the other fields are the same as those displayed with
              option <b>-u </b>(see below).

       <b>-o JSON</b>
              Display the statistics in JSON (JavaScript Object
              Notation) format.  JSON output field order is undefined,
              and new fields may be added in the future.

       <b>-P { </b><i>cpu_list</i> <b>| ALL }</b>
              Indicate the processors for which statistics are to be
              reported.  <i>cpu_list</i> is a list of comma-separated values or
              range of values (e.g., <b>0,2,4-7,12-</b>).  Note that processor
              0 is the first processor, and processor <b>all </b>is the global
              average among all processors.  The <b>ALL </b>keyword indicates
              that statistics are to be reported for all processors.
              Offline processors are not displayed.

       <b>-T     </b>Display topology elements in the CPU report (see option <b>-u</b>
              below). The following elements are displayed:

              CORE   Logical core number.

              SOCK   Logical socket number.

              NODE   Logical NUMA node number.

       <b>-u     </b>Report CPU utilization. The following values are
              displayed:

              CPU    Processor number. The keyword <i>all</i> indicates that
                     statistics are calculated as averages among all
                     processors.

              %usr   Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
                     occurred while executing at the user level
                     (application).

              %nice  Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
                     occurred while executing at the user level with
                     nice priority.

              %sys   Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
                     occurred while executing at the system level
                     (kernel). Note that this does not include time
                     spent servicing hardware and software interrupts.

              %iowait
                     Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
                     were idle during which the system had an
                     outstanding disk I/O request.

              %irq   Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                     CPUs to service hardware interrupts.

              %soft  Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                     CPUs to service software interrupts.

              %steal Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary
                     wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the
                     hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.

              %guest Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                     CPUs to run a virtual processor.

              %gnice Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                     CPUs to run a niced guest.

              %idle  Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
                     were idle and the system did not have an
                     outstanding disk I/O request.

       <b>-V     </b>Print version number then exit.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>mpstat </b>command takes into account the following environment
       variable:

       <b>S_COLORS</b>
              By default statistics are displayed in color when the
              output is connected to a terminal.  Use this variable to
              change the settings. Possible values for this variable are
              <i>never</i>, <i>always</i> or <i>auto</i> (the latter is equivalent to the
              default settings).
              Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some
              other color) used to display a value is not indicative of
              any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only
              indicates different ranges of values.

       <b>S_COLORS_SGR</b>
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display
              statistics on the terminal.  Its value is a colon-
              separated list of capabilities that defaults to
              <b>I=32;22:N=34;1:W=35;1:X=31;1:Z=34;22</b>.  Supported
              capabilities are:

              <b>I=     </b>SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for CPU
                     number.

              <b>N=     </b>SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.

              <b>W= </b>(or <b>M=</b>)
                     SGR substring for percentage values in the range
                     from 75% to 90% (or in the range 10% to 25%
                     depending on the metric's meaning).

              <b>X= </b>(or <b>H=</b>)
                     SGR substring for percentage values greater than or
                     equal to 90% (or lower than or equal to 10%
                     depending on the metric's meaning).

              <b>Z=     </b>SGR substring for zero values.

       <b>S_TIME_FORMAT</b>
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>ISO </b>then the
              current locale will be ignored when printing the date in
              the report header.  The <b>mpstat </b>command will use the ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp will also
              be compliant with ISO 8601 format.
