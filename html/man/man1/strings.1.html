DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For each <i>file</i> given, GNU <b>strings </b>prints the printable character
       sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number
       given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable
       character.

       Depending upon how the strings program was configured it will
       default to either displaying all the printable sequences that it
       can find in each file, or only those sequences that are in
       loadable, initialized data sections.  If the file type is
       unrecognizable, or if strings is reading from stdin then it will
       always display all of the printable sequences that it can find.

       For backwards compatibility any file that occurs after a command-
       line option of just <b>- </b>will also be scanned in full, regardless of
       the presence of any <b>-d </b>option.

       <b>strings </b>is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text
       files.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--all</b>
       <b>-   </b>Scan the whole file, regardless of what sections it contains
           or whether those sections are loaded or initialized.
           Normally this is the default behaviour, but strings can be
           configured so that the <b>-d </b>is the default instead.

           The <b>- </b>option is position dependent and forces strings to
           perform full scans of any file that is mentioned after the <b>-</b>
           on the command line, even if the <b>-d </b>option has been
           specified.

       <b>-d</b>
       <b>--data</b>
           Only print strings from initialized, loaded data sections in
           the file.  This may reduce the amount of garbage in the
           output, but it also exposes the strings program to any
           security flaws that may be present in the BFD library used to
           scan and load sections.  Strings can be configured so that
           this option is the default behaviour.  In such cases the <b>-a</b>
           option can be used to avoid using the BFD library and instead
           just print all of the strings found in the file.

       <b>-f</b>
       <b>--print-file-name</b>
           Print the name of the file before each string.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print a summary of the program usage on the standard output
           and exit.

       <b>-</b><i>min-len</i>
       <b>-n </b><i>min-len</i>
       <b>--bytes=</b><i>min-len</i>
           Print sequences of displayable characters that are at least
           <i>min-len</i> characters long.  If not specified a default minimum
           length of 4 is used.  The distinction between displayable and
           non-displayable characters depends upon the setting of the <b>-e</b>
           and <b>-U </b>options.  Sequences are always terminated at control
           characters such as new-line and carriage-return, but not the
           tab character.

       <b>-o  </b>Like <b>-t o</b>.  Some other versions of <b>strings </b>have <b>-o </b>act like
           <b>-t d </b>instead.  Since we can not be compatible with both ways,
           we simply chose one.

       <b>-t </b><i>radix</i>
       <b>--radix=</b><i>radix</i>
           Print the offset within the file before each string.  The
           single character argument specifies the radix of the
           offset---<b>o </b>for octal, <b>x </b>for hexadecimal, or <b>d </b>for decimal.

       <b>-e </b><i>encoding</i>
       <b>--encoding=</b><i>encoding</i>
           Select the character encoding of the strings that are to be
           found.  Possible values for <i>encoding</i> are: <b>s </b>=
           single-7-bit-byte characters (default), <b>S </b>= single-8-bit-byte
           characters, <b>b </b>= 16-bit bigendian, <b>l </b>= 16-bit littleendian, <b>B</b>
           = 32-bit bigendian, <b>L </b>= 32-bit littleendian.  Useful for
           finding wide character strings. (<b>l </b>and <b>b </b>apply to, for
           example, Unicode UTF-16/UCS-2 encodings).

       <b>-U </b><i>[d|i|l|e|x|h]</i>
       <b>--unicode=</b><i>[default|invalid|locale|escape|hex|highlight]</i>
           Controls the display of UTF-8 encoded multibyte characters in
           strings.  The default (<b>--unicode=default</b>) is to give them no
           special treatment, and instead rely upon the setting of the
           <b>--encoding </b>option.  The other values for this option
           automatically enable <b>--encoding=S</b>.

           The <b>--unicode=invalid </b>option treats them as non-graphic
           characters and hence not part of a valid string.  All the
           remaining options treat them as valid string characters.

           The <b>--unicode=locale </b>option displays them in the current
           locale, which may or may not support UTF-8 encoding.  The
           <b>--unicode=hex </b>option displays them as hex byte sequences
           enclosed between <i>&lt;&gt;</i> characters.  The <b>--unicode=escape </b>option
           displays them as escape sequences (<i>\uxxxx</i>) and the
           <b>--unicode=highlight </b>option displays them as escape sequences
           highlighted in red (if supported by the output device).  The
           colouring is intended to draw attention to the presence of
           unicode sequences where they might not be expected.

       <b>-T </b><i>bfdname</i>
       <b>--target=</b><i>bfdname</i>
           Specify an object code format other than your system's
           default format.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Print the program version number on the standard output and
           exit.

       <b>-w</b>
       <b>--include-all-whitespace</b>
           By default tab and space characters are included in the
           strings that are displayed, but other whitespace characters,
           such a newlines and carriage returns, are not.  The <b>-w </b>option
           changes this so that all whitespace characters are considered
           to be part of a string.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--output-separator</b>
           By default, output strings are delimited by a new-line. This
           option allows you to supply any string to be used as the
           output record separator.  Useful with
           --include-all-whitespace where strings may contain new-lines
           internally.

       <b>@</b><i>file</i>
           Read command-line options from <i>file</i>.  The options read are
           inserted in place of the original @<i>file</i> option.  If <i>file</i> does
           not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
           literally, and not removed.

           Options in <i>file</i> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
           character may be included in an option by surrounding the
           entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any
           character (including a backslash) may be included by
           prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The
           <i>file</i> may itself contain additional @<i>file</i> options; any such
           options will be processed recursively.
