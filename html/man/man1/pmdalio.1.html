NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdalio </b>- Linux LIO subsystem PMDA
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdalio </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metric values about the Linux I/O target subsystem, which
       provides for protocols like iSCSI, FCP, FCoE.  These allow
       storage available on one host to be exported and consumed by
       other hosts using industry standard protocols.

       This PMDA exports summary metrics which are performance value
       aggregations and configuration per LIO target instance.
       Additionally, it provides per LUN performance metrics including
       IOPS, and READ and WRITE throughput.

       The LIO configuration is maintained within the kernel's <b>configfs</b>
       virtual filesystem.  The <i>python-rtslib</i> module provides an
       interface to <b>configfs</b>, allowing tools like <b>pmdalio </b>to interact
       with the settings and metadata held in <b>configfs</b>.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       Install the lio PMDA by using the Install script as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, do the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdalio </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio/Install</b>
           installation script for the <b>pmdalio </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio/Remove</b>
           undo installation script for the <b>pmdalio </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lio.log</b>
           default log file for error messages from <b>pmdalio</b>
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by <b>PCP</b>. On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
