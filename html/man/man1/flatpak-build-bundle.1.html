NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-build-bundle - Create a single-file bundle from a local
       repository
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak build-bundle </b>[OPTION...] LOCATION FILENAME NAME [BRANCH]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Creates a single-file named FILENAME for the application (or
       runtime) named NAME in the repository at LOCATION. If a BRANCH is
       specified, this branch of the application is used.

       The collection ID set on the repository at LOCATION (if set) will
       be used for the bundle.

       Unless <b>--oci </b>is used, the format of the bundle file is that of an
       ostree static delta (against an empty base) with some flatpak
       specific metadata for the application icons and appdata.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>--repo-url=URL</b>
           The URL for the repository from which the application can be
           updated. Installing the bundle will automatically configure a
           remote for this URL.

       <b>--runtime-repo=URL</b>
           The URL for a .flatpakrepo file that contains the information
           about the repository that supplies the runtimes required by
           the app.

           Add the GPG key from FILE (use - for stdin).

       <b>--gpg-homedir=PATH</b>
           GPG Homedir to use when looking for keyrings.

           The OSTree commit to create a delta bundle from.

       <b>--oci</b>
           Export to an OCI image instead of a Flatpak bundle.
