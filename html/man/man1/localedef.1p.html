NAME </h2>
<pre>
       localedef — define locale environment
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       localedef <b>[</b>-c<b>] [</b>-f <i>charmap</i><b>] [</b>-i <i>sourcefile</i><b>] [</b>-u <i>code_set_name</i><b>] </b><i>name</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>localedef</i> utility shall convert source definitions for locale
       categories into a format usable by the functions and utilities
       whose operational behavior is determined by the setting of the
       locale environment variables defined in the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 7</i>, <i>Locale</i>.  It is implementation-
       defined whether users have the capability to create new locales,
       in addition to those supplied by the implementation. If the
       symbolic constant POSIX2_LOCALEDEF is defined, the system
       supports the creation of new locales.  On XSI-conformant systems,
       the symbolic constant POSIX2_LOCALEDEF shall be defined.

       The utility shall read source definitions for one or more locale
       categories belonging to the same locale from the file named in
       the <b>-i </b>option (if specified) or from standard input.

       The <i>name</i> operand identifies the target locale. The utility shall
       support the creation of <i>public</i>, or generally accessible locales,
       as well as <i>private</i>, or restricted-access locales. Implementations
       may restrict the capability to create or modify public locales to
       users with appropriate privileges.

       Each category source definition shall be identified by the
       corresponding environment variable name and terminated by an <b>END</b>
       <i>category-name</i> statement. The following categories shall be
       supported. In addition, the input may contain source for
       implementation-defined categories.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Defines character classification and case conversion.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Defines collation rules.

       <i>LC_MONETARY</i>
                 Defines the format and symbols used in formatting of
                 monetary information.

       <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>
                 Defines the decimal delimiter, grouping, and grouping
                 symbol for non-monetary numeric editing.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Defines the format and content of date and time
                 information.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Defines the format and values of affirmative and
                 negative responses.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>localedef</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c        </b>Create permanent output even if warning messages have
                 been issued.

       <b>-f </b><i>charmap</i>
                 Specify the pathname of a file containing a mapping of
                 character symbols and collating element symbols to
                 actual character encodings.  The format of the <i>charmap</i>
                 is described in the Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 6.4</i>, <i>Character Set Description</i>
                 <i>File</i>.  The application shall ensure that this option is
                 specified if symbolic names (other than collating
                 symbols defined in a <b>collating-symbol </b>keyword) are
                 used. If the <b>-f </b>option is not present, an
                 implementation-defined character mapping shall be used.

       <b>-i </b><i>inputfile</i>
                 The pathname of a file containing the source
                 definitions. If this option is not present, source
                 definitions shall be read from standard input. The
                 format of the <i>inputfile</i> is described in the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 7.3</i>, <i>Locale</i>
                 <i>Definition</i>.

       <b>-u </b><i>code_set_name</i>
                 Specify the name of a codeset used as the target
                 mapping of character symbols and collating element
                 symbols whose encoding values are defined in terms of
                 the ISO/IEC 10646‐1:2000 standard position constant
                 values.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>name</i>      Identifies the locale; see the Base Definitions volume
                 of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 7</i>, <i>Locale</i> for a description of
                 the use of this name. If the name contains one or more
                 &lt;slash&gt; characters, <i>name</i> shall be interpreted as a
                 pathname where the created locale definitions shall be
                 stored. If <i>name</i> does not contain any &lt;slash&gt;
                 characters, the interpretation of the name is
                 implementation-defined and the locale shall be public.
                 The ability to create public locales in this way may be
                 restricted to users with appropriate privileges. (As a
                 consequence of specifying one <i>name</i>, although several
                 categories can be processed in one execution, only
                 categories belonging to the same locale can be
                 processed.)
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Unless the <b>-i </b>option is specified, the standard input shall be a
       text file containing one or more locale category source
       definitions, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 7.3</i>, <i>Locale Definition</i>.  When lines are
       continued using the escape character mechanism, there is no limit
       to the length of the accumulated continued line.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The character set mapping file specified as the <i>charmap</i> option-
       argument is described in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 6.4</i>, <i>Character Set Description File</i>.  If a
       locale category source definition contains a <b>copy </b>statement, as
       defined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter</i>
       <i>7</i>, <i>Locale</i>, and the <b>copy </b>statement names a valid, existing locale,
       then <i>localedef</i> shall behave as if the source definition had
       contained a valid category source definition for the named
       locale.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>localedef</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 (This variable has no affect on <i>localedef</i>; the POSIX
                 locale is used for this category.)

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files). This variable
                 has no affect on the processing of <i>localedef</i> input
                 data; the POSIX locale is used for this purpose,
                 regardless of the value of this variable.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The utility shall report all categories successfully processed,
       in an unspecified format.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The format of the created output is unspecified. If the <i>name</i>
       operand does not contain a &lt;slash&gt;, the existence of an output
       file for the locale is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       When the <b>-u </b>option is used, the <i>code_set_name</i> option-argument
       shall be interpreted as an implementation-defined name of a
       codeset to which the ISO/IEC 10646‐1:2000 standard position
       constant values shall be converted via an implementation-defined
       method. Both the ISO/IEC 10646‐1:2000 standard position constant
       values and other formats (decimal, hexadecimal, or octal) shall
       be valid as encoding values within the <i>charmap</i> file. The codeset
       represented by the implementation-defined name can be any codeset
       that is supported by the implementation.

       When conflicts occur between the <i>charmap</i> specification of
       &lt;<i>code_set_name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>mb_cur_max</i>&gt;, or &lt;<i>mb_cur_min</i>&gt; and the
       implementation-defined interpretation of these respective items
       for the codeset represented by the <b>-u </b>option-argument
       <i>code_set_name</i>, the result is unspecified.

       When conflicts occur between the <i>charmap</i> encoding values
       specified for symbolic names of characters of the portable
       character set and the implementation-defined assignment of
       character encoding values, the result is unspecified.

       If a non-printable character in the <i>charmap</i> has a width specified
       that is not <b>-1</b>, the result will be undefined.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    No errors occurred and the locales were successfully
             created.

        1    Warnings occurred and the locales were successfully
             created.

        2    The locale specification exceeded implementation limits or
             the coded character set or sets used were not supported by
             the implementation, and no locale was created.

        3    The capability to create new locales is not supported by
             the implementation.

       &gt;3    Warnings or errors occurred and no output was created.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If an error is detected, no permanent output shall be created.

       If warnings occur, permanent output shall be created if the <b>-c</b>
       option was specified. The following conditions shall cause
       warning messages to be issued:

        *  If a symbolic name not found in the <i>charmap</i> file is used for
           the descriptions of the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> or <i>LC_COLLATE</i> categories
           (for other categories, this shall be an error condition).

        *  If the number of operands to the <b>order </b>keyword exceeds the
           {COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX} limit.

        *  If optional keywords not supported by the implementation are
           present in the source.

       Other implementation-defined conditions may also cause warnings.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>charmap</i> definition is optional, and is contained outside the
       locale definition. This allows both completely self-defined
       source files, and generic sources (applicable to more than one
       codeset). To aid portability, all <i>charmap</i> definitions must use
       the same symbolic names for the portable character set. As
       explained in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section</i>
       <i>6.4</i>, <i>Character Set Description File</i>, it is implementation-defined
       whether or not users or applications can provide additional
       character set description files. Therefore, the <b>-f </b>option might
       be operable only when an implementation-defined <i>charmap</i> is named.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The output produced by the <i>localedef</i> utility is implementation-
       defined. The <i>name</i> operand is used to identify the specific
       locale. (As a consequence, although several categories can be
       processed in one execution, only categories belonging to the same
       locale can be processed.)
