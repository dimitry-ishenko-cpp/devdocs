PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       qmsg — send message to batch jobs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       qmsg <b>[</b>-EO<b>] </b><i>message_string job_identifier</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       To send a message to a batch job is to request that a server
       write a message string into one or more output files of the batch
       job. A message is sent to a batch job by a request to the batch
       server that manages the batch job. The <i>qmsg</i> utility is a user-
       accessible batch client that requests the sending of messages to
       one or more batch jobs.

       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall write messages into the files of batch
       jobs by sending a <i>Job Message Request</i> to the batch server that
       manages the batch job. The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall not directly write
       the message into the files of the batch job.

       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall send a <i>Job Message Request</i> for those batch
       jobs, and only those batch jobs, for which a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       is presented to the utility.

       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall send <i>Job Message Request</i>s for batch jobs
       in the order in which their batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented
       to the utility.

       If the <i>qmsg</i> utility fails to process any batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall not exit before a <i>Job Message Request</i> has
       been sent to the server that manages the batch job that
       corresponds to each successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-E        </b>Specify that the message is written to the standard
                 error of each batch job.

                 The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall write the message into the
                 standard error of the batch job.

       <b>-O        </b>Specify that the message is written to the standard
                 output of each batch job.

                 The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall write the message into the
                 standard output of the batch job.

       If neither the <b>-O </b>nor the <b>-E </b>option is presented to the <i>qmsg</i>
       utility, the utility shall write the message into an
       implementation-defined file. The conformance document for the
       implementation shall describe the name and location of the
       implementation-defined file. If both the <b>-O </b>and the <b>-E </b>options
       are presented to the <i>qmsg</i> utility, then the utility shall write
       the messages to both standard output and standard error.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qmsg</i> utility shall accept a minimum of two operands,
       <i>message_string</i> and one or more batch <i>job_identifier</i>s.

       The <i>message_string</i> operand shall be the string to be written to
       one or more output files of the batch job followed by a
       &lt;newline&gt;.  If the string contains &lt;blank&gt; characters, then the
       application shall ensure that the string is quoted. The
       <i>message_string</i> shall be encoded in the portable character set
       (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 6.1</i>,
       <i>Portable Character Set</i>).

       All remaining operands are batch <i>job_identifier</i>s that conform to
       the syntax for a batch <i>job_identifier</i> (see <i>Section 3.3.1</i>, <i>Batch</i>
       <i>Job Identifier</i>).
</pre> <h2>

</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>qmsg</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LOGNAME</i>   Determine the login name of the user.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <i>qmsg</i> utility shall not
       be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
       the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
       batch <i>job_identifier</i> does not exist on the server. Whether or not
       the <i>qmsg</i> utility waits to output the diagnostic message while
       attempting to locate the job on other servers is implementation-
       defined.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qmsg</i> utility allows users to write messages into the output
       files of running jobs. Users, including operators and
       administrators, have a number of occasions when they want to
       place messages in the output files of a batch job. For example,
       if a disk that is being used by a batch job is showing errors,
       the operator might note this in the standard error stream of the
       batch job.

       The options of the <i>qmsg</i> utility provide users with the means of
       placing the message in the output stream of their choice. The
       default output stream for the message—if the user does not
       designate an output stream—is implementation-defined, since many
       implementations will provide, as an extension to this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, a log file that shows the history of utility
       execution.

       If users wish to send a message to a set of jobs that meet a
       selection criteria, the <i>qselect</i> utility can be used to acquire
       the appropriate list of job identifiers.

       The <b>-E </b>option allows users to place the message in the standard
       error stream of the batch job.

       The <b>-O </b>option allows users to place the message in the standard
       output stream of the batch job.

       Historically, the <i>qmsg</i> utility is an existing practice in the
       offerings of one or more implementors of an NQS-derived batch
       system. The utility has been found to be useful enough that it
       deserves to be included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qmsg</i> utility may be removed in a future version.
