NAME </h2>
<pre>
       chage - change user password expiry information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>chage </b>[<i>options</i>] <i>LOGIN</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>chage </b>command changes the number of days between password
       changes and the date of the last password change. This
       information is used by the system to determine when a user must
       change their password.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>chage </b>command are:

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--lastday </b><i>LAST_DAY</i>
           Set the number of days since January 1st, 1970 when the
           password was last changed. The date may also be expressed in
           the format YYYY-MM-DD (or the format more commonly used in
           your area). If the <i>LAST_DAY</i> is set to <i>0</i> the user is forced to
           change his password on the next log on.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--expiredate </b><i>EXPIRE_DATE</i>
           Set the date or number of days since January 1, 1970 on which
           the user's account will no longer be accessible. The date may
           also be expressed in the format YYYY-MM-DD (or the format
           more commonly used in your area). A user whose account is
           locked must contact the system administrator before being
           able to use the system again.

           For example the following can be used to set an account to
           expire in 180 days:

                        chage -E $(date -d +180days +%Y-%m-%d)

           Passing the number <i>-1</i> as the <i>EXPIRE_DATE</i> will remove an
           account expiration date.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--iso8601</b>
           When printing dates, use YYYY-MM-DD format.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--inactive </b><i>INACTIVE</i>
           Set the number of days of inactivity after a password has
           expired before the account is locked. The <i>INACTIVE</i> option is
           the number of days of inactivity. A user whose account is
           locked must contact the system administrator before being
           able to use the system again.

           Passing the number <i>-1</i> as the <i>INACTIVE</i> will remove an
           account's inactivity.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
           Show account aging information.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mindays </b><i>MIN_DAYS</i>
           Set the minimum number of days between password changes to
           <i>MIN_DAYS</i>. A value of zero for this field indicates that the
           user may change their password at any time.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--maxdays </b><i>MAX_DAYS</i>
           Set the maximum number of days during which a password is
           valid. When <i>MAX_DAYS</i> plus <i>LAST_DAY</i> is less than the current
           day, the user will be required to change their password
           before being able to use their account. This occurrence can
           be planned for in advance by use of the <b>-W </b>option, which
           provides the user with advance warning.

           Passing the number <i>-1</i> as <i>MAX_DAYS</i> will remove checking a
           password's validity.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--prefix </b><i>PREFIX_DIR</i>
           Apply changes to configuration files under the root
           filesystem found under the directory <i>PREFIX_DIR</i>. This option
           does not chroot and is intended for preparing a
           cross-compilation target. Some limitations: NIS and LDAP
           users/groups are not verified. PAM authentication is using
           the host files. No SELINUX support.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--warndays </b><i>WARN_DAYS</i>
           Set the number of days of warning before a password change is
           required. The <i>WARN_DAYS</i> option is the number of days prior to
           the password expiring that a user will be warned their
           password is about to expire.

       If none of the options are selected, <b>chage </b>operates in an
       interactive fashion, prompting the user with the current values
       for all of the fields. Enter the new value to change the field,
       or leave the line blank to use the current value. The current
       value is displayed between a pair of <i>[ ]</i> marks.
</pre> <h2>
NOTE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>chage </b>program requires a shadow password file to be
       available.

       The chage program will report only the information from the
       shadow password file. This implies that configuration from other
       sources (e.g. LDAP or empty password hash field from the passwd
       file) that affect the user's login will not be shown in the chage
       output.

       The <b>chage </b>program will also not report any inconsistency between
       the shadow and passwd files (e.g. missing x in the passwd file).
       The <b>pwck </b>can be used to check for this kind of inconsistencies.

       The <b>chage </b>command is restricted to the root user, except for the
       <b>-l </b>option, which may be used by an unprivileged user to determine
       when their password or account is due to expire.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
