NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-make-current - Make a specific version of an app current
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak make-current </b>[OPTION...] APP BRANCH
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Makes a particular branch of an application current. Only the
       current branch of an app has its exported files (such as desktop
       files and icons) made visible to the host.

       When a new branch is installed it will automatically be made
       current, so this command is often not needed.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user </b>or <b>--installation </b>options, this
       command changes the default system-wide installation.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Update a per-user installation.

       <b>--system</b>
           Update the default system-wide installation.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Updates a system-wide installation specified by NAME among
           those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
           <b>--installation=default </b>is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--arch=ARCH</b>
           The architecture to make current for. See <b>flatpak</b>
           <b>--supported-arches </b>for architectures supported by the host.

           Print debug information during command processing.
