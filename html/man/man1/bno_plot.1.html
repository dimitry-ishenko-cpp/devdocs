NAME </h2>

       bno_plot - generate interactive 3D plot of IO blocks and sizes

SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>bno_plot </b>[ -h | --help ]
                [ -v | --verbose ]
                [ -K | --keys-below ]
                [ &lt;file...&gt; ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       bno_plot is a visualization tool for the block layer IO tracing
       tool called blktrace(8).  As noted in its documentation, blktrace
       is a block layer IO tracing mechanism which provides detailed
       information about request queue operations up to user space.

       bno_plot utilizes gnuplot to generate a 3D plot of the block
       number output from btt.  If no <i>&lt;files&gt;</i> are specified, it will
       utilize all files generated after btt was run with <i>-B blknos</i>
       (meaning: all files of the form <i>blknos*[rw].dat</i>).

       The <i>-K</i> option forces bno_plot to put the keys below the graph.
       If it is not specified, all keys for input files are put in the
       upper right corner of the graph. If the number of devices exceed
       10, then bno_plot will automatically push the keys under the
       graph.

       To use this utility, the gnuplot package needs to be installed.

       To exit the plotter, enter 'quit' or ^D at the 'gnuplot&gt; '
       prompt.
