DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdasystemd </b>is a systemd log file monitoring Performance Metrics
       Domain Agent (PMDA).  It can be seen as analogous to the <b>-f</b>
       option to <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and converts each new log line into a
       performance event, suitable for consumption by <a href="../man3/pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> client
       tools like <a href="pmevent.1.html">pmevent(1)</a>.

       The <b>systemd </b>PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting
       timestamped event records for messages logged to the system logs,
       as well as the more orthodox sample-style metrics such as message
       counts and throughput size values.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdasystemd </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-f   </b>Disables per-uid/gid record filtering.  By default the user
            and group credentials will be used to filter log records
            returned to the client tool, preventing information exposure
            to arbitrary users.  This option disables that, so use only
            with extreme caution.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>systemd.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdasystemd </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If
            the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-m   </b>Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event
            records to <i>maxsize</i> bytes.  As log events arrive at the PMDA,
            they must be buffered until individual client tools request
            the next batch since their previous batch of events.  The
            default maximum is 2 megabytes.

       <b>-s   </b>Sets the polling interval for detecting newly arrived log
            lines.  Mirrors the same option from the <a href="tail.1.html">tail(1)</a> command.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the "adm" user account.

INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
       systemd performance metrics, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd
            # ./Install

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdasystemd </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</b>
              command line options used to launch <b>pmdasystemd</b>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd/help</b>
              default help text file for the systemd metrics
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd/Install</b>
              installation script for the <b>pmdasystemd </b>agent
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/systemd/Remove</b>
              undo installation script for the <b>pmdasystemd </b>agent
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/systemd.log</b>
              default log file for error messages and other information
              from <b>pmdasystemd</b>
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
