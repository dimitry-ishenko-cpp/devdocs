NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-push - Push (apply) one or more unapplied patches
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg push</i> [OPTIONS] [patch]...
       <i>stg push</i> [OPTIONS] -n &lt;number&gt;
       <i>stg push</i> [OPTIONS] --all
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Push one or more unapplied patches from the series onto the
       stack.

       By default, the first unapplied patch is pushed.

       Unapplied patches may be pushed in arbitrary order, but out of
       order pushes may result in merge conflicts. If there are
       conflicts while pushing a patch, the conflicts are written to the
       work tree and the push command halts. Conflicts may then be
       resolved using the normal Git methods, or alternatively the push
       may be undone using <a href="stg-undo.1.html">stg-undo(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -a, --all
           Push all unapplied patches

       -n &lt;n&gt;, --number=&lt;n&gt;
           Push the specified number of patches.

           A negative number indicates to push all but that number of
           patches

       --reverse
           Push the patches in reverse order

       --noapply
           Reorder patches by pushing without applying

       --set-tree
           Push patches keeping their original trees.

           For each patch pushed, instead of performing a merge, the
           patch is pushed such the resulting tree will be identical to
           the tree associated with the patch.

           This can be useful when splitting a patch by first popping
           the patch and creating a new patch with some of the changes.
           Pushing the original patch with <i>--set-tree</i> will avoid
           conflicts and only the remaining changes will be in the
           patch.

       -k, --keep
           Keep the local changes

       -m, --merged
           Check for patches merged upstream

       --committer-date-is-author-date
           Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
           the author date of the commit as the committer date.

       --conflicts[=&lt;policy&gt;]
           Either "allow" or "disallow" pushing a patch with conflicts.

           Using <b>--conflicts=allow </b>(or just <b>--conflicts</b>) allows pushing
           a patch that may result in unresolved merge conflicts. The
           patch will be pushed and files with conflicts will be left
           with conflict markers to be resolved manually; or the
           operation undone with <b>stg undo --hard</b>. This is the default
           behavior and also corresponds to the
           "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" variable being set to "true".

           Using <b>--conflicts=disallow </b>disallows pushing any patch that
           would result in merge conflicts. The operation will stop on
           the last patch that can be pushed without conflicts. This
           behavior can be configured by setting
           "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" to "false".
