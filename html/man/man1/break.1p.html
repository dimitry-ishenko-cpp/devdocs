PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       break — exit from for, while, or until loop
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       break <b>[</b><i>n</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>n</i> is specified, the <i>break</i> utility shall exit from the <i>n</i>th
       enclosing <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, or <b>until </b>loop. If <i>n</i> is not specified, <i>break</i>
       shall behave as if <i>n</i> was specified as 1. Execution shall continue
       with the command immediately following the exited loop. The value
       of <i>n</i> is a positive decimal integer. If <i>n</i> is greater than the
       number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing loop shall be
       exited. If there is no enclosing loop, the behavior is
       unspecified.

       A loop shall enclose a <i>break</i> or <i>continue</i> command if the loop
       lexically encloses the command. A loop lexically encloses a <i>break</i>
       or <i>continue</i> command if the command is:

        *  Executing in the same execution environment (see <i>Section</i>
           <i>2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>) as the compound-list of
           the loop's do-group (see <i>Section 2.10.2</i>, <i>Shell Grammar</i>
           <i>Rules</i>), and

        *  Contained in a compound-list associated with the loop (either
           in the compound-list of the loop's do-group or, if the loop
           is a <b>while </b>or <b>until </b>loop, in the compound-list following the
           <b>while </b>or <b>until </b>reserved word), and

        *  Not in the body of a function whose function definition
           command (see <i>Section 2.9.5</i>, <i>Function Definition Command</i>) is
           contained in a compound-list associated with the loop.

       If <i>n</i> is greater than the number of lexically enclosing loops and
       there is a non-lexically enclosing loop in progress in the same
       execution environment as the <i>break</i> or <i>continue</i> command, it is
       unspecified whether that loop encloses the command.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       for i in *
       do
           if test -d "$i"
           then break
           fi
       done

       The results of running the following example are unspecified:
       there are two loops in progress when the <i>break</i> command is
       executed, and they are in the same execution environment, but
       neither loop is lexically enclosing the <i>break</i> command. (There are
       no loops lexically enclosing the <i>continue</i> commands, either.)

       foo() {
           for j in 1 2; do
               echo 'break 2' &gt;/tmp/do_break
               echo "  sourcing /tmp/do_break ($j)..."
               # the behavior of the break from running the following command
               # results in unspecified behavior:
               . /tmp/do_break

               do_continue() { continue 2; }
               echo "  running do_continue ($j)..."
               # the behavior of the continue in the following function call
               # results in unspecified behavior (if execution reaches this
               # point):
               do_continue

               trap 'continue 2' USR1
               echo "  sending SIGUSR1 to self ($j)..."
               # the behavior of the continue in the trap invoked from the
               # following signal results in unspecified behavior (if
               # execution reaches this point):
               kill -s USR1 $$
               sleep 1
           done
       }
       for i in 1 2; do
           echo "running foo ($i)..."
           foo
       done
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       In early proposals, consideration was given to expanding the
       syntax of <i>break</i> and <i>continue</i> to refer to a label associated with
       the appropriate loop as a preferable alternative to the <i>n</i> method.
       However, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does reserve the name space
       of command names ending with a &lt;colon&gt;.  It is anticipated that a
       future implementation could take advantage of this and provide
       something like:

           outofloop: for i in a b c d e
           do
               for j in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
               do
                   if test -r "${i}${j}"
                   then break outofloop
                   fi
               done
           done

       and that this might be standardized after implementation
       experience is achieved.
