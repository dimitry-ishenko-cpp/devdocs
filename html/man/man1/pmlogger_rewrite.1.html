NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogger_rewrite </b>- helper script to rewrite Performance Co-Pilot
       archives
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_rewrite </b>[<b>-dNsVvw?</b>]  [<b>-c </b><i>config</i>] <i>archive</i>
       ...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogger_rewrite </b>is a helper script that is used by
       <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> when rewriting Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
       archives.  Rewriting is usually required to accommodate
       evolutionary changes in metadata so old archives can be updated
       and then merged with current archives.

       <b>pmlogger_rewrite </b>is a wrapper script for <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> that
       will potentially rewrite all of the archives matching the <i>archive</i>
       arguments.  Each <i>archive</i> argument may be a PCP archive file name,
       the basename for the files in a PCP archive, or a directory (in
       which case all subordinate PCP archives are found by recursive
       descent).

       <b>pmlogrewrite </b>is run with the <b>-i </b>option so rewriting is done ``in
       place''.  The <b>-q </b>option is also used, so if no rewriting is
       required then no changes are made to the archive files.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are passed through to <b>pmlogrewrite</b>: <b>-c </b>(or
       <b>--config</b>), <b>-d </b>(or <b>--desperate</b>), <b>-s </b>(or <b>--scale</b>), <b>-v </b>(or
       <b>--verbose) </b>and <b>-w </b>(or <b>--warnings</b>).  Refer to <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> for
       the meaning of these options.

       The remaining options are:

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--showme</b>
            Runs <b>pmlogger_rewrite </b>in a ``show me'' or ``dry run'' mode
            where the tasks that would be performed are reported, but no
            changes are made.  This is typically used for debugging in
            combination with one (verbose) or two (very verbose) <b>-V </b>op‐
            tions.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            Increase script output verbosity.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to parameter‐
       ize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each installa‐
       tion, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values for these
       variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to specify an al‐
       ternative configuration file, as described in <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
