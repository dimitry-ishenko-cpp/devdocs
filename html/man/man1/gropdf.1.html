Description </h2>
<pre>
       The GNU <i>roff</i> PDF output driver translates the output of <i>troff</i>(1)
       into Portable Document Format.  Normally, <i>gropdf</i> is invoked by
       <i>groff</i>(1) when the latter is given the “<b>-T pdf</b>” option.  (In this
       installation, <b>ps </b>is the default output device.)  Use <i>groff</i>'s <b>-P</b>
       option to pass any options shown above to <i>gropdf</i>.  If no <i>file</i>
       arguments are given, or if <i>file</i> is “-”, <i>gropdf</i> reads the standard
       input stream.  It writes to the standard output stream.

       See section “Font installation” below for a guide to installing
       fonts for <i>gropdf</i>.
</pre> <h2>
Options </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b>displays a usage message, while <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>show
       version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-d     </b>Include debug information as comments within the PDF.
              Also produces an uncompressed PDF.

       <b>-e     </b>Forces <i>gropdf</i> to embed <i>all</i> fonts (even the 14 base PDF
              fonts).

       <b>-F </b><i>dir</i> Prepend directory <i>dir</i>/dev<i>name</i> to the search path for font,
              and device description files; <i>name</i> is the name of the
              device, usually <b>pdf</b>.

       <b>-I </b><i>dir</i> Search the directory <i>dir</i> for files named in <b>\X'pdf:</b>
              <b>pdfpic' </b>device control commands.  <b>-I </b>may be specified more
              than once; each <i>dir</i> is searched in the given order.  To
              search the current working directory before others, add
              “<b>-I .</b>” at the desired place; it is otherwise searched
              last.

       <b>-l     </b>Orient the document in landscape format.

       <b>-p </b><i>paper-format</i>
              Set the physical dimensions of the output medium.  This
              overrides the <b>papersize</b>, <b>paperlength</b>, and <b>paperwidth</b>
              directives in the <i>DESC</i> file; it accepts the same arguments
              as the <b>papersize </b>directive.  See <i>groff_font</i>(5) for
              details.

       <b>-s     </b>Append a comment line to end of PDF showing statistics,
              i.e. number of pages in document.  Ghostscript's <b>ps2pdf</b>
              complains about this line if it is included, but works
              anyway.

       <b>-u </b>[<i>cmap-file</i>]
              <i>gropdf</i> normally includes a ToUnicode CMap with any font
              created using <i>text.enc</i> as the encoding file, this makes it
              easier to search for words which contain ligatures.  You
              can include your own CMap by specifying a <i>cmap-file</i> or
              have no CMap at all by omitting the argument.

       <b>-y </b><i>foundry</i>
              Set the foundry to use for selecting fonts of the same
              name.
</pre> <h2>
Usage </h2>
<pre>
       The input to <i>gropdf</i> must be in the format output by <i>troff</i>(1).
       This is described in <i>groff_out</i>(5).  In addition, the device and
       font description files for the device used must meet certain
       requirements: The resolution must be an integer multiple of 72
       times the <b>sizescale</b>.  The <b>pdf </b>device uses a resolution of 72000
       and a sizescale of 1000.

       The device description file must contain a valid paper format;
       see <i>groff_font</i>(5).  <i>gropdf</i> uses the same Type 1 Adobe PostScript
       fonts as the <b>grops </b>device driver.  Although the PDF Standard
       allows the use of other font types (like TrueType) this
       implementation only accepts the Type 1 PostScript font.  Fewer
       Type 1 fonts are supported natively in PDF documents than the
       standard 35 fonts supported by <b>grops </b>and all PostScript printers,
       but all the fonts are available since any which aren't supported
       natively are automatically embedded in the PDF.

       <i>gropdf</i> supports the concept of foundries, that is different
       versions of basically the same font.  During install a <i>Foundry</i>
       file controls where fonts are found and builds <i>groff</i> fonts from
       the files it discovers on your system.

       Each font description file must contain a command

              <b>internalname </b><i>psname</i>

       which says that the PostScript name of the font is <i>psname</i>.  Lines
       starting with <b># </b>and blank lines are ignored.  The code for each
       character given in the font file must correspond to the code in
       the default encoding for the font.  This code can be used with
       the <b>\N </b>escape sequence in <b>troff </b>to select the character, even if
       the character does not have a <i>groff</i> name.  Every character in the
       font file must exist in the PostScript font, and the widths given
       in the font file must match the widths used in the PostScript
       font.

       <i>gropdf</i> can automatically include the downloadable fonts necessary
       to print the document.  Fonts may be in PFA or PFB format.

       Any downloadable fonts which should, when required, be included
       by <i>gropdf</i> must be listed in the file <i>/usr/local/share/groff/</i>
       <i>1.23.0/font/devpdf/download</i>; this should consist of lines of the
       form

              <i>foundry font filename</i>

       where <i>foundry</i> is the foundry name or blank for the default
       foundry.  <i>font</i> is the PostScript name of the font, and <i>filename</i>
       is the name of the file containing the font.  It can also contain
       a pathname to the font.  Any lines beginning with <b># </b>and blank
       lines are ignored; fields must be separated by tabs (spaces are
       <b>not </b>allowed); <i>filename</i> is searched for using the same mechanism
       that is used for <i>groff</i> font metric files, unless a path is also
       present.  The <i>download</i> file itself is also sought using this
       mechanism.  Foundry names are usually a single character (such as
       ‘U’ for the URW foundry) or empty for the default foundry.  This
       default uses the same fonts as <i>ghostscript</i> uses when it embeds
       fonts in a PDF file.

       The default stroke and fill colors are black.

   <b>Typefaces</b>
       Styles called <b>R</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>BI </b>mounted at font positions 1 to 4.
       Text fonts are grouped into families <b>A</b>, <b>BM</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>HN</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>,
       and <b>T</b>, each having members in each of these styles.

              <b>ZCMI   </b>ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

       Special fonts include <b>S</b>, the PostScript Symbol font, and <b>EURO</b>,
       which offers a Euro glyph for use with old devices lacking it.
       Lowercase Greek letters are automatically slanted to match the
       SymbolSlanted font (<b>SS</b>) available to <i>grops</i>(1).  Zapf Dingbats is
       available as <b>ZD</b>.  In contrast to <i>grops , gropdf</i> does not require
       a reversed variant of it (<b>ZDR</b>); the “hand pointing left” glyph
       (<b>\[lh]</b>) is available nevertheless, since it is defined using the
       <b>\X'pdf: xrev' </b>device control command (see below).  Most glyphs in
       these fonts are unnamed and must be accessed using <b>\N</b>.  <b>EURO </b>is
       not a standard PDF font, but supplied by <i>groff</i> and therefore
       included in the default <i>download</i> file.

   <b>Device control commands</b>
       <i>gropdf</i> supports many device control functions, accessed with the
       <i>groff</i> request <b>device </b>or <i>roff</i> <b>\X </b>escape sequence.  First, it
       understands many of the device control commands supported by
       <i>grops</i>(1).

       <b>\X'ps: invis'</b>
              Suppress output.

       <b>\X'ps: endinvis'</b>
              Stop suppressing output.

       <b>\X'ps: exec gsave currentpoint 2 copy translate </b><i>n</i> <b>rotate neg exch</b>
       <b>neg exch translate'</b>
              where <i>n</i> is the angle of rotation.  This is to support the
              <b>align </b>command in <i>pic</i>(1).

       <b>\X'ps: exec grestore'</b>
              Used by <i>pic</i>(1) to restore state after rotation.

       <b>\X'ps: exec </b><i>n</i> <b>setlinejoin'</b>
              where <i>n</i> can be one of the following values.

              0 = Miter join
              1 = Round join
              2 = Bevel join

       <b>\X'ps: exec </b><i>n</i> <b>setlinecap'</b>
              where <i>n</i> can be one of the following values.

              0 = Butt cap
              1 = Round cap, and
              2 = Projecting square cap

       <b>\X'ps: </b>... <b>pdfmark'</b>
              All the <i>pdfmark</i> macros installed by using <i>-m pdfmark</i> or <i>-m</i>
              <i>mspdf</i> (see documentation in <i>pdfmark.pdf</i>).  A subset of
              these macros are installed automatically when you use
              <b>-Tpdf </b>so you should not need to use “<b>-m pdfmark</b>” to access
              most PDF functionality.

       <i>gropdf</i> also supports a subset of the commands introduced in
       <i>gpresent</i>'s <i>present.tmac</i>.

              <b>PAUSE</b>
              <b>BLOCKS</b>
              <b>BLOCKE</b>

       These allow you to create presentation PDFs.  Many of the other
       commands are already available in other macro packages.

       These commands are implemented with <i>groff</i> X commands:-

       <b>\X'ps: exec %%%%PAUSE'</b>
              The section before this is treated as a block and is
              introduced using the current <b>BLOCK </b>transition setting (see
              “<b>\X'pdf: transition'</b>” below).  Equivalently, <b>.pdfpause </b>is
              available as a macro.

       <b>\X'ps: exec %%%%BEGINONCE'</b>
              Any text following this command (up to %%%%ENDONCE) is
              shown only once, the next %%%%PAUSE will remove it.  If
              producing a non-presentation PDF, i.e. ignoring the
              pauses, see <i>GROPDF_NOSLIDE</i> below, this text is ignored.

       <b>\X'ps: exec %%%%ENDONCE'</b>
              This terminates the block defined by %%%%BEGINONCE.  This
              pair of commands is what implements the .BLOCKS
              Once/.BLOCKE commands in <i>present.tmac</i>.

       The <i>mom</i> macro package already integrates these extensions, so you
       can build slides with <i>mom</i>.

       If you use <i>present.tmac</i> with <i>gropdf</i> there is no need to run the
       program <i>presentps</i>(1) since the output will already be a
       presentation PDF.

       All other <b>ps: </b>tags are silently ignored.

       <i>gropdf</i> also recognizes a device control command used by the DVI
       driver.

       <b>\X'papersize=</b><i>width</i><b>,</b><i>length</i><b>'</b>
              Set the page dimensions in centimeters to <i>width</i> by <i>length.</i>
              If the <b>-l </b>option was specified, these dimensions are
              swapped.  Changes to the paper dimensions should occur
              prior to the first page, or during page ejection before
              starting a subsequent one.

              <i>Caution:</i> the ordering of dimensions differs from that used
              by <i>papersize.tmac</i> and <i>troff</i>(1)'s “<b>-d paper</b>” option.

       <i>gropdf</i> supports several more device control features using the
       <b>pdf: </b>tag.  Some have counterpart <i>convenience macros</i> that take the
       same arguments and behave equivalently.

       <b>\X'pdf: pdfpic </b><i>file alignment width height line-length</i>'
              Place an image of the specified <i>width</i> containing the PDF
              drawing from file <i>file</i> of desired <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> (if
              <i>height</i> is missing or zero then it is scaled
              proportionally).  If <i>alignment</i> is <b>-L </b>the drawing is left-
              aligned.  If it is <b>-C </b>or <b>-R </b>a <i>line-length</i> greater than the
              width of the drawing is required as well.  If <i>width</i> is
              specified as zero then the width is scaled in proportion
              to the height.

       <b>\X'pdf: xrev'</b>
              Toggle the reversal of glyph direction.  This feature
              works by reversing all following text.  Each separate
              letter is also mirrored.  One application is the reversal
              of glyphs in the Zapf Dingbats font.  To restore the
              normal glyph orientation, repeat the command.

       <b>\X'pdf: markstart </b><i>/ANN-definition</i><b>'</b>
       <b>\X'pdf: markend'</b>
              Macros that support PDF bookmarks use these calls
              internally to start and stop (respectively) the placement
              of the bookmark's <i>hot spot;</i> the user will have called
              “<b>.pdfhref L</b>” with the text of the hot spot.  Normally,
              these are never used except from within the <i>pdfmark</i>
              macros.

       <b>\X'pdf: marksuspend'</b>
       <b>\X'pdf: markrestart'</b>
              If you use a page location trap to produce a header or
              footer, or otherwise interrupt a document's text, you need
              to use these commands if a PDF <i>hot spot</i> crosses a trap
              boundary; otherwise any text output by the trap will be
              marked as part of the hot spot.  To prevent this error,
              place these device control commands or their corresponding
              convenience macros <b>.pdfmarksuspend </b>and <b>.pdfmarkrestart </b>at
              the start and end of the trap macro, respectively.

       <b>\X'pdf: pagename </b><i>name</i><b>'</b>
              Assign the current page a <i>name</i>.  All documents bear two
              default names, ‘<b>top</b>’ and ‘<b>bottom</b>’.  The convenience macro
              for this command is <b>.pdfpagename</b>.

       <b>\X'pdf: switchtopage </b><i>when name</i><b>'</b>
              Normally each new page is appended to the end of the
              document, this command allows following pages to be
              inserted at a <i>‘named’</i> position within the document (see
              pagename command above).  <i>‘when’</i> can be either ‘<i>after</i>’ or
              ‘<i>before</i>’.  If it is omitted it defaults to ‘<i>before</i>’.  It
              should be used at the end of the page before you want the
              switch to happen.  This allows pages such as a TOC to be
              moved to elsewhere in the document, but more esoteric uses
              are possible.  The convenience macro for this command is
              <b>.pdfswitchtopage</b>.

       <b>\X'pdf: transition </b><i>feature mode duration dimension motion</i>
       <i>direction scale bool</i><b>'</b>
              where <i>feature</i> can be either SLIDE or BLOCK.  When it is
              SLIDE the transition is used when a new slide is
              introduced to the screen, if BLOCK then this transition is
              used for the individual blocks which make up the slide.

              <i>mode</i> is the transition type between slides:-

                     <b>Split </b>- Two lines sweep across the screen,
                     revealing the new page.  The lines may be either
                     horizontal or vertical and may move inward from the
                     edges of the page or outward from the center, as
                     specified by the <i>dimension</i> and <i>motion</i> entries,
                     respectively.
                     <b>Blinds </b>- Multiple lines, evenly spaced across the
                     screen, synchronously sweep in the same direction
                     to reveal the new page.  The lines may be either
                     horizontal or vertical, as specified by the
                     <i>dimension</i> entry.  Horizontal lines move downward;
                     vertical lines move to the right.
                     <b>Box </b>- A rectangular box sweeps inward from the
                     edges of the page or outward from the center, as
                     specified by the <i>motion</i> entry, revealing the new
                     page.
                     <b>Wipe </b>- A single line sweeps across the screen from
                     one edge to the other in the direction specified by
                     the <i>direction</i> entry, revealing the new page.
                     <b>Dissolve </b>- The old page dissolves gradually to
                     reveal the new one.
                     <b>Glitter </b>- Similar to Dissolve, except that the
                     effect sweeps across the page in a wide band moving
                     from one side of the screen to the other in the
                     direction specified by the <i>direction</i> entry.
                     <b>R </b>- The new page simply replaces the old one with
                     no special transition effect; the <i>direction</i> entry
                     shall be ignored.
                     <b>Fly </b>- (PDF 1.5) Changes are flown out or in (as
                     specified by <i>motion</i>), in the direction specified by

                     <b>Uncover </b>- (PDF 1.5) The old page slides off the
                     screen in the direction specified by <i>direction</i>,
                     uncovering the new page in the direction specified
                     by <i>direction</i>.
                     <b>Fade </b>- (PDF 1.5) The new page gradually becomes
                     visible through the old one.

              <i>duration</i> is the length of the transition in seconds
              (default 1).

              <i>dimension</i> (Optional; <b>Split </b>and <b>Blinds </b>transition styles
              only) The dimension in which the specified transition
              effect shall occur: <b>H </b>Horizontal, or <b>V </b>Vertical.

              <i>motion</i> (Optional; <b>Split</b>, <b>Box </b>and <b>Fly </b>transition styles
              only) The direction of motion for the specified transition
              effect: <b>I </b>Inward from the edges of the page, or <b>O </b>Outward
              from the center of the page.

              <i>direction</i> (Optional; <b>Wipe</b>, <b>Glitter</b>, <b>Fly</b>, <b>Cover</b>, <b>Uncover</b>
              and <b>Push </b>transition styles only) The direction in which
              the specified transition effect shall moves, expressed in
              degrees counterclockwise starting from a left-to-right
              direction.  If the value is a number, it shall be one of:
              <b>0 </b>= Left to right, <b>90 </b>= Bottom to top (Wipe only), <b>180 </b>=
              Right to left (Wipe only), <b>270 </b>= Top to bottom, <b>315 </b>= Top-
              left to bottom-right (Glitter only) The value can be <b>None</b>,
              which is relevant only for the <b>Fly </b>transition when the
              value of <i>scale</i> is not 1.0.

              <i>scale</i> (Optional; PDF 1.5; <b>Fly </b>transition style only) The
              starting or ending scale at which the changes shall be
              drawn.  If <i>motion</i> specifies an inward transition, the
              scale of the changes drawn shall progress from <i>scale</i> to
              1.0 over the course of the transition.  If <i>motion</i>
              specifies an outward transition, the scale of the changes
              drawn shall progress from 1.0 to <i>scale</i> over the course of
              the transition

              <i>bool</i> (Optional; PDF 1.5; <b>Fly </b>transition style only) If
              <b>true</b>, the area that shall be flown in is rectangular and
              opaque.

              This command can be used by calling the macro
              <b>.pdftransition </b>using the parameters described above.  Any
              of the parameters may be replaced with a "." which
              signifies the parameter retains its previous value, also
              any trailing missing parameters are ignored.

              <b>Note: </b>not all PDF Readers support any or all these
              transitions.

       <b>\X'pdf: background </b><i>cmd left top right bottom weight</i><b>'</b>
       <b>\X'pdf: background off'</b>
       <b>\X'pdf: background footnote </b><i>bottom</i><b>'</b>
              produces a background rectangle on the page, where

              <i>cmd</i>    is the command, which can be any of “<b>page</b>|<b>fill</b>|<b>box</b>”
                     in combination.  Thus, “<b>pagefill</b>” would draw a
                     rectangle which covers the whole current page size
                     (in which case the rest of the parameters can be
                     omitted because the box dimensions are taken from
                     the current media size).  “<b>boxfill</b>”, on the other
                     hand, requires the given dimensions to place the
                     box.  Including “<b>fill</b>” in the command will paint
                     the rectangle with the current fill colour (as with
                     <b>\M[]</b>) and including “<b>box</b>” will give the rectangle a
                     border in the current stroke colour (as with <b>\m[]</b>).

                     <i>cmd</i> may also be “<b>off</b>” on its own, which will
                     terminate drawing the current box.  If you have
                     specified a page colour with “<b>pagefill</b>”, it is
                     always the first box in the stack, and if you
                     specify it again, it will replace the first entry.
                     Be aware that the “<b>pagefill</b>” box renders the page
                     opaque, so tools that “watermark” PDF pages are
                     unlikely to be successful.  To return the
                     background to transparent, issue an “<b>off</b>” command
                     with no other boxes open.

                     Finally, <i>cmd</i> may be “<b>footnote</b>” followed by a new
                     value for <i>bottom</i>, which will be used for all open
                     boxes on the current page.  This is to allow room
                     for footnote areas that grow while a page is
                     processed (to accommodate multiple footnotes, for
                     instance).  (If the value is negative, it is used
                     as an offset from the bottom of the page.)

              <i>left</i>
              <i>top</i>
              <i>right</i>
              <i>bottom</i> are the coordinates of the box.  The <i>top</i> and <i>bottom</i>
                     coordinates are the minimum and maximum for the
                     box, since the actual start of the box is <i>groff</i>'s
                     drawing position when you issue the command, and
                     the bottom of the box is the point where you turn
                     the box “<b>off</b>”.  The top and bottom coordinates are
                     used only if the box drawing extends onto the next
                     page; ordinarily, they would be set to the header
                     and footer margins.

              <i>weight</i> provides the line width for the border if “<b>box</b>” is
                     included in the command.

              The convenience macro for this escape sequence is
              <b>.pdfbackground</b>.  An <i>sboxes</i> macro file is also available;
              see <i>groff_tmac</i>(5).

       <b>\X'pdf: pagenumbering </b><i>type prefix start</i><b>'</b>
              Control the page numbering shown in a PDF reader's outline
              (which also contains bookmarks).  Normally, the page
              number associated with each bookmark is its sequence
              number in the file, but this might not match the desired
              numbering scheme.  A document may bear a cover sheet
              (which has no page number); front matter (possibly
              including a table of contents) that uses lowercase roman
              numerals; the main matter, which uses arabic numerals; and
              back matter, which may include appendices that are each
              prefixed with a letter and independently numbered.  Place
              this command prior to breaking the page to which the new
              numbering scheme is to apply.  It then persists until
              changed again.

              <i>type</i>   specifies the numbering system to use. It should be
                     one of “<b>Decimal</b>”, “<b>Roman</b>”, “<b>roman</b>”, “<b>Alpha</b>”, or
                     “<b>alpha</b>”.  This parameter may be abbreviated to the
                     first letter, whose lettercase determines that used
                     for the numbers where applicable.  The ordering
                     used by the alphabetic numbering systems is A-Z ...
                     AA-AZ ... ZA-ZZ.  <i>type</i> can also be “<b>.</b>”, which
                     selects no numbering system; you may still provide
                     a <i>prefix.</i>

              <i>prefix</i> specifies text to precede the page number.  For
                     example, to number the pages of an appendix “A-1”,
                     “A-2”, and so forth, use a <i>prefix</i> of “<b>A-</b>” and a
                     <i>type</i> of “<b>Decimal</b>”.

              <i>start</i>  determines the page number.  It defaults to 1.

              The convenience macro for this escape sequence is
              <b>.pdfpagenumbering</b>.

   <b>Macros</b>
       <i>gropdf</i>'s support macros in <i>pdf.tmac</i> define the convenience macros
       described above.  Some features have no direct device control
       command counterpart.

       <b>.pdfinfo /</b><i>field content</i> ...
              Define PDF metadata.  <i>field</i> may be be one of <b>Title</b>,
              <b>Author</b>, <b>Subject</b>, <b>Keywords</b>, or another datum supported by
              the PDF standard or your reader.  <i>field</i> must be prefixed
              with a slash.

   <b>Importing graphics</b>
       <i>gropdf</i> supports only the inclusion of other PDF files for inline
       images.  Such a PDF file may, however, contain any of the graphic
       formats supported by the PDF standard, such as JPEG/JFIF, PNG,
       and GIF.  Any application that outputs PDF can thus be used to
       prepare files for embedding in documents processed by <i>groff</i> and
       <i>gropdf</i>.

       The PDF file you wish to insert must be a single page and the
       drawing must just fit inside the media size of the PDF file.  In
       <i>inkscape</i>(1) or <i>gimp</i>(1), for example, make sure the canvas size
       just fits the image.

       The PDF parser <i>gropdf</i> implements has not been rigorously tested
       with all applications that produce PDF.  If you find a single-
       page PDF which fails to import properly, try processing it with
       the <i>pdftk</i>(1) program.
              pdftk <i>existing-file</i> output <i>new-file</i>
       You may find that <i>new-file</i> imports successfully.

   <b>TrueType and other font formats</b>
       <i>gropdf</i> does not yet support any font formats besides Adobe Type 1
       (PFA or PFB).
</pre> <h2>
Font installation </h2>
<pre>
       The following is a step-by-step font installation guide for
       <i>gropdf.</i>

       •  Convert your font to something <i>groff</i> understands.  This is a
          PostScript Type 1 font in PFA or PFB format, together with an
          AFM file.  A PFA file begins as follows.
                 %!PS-AdobeFont-1.0:
          A PFB file contains this string as well, preceded by some non-
          printing bytes.  In the following steps, we will consider the
          use of CTAN's BrushScriptX-Italic 
          ⟨<a href="https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/brushscr">https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/brushscr</a>⟩ font in PFA
          format.

       •  Convert the AFM file to a <i>groff</i> font description file with the
          <i>afmtodit</i>(1) program.  For instance,
                 $ <b>afmtodit BrushScriptX-Italic.afm text.map BSI</b>
          converts the Adobe Font Metric file <i>BrushScriptX-Italic.afm</i> to
          the <i>groff</i> font description file <i>BSI</i>.

          If you have a font family which provides regular upright
          (roman), bold, italic, and bold-italic styles, (where “italic”
          may be “oblique” or “slanted”), we recommend using <b>R</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>,
          and <b>BI</b>, respectively, as suffixes to the <i>groff</i> font family
          name to enable <i>groff</i>'s font family and style selection
          features.  An example is <i>groff</i>'s built-in support for Times:
          the font family name is abbreviated as <b>T</b>, and the <i>groff</i> font
          names are therefore <b>TR</b>, <b>TB</b>, <b>TI</b>, and <b>TBI</b>.  In our example,
          however, the BrushScriptX font is available in a single style
          only, italic.

       •  Install the <i>groff</i> font description file(s) in a <i>devpdf</i>
          subdirectory in the search path that <i>groff</i> uses for device and
          font file descriptions.  See the <i>GROFF_FONT_PATH</i> entry in
          section “Environment” of <i>troff</i>(1) for the current value of the
          font search path.  While <i>groff</i> doesn't directly use AFM files,
          it is a good idea to store them alongside its font description
          files.

       •  Register fonts in the <i>devpdf/download</i> file so they can be
          located for embedding in PDF files <i>gropdf</i> generates.  Only the
          first <i>download</i> file encountered in the font search path is
          read.  If in doubt, copy the default <i>download</i> file (see
          section “Files” below) to the first directory in the font
          search path and add your fonts there.  The PostScript font
          name used by <i>gropdf</i> is stored in the <b>internalname </b>field in the
          <i>groff</i> font description file.  (This name does not necessarily
          resemble the font's file name.)  If the font in our example
          had originated from a foundry named <b>Z</b>, we would add the
          following line to <i>download</i>.
                 Z→BrushScriptX-Italic→BrushScriptX-Italic.pfa
          A tab character, depicted as →, separates the fields.  The
          default foundry has no name: its field is empty and entries
          corresponding to it start with a tab character, as will the
          one in our example.

       •  Test the selection and embedding of the new font.
                 printf "\\f[BSI]Hello, world!\n" | groff -T pdf -P -e &gt;hello.pdf
                 see hello.pdf
</pre> <h2>
Environment </h2>
<pre>
       <i>GROFF_FONT_PATH</i>
              A list of directories in which to seek the selected output
              device's directory of device and font description files.
              If, in the <i>download</i> file, the font file has been specified
              with a full path, no directories are searched.  See
              <i>troff</i>(1) and <i>groff_font</i>(5).

       <i>GROPDF_NOSLIDE</i>
              If set and evaluates to a true value (to Perl), <i>gropdf</i>
              ignores commands specific to presentation PDFs, producing
              a normal PDF instead.

       <i>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</i>
              A timestamp (expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch) to
              use as the output creation timestamp in place of the
              current time.  The time is converted to human-readable
              form using Perl's <i>gmtime()</i> function and recorded in a PDF
              comment.

       <i>TZ</i>     The time zone to use when converting the current time to
              human-readable form; see <i>tzset</i>(3).  If <i>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</i>
              is used, it is always converted to human-readable form
              using UTC.
