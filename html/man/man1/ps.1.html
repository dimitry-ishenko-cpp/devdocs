NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ps - report a snapshot of the current processes.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ps </b>[<i>option</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ps </b>displays information about a selection of the active
       processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and
       the displayed information, use <b>top </b>instead.

       This version of <b>ps </b>accepts several kinds of options.

       •   Unix options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a
           dash.

       •   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a
           dash.

       •   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can
       appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are
       functionally identical, due to the many standards and <b>ps</b>
       implementations that this <b>ps </b>is compatible with.

       By default, <b>ps </b>selects all processes with the same effective user
       ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same
       terminal as the invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID),
       the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the
       cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the
       executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT)
       to the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND)
       instead of the executable name.  You can override this with the
       <b>PS_FORMAT </b>environment variable.  The use of BSD-style options
       will also change the process selection to include processes on
       other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this
       may be described as setting the selection to be the set of all
       processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or
       not on a terminal.  These effects are not considered when options
       are described as being "identical" below, so <b>-M </b>will be
       considered identical to <b>Z </b>and so on.

       Except as described below, process selection options are
       additive.  The default selection is discarded, and then the
       selected processes are added to the set of processes to be
       displayed.  A process will thus be shown if it meets any of the
       given selection criteria.

</pre> <h2>
SIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>a      </b>Lift the BSD-style "only yourself" restriction, which is
              imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style
              (without "-") options are used or when the <b>ps </b>personality
              setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in
              this manner is in addition to the set of processes
              selected by other means.  An alternate description is that
              this option causes <b>ps </b>to list all processes with a
              terminal (tty), or to list all processes when used
              together with the <b>x </b>option.

       <b>-A     </b>Select all processes.  Identical to <b>-e</b>.

       <b>-a     </b>Select all processes except both session leaders (see
              <a href="../man2/getsid.2.html">getsid(2)</a>) and processes not associated with a terminal.

       <b>-d     </b>Select all processes except session leaders.

       <b>--deselect</b>
              Select all processes except those that fulfill the
              specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical
              to <b>-N</b>.

       <b>-e     </b>Select all processes.  Identical to <b>-A</b>.

       <b>g      </b>Really all, even session leaders.  This flag is obsolete
              and may be discontinued in a future release.  It is
              normally implied by the <b>a </b>flag, and is only useful when
              operating in the sunos4 personality.

       <b>-N     </b>Select all processes except those that fulfill the
              specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical
              to <b>--deselect</b>.

       <b>T      </b>Select all processes associated with this terminal.
              Identical to the <b>t </b>option without any argument.

       <b>r      </b>Restrict the selection to only running processes.

       <b>x      </b>Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is
              imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style
              (without "-") options are used or when the <b>ps </b>personality
              setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in
              this manner is in addition to the set of processes
              selected by other means.  An alternate description is that
              this option causes <b>ps </b>to list all processes owned by you
              (same EUID as <b>ps</b>), or to list all processes when used
              together with the <b>a </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
PROCESS SELECTION BY LIST </h2>
<pre>
       These options accept a single argument in the form of a
       blank-separated or comma-separated list.  They can be used
       multiple times.  For example: <b>ps -p "1 2" -p 3,4</b>

       <i>123</i>    Identical to <b>--pid </b><i>123</i>.

       +<i>123</i>   Identical to <b>--sid </b><i>123</i>.

       -<i>123</i>   Select by process group ID (PGID).

       <b>-C </b><i>cmdlist</i>
              Select by command name.  This selects the processes whose
              executable name is given in <i>cmdlist</i>.  NOTE: The command
              name is not the same as the command line. Previous
              versions of procps and the kernel truncated this command
              name to 15 characters. This limitation is no longer
              present in both. If you depended on matching only 15
              characters, you may no longer get a match.

       <b>-G </b><i>grplist</i>
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the
              processes whose real group name or ID is in the <i>grplist</i>
              list.  The real group ID identifies the group of the user
              who created the process, see <a href="../man2/getgid.2.html">getgid(2)</a>.

       <b>-g </b><i>grplist</i>
              Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection
              by session is specified by many standards, but selection
              by effective group is the logical behavior that several
              other operating systems use.  This <b>ps </b>will select by
              session when the list is completely numeric (as sessions
              are).  Group ID numbers will work only when some group
              names are also specified.  See the <b>-s </b>and <b>--group </b>options.

       <b>--Group </b><i>grplist</i>
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to <b>-G</b>.

       <b>--group </b><i>grplist</i>
              Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects
              the processes whose effective group name or ID is in
              <i>grplist</i>.  The effective group ID describes the group whose
              file access permissions are used by the process (see
              <a href="../man2/getegid.2.html">getegid(2)</a>).  The <b>-g </b>option is often an alternative to
              <b>--group</b>.

       <b>p </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by process ID.  Identical to <b>-p </b>and <b>--pid</b>.

       <b>-p </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by PID.  This selects the processes whose process
              ID numbers appear in <i>pidlist</i>.  Identical to <b>p </b>and <b>--pid</b>.

       <b>--pid </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by process ID.  Identical to <b>-p </b>and <b>p</b>.

       <b>--ppid </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes
              with a parent process ID in <i>pidlist</i>.  That is, it selects
              processes that are children of those listed in <i>pidlist</i>.

       <b>q </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to <b>-q </b>and
              <b>--quick-pid</b>.

       <b>-q </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by PID (quick mode).  This selects the processes
              whose process ID numbers appear in <i>pidlist</i>.  With this
              option <b>ps </b>reads the necessary info only for the pids
              listed in the <i>pidlist</i> and doesn't apply additional
              filtering rules. The order of pids is unsorted and
              preserved. No additional selection options, sorting and
              forest type listings are allowed in this mode.  Identical
              to <b>q </b>and <b>--quick-pid</b>.

       <b>--quick-pid </b><i>pidlist</i>
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to <b>-q </b>and <b>q</b>.

       <b>-s </b><i>sesslist</i>
              Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a
              session ID specified in <i>sesslist</i>.

       <b>--sid </b><i>sesslist</i>
              Select by session ID.  Identical to <b>-s</b>.

       <b>t </b><i>ttylist</i>
              Select by tty.  Nearly identical to <b>-t </b>and <b>--tty</b>, but can
              also be used with an empty <i>ttylist</i> to indicate the
              terminal associated with <b>ps</b>.  Using the <b>T </b>option is
              considered cleaner than using <b>t </b>with an empty <i>ttylist</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>ttylist</i>
              Select by tty.  This selects the processes associated with
              the terminals given in <i>ttylist</i>.  Terminals (ttys, or
              screens for text output) can be specified in several
              forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.  A plain "-" may be used to
              select processes not attached to any terminal.

       <b>--tty </b><i>ttylist</i>
              Select by terminal.  Identical to <b>-t </b>and <b>t</b>.

       <b>U </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects
              the processes whose effective user name or ID is in
              <i>userlist</i>.  The effective user ID describes the user whose
              file access permissions are used by the process (see
              <i>geteuid</i>(2)).  Identical to <b>-u </b>and <b>--user</b>.

       <b>-U </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the
              processes whose real user name or ID is in the <i>userlist</i>
              list.  The real user ID identifies the user who created
              the process, see <a href="../man2/getuid.2.html">getuid(2)</a>.

       <b>-u </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects
              the processes whose effective user name or ID is in
              <i>userlist</i>.

       The effective user ID describes the user whose file access
       permissions are used by the process (see <a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid(2)</a>).  Identical
       to <b>U </b>and <b>--user</b>.

       <b>--User </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to <b>-U</b>.

       <b>--user </b><i>userlist</i>
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to
              <b>-u </b>and <b>U</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       These options are used to choose the information displayed by <b>ps</b>.
       The output may differ by personality.

       <b>-c     </b>Show different scheduler information for the <b>-l </b>option.

       <b>--context</b>
              Display security context format (for SELinux).

       <b>-f     </b>Do full-format listing.  This option can be combined with
              many other Unix-style options to add additional columns.
              It also causes the command arguments to be printed.  When
              used with <b>-L</b>, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread
              ID) columns will be added.  See the <b>c </b>option, the format
              keyword <b>args</b>, and the format keyword <b>comm</b>.

       <b>-F     </b>Extra full format.  See the <b>-f </b>option, which <b>-F </b>implies.

       <b>--format </b><i>format</i>
              user-defined format.  Identical to <b>-o </b>and <b>o</b>.

       <b>j      </b>BSD job control format.

       <b>-j     </b>Jobs format.

       <b>l      </b>Display BSD long format.

       <b>-l     </b>Long format.  The <b>-y </b>option is often useful with this.

       <b>-M     </b>Add a column of security data.  Identical to <b>Z </b>(for
              SELinux).

       <b>O </b><i>format</i>
              is preloaded <b>o </b>(overloaded).  The BSD <b>O </b>option can act
              like <b>-O </b>(user-defined output format with some common
              fields predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
              Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this
              option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
              (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other
              way (e.g.  with <b>-O </b>or <b>--sort</b>).  When used as a formatting
              option, it is identical to <b>-O</b>, with the BSD personality.

       <b>-O </b><i>format</i>
              Like <b>-o</b>, but preloaded with some default columns.
              Identical to <b>-o pid,</b><i>format</i><b>,state,tname,time,command </b>or
              <b>-o pid,</b><i>format</i><b>,tname,time,cmd</b>, see <b>-o </b>below.

       <b>o </b><i>format</i>
              Specify user-defined format.  Identical to <b>-o </b>and
              <b>--format</b>.

       <b>-o </b><i>format</i>
              User-defined format.  <i>format</i> is a single argument in the
              form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which
              offers a way to specify individual output columns.  The
              recognized keywords are described in the <b>STANDARD FORMAT</b>
              <b>SPECIFIERS </b>section below.  Headers may be renamed (<b>ps -o</b>
              <b>pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command</b>) as desired.  If all
              column headers are empty (<b>ps -o pid= -o comm=</b>) then the
              header line will not be output.  Column width will
              increase as needed for wide headers; this may be used to
              widen up columns such as WCHAN (<b>ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-</b>
              <b>WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm</b>).  Explicit width control (<b>ps opid,</b>
              <b>wchan:42,cmd</b>) is offered too.  The behavior of <b>ps -o</b>
              <b>pid=X,comm=Y </b>varies with personality; output may be one
              column named "X,comm=Y" or two columns named "X" and "Y".
              Use multiple <b>-o </b>options when in doubt.  Use the <b>PS_FORMAT</b>
              environment variable to specify a default as desired;
              DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to choose
              the default Unix or BSD columns.

       <b>-P     </b>Add a column showing <b>psr</b>.

       <b>s      </b>Display signal format.

       <b>u      </b>Display user-oriented format.

       <b>v      </b>Display virtual memory format.

       <b>X      </b>Register format.

       <b>-y     </b>Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.  This option
              can only be used with <b>-l</b>.

       <b>Z      </b>Add a column of security data.  Identical to <b>-M </b>(for
              SELinux).
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT MODIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>c      </b>Show the true command name.  This is derived from the name
              of the executable file, rather than from the argv value.
              Command arguments and any modifications to them are thus
              not shown.  This option effectively turns the <b>args </b>format
              keyword into the <b>comm </b>format keyword; it is useful with
              the <b>-f </b>format option and with the various BSD-style format
              options, which all normally display the command arguments.
              See the <b>-f </b>option, the format keyword <b>args</b>, and the format
              keyword <b>comm</b>.

       <b>--cols </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen width.

       <b>--columns </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen width.

       <b>--cumulative</b>
              Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the
              parent).

       <b>-D </b><i>format</i>
              Set the date format of the <b>lstart </b>field to <i>format</i>. This
              format is parsed by <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a> and should be a maximum of
              24 characters to not mis-align columns.

       <b>--date-format </b><i>format</i>
              Identical to <b>-D</b>.

       <b>e      </b>Show the environment after the command.

       <b>f      </b>ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).

       <b>--forest</b>
              ASCII art process tree.

       <b>h      </b>No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD
              personality).  The <b>h </b>option is problematic.  Standard BSD
              <b>ps </b>uses this option to print a header on each page of
              output, but older Linux <b>ps </b>uses this option to totally
              disable the header.  This version of <b>ps </b>follows the Linux
              usage of not printing the header unless the BSD
              personality has been selected, in which case it prints a
              header on each page of output.  Regardless of the current
              personality, you can use the long options <b>--headers </b>and
              <b>--no-headers </b>to enable printing headers each page or
              disable headers entirely, respectively.

       <b>-H     </b>Show process hierarchy (forest).

       <b>--headers</b>
              Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

       <b>k </b><i>spec</i> Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
              [<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>key</i>[,[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>key</i>[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from
              the <b>STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS </b>section.  The "+" is
              optional since default direction is increasing numerical
              or lexicographic order.  Identical to <b>--sort</b>.

                      Examples:
                      <b>ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid</b>
                      <b>ps axk comm o comm,args</b>
                      <b>ps kstart_time -ef</b>

       <b>--lines </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen height.

       <b>n      </b>Numeric output for WCHAN and USER (including all types of
              UID and GID).

       <b>--no-headers</b>
              Print no header line at all.  <b>--no-heading </b>is an alias for
              this option.

       <b>O </b><i>order</i>
              Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD <b>O </b>option can act like
              <b>-O </b>(user-defined output format with some common fields
              predefined) or can be used to specify sort order.
              Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this
              option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
              (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other
              way (e.g.  with <b>-O </b>or <b>--sort</b>).

              For sorting, obsolete BSD <b>O </b>option syntax is
              <b>O</b>[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>k1</i>[,[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>k2</i>[,...]].  It orders the processes listing
              according to the multilevel sort specified by the sequence
              of one-letter short keys <i>k1</i>,<i>k2</i>, ... described in the
              <b>OBSOLETE SORT KEYS </b>section below.  The "+" is currently
              optional, merely re-iterating the default direction on a
              key, but may help to distinguish an <b>O </b>sort from an <b>O</b>
              format.  The "-" reverses direction only on the key it
              precedes.

       <b>--rows </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen height.

       <b>S      </b>Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead
              child processes into their parent.  This is useful for
              examining a system where a parent process repeatedly forks
              off short-lived children to do work.

       <b>--sort </b><i>spec</i>
              Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is
              [<i>+</i>|<i>-</i>]<i>key</i>[,[<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<i>key</i>[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from
              the <b>STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS </b>section.  The "+" is
              optional since default direction is increasing numerical
              or lexicographic order.  Identical to <b>k</b>.  For example: <b>ps</b>
              <b>jax --sort=uid,-ppid,+pid</b>

       <b>--signames</b>
              Show signal masks using abbreviated signal names and
              expands the collumn.  If the column width cannot show all
              signals, the column will end with a plus "<i>+</i>".  Columns
              with only a hyphen have no signals.

       <b>w      </b>Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       <b>-w     </b>Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       <b>--width </b><i>n</i>
              Set screen width.
</pre> <h2>
THREAD DISPLAY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>H      </b>Show threads as if they were processes.

       <b>-L     </b>Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns.

       <b>m      </b>Show threads after processes.

       <b>-m     </b>Show threads after processes.

       <b>-T     </b>Show threads, possibly with SPID column.
</pre> <h2>
OTHER INFORMATION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b><i>section</i>
              Print a help message.  The <i>section</i> argument can be one of
              <i>s</i>imple, <i>l</i>ist, <i>o</i>utput, <i>t</i>hreads, <i>m</i>isc, or <i>a</i>ll.  The argument
              can be shortened to one of the underlined letters as in:
              s|l|o|t|m|a.

       <b>--info </b>Print debugging info.

       <b>L      </b>List all format specifiers.

       <b>V      </b>Print the procps-ng version.

       <b>-V     </b>Print the procps-ng version.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the procps-ng version.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       This <b>ps </b>works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This <b>ps</b>
       does not need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.
       Do not give this <b>ps </b>any special permissions.

       CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent
       running during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not
       ideal, and it does not conform to the standards that <b>ps </b>otherwise
       conforms to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.

       The SIZE and RSS fields don't count some parts of a process
       including the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and
       struct task_struct.  This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory
       that is always resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process
       (code+data+stack).

       Processes marked &lt;defunct&gt; are dead processes (so-called
       "zombies") that remain because their parent has not destroyed
       them properly.  These processes will be destroyed by <b>init</b>(8) if
       the parent process exits.

       If the length of the username is greater than the width of the
       display column, the username will be truncated.  See the <b>-o </b>and
       <b>-O </b>formatting options to customize length.

       Commands options such as <b>ps -aux </b>are not recommended as it is a
       confusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and
       Unix standards, the above command asks to display all processes
       with a TTY (generally the commands users are running) plus all
       processes owned by a user named <i>x</i>.  If that user doesn't exist,
       then <b>ps </b>will assume you really meant "<b>ps </b><i>aux</i>".
</pre> <h2>
PROCESS FLAGS </h2>
<pre>
       The sum of these values is displayed in the "F" column, which is
       provided by the <b>flags </b>output specifier:

               1    forked but didn't exec
               4    used super-user privileges
</pre> <h2>
PROCESS STATE CODES </h2>
<pre>
       Here are the different values that the <b>s</b>, <b>stat </b>and <b>state </b>output
       specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the
       state of a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O)
               I    idle kernel thread
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an
                    event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since Linux 2.6)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct (“zombie”) process, terminated
                    but not reaped by its parent

       For BSD formats and when the <b>stat </b>keyword is used, additional
       characters may be displayed:

               &lt;    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-
                    time and custom I/O)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD,
                    like NPTL pthreads do)
               +    is in the foreground process group
</pre> <h2>
OBSOLETE SORT KEYS </h2>
<pre>
       These keys are used by the BSD <b>O </b>option (when it is used for
       sorting).  The GNU <b>--sort </b>option doesn't use these keys, but the
       specifiers described below in the <b>STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS</b>
       section.  Note that the values used in sorting are the internal
       values <b>ps </b>uses and not the "cooked" values used in some of the
       output format fields (e.g.  sorting on tty will sort into device
       number, not according to the terminal name displayed).  Pipe <b>ps</b>
       output into the <a href="sort.1.html">sort(1)</a> command if you want to sort the cooked
       values.

STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the
       output format (e.g., with option <b>-o</b>) or to sort the selected
       processes with the GNU-style <b>--sort </b>option.

       For example: <b>ps -eo pid,user,args --sort user</b>

       This version of <b>ps </b>tries to recognize most of the keywords used
       in other implementations of <b>ps</b>.

       The following user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces:
       <b>args</b>, <b>cmd</b>, <b>comm</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>fname</b>, <b>ucmd</b>, <b>ucomm</b>, <b>lstart</b>, <b>bsdstart</b>,
       <b>start</b>.

       Some keywords may not be available for sorting.

       <b>Code         Header     Description</b>
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>%cpu         %CPU       </b>cpu utilization of the process in "##.#"
                               format.  Currently, it is the CPU time
                               used divided by the time the process has
                               been running (cputime/realtime ratio),
                               expressed as a percentage.  It will not
                               add up to 100% unless you are lucky.
                               (alias <b>pcpu</b>).

       <b>%mem         %MEM       </b>ratio of the process's resident set size
                               to the physical memory on the machine,
                               expressed as a percentage.  (alias <b>pmem</b>).

       <b>ag_id        AGID       </b>The autogroup identifier associated with
                               a process which operates in conjunction
                               with the CFS scheduler to improve
                               interactive desktop performance.

       <b>ag_nice      AGNI       </b>The autogroup nice value which affects
                               scheduling of all processes in that
                               group.

       <b>args         COMMAND    </b>A command with all its arguments as a
                               string.  Modifications to the arguments
                               may be shown.  The output in this column
                               may contain spaces.  A process marked
                               “&lt;defunct&gt;” is partly dead, waiting to be
                               fully destroyed by its parent.  Sometimes
                               the process arguments will be
                               unavailable; when this happens, <b>ps</b>
                               instead reports the executable name in
                               brackets.  (alias <b>cmd</b>, <b>command</b>).  See
                               also the <b>comm </b>format keyword, the <b>-f</b>
                               option, and the <b>c </b>option.

                               When specified last, this column will
                               extend to the edge of the display.  If <b>ps</b>
                               can not determine the display width, as
                               when output is redirected (piped) into a
                               file or another command, the output width
                               is undefined (it may be 80, unlimited,
                               determined by the <b>TERM </b>variable, and so
                               on).  The <b>COLUMNS </b>environment variable or
                               <b>--cols </b>option may be used to exactly
                               determine the width in this case.  The <b>w</b>
                               or <b>-w </b>option may be also be used to
                               adjust width.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables could affect <b>ps</b>:

       <b>COLUMNS</b>
          Override default display width.

       <b>LINES</b>
          Override default display height.

       <b>PS_PERSONALITY</b>
          Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital... (see
          section <b>PERSONALITY </b>below).

       <b>CMD_ENV</b>
          Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital... (see
          section <b>PERSONALITY </b>below).

       <b>I_WANT_A_BROKEN_PS</b>
          Force obsolete command line interpretation.

       <b>LC_TIME</b>
          Date format.

       <b>LIBPROC_HIDE_KERNEL</b>
          Set this to any value to hide kernel threads normally
          displayed with the <b>-e </b>option. This is equivalent to selecting
          <b>--ppid 2 -p 2 --deselect </b>instead. Also works in BSD mode.

       <b>PS_COLORS</b>
          Not currently supported.

       <b>PS_FORMAT</b>
          Default output format override. You may set this to a format
          string of the type used for the <b>-o </b>option.  The <b>DefSysV </b>and
          <b>DefBSD </b>values are particularly useful.

       <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>
          Don't find excuses to ignore bad "features".

       <b>POSIX2</b>
          When set to "on", acts as <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT</b>.

       <b>UNIX95</b>
          Don't find excuses to ignore bad "features".

       <b>_XPG</b>
          Cancel <b>CMD_ENV</b>=<i>irix</i> non-standard behavior.

       In general, it is a bad idea to set these variables.  The one
       exception is <b>CMD_ENV </b>or <b>PS_PERSONALITY</b>, which could be set to
       Linux for normal systems.  Without that setting, <b>ps </b>follows the
       useless and bad parts of the Unix98 standard.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The fields <b>bsdstart </b>and <b>start </b>will only show the abbreviated
       month name in English. The fields <b>lstart </b>and <b>stime </b>will show the
       abbreviated month name in the configured locale but may exceed
       the column width due to the different lengths for abbreviated
       month and day names across languages.

AUTHOR </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ps </b>was originally written by Branko Lankester ⟨lankeste@fwi.uva.
       nl⟩.  Michael K. Johnson ⟨johnsonm@redhat.com⟩ re-wrote it
       significantly to use the proc filesystem, changing a few things
       in the process.  Michael Shields ⟨mjshield@nyx.cs.du.edu⟩ added
       the pid-list feature.  Charles Blake ⟨cblake@bbn.com⟩ added
       multi-level sorting, the dirent-style library, the device
       name-to-number mmaped database, the approximate binary search
       directly on System.map, and many code and documentation cleanups.
       David Mossberger-Tang wrote the generic BFD support for psupdate.
       Albert Cahalan ⟨albert@users.sf.net⟩ rewrote ps for full Unix98
       and BSD support, along with some ugly hacks for obsolete and
       foreign syntax.
