NAME </h2>
<pre>
       yum-ovl - Performs an initial copy-up of yum(8) package database.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d </b><i>debug-level</i> If debug level is <i>2</i> and more, print out the number
       of files copied up from the lower layer
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Opening a file on OverlayFS in read-only mode causes the file
       from
       lower layer to be opened, then later on, if the same file is
       opened
       in write mode, a copy-up into the upper    layer    takes
       place,
       resulting into a <b>new </b>file being opened.
       Since yum(8) needs to open the <b>RPMdb </b>first read-only, and then
       also with write access, we need to copy-up the files beforehand
       to
       make sure that the access is consistent.
</pre> <h2>
