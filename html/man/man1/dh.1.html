SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh </b><i>sequence</i> [<b>--with </b><i>addon</i>[<b>,</b><i>addon</i> ...]] [<b>--list</b>]

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh </b>runs a sequence of debhelper commands. The supported <i>sequence</i>s
       correspond to the targets of a <i>debian/rules</i> file: <b>build-arch</b>,
       <b>build-indep</b>, <b>build</b>, <b>clean</b>, <b>install-indep</b>, <b>install-arch</b>, <b>install</b>,
       <b>binary-arch</b>, <b>binary-indep</b>, and <b>binary</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OVERRIDE AND HOOK TARGETS </h2>
<pre>
       A <i>debian/rules</i> file using <b>dh </b>can override the command that is run
       at any step in a sequence, by defining an override target.  It is
       also possible to inject a command before or after any step
       without affecting the step itself.

   <b>Injecting commands before or after a step</b>
       <i>Note</i>: This feature requires debhelper 12.8 or later plus the
       package must use compatibility mode 10 or later.

       To inject commands before <i>dh_command</i>, add a target named
       <b>execute_before_</b><i>dh_command</i> to the rules files.  Similarly, if you
       want to inject commands after <i>dh_command</i>, add the target
       <b>execute_after_</b><i>dh_command</i>.  Both targets can be used for the same
       <i>dh_command</i> and also even if the command is overridden (as
       described in "Overriding a command" below).

       When these targets are defined, <b>dh </b>will call the targets
       respectively before or after it would invoke <i>dh_command</i> (or its
       override target).

   <b>Overriding a command</b>
       To override <i>dh_command</i>, add a target named <b>override_</b><i>dh_command</i> to
       the rules file. When it would normally run <i>dh_command</i>, <b>dh </b>will
       instead call that target. The override target can then run the
       command with additional options, or run entirely different
       commands instead. See examples below.

   <b>Architecture dependent/independent override and hook targets</b>
       The override and hook targets can also be defined to run only
       when building architecture dependent or architecture independent
       packages. Use targets with names like <b>override_</b><i>dh_command</i><b>-arch</b>
       and <b>execute_after_</b><i>dh_command</i><b>-indep</b>.

       This feature is available since debhelper 8.9.7 (for override
       targets) and 12.8 (for hook targets).

   <b>Completely empty targets</b>
       As a special optimization, <b>dh </b>will skip a target if it is
       completely empty and does not depend on any other target.  This
       is mostly useful for override targets, where the command will
       simply be skipped without the overhead of invoking a dummy
       target.

       Note that the target has to be completely empty for this to work:

            # Skip dh_bar - the good and optimized way
            # Some rationale for skipping dh_bar goes here
            override_dh_bar:

            # Skip dh_foo - the slow way
            override_dh_foo:
               # Some rationale for skipping dh_foo goes here
               # (these comments causes a dummy target to be run)

   <b>Verifying targets are picked up by dh</b>
       As of debhelper 13.10, you can use <a href="dh_assistant.1.html">dh_assistant(1)</a> to see which
       override and hook targets will be seen by <b>dh</b>.  Here is an example
       run of <a href="dh_assistant.1.html">dh_assistant(1)</a> along with its output:

           $ dh_assistant detect-hook-targets
           {
              "commands-not-in-path": [
                 "dh_foo"
              ],
              "hook-targets": [
                 {
                    "command": "dh_strip_nondeterminism",
                    "is-empty": true,
                    "package-section-param": null,
                    "target-name": "override_dh_strip_nondeterminism"
                 },
                 {
                    "command": "dh_foo",
                    "is-empty": false,
                    "package-section-param": "-a",
                    "target-name": "override_dh_foo-arch"
                 }
              ]
           }

       The <b>commands-not-in-path </b>is useful for spotting mistakes in the
       hook target names.  A non-empty value implies one of more hook
       targets are related to a command that is either not installed or
       no command with that name exists at all.  It is generally worth
       double checking these.

       Additionally, the <b>is-empty </b>attribute for each hook target can be
       used for seeing whether a hook target triggers the "Completely
       empty targets" optimization.

       If you are interested in the other attributes, please read the
       <a href="dh_assistant.1.html">dh_assistant(1)</a> for the details.

       <i>Verifying targets are picked up by dh (when debhelper is older</i>
       <i>than 13.10)</i>

       On older versions of debhelper, you have to use <b>dh </b>with <b>--no-act</b>.
       You can use the following command as an example:

           $ dh binary --no-act | grep dh_install | head -n5
                dh_installdirs
                dh_install
                debian/rules execute_after_dh_install
                dh_installdocs
                dh_installchangelogs

       The <b>debian/rules execute_after_dh_install </b>in the output, which
       signals that <b>dh </b>registered a <b>execute_after_dh_install </b>target and
       would run it directly after <a href="dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a>.

       Note that "Completely empty targets" will be omitted in the
       listing above.  This makes it a bit harder to spot as you are
       looking for the omission of a command name.  But otherwise, the
       principle remains the same.

   <b>Caveats with hook targets and makefile conditionals</b>
       If you choose to wrap a hook target in makefile conditionals,
       please be aware that <b>dh </b>computes all the hook targets a head of
       time and caches the result for that run.  Furthermore, the
       conditionals will be invoked again when <b>dh </b>calls the hook target
       later and will assume the answer did not change.

       The parsing and caching <i>often</i> happens before <b>dh </b>knows whether it
       will build arch:any (-a) or/and arch:all (-i) packages, which can
       produce confusing results - especially when <a href="dh_listpackages.1.html">dh_listpackages(1)</a> is
       part of the conditional.

       Most of the problems can be avoided by making the hook target
       unconditional and then have the "body" be partially or completely
       conditional.  As an example:

             # SIMPLE: It is well-defined what happens.  The hook target
             # is always considered.  The "maybe run this" bit is
             # conditional but dh_foo is definitely skipped.
             #
             # Note: The conditional is evaluated "twice" where its
             # influences what happens.  Once when dh check which hook
             # targets exist and once when the override_dh_foo hook target
             # is run.  If *either* times return false, "maybe run this"
             # is skipped.
             override_dh_foo:
             ifneq (...)
                 maybe run this
             endif

             # SIMPLE: This is also well-defined.  The hook target is always
             # run and dh_bar is skipped.  The "maybe run this" bit is
             # conditional as one might expect.
             #
             # Note: The conditional is still evaluated multiple times (in
             # different process each time).  However, only the evaluation
             # that happens when the hook target is run influences what
             # happens.
             override_dh_bar:
                 : # Dummy command to force the target to always be run
             ifneq (...)
                 maybe run this
             endif

             # COMPLICATED: This case can be non-trivial and have sharp edges.
             # Use at your own peril if dh_listpackages in the conditional.
             #
             # Here, either dh_baz is run normally OR "maybe run this" is run
             # instead.
             #
             # And it gets even more complicated to reason about if dh needs to
             # recurse into debian/rules because you have an "explicit"
             # standard target (e.g. a "build-arch:" target separate from "%:").
             ifneq (...)
             override_dh_baz:
                 maybe run this
             endif

       These recipes are also relevant for conditional dependency
       targets, which are often seen in a variant of the following
       example:

             COND_TASKS =
             ifneq (...)
             COND_TASKS += maybe-run-this
             endif
             ...

             maybe-run-this:
                 ...

             # SIMPLE: It is well-defined what happens.  Either the
             # $(COND_TASKS) are skipped or run.
             #
             # Note: The conditional is evaluated "twice" where its
             # influences what happens.  Once when dh check which hook
             # targets exist and once when the override_dh_foo hook target
             # is run.  If *either* times return false, $(COND_TASKS)
             # is skipped.
             override_dh_foo: $(COND_TASKS)

             # SIMPLE: This is also well-defined.  The hook target is always
             # run and dh_bar is skipped.  The $(COND_TASKS) bit is
             # conditional as one might expect.
             #
             # Note: The conditional is still evaluated multiple times (in
             # different process each time).  However, only the evaluation
             # that happens when the hook target is run influences what
             # happens.
             override_dh_bar: $(COND_TASKS)
                 : # Dummy command to force the target to always be run

             # COMPLICATED: This case can be non-trivial and have sharp edges.
             # Use at your own peril if dh_listpackages in the conditional.
             #
             ifneq (...)
             override_dh_baz: $(COND_TASKS)
             endif

       When in doubt, pick the relevant <b>SIMPLE </b>case in the examples
       above that match your need.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--with </b><i>addon</i>[<b>,</b><i>addon</i> ...]
           Add the debhelper commands specified by the given addon to
           appropriate places in the sequence of commands that is run.
           This option can be repeated more than once, or multiple
           addons can be listed, separated by commas.  This is used when
           there is a third-party package that provides debhelper
           commands. See the <i>PROGRAMMING</i> file for documentation about
           the sequence addon interface.

           A <b>Build-Depends </b>relation on the package <b>dh-sequence-</b><i>addon</i>
           implies a <b>--with </b><i>addon</i>. This avoids the need for an explicit
           <b>--with </b>in <i>debian/rules</i> that only duplicates what is already
           declared via the build dependencies in <i>debian/control</i>.  The
           relation can (since 12.5) be made optional via e.g.  build-
           profiles.  This enables you to easily disable an addon that
           is only useful with certain profiles (e.g. to facilitate
           bootstrapping).

           Since debhelper 12.5, addons can also be activated in
           <b>indep</b>-only mode (via <b>Build-Depends-Indep</b>) or <b>arch</b>-only mode
           (via <b>Build-Depends-Arch</b>). Such addons are only active in the
           particular sequence (e.g. <b>binary-indep</b>) which simplifies
           dependency management for cross-builds.

           Please note that addons activated via <b>Build-Depends-Indep </b>or
           <b>Build-Depends-Arch </b>are subject to additional limitations to
           ensure the result is deterministic even when the addon is
           unavailable (e.g. during clean).  This implies that some
           addons are incompatible with these restrictions and can only
           be used via <b>Build-Depends </b>(or manually via <i>debian/rules</i>).
           Currently, such addons can only add commands to sequences.

       <b>--without </b><i>addon</i>
           The inverse of <b>--with</b>, disables using the given addon. This
           option can be repeated more than once, or multiple addons to
           disable can be listed, separated by commas.

       <b>--list</b>, <b>-l</b>
           List all available addons.

           When called only with this option, <b>dh </b>can be called from any
           directory (i.e. it does not need access to files from a
           source package).

       <b>--no-act</b>
           Prints commands that would run for a given sequence, but does
           not run them.

           Note that dh normally skips running commands that it knows
           will do nothing.  With --no-act, the full list of commands in
           a sequence is printed.

       Other options passed to <b>dh </b>are passed on to each command it runs.
       This can be used to set an option like <b>-v </b>or <b>-X </b>or <b>-N</b>, as well as
       for more specialised options.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To see what commands are included in a sequence, without actually
       doing anything:

               dh binary-arch --no-act

       This is a very simple rules file, for packages where the default
       sequences of commands work with no additional options.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

       Often you'll want to pass an option to a specific debhelper
       command. The easy way to do with is by adding an override target
       for that command.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               override_dh_strip:
                       dh_strip -Xfoo

               override_dh_auto_configure:
                       dh_auto_configure -- --with-foo --disable-bar

       Sometimes the automated <a href="dh_auto_configure.1.html">dh_auto_configure(1)</a> and <a href="dh_auto_build.1.html">dh_auto_build(1)</a>
       can't guess what to do for a strange package. Here's how to avoid
       running either and instead run your own commands.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               override_dh_auto_configure:
                       ./mondoconfig

               override_dh_auto_build:
                       make universe-explode-in-delight

       Another common case is wanting to do something manually before or
       after a particular debhelper command is run.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               # Example assumes debhelper/12.8 and compat 10+
               execute_after_dh_fixperms:
                       chmod 4755 debian/foo/usr/bin/foo

       If you are on an older debhelper or compatibility level, the
       above example would have to be written as.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               # Older debhelper versions or using compat 9 or lower.
               override_dh_fixperms:
                       dh_fixperms
                       chmod 4755 debian/foo/usr/bin/foo

       Python tools are not run by dh by default, due to the continual
       change in that area. Here is how to use <b>dh_python2</b>.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --with python2

       Here is how to force use of Perl's <b>Module::Build </b>build system,
       which can be necessary if debhelper wrongly detects that the
       package uses MakeMaker.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --buildsystem=perl_build

       Here is an example of overriding where the <b>dh_auto_</b><i>*</i> commands
       find the package's source, for a package where the source is
       located in a subdirectory.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --sourcedirectory=src

       And here is an example of how to tell the <b>dh_auto_</b><i>*</i> commands to
       build in a subdirectory, which will be removed on <b>clean</b>.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --builddirectory=build

       If your package can be built in parallel, please either use
       compat 10 or pass <b>--parallel </b>to dh. Then <b>dpkg-buildpackage -j</b>
       will work.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --parallel

       If your package cannot be built reliably while using multiple
       threads, please pass <b>--no-parallel </b>to dh (or the relevant
       <b>dh_auto_</b><i>*</i> command):

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --no-parallel

       Here is a way to prevent <b>dh </b>from running several commands that
       you don't want it to run, by defining empty override targets for
       each command.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               # Commands not to run:
               override_dh_auto_test override_dh_compress override_dh_fixperms:

       A long build process for a separate documentation package can be
       separated out using architecture independent overrides.  These
       will be skipped when running build-arch and binary-arch
       sequences.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               override_dh_auto_build-indep:
                       $(MAKE) -C docs

               # No tests needed for docs
               override_dh_auto_test-indep:

               override_dh_auto_install-indep:
                       $(MAKE) -C docs install

       Adding to the example above, suppose you need to chmod a file,
       but only when building the architecture dependent package, as
       it's not present when building only documentation.

DEBHELPER PROVIDED DH ADDONS </h2>
<pre>
       The primary purpose of <b>dh </b>addons is to provide easy integration
       with third-party provided features for debhelper.  However,
       debhelper itself also provide a few sequences that can be useful
       in some cases.  These are documented in this list:

       build-stamp
           A special addon for controlling whether <b>dh </b>(in compat 10 or
           later) will create stamp files to tell whether the build
           target has been run successfully. See "INTERNALS" for more
           details.

           This addon is active by default but can disabled by using <b>dh</b>
           <b>$@ --without build-stamp</b>

       dwz (obsolete)
           Adds <a href="dh_dwz.1.html">dh_dwz(1)</a> to the sequence in compat level 11 or below.
           Obsolete in compat 12 or later.

       elf-tools
           This addon adds tools related to ELF files to the sequence
           such as <a href="dh_strip.1.html">dh_strip(1)</a> and <a href="dh_shlibdeps.1.html">dh_shlibdeps(1)</a>

           This addon is <i>conditionally</i> active by default for
           architecture specific packages - that is, it is skipped for
           arch:all packages.  In the special case where you need these
           tools to work on arch:all packages, you can use <b>--with elf-</b>
           <b>tools </b>to activate it unconditionally.

       installinitramfs (obsolete)
           Adds <a href="dh_installinitramfs.1.html">dh_installinitramfs(1)</a> to the sequence in compat level
           11 or below.  Obsolete in compat 12 or later.

       root-sequence (internal)
           This is reserved for internal usage.

       single-binary
           A special-purpose addon that makes debhelper run in "single
           binary" mode.

           When active, it will pass <b>--destdir=debian/<i>package</i>/ </b>to
           <a href="dh_auto_install.1.html">dh_auto_install(1)</a>.  This makes every file "installed" by the
           upstream build system part of the (only) binary package by
           default without having to use other helpers such as
           <a href="dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a>.

           The addon will refuse to activate when the source package
           lists 2 or more binary packages in <i>debian/control</i> as a
           precaution.

           Before compat 15. this behaviour was the default when there
           was only a single binary package listed in <i>debian/control</i>.
           In compat 15 and later, this addon must explicitly be
           activated for this feature to work.

           The rationale for requiring this as an explicit choice is
           that if it is implicit then debhelper will silently change
           behaviour on adding a new binary package.  This has caused
           many RC bugs when maintainers renamed a binary and added
           transitional packages with the intention of supporting
           seamless upgrades.  The result would often be two empty
           binary packages that were uploaded to archive with users
           frustrated as their "upgrade" removed their programs.

       systemd (obsolete)
           Adds <a href="dh_systemd_enable.1.html">dh_systemd_enable(1)</a> and <a href="dh_systemd_start.1.html">dh_systemd_start(1)</a> to the
           sequence in compat level 10 or below.  Obsolete in compat 11
           or later.
</pre> <h2>
INTERNALS </h2>
<pre>
       If you're curious about <b>dh</b>'s internals, here's how it works under
       the hood.

       In compat 10 (or later), <b>dh </b>creates a stamp file
       <i>debian/debhelper-build-stamp</i> after the build step(s) are complete
       to avoid re-running them.  It is possible to avoid the stamp file
       by passing <b>--without=build-stamp </b>to <b>dh</b>.  This makes "no clean"
       builds behave more like what some people expect at the expense of
       possibly running the build and test twice (the second time as
       root or under <b>fakeroot</b>(1)).

       Inside an override target, <b>dh_* </b>commands will create a log file
       <i>debian/package.debhelper.log</i> to keep track of which packages the
       command(s) have been run for.  These log files are then removed
       once the override target is complete.

       In compat 9 or earlier, each debhelper command will record when
       it's successfully run in <i>debian/package.debhelper.log</i>. (Which
       <b>dh_clean </b>deletes.) So <b>dh </b>can tell which commands have already
       been run, for which packages, and skip running those commands
       again.

       Each time <b>dh </b>is run (in compat 9 or earlier), it examines the
       log, and finds the last logged command that is in the specified
       sequence. It then continues with the next command in the
       sequence.

       A sequence can also run dependent targets in debian/rules.  For
       example, the "binary" sequence runs the "install" target.

       <b>dh </b>uses the <b>DH_INTERNAL_OPTIONS </b>environment variable to pass
       information through to debhelper commands that are run inside
       override targets. The contents (and indeed, existence) of this
       environment variable, as the name might suggest, is subject to
       change at any time.

       Commands in the <b>build-indep</b>, <b>install-indep </b>and <b>binary-indep</b>
       sequences are passed the <b>-i </b>option to ensure they only work on
       architecture independent packages, and commands in the <b>build-</b>
       <b>arch</b>, <b>install-arch </b>and <b>binary-arch </b>sequences are passed the <b>-a</b>
       option to ensure they only work on architecture dependent
       packages.
