</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>grep</i> utility shall search the input files, selecting lines
       matching one or more patterns; the types of patterns are
       controlled by the options specified. The patterns are specified
       by the <b>-e </b>option, <b>-f </b>option, or the <i>pattern_list</i> operand. The
       <i>pattern_list</i>'s value shall consist of one or more patterns
       separated by &lt;newline&gt; characters; the <i>pattern_file</i>'s contents
       shall consist of one or more patterns terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;
       character. By default, an input line shall be selected if any
       pattern, treated as an entire basic regular expression (BRE) as
       described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section</i>
       <i>9.3</i>, <i>Basic Regular Expressions</i>, matches any part of the line
       excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;; a null BRE shall match every
       line. By default, each selected input line shall be written to
       the standard output.

       Regular expression matching shall be based on text lines. Since a
       &lt;newline&gt; separates or terminates patterns (see the <b>-e </b>and <b>-f</b>
       options below), regular expressions cannot contain a &lt;newline&gt;.
       Similarly, since patterns are matched against individual lines
       (excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; characters) of the input,
       there is no way for a pattern to match a &lt;newline&gt; found in the
       input.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>grep</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-E        </b>Match using extended regular expressions.  Treat each
                 pattern specified as an ERE, as described in the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 9.4</i>,
                 <i>Extended Regular Expressions</i>.  If any entire ERE
                 pattern matches some part of an input line excluding
                 the terminating &lt;newline&gt;, the line shall be matched. A
                 null ERE shall match every line.

       <b>-F        </b>Match using fixed strings. Treat each pattern specified
                 as a string instead of a regular expression. If an
                 input line contains any of the patterns as a contiguous
                 sequence of bytes, the line shall be matched.  A null
                 string shall match every line.

       <b>-c        </b>Write only a count of selected lines to standard
                 output.

       <b>-e </b><i>pattern_list</i>
                 Specify one or more patterns to be used during the
                 search for input.  The application shall ensure that
                 patterns in <i>pattern_list</i> are separated by a &lt;newline&gt;.
                 A null pattern can be specified by two adjacent
                 &lt;newline&gt; characters in <i>pattern_list</i>.  Unless the <b>-E </b>or
                 <b>-F </b>option is also specified, each pattern shall be
                 treated as a BRE, as described in the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 9.3</i>, <i>Basic Regular</i>
                 <i>Expressions</i>.  Multiple <b>-e </b>and <b>-f </b>options shall be
                 accepted by the <i>grep</i> utility. All of the specified
                 patterns shall be used when matching lines, but the
                 order of evaluation is unspecified.

       <b>-f </b><i>pattern_file</i>
                 Read one or more patterns from the file named by the
                 pathname <i>pattern_file</i>.  Patterns in <i>pattern_file</i> shall
                 be terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;.  A null pattern can be
                 specified by an empty line in <i>pattern_file</i>.  Unless the
                 <b>-E </b>or <b>-F </b>option is also specified, each pattern shall
                 be treated as a BRE, as described in the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 9.3</i>, <i>Basic</i>
                 <i>Regular Expressions</i>.

       <b>-i        </b>Perform pattern matching in searches without regard to
                 case; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <i>Section 9.2</i>, <i>Regular Expression General Requirements</i>.

       <b>-l        </b>(The letter ell.) Write only the names of files
                 containing selected lines to standard output. Pathnames
                 shall be written once per file searched. If the
                 standard input is searched, a pathname of
                 <b>"(standard</b>input)" shall be written, in the POSIX
                 locale. In other locales, <b>"standard</b>input" may be
                 replaced by something more appropriate in those
                 locales.

       <b>-n        </b>Precede each output line by its relative line number in
                 the file, each file starting at line 1. The line number
                 counter shall be reset for each file processed.

       <b>-q        </b>Quiet. Nothing shall be written to the standard output,
                 regardless of matching lines. Exit with zero status if
                 an input line is selected.

       <b>-s        </b>Suppress the error messages ordinarily written for
                 nonexistent or unreadable files. Other error messages
                 shall not be suppressed.

       <b>-v        </b>Select lines not matching any of the specified
                 patterns. If the <b>-v </b>option is not specified, selected
                 lines shall be those that match any of the specified
                 patterns.

       <b>-x        </b>Consider only input lines that use all characters in
                 the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; to match
                 an entire fixed string or regular expression to be
                 matching lines.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>pattern_list</i>
                 Specify one or more patterns to be used during the
                 search for input.  This operand shall be treated as if
                 it were specified as <b>-e </b><i>pattern_list</i>.

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file to be searched for the patterns.
                 If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, the standard input
                 shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used if no <i>file</i> operands are
       specified, and shall be used if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-' </b>and the
       implementation treats the <b>'-' </b>as meaning standard input.
       Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT
       FILES section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be text files.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>grep</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                 elements within regular expressions.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files) and the
                 behavior of character classes within regular
                 expressions.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>-l </b>option is in effect, the following shall be written for
       each file containing at least one selected input line:

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>file</i>&gt;

       Otherwise, if more than one <i>file</i> argument appears, and <b>-q </b>is not
       specified, the <i>grep</i> utility shall prefix each output line by:

           "%s:", &lt;<i>file</i>&gt;

       The remainder of each output line shall depend on the other
       options specified:

        *  If the <b>-c </b>option is in effect, the remainder of each output
           line shall contain:

               "%d\n", &lt;<i>count</i>&gt;

        *  Otherwise, if <b>-c </b>is not in effect and the <b>-n </b>option is in
           effect, the following shall be written to standard output:

               "%d:", &lt;<i>line number</i>&gt;

        *  Finally, the following shall be written to standard output:

               "%s", &lt;<i>selected-line contents</i>&gt;
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    One or more lines were selected.

        1    No lines were selected.

       &gt;1    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>-q </b>option is specified, the exit status shall be zero if
       an input line is selected, even if an error was detected.
       Otherwise, default actions shall be performed.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Care should be taken when using characters in <i>pattern_list</i> that
       may also be meaningful to the command interpreter. It is safest
       to enclose the entire <i>pattern_list</i> argument in single-quotes:

           '...'

       The <b>-e </b><i>pattern_list</i> option has the same effect as the
       <i>pattern_list</i> operand, but is useful when <i>pattern_list</i> begins with
       the &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; delimiter. It is also useful when it is more
       convenient to provide multiple patterns as separate arguments.

       Multiple <b>-e </b>and <b>-f </b>options are accepted and <i>grep</i> uses all of the
       patterns it is given while matching input text lines.  (Note that
       the order of evaluation is not specified. If an implementation
       finds a null string as a pattern, it is allowed to use that
       pattern first, matching every line, and effectively ignore any
       other patterns.)

       The <b>-q </b>option provides a means of easily determining whether or
       not a pattern (or string) exists in a group of files. When
       searching several files, it provides a performance improvement
       (because it can quit as soon as it finds the first match) and
       requires less care by the user in choosing the set of files to
       supply as arguments (because it exits zero if it finds a match
       even if <i>grep</i> detected an access or read error on earlier <i>file</i>
       operands).

       When using <i>grep</i> to process pathnames, it is recommended that
       LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or
       C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences
       that do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case
       the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale
       each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this
       problem is avoided.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. To find all uses of the word <b>"Posix" </b>(in any case) in file
           <b>text.mm </b>and write with line numbers:

               grep -i -n posix text.mm

        2. To find all empty lines in the standard input:

               grep ^$

           or:

               grep -v .

        3. Both of the following commands print all lines containing
           strings <b>"abc" </b>or <b>"def" </b>or both:

               grep -E 'abc|def'

               grep -F 'abc
               def'

        4. Both of the following commands print all lines matching
           exactly <b>"abc" </b>or <b>"def"</b>:

               grep -E '^abc$|^def$'

               grep -F -x 'abc
               def'
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       This <i>grep</i> has been enhanced in an upwards-compatible way to
       provide the exact functionality of the historical <i>egrep</i> and <i>fgrep</i>
       commands as well. It was the clear intention of the standard
       developers to consolidate the three <i>grep</i>s into a single command.

       The old <i>egrep</i> and <i>fgrep</i> commands are likely to be supported for
       many years to come as implementation extensions, allowing
       historical applications to operate unmodified.

       Historical implementations usually silently ignored all but one
       of multiply-specified <b>-e </b>and <b>-f </b>options, but were not consistent
       as to which specification was actually used.

       The <b>-b </b>option was omitted from the OPTIONS section because block
       numbers are implementation-defined.

       The System V restriction on using <b>- </b>to mean standard input was
       omitted.

       A definition of action taken when given a null BRE or ERE is
       specified.  This is an error condition in some historical
       implementations.

       The <b>-l </b>option previously indicated that its use was undefined
       when no files were explicitly named. This behavior was historical
       and placed an unnecessary restriction on future implementations.
       It has been removed.

       The historical BSD <i>grep</i> <b>-s </b>option practice is easily duplicated
       by redirecting standard output to <b>/dev/null</b>.  The <b>-s </b>option
       required here is from System V.

       The <b>-x </b>option, historically available only with <i>fgrep</i>, is
       available here for all of the non-obsolescent versions.
