Description </h2>
<pre>
       <i>chem</i> produces chemical structure diagrams.  Today's version is
       best suited for organic chemistry (bonds, rings).  The <i>chem</i>
       program is a <i>groff</i> preprocessor like <i>eqn</i>, <i>pic</i>, <i>tbl</i>, etc.  It
       generates <i>pic</i> output such that all <i>chem</i> parts are translated into
       diagrams of the <i>pic</i> language.

       If no operands are given, or if <i>file</i> is “<b>-</b>”, <i>chem</i> reads the
       standard input stream.  <b>-h </b>and <b>--help </b>display a usage message,
       whereas <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>display version information; all exit.

       The program <i>chem</i> originates from the Perl source file <i>chem.pl</i>.
       It tells <i>pic</i> to include a copy of the macro file <i>chem.pic</i>.
       Moreover the <i>groff</i> source file <i>pic.tmac</i> is loaded.

       In a style reminiscent of <i>eqn</i> and <i>pic</i>, the <i>chem</i> diagrams are
       written in a special language.

       A set of <i>chem</i> lines looks like this

              .cstart
              <i>chem data</i>
              .cend

       Lines containing the keywords <b>.cstart </b>and <b>.cend </b>start and end the
       input for <i>chem</i>, respectively.  In <i>pic</i> context, i.e., after the
       call of <b>.PS</b>, <i>chem</i> input can optionally be started by the line
       <b>begin chem </b>and ended by the line with the single word <b>end</b>
       instead.

       Anything outside these initialization lines is copied through
       without modification; all data between the initialization lines
       is converted into <i>pic</i> commands to draw the diagram.

       As an example,

              .cstart
              CH3
              bond
              CH3
              .cend

       prints two <b>CH3 </b>groups with a bond between them.

       If you want to create just <i>groff</i> output, you must run <i>chem</i>
       followed by <i>groff</i> with the option <b>-p </b>for the activation of <i>pic</i>:

              <i>chem</i> [<i>file</i> ...] <b>| groff -p </b>...
</pre> <h2>
Language </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>chem</i> input language is rather small.  It provides rings of
       several styles and a way to glue them together as desired, bonds
       of several styles, moieties (e.g., <b>C</b>, <b>NH3</b>, ..., and strings.

   <b>Setting variables</b>
       There are some variables that can be set by commands.  Such
       commands have two possible forms, either

              <i>variable value</i>

       or

              <i>variable</i> <b>= </b><i>value</i>

       This sets the given <i>variable</i> to the argument <i>value</i>.  If more
       arguments are given only the last argument is taken, all other
       arguments are ignored.

       There are only a few variables to be set by these commands:

       <b>textht </b><i>arg</i>
              Set the height of the text to <i>arg</i>; default is 0.16.

       <b>cwid </b><i>arg</i>
              Set the character width to <i>arg</i>; default is 0.12.

       <b>db </b><i>arg</i> Set the bond length to <i>arg</i>; default is 0.2.

       <b>size </b><i>arg</i>
              Scale the diagram to make it look plausible at point size
              <i>arg</i>; default is 10 point.

   <b>Bonds</b>
       <b>bond </b>[<i>direction</i>] [<i>length n</i>] [<b>from </b><i>Name</i>|<i>picstuff</i>]

       The <b>bond </b>command draws a single bond in direction from nearest
       corner of <i>Name</i>.  <b>bond </b>can also be <b>double bond</b>, <b>front bond</b>, <b>back</b>
       <b>bond</b>, etc.  (We will get back to <i>Name</i> soon.)

       <i>direction</i> is the angle in degrees (0 up, positive clockwise) or a
       direction word like <b>up</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>sw </b>(= southwest), etc.  If no
       direction is specified, the bond goes in the current direction
       (usually that of the last bond).

       Normally the bond begins at the last object placed;  this can be
       changed by naming a <b>from </b>place.  For instance, to make a simple
       alkyl chain:
              <b>CH3</b>
              <b>bond                </b>(this one goes right from the CH3)
              <b>C                   </b>(at the right end of the bond)
              <b>double bond up      </b>(from the C)
              <b>O                   </b>(at the end of the double bond)
              <b>bond right from C</b>
              <b>CH3</b>

       A length in inches may be specified to override the default
       length.  Other <i>pic</i> commands can be tacked on to the end of a bond
       command, to created dotted or dashed bonds or to specify a <b>to</b>
       place.

   <b>Rings</b>
       There are lots of rings, but only five- and six-sided rings get
       much support.  <b>ring </b>by itself is a six-sided ring; <b>benzene </b>is the
       benzene ring with a circle inside.  <b>aromatic </b>puts a circle into
       any kind of ring.

       <b>ring </b>[<b>pointing </b>(<b>up</b>|<b>right</b>|<b>left</b>|<b>down</b>)] [<b>aromatic</b>] [<b>put Mol at </b><i>n</i>]
            [<b>double </b><i>i</i>,<i>j k</i>,<i>l</i> ... [<i>picstuff</i>]

       The vertices of a ring are numbered 1, 2, ... from the vertex
       that points in the natural compass direction.  So for a hexagonal
       ring with the point at the top, the top vertex is 1, while if the
       ring has a point at the east side, that is vertex 1.  This is
       expressed as

              R1: ring pointing up
              R2: ring pointing right

       The ring vertices are named <b>.V1</b>, ..., <b>.V</b><i>n</i>, with <b>.V1 </b>in the
       pointing direction.  So the corners of <b>R1 </b>are <b>R1.V1 </b>(the <i>top</i>),
       <b>R1.V2</b>, <b>R1.V3</b>, <b>R1.V4 </b>(the <i>bottom</i>), etc., whereas for <b>R2</b>, <b>R2.V1 </b>is
       the rightmost vertex and <b>R2.V4 </b>the leftmost.  These vertex names
       are used for connecting bonds or other rings.  For example,

              R1: benzene pointing right
              R2: benzene pointing right with .V6 at R1.V2

       creates two benzene rings connected along a side.

       Interior double bonds are specified as <b>double </b><i>n1</i><b>,</b><i>n2 n3</i><b>,</b><i>n4</i> ...<b>;</b>
       each number pair adds an interior bond.  So the alternate form of
       a benzene ring is

              <b>ring double 1,2 3,4 5,6</b>

       Heterocycles (rings with something other than carbon at a vertex)
       are written as <b>put </b><i>X</i> <b>at </b><i>V</i>, as in

              <b>R: ring put N at 1 put O at 2</b>

       In this heterocycle, <b>R.N </b>and <b>R.O </b>become synonyms for <b>R.V1 </b>and
       <b>R.V2</b>.

       There are two five-sided rings.  <b>ring5 </b>is pentagonal with a side
       that matches the six-sided ring; it has four natural directions.
       A <b>flatring </b>is a five-sided ring created by chopping one corner of
       a six-sided ring so that it exactly matches the six-sided rings.

       The description of a ring has to fit on a single line.

   <b>Moieties and strings</b>
       A moiety is a string of characters beginning with a capital
       letter, such as N(C2H5)2.  Numbers are converted to subscripts
       (unless they appear to be fractional values, as in N2.5H).  The
       name of a moiety is determined from the moiety after special
       characters have been stripped out: e.g., N(C2H5)2) has the name
       NC2H52.

       Moieties can be specified in two kinds.  Normally a moiety is
       placed right after the last thing mentioned, separated by a
       semicolon surrounded by spaces, e.g.,

              <b>B1: bond ; OH</b>

       Here the moiety is <b>OH</b>; it is set after a bond.

       As the second kind a moiety can be positioned as the first word
       in a <i>pic</i>-like command, e.g.,

              <b>CH3 at C + (0.5,0.5)</b>

       Here the moiety is <b>CH3</b>.  It is placed at a position relative to
       <b>C</b>, a moiety used earlier in the chemical structure.

       So moiety names can be specified as <i>chem</i> positions everywhere in
       the <i>chem</i> code.  Beneath their printing moieties are names for
       places.

       The moiety <b>BP </b>is special.  It is not printed but just serves as a
       mark to be referred to in later <i>chem</i> commands.  For example,

              <b>bond ; BP</b>

       sets a mark at the end of the bond.  This can be used then for
       specifying a place.  The name <b>BP </b>is derived from <i>branch point</i>
       (i.e., line crossing).

       A string within double quotes <b>" </b>is interpreted as a part of a
       <i>chem</i> command.  It represents a string that should be printed
       (without the quotes).  Text within quotes <b>"</b>...<b>" </b>is treated more
       or less like a moiety except that no changes are made to the
       quoted part.

   <b>Names</b>
       In the alkyl chain above, notice that the carbon atom <b>C </b>was used
       both to draw something and as the name for a place.  A moiety
       always defines a name for a place;  you can use your own names
       for places instead, and indeed, for rings you will have to.  A
       name is just

              <i>Name</i><b>: </b>...

       <i>Name</i> is often the name of a moiety like <b>CH3</b>, but it need not to
       be.  Any name that begins with a capital letter and which
       contains only letters and numbers is valid.

              First: bond
                     "bond 30 from First"

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       The specific construction

              <b>bond </b>... <b>; moiety</b>

       is equivalent to

              bond
              moiety

       Otherwise, each item has to be on a separate line (and only one
       line).  Note that there must be whitespace after the semicolon
       which separates the commands.

       A period character <b>. </b>or a single quote <b>' </b>in the first column of a
       line signals a <i>troff</i> command, which is copied through as-is.

       A line whose first non-blank character is a hash character (<b>#</b>) is
       treated as a comment and thus ignored.  However, hash characters
       within a word are kept.

       A line whose first word is <b>pic </b>is copied through as-is after the
       word <b>pic </b>has been removed.

       The command

              <b>size </b><i>n</i>

       scales the diagram to make it look plausible at point size <i>n</i>
       (default is 10 point).

       Anything else is assumed to be <i>pic</i> code, which is copied through
       with a label.

       Since <i>chem</i> is a <i>pic</i> preprocessor, it is possible to include <i>pic</i>
       statements in the middle of a diagram to draw things not provided
       for by <i>chem</i> itself.  Such <i>pic</i> statements should be included in
       <i>chem</i> code by adding <b>pic </b>as the first word of this line for
       clarity.

       The following <i>pic</i> commands are accepted as <i>chem</i> commands, so no
       <b>pic </b>command word is needed:

              <b>define </b>Start the definition of <i>pic</i> macro within <i>chem</i>.

              <b>[      </b>Start a block composite.

              <b>]      </b>End a block composite.

              <b>{      </b>Start a macro definition block.

              <b>}      </b>End a macro definition block.

       The macro names from <b>define </b>statements are stored and their call
       is accepted as a <i>chem</i> command as well.

   <b>Wish list</b>
       This TODO list was collected by Brian Kernighan.

       Error checking is minimal; errors are usually detected and
       reported in an oblique fashion by <i>pic</i>.

       There is no library or file inclusion mechanism, and there is no
       shorthand for repetitive structures.

       The extension mechanism is to create <i>pic</i> macros, but these are
       tricky to get right and don't have all the properties of built-in
       objects.

       There is no in-line chemistry yet (e.g., analogous to the <b>$</b>...<b>$</b>
       construct of <i>eqn</i>).

       There is no way to control entry point for bonds on groups.
       Normally a bond connects to the carbon atom if entering from the
       top or bottom and otherwise to the nearest corner.

       Bonds from substituted atoms on heterocycles do not join at the
       proper place without adding a bit of <i>pic</i>.

       There is no decent primitive for brackets.

       Text (quoted strings) doesn't work very well.

       A squiggle bond is needed.
