NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-goto - Go to patch by pushing or popping as necessary
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg goto</i> [OPTIONS] &lt;patch&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Go to patch by pushing or popping as necessary
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -k, --keep
           Keep the local changes

       -m, --merged
           Check for patches merged upstream

       --committer-date-is-author-date
           Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
           the author date of the commit as the committer date.

       --conflicts[=&lt;policy&gt;]
           Either "allow" or "disallow" pushing a patch with conflicts.

           Using <b>--conflicts=allow </b>(or just <b>--conflicts</b>) allows pushing
           a patch that may result in unresolved merge conflicts. The
           patch will be pushed and files with conflicts will be left
           with conflict markers to be resolved manually; or the
           operation undone with <b>stg undo --hard</b>. This is the default
           behavior and also corresponds to the
           "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" variable being set to "true".

           Using <b>--conflicts=disallow </b>disallows pushing any patch that
           would result in merge conflicts. The operation will stop on
           the last patch that can be pushed without conflicts. This
           behavior can be configured by setting
           "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" to "false".
