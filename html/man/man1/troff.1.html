Description </h2>
<pre>
       GNU <i>troff</i> transforms <i>groff</i>(7) language input into the device-
       independent output format described in <i>groff_out</i>(5); <i>troff</i> is
       thus the heart of the GNU <i>roff</i> document formatting system.  If no
       <i>file</i> operands are present, or if <i>file</i> is “<b>-</b>”, <i>troff</i> reads the
       standard input stream.

       GNU <i>troff</i> is functionally compatible with the AT&amp;T <i>troff</i>
       typesetter and features numerous extensions.  Many people prefer
       to use the <i>groff</i>(1) command, a front end which also runs
       preprocessors and output drivers in the appropriate order and
       with appropriate options.
</pre> <h2>
Options </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-h </b>and <b>--help </b>display a usage message, while <b>-v </b>and <b>--version</b>
       show version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-a     </b>Generate a plain text approximation of the typeset output.
              The read-only register <b>.A </b>is set to 1.  This option
              produces a sort of abstract preview of the formatted
              output.

              •  Page breaks are marked by a phrase in angle brackets;
                 for example, “&lt;beginning of page&gt;”.

              •  Lines are broken where they would be in formatted
                 output.

              •  Vertical motion, apart from that implied by a break, is
                 not represented.

              •  A horizontal motion of any size is represented as one
                 space.  Adjacent horizontal motions are not combined.
                 Inter-sentence space nodes (those arising from the
                 second argument to the <b>.ss </b>request) are not
                 represented.

              •  A special character is rendered as its identifier
                 between angle brackets; for example, a hyphen appears
                 as “&lt;hy&gt;”.

              The above description should not be considered a
              specification; the details of <b>-a </b>output are subject to
              change.

       <b>-b     </b>Write a backtrace reporting the state of <i>troff</i>'s input
              parser to the standard error stream with each diagnostic
              message.  The line numbers given in the backtrace might
              not always be correct, because <i>troff</i>'s idea of line
              numbers can be confused by requests that append to macros.

       <b>-c     </b>Start with color output disabled.

       <b>-C     </b>Enable AT&amp;T <i>troff</i> compatibility mode; implies <b>-c</b>.  See
              <i>groff_diff</i>(7).

       <b>-d </b><i>ctext</i>
       <b>-d </b><i>string</i><b>=</b><i>text</i>
              Define <i>roff</i> string <i>c</i> or <i>string</i> as <i>text.</i>  <i>c</i> must be a one-
              character identifier; <i>string</i> can be of arbitrary length.
              Such assignments happen before any macro file is loaded,
              including the startup file.  Due to <i>getopt_long</i>(3)
              limitations, <i>c</i> cannot be, and <i>string</i> cannot contain, an
              equals sign, even though that is a valid character in a
              <i>roff</i> identifier.

       <b>-E     </b>Inhibit <i>troff</i> error messages; implies <b>-Ww</b>.  This option
              does <i>not</i> suppress messages sent to the standard error
              stream by documents or macro packages using <b>tm </b>or related
              requests.

       <b>-f </b><i>fam</i> Use <i>fam</i> as the default font family.

       <b>-F </b><i>dir</i> Search in directory <i>dir</i> for the selected output device's
              directory of device and font description files.  See the
              description of <i>GROFF_FONT_PATH</i> in section “Environment”
              below for the default search locations and ordering.

       <b>-i     </b>Read the standard input stream after all named input files
              have been processed.

       <b>-I </b><i>dir</i> Search the directory <i>dir</i> for files (those named on the
              command line; in <b>psbb</b>, <b>so</b>, and <b>soquiet </b>requests; and in
              “<b>\X'ps: import'</b>”, “<b>\X'ps: file'</b>”, and “<b>\X'pdf: pdfpic'</b>”
              device control escape sequences).  <b>-I </b>may be specified
              more than once; each <i>dir</i> is searched in the given order.
              To search the current working directory before others, add
              “<b>-I .</b>” at the desired place; it is otherwise searched
              last.  <b>-I </b>works similarly to, and is named for, the
              “include” option of Unix C compilers.

       <b>-m </b><i>mac</i> Search for the macro package mac<i>.tmac</i> and read it prior to
              any input files.  If not found, <i>tmac.</i>mac is attempted.
              See the description of <i>GROFF_TMAC_PATH</i> in section
              “Environment” below for the default search locations and
              ordering.

       <b>-M </b><i>dir</i> Search directory <i>dir</i> for macro files.  See the description
              of <i>GROFF_TMAC_PATH</i> in section “Environment” below for the
              default search locations and ordering.

       <b>-n </b><i>num</i> Begin numbering pages at <i>num.</i>  The default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>-o </b><i>list</i>
              Output only pages in <i>list,</i> which is a comma-separated list
              of inclusive page ranges; <i>n</i> means page <i>n, m</i><b>-</b><i>n</i> means every
              page between <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>, <b>-</b><i>n</i> means every page up to <i>n</i>, and <i>n</i><b>-</b>
              means every page from <i>n</i> on.  <i>troff</i> stops processing and
              exits after formatting the last page enumerated in <i>list.</i>

       <b>-r </b><i>cnumeric-expression</i>
       <b>-r </b><i>register</i><b>=</b><i>numeric-expression</i>
              Define <i>roff</i> register <i>c</i> or <i>register</i> as <i>numeric-expression.</i>
              <i>c</i> must be a one-character identifier; <i>register</i> can be of
              arbitrary length.  Such assignments happen before any
              macro file is loaded, including the startup file.  Due to
              <i>getopt_long</i>(3) limitations, <i>c</i> cannot be, and <i>register</i>
              cannot contain, an equals sign, even though that is a
              valid character in a <i>roff</i> identifier.

       <b>-R     </b>Don't load <i>troffrc</i> and <i>troffrc-end</i>.

       <b>-T </b><i>dev</i> Prepare output for device <i>dev.</i>  The default is <b>ps</b>; see
              <i>groff</i>(1).

       <b>-U     </b>Operate in <i>unsafe mode,</i> enabling the <b>open</b>, <b>opena</b>, <b>pi</b>, <b>pso</b>,
              and <b>sy </b>requests, which are disabled by default because
              they allow an untrusted input document to write to
              arbitrary file names and run arbitrary commands.  This
              option also adds the current directory to the macro
              package search path; see the <b>-m </b>and <b>-M </b>options above.

       <b>-w </b><i>cat</i>
       <b>-W </b><i>cat</i> Enable and inhibit, respectively, warnings in category
              <i>cat.</i>  See section “Warnings” below.

       <b>-z     </b>Suppress formatted output.
</pre> <h2>
Warnings </h2>
<pre>
       Warning diagnostics emitted by <i>troff</i> are divided into named,
       numbered categories.  The name associated with each warning
       category is used by the <b>-w </b>and <b>-W </b>options.  Each category is also
       assigned a power of two; the sum of enabled category codes is
       used by the <b>warn </b>request and the <b>.warn </b>register.  Warnings of
       each category are produced under the following circumstances.

       <b>break           </b>4   A filled output line could not be broken such
                           that its length was less than the output line
                           length <b>\n[.l]</b>.  This category is enabled by
                           default.

       <b>char            </b>1   No mounted font defines a glyph for the
                           requested character.  This category is
                           enabled by default.

       <b>color      </b>524288   An undefined color name was selected, an
                           attempt was made to define a color using an
                           unrecognized color space, an invalid
                           component in a color definition was
                           encountered, or an attempt was made to
                           redefine a default color.

       <b>delim           </b>8   The closing delimiter in an escape sequence
                           was missing or mismatched.

       <b>di            </b>256   A <b>di</b>, <b>da</b>, <b>box</b>, or <b>boxa </b>request was invoked
                           without an argument when there was no current
                           diversion.

       <b>escape      </b>32768   An unsupported escape sequence was
                           encountered.

       <b>file      </b>1048576   An attempt was made to load a file that does
                           not exist.  This category is enabled by
                           default.

       <b>font       </b>131072   A non-existent font was selected, or the
                           selection was ignored because a font
                           selection escape sequence was used after the
                           output line continuation escape sequence on
                           an input line.  This category is enabled by
                           default.

       <b>ig         </b>262144   An invalid escape sequence occurred in input
                           ignored using the <b>ig </b>request.  This warning
                           category diagnoses a condition that is an
                           error when it occurs in non-ignored input.

       <b>input       </b>16384   An invalid character occurred on the input
                           stream.

       <b>mac           </b>512   An undefined string, macro, or diversion was
                           used.  When such an object is dereferenced,
                           an empty one of that name is automatically
                           created.  So, unless it is later deleted, at
                           most one warning is given for each.

                           This warning is also emitted upon an attempt
                           to move an unplanted trap macro.  In such
                           cases, the unplanted macro is <i>not</i>
                           dereferenced, so it is not created if it does
                           not exist.

       <b>missing      </b>8192   A request was invoked with a mandatory
                           argument absent.

       <b>number          </b>2   An invalid numeric expression was
                           encountered.  This category is enabled by
                           default.

       <b>range          </b>64   A numeric expression was out of range for its
                           context.

       <b>reg          </b>1024   An undefined register was used.  When an
                           undefined register is dereferenced, it is
                           automatically defined with a value of 0.  So,
                           unless it is later deleted, at most one
                           warning is given for each.

       <b>right-brace  </b>4096   A right brace escape sequence <b>\} </b>was
                           encountered where a number was expected.

       <b>scale          </b>32   A scaling unit inappropriate to its context
                           was used in a numeric expression.

       <b>space       </b>65536   A space was missing between a request or
                           macro and its argument.  This warning is
                           produced when an undefined name longer than
                           two characters is encountered and the first
                           two characters of the name constitute a
                           defined name.  No request is invoked, no
                           macro called, and an empty macro is not
                           defined.  This category is enabled by
                           default.  It never occurs in compatibility
                           mode.

       <b>syntax        </b>128   A self-contradictory hyphenation mode was
                           requested; an empty or incomplete numeric
                           expression was encountered; an operand to a
                           numeric operator was missing; an attempt was
                           made to define a recursive, empty, or
                           nonsensical character class; or a <i>groff</i>
                           extension conditional expression operator was
                           used while in compatibility mode.

       <b>tab          </b>2048   A tab character was encountered where a
                           number was expected, or appeared in an
                           unquoted macro argument.

       Two warning names group other warning categories for convenience.

       <b>all    </b>All warning categories except <b>di</b>, <b>mac</b>, and <b>reg</b>.  This
              shorthand is intended to produce all warnings that are
              useful with macro packages and documents written for AT&amp;T
              <i>troff</i> and its descendants, which have less fastidious
              diagnostics than GNU <i>troff</i>.

       <b>w      </b>All warning categories.  Authors of documents and macro
              packages targeting <i>groff</i> are encouraged to use this
              setting.
</pre> <h2>
Environment </h2>
<pre>
       <i>GROFF_FONT_PATH</i> and <i>GROFF_TMAC_PATH</i> each accept a search path of
       directories; that is, a list of directory names separated by the
       system's path component separator character.  On Unix systems,
       this character is a colon (:); on Windows systems, it is a
       semicolon (;).

       <i>GROFF_FONT_PATH</i>
              A list of directories in which to seek the selected output
              device's directory of device and font description files.
              <i>troff</i> will scan directories given as arguments to any
              specified <b>-F </b>options before these, then in a site-specific
              directory (<i>/usr/local/share/groff/site-font</i>), a standard
              location (<i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font</i>), and a
              compatibility directory (<i>/usr/lib/font</i>) after them.

       <i>GROFF_TMAC_PATH</i>
              A list of directories in which to search for macro files.
              <i>troff</i> will scan directories given as arguments to any
              specified <b>-M </b>options before these, then the current
              directory (only if in unsafe mode), the user's home
              directory, a site-specific directory (<i>/usr/local/share/</i>
              <i>groff/site-tmac</i>), and a standard location (<i>/usr/local/</i>
              <i>share/groff/1.23.0/tmac</i>) after them.

       <i>GROFF_TYPESETTER</i>
              Set the default output device.  If empty or not set, <b>ps </b>is
              used.  The <b>-T </b>option overrides <i>GROFF_TYPESETTER</i>.

       <i>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</i>
              A timestamp (expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch) to
              use as the output creation timestamp in place of the
              current time.  The time is converted to human-readable
              form using <i>gmtime</i>(3) and <i>asctime</i>(3) when the formatter
              starts up and stored in registers usable by documents and
              macro packages.

       <i>TZ</i>     The time zone to use when converting the current time to
              human-readable form; see <i>tzset</i>(3).  If <i>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</i>
              is used, it is always converted to human-readable form
              using UTC.

Files </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/troffrc</i>
              is an initialization macro file loaded before any macro
              packages specified with <b>-m </b>options.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/troffrc-end</i>
              is an initialization macro file loaded after all macro
              packages specified with <b>-m </b>options.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/</i>name<i>.tmac</i>
              are macro files distributed with <i>groff</i>.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/dev</i>name<i>/DESC</i>
              describes the output device <i>name</i>.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/dev</i>name<i>/</i>F
              describes the font <i>F</i> of device <i>name.</i>

       <i>troffrc</i> and <i>troffrc-end</i> are sought neither in the current nor the
       home directory by default for security reasons, even if the <b>-U</b>
       option is specified.  Use the <b>-M </b>command-line option or the
       <i>GROFF_TMAC_PATH</i> environment variable to add these directories to
       the search path if necessary.
