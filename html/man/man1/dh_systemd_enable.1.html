</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_systemd_enable - enable/disable systemd unit files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_systemd_enable </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>--no-enable</b>] [<b>--name=</b><i>name</i>]
       [<i>unit file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_systemd_enable </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       enabling and disabling systemd unit files.

       In the simple case, it finds all unit files installed by a
       package (e.g.  bacula-fd.service) and enables them. It is not
       necessary that the machine actually runs systemd during package
       installation time, enabling happens on all machines in order to
       be able to switch from sysvinit to systemd and back.

       In the complex case, you can call <b>dh_systemd_enable </b>and
       <b>dh_systemd_start </b>manually (by overwriting the debian/rules
       targets) and specify flags per unit file. An example is colord,
       which ships colord.service, a dbus-activated service without an
       [Install] section. This service file cannot be enabled or
       disabled (a state called "static" by systemd) because it has no
       [Install] section. Therefore, running dh_systemd_enable does not
       make sense.

       For only generating blocks for specific service files, you need
       to pass them as arguments, e.g. <b>dh_systemd_enable quota.service</b>
       and <b>dh_systemd_enable --name=quotarpc quotarpc.service</b>.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.service, debian/<i>package</i>@.service
           If this exists, it is installed into
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package.service</i> (or
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package@.service</i>) in the package build
           directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.tmpfile
           If this exists, it is installed into
           usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/<i>package</i>.conf in the package build
           directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.target, debian/<i>package</i>@.target
           If this exists, it is installed into
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package.target</i> (or
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package@.target</i>) in the package build
           directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.socket, debian/<i>package</i>@.socket
           If this exists, it is installed into
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package.socket</i> (or
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package@.socket</i>) in the package build
           directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.mount
           If this exists, it is installed into
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package.mount</i> in the package build
           directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.path, debian/<i>package</i>@.path
           If this exists, it is installed into
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package.path</i> (or
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package@.path</i>) in the package build
           directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.timer, debian/<i>package</i>@.timer
           If this exists, it is installed into
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package.timer</i> (or
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package@.timer</i>) in the package build
           directory.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--no-enable</b>
           Disable the service(s) on purge, but do not enable them on
           install.

           <b>Note </b>that this option does not affect whether the services
           are started.  That is controlled by <a href="dh_systemd_start.1.html">dh_systemd_start(1)</a>
           (using e.g. its <b>--no-start </b>option).

       <b>--name=</b><i>name</i>
           Install the service file as <i>name.service</i> instead of the
           default filename, which is the <i>package.service</i>. When this
           parameter is used, <b>dh_systemd_enable </b>looks for and installs
           files named <i>debian/package.name.service</i> instead of the usual
           <i>debian/package.service</i>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that this command is not idempotent. <a href="dh_prep.1.html">dh_prep(1)</a> should be
       called between invocations of this command (with the same
       arguments). Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the
       same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

       Note that <b>dh_systemd_enable </b>should be run before <b>dh_installinit</b>.
       The default sequence in <b>dh </b>does the right thing, this note is
       only relevant when you are calling <b>dh_systemd_enable </b>manually.
