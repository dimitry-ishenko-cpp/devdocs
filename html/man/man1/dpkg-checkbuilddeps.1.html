NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-checkbuilddeps - check build dependencies and conflicts
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-checkbuilddeps </b>[<i>option</i>...]  [<i>control-file</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This program checks the installed packages in the system against
       the build dependencies and build conflicts listed in the control
       file.  If any are not met, it displays them and exits with a
       nonzero return code.

       By default, <b>debian/control </b>is read, but an alternate control
       filename may be specified on the command line.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--admindir=</b><i>dir</i>
           Change the location of the <b>dpkg </b>database (since dpkg 1.14.0).
           The default location is <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</i>.

       <b>-A  </b>Ignore <b>Build-Depends-Arch </b>and <b>Build-Conflicts-Arch </b>lines
           (since dpkg 1.16.4).  Use when only arch-indep packages will
           be built, or combine with <b>-B </b>when only a source package is to
           be built.

       <b>-B  </b>Ignore <b>Build-Depends-Indep </b>and <b>Build-Conflicts-Indep </b>lines.
           Use when only arch-dep packages will be built, or combine
           with <b>-A </b>when only a source package is to be built.

       <b>-I  </b>Ignore built-in build depends and conflicts (since dpkg
           1.18.2).  These are implicit dependencies that are usually
           required on a specific distribution, the so called Build-
           Essential package set.

       <b>-d </b><i>build-depends-string</i>
       <b>-c </b><i>build-conflicts-string</i>
           Use the given build dependencies/conflicts instead of those
           contained in the <i>debian/control</i> file (since dpkg 1.14.17).

       <b>-a </b><i>arch</i>
           Check build dependencies/conflicts assuming that the package
           described in the control file is to be built for the given
           host architecture instead of the architecture of the current
           system (since dpkg 1.16.2).

       <b>-P </b><i>profile</i>[<b>,</b>...]
           Check build dependencies/conflicts assuming that the package
           described in the control file is to be built for the given
           build profile(s) (since dpkg 1.17.2).  The argument is a
           comma-separated list of profile names.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH</b>
           Sets the host architecture.  This affects the dependency
           resolution logic, which might then not match what the system
           dpkg considers satisfiable.

       <b>DEB_BUILD_PROFILES</b>
           If set, it will be used as the active build profile(s) for
           the package being built.  It is a space separated list of
           profile names.  Overridden by the <b>-P </b>option.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are:
           <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>(default).
