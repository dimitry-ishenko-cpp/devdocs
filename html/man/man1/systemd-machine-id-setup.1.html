NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-machine-id-setup - Initialize the machine ID in
       /etc/machine-id
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>systemd-machine-id-setup</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-machine-id-setup </b>may be used by system installer tools to
       initialize the machine ID stored in /etc/machine-id at install
       time, with a provisioned or randomly generated ID. See
       <a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a> for more information about this file.

       If the tool is invoked without the <b>--commit </b>switch,
       /etc/machine-id is initialized with a valid, new machine ID if it
       is missing or empty. The new machine ID will be acquired in the
       following fashion:

        1. If a valid machine ID is stored in /run/machine-id, the
           machine ID is copied and used to initialize the machine ID in
           /etc/machine-id. This step is skipped if <b>--root= </b>is specified
           or running in a chroot environment.

        2. If a valid D-Bus machine ID is already configured for the
           system, the D-Bus machine ID is copied and used to initialize
           the machine ID in /etc/machine-id.

        3. If a valid machine ID is provided through <b>system.machine_id</b>
           credential, the machine ID is copied and used to initialize
           the machine ID in /etc/machine-id. This step is skipped if
           <b>--root= </b>is specified or running in a chroot environment.

        4. If run inside a KVM virtual machine and a UUID is configured
           (via the <b>-uuid </b>option), this UUID is used to initialize the
           machine ID. The caller must ensure that the UUID passed is
           sufficiently unique and is different for every booted
           instance of the VM. This step is skipped if <b>--root= </b>is
           specified or running in a chroot environment.

        5. Similarly, if run inside a Linux container environment and a
           UUID is configured for the container, this is used to
           initialize the machine ID. For details, see the documentation
           of the <b>Container Interface</b>[1]. This step is skipped if
           <b>--root= </b>is specified or running in a chroot environment.

        6. Otherwise, a new ID is randomly generated.

       The <b>--commit </b>switch may be used to commit a transient machined ID
       to disk, making it persistent. For details, see below.

       Use <a href="systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot(1)</a> to initialize the machine ID on mounted
       (but not booted) system images.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--root=</b><i>path</i>
           Takes a directory path as argument. All paths operated on
           will be prefixed with the given alternate <i>root</i> path,
           including the path for /etc/machine-id itself.

           Added in version 212.

       <b>--image=</b><i>path</i>
           Takes a path to a device node or regular file as argument.
           This is similar to <b>--root= </b>as described above, but operates
           on a disk image instead of a directory tree.

           Added in version 249.

       <b>--image-policy=</b><i>policy</i>
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per
           <a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy(7)</a>. The policy is enforced when
           operating on the disk image specified via <b>--image=</b>, see
           above. If not specified defaults to the "*" policy, i.e. all
           recognized file systems in the image are used.

       <b>--commit</b>
           Commit a transient machine ID to disk. This command may be
           used to convert a transient machine ID into a persistent one.
           A transient machine ID file is one that was bind mounted from
           a memory file system (usually "tmpfs") to /etc/machine-id
           during the early phase of the boot process. This may happen
           because /etc/ is initially read-only and was missing a valid
           machine ID file at that point.

           This command will execute no operation if /etc/machine-id is
           not mounted from a memory file system, or if /etc/ is
           read-only. The command will write the current transient
           machine ID to disk and unmount the /etc/machine-id mount
           point in a race-free manner to ensure that this file is
           always valid and accessible for other processes.

           This command is primarily used by the
           <a href="../man8/systemd-machine-id-commit.service.8.html">systemd-machine-id-commit.service(8)</a> early boot service.

           Added in version 227.

       <b>--print</b>
           Print the machine ID generated or committed after the
           operation is complete.

           Added in version 231.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
