NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_strip - strip executables, shared libraries, and some static
       libraries
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_strip </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [<b>--dbg-package=</b><i>package</i>]
       [<b>--keep-debug</b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_strip </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for stripping
       out debug symbols in executables, shared libraries, and static
       libraries that are not needed during execution.

       This program examines your package build directories and works
       out what to strip on its own. It uses <a href="file.1.html">file(1)</a> and file
       permissions and filenames to figure out what files are shared
       libraries (<i>*.so</i>), executable binaries, and static (<i>lib*.a</i>) and
       debugging libraries (<i>lib*_g.a</i>, <i>debug/*.so</i>), and strips each as
       much as is possible. (Which is not at all for debugging
       libraries.) In general it seems to make very good guesses, and
       will do the right thing in almost all cases.

       Since it is very hard to automatically guess if a file is a
       module, and hard to determine how to strip a module, <b>dh_strip</b>
       does not currently deal with stripping binary modules such as <i>.o</i>
       files.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude files that contain <i>item</i> anywhere in their filename
           from being stripped. You may use this option multiple times
           to build up a list of things to exclude.

       <b>--dbg-package=</b><i>package</i>
           <b>This option is a now special purpose option that you normally</b>
           <b>do not need</b>.  In most cases, there should be little reason to
           use this option for new source packages as debhelper
           automatically generates debug packages ("dbgsym packages").
           <b>If you have a manual --dbg-package </b>that you want to replace
           with an automatically generated debug symbol package, please
           see the <b>--dbgsym-migration </b>option.

           Causes <b>dh_strip </b>to save debug symbols stripped from the
           packages it acts on as independent files in the package build
           directory of the specified debugging package.

           For example, if your packages are libfoo and foo and you want
           to include a <i>foo-dbg</i> package with debugging symbols, use
           <b>dh_strip --dbg-package=</b><i>foo-dbg</i>.

           This option implies <b>--no-automatic-dbgsym </b>and <i>cannot</i> be used
           with <b>--automatic-dbgsym </b>or <b>--dbgsym-migration</b>.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-debug</b>
           <b>This option is a now special purpose option that you normally</b>
           <b>do not need</b>.  In most cases, there should be little reason to
           use this option for new source packages as debhelper
           automatically generates debug packages ("dbgsym packages").
           <b>If you have a manual --dbg-package </b>that you want to replace
           with an automatically generated debug symbol package, please
           see the <b>--dbgsym-migration </b>option.

           Debug symbols will be retained, but split into an independent
           file in <i>usr/lib/debug/</i> in the package build directory.
           <b>--dbg-package </b>is easier to use than this option, but this
           option is more flexible.

           This option implies <b>--no-automatic-dbgsym </b>and <i>cannot</i> be used
           with <b>--automatic-dbgsym</b>.

       <b>--dbgsym-migration=</b><i>package-relation</i>
           This option is used to migrate from a manual "-dbg" package
           (created with <b>--dbg-package</b>) to an automatic generated debug
           symbol package. This option should describe a valid <b>Replaces</b>-
           and <b>Breaks</b>-relation, which will be added to the debug symbol
           package to avoid file conflicts with the (now obsolete) -dbg
           package.

           This option implies <b>--automatic-dbgsym </b>and <i>cannot</i> be used
           with <b>--keep-debug</b>, <b>--dbg-package </b>or <b>--no-automatic-dbgsym</b>.

           Examples:

             dh_strip --dbgsym-migration='libfoo-dbg (&lt;&lt; 2.1-3~)'

             dh_strip --dbgsym-migration='libfoo-tools-dbg (&lt;&lt; 2.1-3~), libfoo2-dbg (&lt;&lt; 2.1-3~)'

       <b>--automatic-dbgsym</b>, <b>--no-automatic-dbgsym</b>
           Control whether <b>dh_strip </b>should be creating debug symbol
           packages when possible.

           The default is to create debug symbol packages.

       <b>--ddebs</b>, <b>--no-ddebs</b>
           Historical name for <b>--automatic-dbgsym </b>and
           <b>--no-automatic-dbgsym</b>.

       <b>--ddeb-migration=</b><i>package-relation</i>
           Historical name for <b>--dbgsym-migration</b>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS </b>environment variable contains <b>nostrip</b>,
       nothing will be stripped, in accordance with Debian policy
       (section 10.1 "Binaries").  This will also inhibit the automatic
       creation of debug symbol packages.

       The automatic creation of debug symbol packages can also be
       prevented by adding <b>noautodbgsym </b>to the <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</b>
       environment variable.  However, <b>dh_strip </b>will still add
       debuglinks to ELF binaries when this flag is set.  This is to
       ensure that the regular deb package will be identical with and
       without this flag (assuming it is otherwise "bit-for-bit"
       reproducible).
