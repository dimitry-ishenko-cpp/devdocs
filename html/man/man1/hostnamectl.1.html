NAME </h2>
<pre>
       hostnamectl - Control the system hostname
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>hostnamectl </b>[OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>hostnamectl </b>may be used to query and change the system hostname
       and related settings.

       <a href="../man8/systemd-hostnamed.service.8.html">systemd-hostnamed.service(8)</a> and this tool distinguish three
       different hostnames: the high-level "pretty" hostname which might
       include all kinds of special characters (e.g. "Lennart's
       Laptop"), the "static" hostname which is the user-configured
       hostname (e.g. "lennarts-laptop"), and the transient hostname
       which is a fallback value received from network configuration
       (e.g. "node12345678"). If a static hostname is set to a valid
       value, then the transient hostname is not used.

       Note that the pretty hostname has little restrictions on the
       characters and length used, while the static and transient
       hostnames are limited to the usually accepted characters of
       Internet domain names, and 64 characters at maximum (the latter
       being a Linux limitation).

       Use <a href="systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot(1)</a> to initialize the system hostname for
       mounted (but not booted) system images.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>status</b>
           Show system hostname and related information. If no command
           is specified, this is the implied default.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>hostname </b>[<i>NAME</i>]
           If no argument is given, print the system hostname. If an
           optional argument <i>NAME</i> is provided then the command changes
           the system hostname to <i>NAME</i>. By default, this will alter the
           pretty, the static, and the transient hostname alike;
           however, if one or more of <b>--static</b>, <b>--transient</b>, <b>--pretty</b>
           are used, only the selected hostnames are changed. If the
           pretty hostname is being set, and static or transient are
           being set as well, the specified hostname will be simplified
           in regards to the character set used before the latter are
           updated. This is done by removing special characters and
           spaces. This ensures that the pretty and the static hostname
           are always closely related while still following the validity
           rules of the specific name. This simplification of the
           hostname string is not done if only the transient and/or
           static hostnames are set, and the pretty hostname is left
           untouched.

           The static and transient hostnames must each be either a
           single DNS label (a string composed of 7-bit ASCII lower-case
           characters and no spaces or dots, limited to the format
           allowed for DNS domain name labels), or a sequence of such
           labels separated by single dots that forms a valid DNS FQDN.
           The hostname must be at most 64 characters, which is a Linux
           limitation (DNS allows longer names).

           Added in version 249.

       <b>icon-name </b>[<i>NAME</i>]
           If no argument is given, print the icon name of the system.
           If an optional argument <i>NAME</i> is provided then the command
           changes the icon name to <i>NAME</i>. The icon name is used by some
           graphical applications to visualize this host. The icon name
           should follow the <b>Icon Naming Specification</b>[1].

           Added in version 249.

       <b>chassis </b>[<i>TYPE</i>]
           If no argument is given, print the chassis type. If an
           optional argument <i>TYPE</i> is provided then the command changes
           the chassis type to <i>TYPE</i>. The chassis type is used by some
           graphical applications to visualize the host or alter user
           interaction. Currently, the following chassis types are
           defined: "desktop", "laptop", "convertible", "server",
           "tablet", "handset", "watch", "embedded", as well as the
           special chassis types "vm" and "container" for virtualized
           systems that lack an immediate physical chassis.

           Added in version 249.

       <b>deployment </b>[<i>ENVIRONMENT</i>]
           If no argument is given, print the deployment environment. If
           an optional argument <i>ENVIRONMENT</i> is provided then the command
           changes the deployment environment to <i>ENVIRONMENT</i>. Argument
           <i>ENVIRONMENT</i> must be a single word without any control
           characters. One of the following is suggested: "development",
           "integration", "staging", "production".

           Added in version 249.

       <b>location </b>[<i>LOCATION</i>]
           If no argument is given, print the location string for the
           system. If an optional argument <i>LOCATION</i> is provided then the
           command changes the location string for the system to
           <i>LOCATION</i>. Argument <i>LOCATION</i> should be a human-friendly,
           free-form string describing the physical location of the
           system, if it is known and applicable. This may be as generic
           as "Berlin, Germany" or as specific as "Left Rack, 2nd
           Shelf".

           Added in version 249.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged
           operations.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>--static</b>, <b>--transient</b>, <b>--pretty</b>
           If <b>status </b>is invoked (or no explicit command is given) and
           one of these switches is specified, <b>hostnamectl </b>will print
           out just this selected hostname.

           If used with <b>hostname</b>, only the selected hostnames will be
           updated. When more than one of these switches are specified,
           all the specified hostnames will be updated.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
           username and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The
           hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is
           listening on, separated by ":", and then a container name,
           separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific
           container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to
           the remote machine manager instance. Container names may be
           enumerated with <b>machinectl -H </b><i>HOST</i>. Put IPv6 addresses in
           brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
           name to connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to
           connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special
           string ".host" is used in place of the container name, a
           connection to the local system is made (which is useful to
           connect to a specific user's user bus: "--user
           --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
           connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used
           either the left hand side or the right hand side may be
           omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and
           ".host" are implied.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       <b>--json=</b><i>MODE</i>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for
           the shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace
           or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same,
           with indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON
           output, the default).

       <b>-j</b>
           Equivalent to <b>--json=pretty </b>if running on a terminal, and
           <b>--json=short </b>otherwise.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
