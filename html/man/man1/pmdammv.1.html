       <b>pmdammv </b>- memory mapped values performance metrics domain agent
       (PMDA)

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdammv </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports application level performance metrics using memory mapped
       files.  It offers an extremely low overhead instrumentation
       facility that is well-suited to long running, mission critical
       applications where it is desirable to have performance metrics
       and availability information permanently enabled.

       The <b>mmv </b>PMDA exports instrumentation that has been added to an
       application using the MMV APIs (refer to <a href="../man3/mmv_stats_init.3.html">mmv_stats_init(3)</a> and
       <a href="../man5/mmv.5.html">mmv(5)</a> for further details).  These APIs can be called from
       several languages, including C, C++, Perl, Python, Java (via the
       separate ``Parfait'' class library) and GoLang (via the separate
       ``Speed'' library).

       A brief description of the <b>pmdammv </b>command line options follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>mmv.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdammv </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       Firstly, a security model for interprocess communication between
       instrumented applications and <b>pmdammv </b>(running as a shared
       library inside <b>pmcd</b>) must be chosen and established.

       This communication occurs through memory mapped files in a
       location known to both <b>pmdammv </b>and the instrumented applications.
       That location is <i>$PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv</i>, although that is often hidden
       behind application APIs such as ``Parfait'' and
       <a href="../man3/mmv_stats_init.3.html">mmv_stats_init(3)</a>.  The permissions set on this directory
       indicate the security model in use.

       The more secure method is to use an existing unprivileged group
       which is shared by instrumented applications, <b>pmcd </b>and <b>pmdammv</b>
       such as the "pcp" group.

            # . /etc/pcp.env
            # mkdir -m 775 $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv
            # chgrp pcp $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv

       Since this method requires instrumented applications to use this
       non-default group (see <a href="newgrp.1.html">newgrp(1)</a> and <a href="../man2/setgid.2.html">setgid(2)</a>) a common
       alternative involves the use of a world-writable <i>$PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv</i>
       directory with the sticky-bit set (similar to <i>/tmp</i> and <i>/var/tmp</i>,
       for example).

       This allows any application, running under any user account, to
       communicate with the PMDA (which runs under the "pcp" account by
       default).  This may not be desirable for all environments and one
       should consider the security implications of any directory setup
       like this (similar classes of issues exist as those that affect
       the system temporary file directories).

       <b>pmdammv </b>is enabled by default on all modern PCP installations,
       and thus the names, help text and values for the mmv performance
       metrics are available without the usual PMDA ./Install process.

       If the <i>$PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv</i> directory does not exist, then the
       ./Install script can be used to create a world-writable sticky-
       bit-set directory for communication.  This is for backwards
       compatibility, as well as ease of use - to use this mechanism, do
       the following as root:

            # rmdir $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv
            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv
            # ./Install

       This installation process will not overwrite any existing
       <i>$PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv</i> directory.

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdammv </b>is launched by <b>pmcd </b>and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <b>pmcd </b>when the
       agent is installed or removed.

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
