NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-unpack-objects - Unpack objects from a packed archive
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git unpack-objects</i> [-n] [-q] [-r] [--strict]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Read a packed archive (.pack) from the standard input, expanding
       the objects contained within and writing them into the repository
       in "loose" (one object per file) format.

       Objects that already exist in the repository will <b>not </b>be unpacked
       from the packfile. Therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use
       this command on a packfile that exists within the target
       repository.

       See <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a> for options to generate new packs and replace
       existing ones.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -n
           Dry run. Check the pack file without actually unpacking the
           objects.

       -q
           The command usually shows percentage progress. This flag
           suppresses it.

       -r
           When unpacking a corrupt packfile, the command dies at the
           first corruption. This flag tells it to keep going and make
           the best effort to recover as many objects as possible.

       --strict
           Don’t write objects with broken content or links.

       --max-input-size=&lt;size&gt;
           Die, if the pack is larger than &lt;size&gt;.
