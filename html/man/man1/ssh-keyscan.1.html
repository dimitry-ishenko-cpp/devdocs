DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ssh-keyscan </b>is a utility for gathering the public SSH host keys
       of a number of hosts.  It was designed to aid in building and
       verifying <i>ssh_known_hosts</i> files, the format of which is
       documented in <i>sshd</i>(8).  <b>ssh-keyscan </b>provides a minimal interface
       suitable for use by shell and perl scripts.

       <b>ssh-keyscan </b>uses non-blocking socket I/O to contact as many hosts
       as possible in parallel, so it is very efficient.  The keys from
       a domain of 1,000 hosts can be collected in tens of seconds, even
       when some of those hosts are down or do not run <i>sshd</i>(8).  For
       scanning, one does not need login access to the machines that are
       being scanned, nor does the scanning process involve any
       encryption.

       Hosts to be scanned may be specified by hostname, address or by
       CIDR network range (e.g. 192.168.16/28).  If a network range is
       specified, then all addresses in that range will be scanned.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-4      </b>Force <b>ssh-keyscan </b>to use IPv4 addresses only.

       <b>-6      </b>Force <b>ssh-keyscan </b>to use IPv6 addresses only.

       <b>-c      </b>Request certificates from target hosts instead of plain
               keys.

       <b>-D      </b>Print keys found as SSHFP DNS records.  The default is to
               print keys in a format usable as a <i>ssh</i>(1) <i>known_hosts</i>
               file.

       <b>-f </b><i>file</i>
               Read hosts or “addrlist namelist” pairs from <i>file</i>, one
               per line.  If ‘-’ is supplied instead of a filename,
               <b>ssh-keyscan </b>will read from the standard input.  Names
               read from a file must start with an address, hostname or
               CIDR network range to be scanned.  Addresses and
               hostnames may optionally be followed by comma-separated
               name or address aliases that will be copied to the
               output.  For example:

               192.168.11.0/24
               10.20.1.1
               happy.example.org
               10.0.0.1,sad.example.org

       <b>-H      </b>Hash all hostnames and addresses in the output.  Hashed
               names may be used normally by <i>ssh</i>(1) and <i>sshd</i>(8), but
               they do not reveal identifying information should the
               file's contents be disclosed.

       <b>-O </b><i>option</i>
               Specify a key/value option.  At present, only a single
               option is supported:

               <b>hashalg</b>=<i>algorithm</i>
                       Selects a hash algorithm to use when printing
                       SSHFP records using the <b>-D </b>flag.  Valid
                       algorithms are “sha1” and “sha256”.  The default
                       is to print both.

       <b>-p </b><i>port</i>
               Connect to <i>port</i> on the remote host.

       <b>-T </b><i>timeout</i>
               Set the timeout for connection attempts.  If <i>timeout</i>
               seconds have elapsed since a connection was initiated to
               a host or since the last time anything was read from that
               host, the connection is closed and the host in question
               considered unavailable.  The default is 5 seconds.

       <b>-t </b><i>type</i>
               Specify the type of the key to fetch from the scanned
               hosts.  The possible values are “dsa”, “ecdsa”,
               “ed25519”, “ecdsa-sk”, “ed25519-sk”, or “rsa”.  Multiple
               values may be specified by separating them with commas.
               The default is to fetch “rsa”, “ecdsa”, “ed25519”,
               “ecdsa-sk”, and “ed25519-sk” keys.

       <b>-v      </b>Verbose mode: print debugging messages about progress.

       If an ssh_known_hosts file is constructed using <b>ssh-keyscan</b>
       without verifying the keys, users will be vulnerable to <i>man in</i>
       <i>the middle</i> attacks.  On the other hand, if the security model
       allows such a risk, <b>ssh-keyscan </b>can help in the detection of
       tampered keyfiles or man in the middle attacks which have begun
       after the ssh_known_hosts file was created.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Print the RSA host key for machine <i>hostname</i>:

             <b>$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa hostname</b>

       Search a network range, printing all supported key types:

             <b>$ ssh-keyscan 192.168.0.64/25</b>

       Find all hosts from the file <i>ssh_hosts</i> which have new or
       different keys from those in the sorted file <i>ssh_known_hosts</i>:

             $ ssh-keyscan -t rsa,dsa,ecdsa,ed25519 -f ssh_hosts | \
                     sort -u - ssh_known_hosts | diff ssh_known_hosts -
