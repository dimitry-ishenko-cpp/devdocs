NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-squash - Squash two or more patches into one
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg squash</i> [OPTIONS] &lt;patch&gt;...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Squash two or more patches, creating one patch with their
       combined changes.

       The squash process, at a high level:

        1. Pop all the given patches, plus any other patches on top of
           them.

        2. Push the given patches in the order they were given on the
           command line. This establishes a tree containing the combined
           changes from the given patches.

        3. Replace given patches with a new, squashed patch.

        4. Allow the user to interactively edit the commit message of
           the new, squashed patch.

        5. Push other patches that were popped in step (1), if any.

       Conflicts can occur whenever a patch is pushed; this is, in steps
       (2) and (5). If conflicts occur, the squash command will halt
       such that the conflicts may be resolved manually.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -n &lt;name&gt;, --name=&lt;name&gt;
           Use &lt;name&gt; for the squashed patch

       -e, --edit
           Invoke editor for patch description

       -d, --diff
           Show diff when editing patch description

       -m &lt;message&gt;, --message=&lt;message&gt;
           Use message instead of invoking the editor

       -f &lt;path&gt;, --file=&lt;path&gt;
           Use the contents of file instead of invoking the editor. Use
           "-" to read from stdin.

       --no-verify
           Disable commit-msg hook

       -s[=&lt;value&gt;], --signoff[=&lt;value&gt;]
           Add "Signed-off-by" message trailer.

           The value is optional and defaults to the committer name and
           email. This option may be provided multiple times.

       --ack[=&lt;value&gt;]
           Add "Acked-by" message trailer.

           The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
           and email. This option may be provided multiple times.

       --review[=&lt;value&gt;]
           Add "Reviewed-by" message trailer.

           The value is optional and defaults to the committer’s name
           and email. This option may be provided multiple times.

       --author=&lt;name-and-email&gt;
           Set the author "name &lt;email&gt;"

       --authname=&lt;name&gt;
           Set the author name

       --authemail=&lt;email&gt;
           Set the author email

       --authdate=&lt;date&gt;
           Set the date the patch was authored.

           Use "now" to use the current time and date.

       --committer-date-is-author-date
           Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
           the author date of the commit as the committer date.

       --save-template=&lt;file&gt;
           Instead of running the command, just write the patch
           description to FILE, and exit. (If FILE is "-", write to
           stdout.)

           When driving StGit from another program, it may be useful to
           first call a command with <i>--save-template</i>, then let the user
           edit the message, and then call the same command with <i>--file</i>.
