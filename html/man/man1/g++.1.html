       gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       gcc [<b>-c</b>|<b>-S</b>|<b>-E</b>] [<b>-std=</b><i>standard</i>]
           [<b>-g</b>] [<b>-pg</b>] [<b>-O</b><i>level</i>]
           [<b>-W</b><i>warn</i>...] [<b>-Wpedantic</b>]
           [<b>-I</b><i>dir</i>...] [<b>-L</b><i>dir</i>...]
           [<b>-D</b><i>macro</i>[=<i>defn</i>]...] [<b>-U</b><i>macro</i>]
           [<b>-f</b><i>option</i>...] [<b>-m</b><i>machine-option</i>...]
           [<b>-o </b><i>outfile</i>] [@<i>file</i>] <i>infile</i>...

       Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
       remainder.  <b>g++ </b>accepts mostly the same options as <b>gcc</b>.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
       assembly and linking.  The "overall options" allow you to stop
       this process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <b>-c</b>
       option says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of
       object files output by the assembler.

       Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.
       Some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler
       itself.  Yet other options control the assembler and linker; most
       of these are not documented here, since you rarely need to use
       any of them.

       Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are
       useful for C programs; when an option is only useful with another
       language (usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If
       the description for a particular option does not mention a source
       language, you can use that option with all supported languages.

       The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called <b>gcc</b>, or
       <i>machine</i><b>-gcc </b>when cross-compiling, or <i>machine</i><b>-gcc-</b><i>version</i> to run a
       specific version of GCC.  When you compile C++ programs, you
       should invoke GCC as <b>g++ </b>instead.

       The <b>gcc </b>program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
       options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
       options may <i>not</i> be grouped: <b>-dv </b>is very different from <b>-d -v</b>.

       You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the
       order you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use
       several options of the same kind; for example, if you specify <b>-L</b>
       more than once, the directories are searched in the order
       specified.  Also, the placement of the <b>-l </b>option is significant.

       Many options have long names starting with <b>-f </b>or with <b>-W</b>---for
       example, <b>-fmove-loop-invariants</b>, <b>-Wformat </b>and so on.  Most of
       these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
       <b>-ffoo </b>is <b>-fno-foo</b>.  This manual documents only one of these two
       forms, whichever one is not the default.

       Some options take one or more arguments typically separated
       either by a space or by the equals sign (<b>=</b>) from the option name.
       Unless documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or
       a string.  Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned
       decimal or hexadecimal integers.  Hexadecimal arguments must
       begin with the <b>0x </b>prefix.  Arguments to options that specify a
       size threshold of some sort may be arbitrarily large decimal or
       hexadecimal integers followed by a byte size suffix designating a
       multiple of bytes such as "kB" and "KiB" for kilobyte and
       kibibyte, respectively, "MB" and "MiB" for megabyte and mebibyte,
       "GB" and "GiB" for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so on.  Such
       arguments are designated by <i>byte-size</i> in the following text.
       Refer to the NIST, IEC, and other relevant national and
       international standards for the full listing and explanation of
       the binary and decimal byte size prefixes.

   <b>Options Controlling the Kind of Output</b>
       Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing,
       compilation proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.
       GCC is capable of preprocessing and compiling several files
       either into several assembler input files, or into one assembler
       input file; then each assembler input file produces an object
       file, and linking combines all the object files (those newly
       compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.

       For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what
       kind of compilation is done:

       <i>file</i><b>.c</b>
           C source code that must be preprocessed.

       <i>file</i><b>.i</b>
           C source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <i>file</i><b>.ii</b>
           C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <i>file</i><b>.m</b>
           Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the
           <i>libobjc</i> library to make an Objective-C program work.

       <i>file</i><b>.mi</b>
           Objective-C source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <i>file</i><b>.mm</b>
       <i>file</i><b>.M</b>
           Objective-C++ source code.  Note that you must link with the
           <i>libobjc</i> library to make an Objective-C++ program work.  Note
           that <b>.M </b>refers to a literal capital M.

       <i>file</i><b>.mii</b>
           Objective-C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <i>file</i><b>.h</b>
           C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be turned
           into a precompiled header (default), or C, C++ header file to
           be turned into an Ada spec (via the <b>-fdump-ada-spec </b>switch).

       <i>file</i><b>.cc</b>
       <i>file</i><b>.cp</b>
       <i>file</i><b>.cxx</b>
       <i>file</i><b>.cpp</b>
       <i>file</i><b>.CPP</b>
       <i>file</i><b>.c++</b>
       <i>file</i><b>.C</b>
           C++ source code that must be preprocessed.  Note that in
           <b>.cxx</b>, the last two letters must both be literally <b>x</b>.
           Likewise, <b>.C </b>refers to a literal capital C.

       <i>file</i><b>.mm</b>
       <i>file</i><b>.M</b>
           Objective-C++ source code that must be preprocessed.

       <i>file</i><b>.mii</b>
           Objective-C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

       <i>file</i><b>.ads</b>
           Ada source code file that contains a library unit declaration
           (a declaration of a package, subprogram, or generic, or a
           generic instantiation), or a library unit renaming
           declaration (a package, generic, or subprogram renaming
           declaration).  Such files are also called <i>specs</i>.

       <i>file</i><b>.adb</b>
           Ada source code file containing a library unit body (a

       <i>other</i>
           An object file to be fed straight into linking.  Any file
           name with no recognized suffix is treated this way.

       You can specify the input language explicitly with the <b>-x </b>option:

       <b>-x </b><i>language</i>
           Specify explicitly the <i>language</i> for the following input files
           (rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on
           the file name suffix).  This option applies to all following
           input files until the next <b>-x </b>option.  Possible values for
           <i>language</i> are:

                   c  c-header  cpp-output
                   c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
                   objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
                   objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
                   assembler  assembler-with-cpp
                   ada
                   d
                   f77  f77-cpp-input f95  f95-cpp-input
                   go
                   brig

       <b>-x none</b>
           Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent
           files are handled according to their file name suffixes (as
           they are if <b>-x </b>has not been used at all).

       If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
       <b>-x </b>(or filename suffixes) to tell <b>gcc </b>where to start, and one of
       the options <b>-c</b>, <b>-S</b>, or <b>-E </b>to say where <b>gcc </b>is to stop.  Note that
       some combinations (for example, <b>-x cpp-output -E</b>) instruct <b>gcc </b>to
       do nothing at all.

       <b>-c  </b>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The
           linking stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in
           the form of an object file for each source file.

           By default, the object file name for a source file is made by
           replacing the suffix <b>.c</b>, <b>.i</b>, <b>.s</b>, etc., with <b>.o</b>.

           Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or
           assembly, are ignored.

       <b>-S  </b>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.
           The output is in the form of an assembler code file for each
           non-assembler input file specified.

           By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made
           by replacing the suffix <b>.c</b>, <b>.i</b>, etc., with <b>.s</b>.

           Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

       <b>-E  </b>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler
           proper.  The output is in the form of preprocessed source
           code, which is sent to the standard output.

           Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.

       <b>-o </b><i>file</i>
           Place output in file <i>file</i>.  This applies to whatever sort of
           output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
           an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

           If <b>-o </b>is not specified, the default is to put an executable
           file in <i>a.out</i>, the object file for <i>source.suffix</i> in <i>source.o</i>,
           its assembler file in <i>source.s</i>, a precompiled header file in
           <i>source.suffix.gch</i>, and all preprocessed C source on standard
           output.

       <b>-v  </b>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run
           the stages of compilation.  Also print the version number of
           the compiler driver program and of the preprocessor and the
           compiler proper.

       <b>-###</b>
           Like <b>-v </b>except the commands are not executed and arguments
           are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters
           or "./-_".  This is useful for shell scripts to capture the
           driver-generated command lines.

       <b>--help</b>
           Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-
           line options understood by <b>gcc</b>.  If the <b>-v </b>option is also
           specified then <b>--help </b>is also passed on to the various
           processes invoked by <b>gcc</b>, so that they can display the
           command-line options they accept.  If the <b>-Wextra </b>option has
           also been specified (prior to the <b>--help </b>option), then
           command-line options that have no documentation associated
           with them are also displayed.

       <b>--target-help</b>
           Print (on the standard output) a description of target-
           specific command-line options for each tool.  For some
           targets extra target-specific information may also be
           printed.

       <b>--help={</b><i>class</i>|[<b>^</b>]<i>qualifier</i><b>}</b>[<b>,...</b>]
           Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-
           line options understood by the compiler that fit into all
           specified classes and qualifiers.  These are the supported
           classes:

           <b>optimizers</b>
               Display all of the optimization options supported by the
               compiler.

           <b>warnings</b>
               Display all of the options controlling warning messages
               produced by the compiler.

           <b>target</b>
               Display target-specific options.  Unlike the
               <b>--target-help </b>option however, target-specific options of
               the linker and assembler are not displayed.  This is
               because those tools do not currently support the extended
               <b>--help= </b>syntax.

           <b>params</b>
               Display the values recognized by the <b>--param </b>option.

           <i>language</i>
               Display the options supported for <i>language</i>, where
               <i>language</i> is the name of one of the languages supported in
               this version of GCC.

           <b>common</b>
               Display the options that are common to all languages.

           These are the supported qualifiers:

           <b>undocumented</b>
               Display only those options that are undocumented.

           <b>joined</b>
               Display options taking an argument that appears after an
               equal sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
               <b>--help=target</b>.

           <b>separate</b>
               Display options taking an argument that appears as a
               separate word following the original option, such as: <b>-o</b>
               <b>output-file</b>.

           Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-
           specific switches supported by the compiler, use:

                   --help=target,undocumented

           The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with
           the <b>^ </b>character, so for example to display all binary warning
           options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not
           take an argument) that have a description, use:

                   --help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented

           The argument to <b>--help= </b>should not consist solely of inverted
           qualifiers.

           Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
           restricts the output so much that there is nothing to
           display.  One case where it does work, however, is when one
           of the classes is <i>target</i>.  For example, to display all the
           target-specific optimization options, use:

                   --help=target,optimizers

           The <b>--help= </b>option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
           successive use displays its requested class of options,
           skipping those that have already been displayed.  If <b>--help</b>
           is also specified anywhere on the command line then this
           takes precedence over any <b>--help= </b>option.

           If the <b>-Q </b>option appears on the command line before the
           <b>--help= </b>option, then the descriptive text displayed by
           <b>--help= </b>is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
           options, an indication is given as to whether the option is
           enabled, disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that
           the compiler knows this at the point where the <b>--help= </b>option
           is used).

           Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of <b>gcc</b>:

                     % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
                     The following options are target specific:
                     -mabi=                                2
                     -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
                     -mapcs                                [disabled]

           The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-
           line options, so for example it is possible to find out which
           optimizations are enabled at <b>-O2 </b>by using:

                   -Q -O2 --help=optimizers

           Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are
           enabled by <b>-O3 </b>by using:

                   gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts
                   gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts
                   diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled

       <b>--version</b>
           Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.

       <b>-pass-exit-codes</b>
           Normally the <b>gcc </b>program exits with the code of 1 if any
           phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If
           you specify <b>-pass-exit-codes</b>, the <b>gcc </b>program instead returns
           with the numerically highest error produced by any phase
           returning an error indication.  The C, C++, and Fortran front
           ends return 4 if an internal compiler error is encountered.

       <b>-pipe</b>
           Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication
           between the various stages of compilation.  This fails to
           work on some systems where the assembler is unable to read
           from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has no trouble.

       <b>-specs=</b><i>file</i>
           Process <i>file</i> after the compiler reads in the standard <i>specs</i>
           file, in order to override the defaults which the <b>gcc </b>driver
           program uses when determining what switches to pass to <b>cc1</b>,
           <b>cc1plus</b>, <b>as</b>, <b>ld</b>, etc.  More than one <b>-specs=</b><i>file</i> can be
           specified on the command line, and they are processed in
           order, from left to right.

       <b>-wrapper</b>
           Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.  The name of
           the wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma
           separated list.

                   gcc -c t.c -wrapper gdb,--args

           This invokes all subprograms of <b>gcc </b>under <b>gdb --args</b>, thus
           the invocation of <b>cc1 </b>is <b>gdb --args cc1 ...</b>.

       <b>-ffile-prefix-map=</b><i>old</i><b>=</b><i>new</i>
           When compiling files residing in directory <i>old</i>, record any
           references to them in the result of the compilation as if the
           files resided in directory <i>new</i> instead.  Specifying this
           option is equivalent to specifying all the individual
           <b>-f*-prefix-map </b>options.  This can be used to make
           reproducible builds that are location independent.  See also
           <b>-fmacro-prefix-map </b>and <b>-fdebug-prefix-map</b>.

       <b>-fplugin=</b><i>name</i><b>.so</b>
           Load the plugin code in file <i>name</i>.so, assumed to be a shared
           object to be dlopen'd by the compiler.  The base name of the
           shared object file is used to identify the plugin for the
           purposes of argument parsing (See <b>-fplugin-arg-</b><i>name</i><b>-</b><i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
           below).  Each plugin should define the callback functions
           specified in the Plugins API.

       <b>-fplugin-arg-</b><i>name</i><b>-</b><i>key</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
           Define an argument called <i>key</i> with a value of <i>value</i> for the
           plugin called <i>name</i>.

       <b>-fdump-ada-spec</b>[<b>-slim</b>]
           For C and C++ source and include files, generate
           corresponding Ada specs.

       <b>-fada-spec-parent=</b><i>unit</i>
           In conjunction with <b>-fdump-ada-spec</b>[<b>-slim</b>] above, generate
           Ada specs as child units of parent <i>unit</i>.

       <b>-fdump-go-spec=</b><i>file</i>
           For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go
           declarations in <i>file</i>.  This generates Go "const", "type",
           "var", and "func" declarations which may be a useful way to
           start writing a Go interface to code written in some other
           language.

       <b>@</b><i>file</i>
           Read command-line options from <i>file</i>.  The options read are
           inserted in place of the original @<i>file</i> option.  If <i>file</i> does
           not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
           literally, and not removed.

           Options in <i>file</i> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
           character may be included in an option by surrounding the
           entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any
           character (including a backslash) may be included by
           prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The
           <i>file</i> may itself contain additional @<i>file</i> options; any such
           options will be processed recursively.

   <b>Compiling C++ Programs</b>
       C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <b>.C</b>, <b>.cc</b>,
       <b>.cpp</b>, <b>.CPP</b>, <b>.c++</b>, <b>.cp</b>, or <b>.cxx</b>; C++ header files often use <b>.hh</b>,
       <b>.hpp</b>, <b>.H</b>, or (for shared template code) <b>.tcc</b>; and preprocessed
       C++ files use the suffix <b>.ii</b>.  GCC recognizes files with these
       names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the
       compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with
       the name <b>gcc</b>).

       However, the use of <b>gcc </b>does not add the C++ library.  <b>g++ </b>is a
       program that calls GCC and automatically specifies linking
       against the C++ library.  It treats <b>.c</b>, <b>.h </b>and <b>.i </b>files as C++
       source files instead of C source files unless <b>-x </b>is used.  This
       program is also useful when precompiling a C header file with a
       <b>.h </b>extension for use in C++ compilations.  On many systems, <b>g++</b>
       is also installed with the name <b>c++</b>.

       When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
       command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
       language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
       languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.

   <b>Options Controlling C Dialect</b>
       The following options control the dialect of C (or languages
       derived from C, such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that
       the compiler accepts:

       <b>-ansi</b>
           In C mode, this is equivalent to <b>-std=c90</b>. In C++ mode, it is
           equivalent to <b>-std=c++98</b>.

           This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible
           with ISO C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++
           (when compiling C++ code), such as the "asm" and "typeof"
           keywords, and predefined macros such as "unix" and "vax" that
           identify the type of system you are using.  It also enables
           the undesirable and rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For
           the C compiler, it disables recognition of C++ style <b>//</b>
           comments as well as the "inline" keyword.

           The alternate keywords "__asm__", "__extension__",
           "__inline__" and "__typeof__" continue to work despite <b>-ansi</b>.
           You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
           course, but it is useful to put them in header files that
           might be included in compilations done with <b>-ansi</b>.  Alternate
           predefined macros such as "__unix__" and "__vax__" are also
           available, with or without <b>-ansi</b>.

           The <b>-ansi </b>option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
           rejected gratuitously.  For that, <b>-Wpedantic </b>is required in
           addition to <b>-ansi</b>.

           The macro "__STRICT_ANSI__" is predefined when the <b>-ansi</b>
           option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and
           refrain from declaring certain functions or defining certain
           macros that the ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to
           avoid interfering with any programs that might use these
           names for other things.

           Functions that are normally built in but do not have
           semantics defined by ISO C (such as "alloca" and "ffs") are
           not built-in functions when <b>-ansi </b>is used.

       <b>-std=</b>
           Determine the language standard.   This option is currently
           only supported when compiling C or C++.

           The compiler can accept several base standards, such as <b>c90</b>
           or <b>c++98</b>, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as <b>gnu90</b>
           or <b>gnu++98</b>.  When a base standard is specified, the compiler
           accepts all programs following that standard plus those using
           GNU extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
           <b>-std=c90 </b>turns off certain features of GCC that are
           incompatible with ISO C90, such as the "asm" and "typeof"
           keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a
           meaning in ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a
           "?:" expression. On the other hand, when a GNU dialect of a
           standard is specified, all features supported by the compiler
           are enabled, even when those features change the meaning of
           the base standard.  As a result, some strict-conforming
           programs may be rejected.  The particular standard is used by
           <b>-Wpedantic </b>to identify which features are GNU extensions
           given that version of the standard. For example <b>-std=gnu90</b>
           <b>-Wpedantic </b>warns about C++ style <b>// </b>comments, while
           <b>-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic </b>does not.

           <b>gnu++2a</b>
               GNU dialect of <b>-std=c++2a</b>.  Support is highly

               incompatible ways in future releases.

       <b>-fgnu89-inline</b>
           The option <b>-fgnu89-inline </b>tells GCC to use the traditional
           GNU semantics for "inline" functions when in C99 mode.

           Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
           "gnu_inline" function attribute to all inline functions.

           The option <b>-fno-gnu89-inline </b>explicitly tells GCC to use the
           C99 semantics for "inline" when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e.,
           it specifies the default behavior).  This option is not
           supported in <b>-std=c90 </b>or <b>-std=gnu90 </b>mode.

           The preprocessor macros "__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__" and
           "__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__" may be used to check which semantics
           are in effect for "inline" functions.

       <b>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=</b><i>style</i>
           ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 defines new permissible values for
           "FLT_EVAL_METHOD" that indicate that operations and constants
           with a semantic type that is an interchange or extended
           format should be evaluated to the precision and range of that
           type.  These new values are a superset of those permitted
           under C99/C11, which does not specify the meaning of other
           positive values of "FLT_EVAL_METHOD".  As such, code
           conforming to C11 may not have been written expecting the
           possibility of the new values.

           <b>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods </b>specifies whether the compiler
           should allow only the values of "FLT_EVAL_METHOD" specified
           in C99/C11, or the extended set of values specified in
           ISO/IEC TS 18661-3.

           <i>style</i> is either "c11" or "ts-18661-3" as appropriate.

           The default when in a standards compliant mode (<b>-std=c11 </b>or
           similar) is <b>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=c11</b>.  The default
           when in a GNU dialect (<b>-std=gnu11 </b>or similar) is
           <b>-fpermitted-flt-eval-methods=ts-18661-3</b>.

       <b>-aux-info </b><i>filename</i>
           Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all
           functions declared and/or defined in a translation unit,
           including those in header files.  This option is silently
           ignored in any language other than C.

           Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the
           origin of each declaration (source file and line), whether
           the declaration was implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<b>I</b>,
           <b>N </b>for new or <b>O </b>for old, respectively, in the first character
           after the line number and the colon), and whether it came
           from a declaration or a definition (<b>C </b>or <b>F</b>, respectively, in
           the following character).  In the case of function
           definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of arguments followed by their
           declarations is also provided, inside comments, after the
           declaration.

       <b>-fallow-parameterless-variadic-functions</b>
           Accept variadic functions without named parameters.

           Although it is possible to define such a function, this is
           not very useful as it is not possible to read the arguments.
           This is only supported for C as this construct is allowed by
           C++.

       <b>-fno-asm</b>
           Do not recognize "asm", "inline" or "typeof" as a keyword, so
           that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
           the keywords "__asm__", "__inline__" and "__typeof__"
           instead.  <b>-ansi </b>implies <b>-fno-asm</b>.

           In C++, this switch only affects the "typeof" keyword, since
           "asm" and "inline" are standard keywords.  You may want to
           use the <b>-fno-gnu-keywords </b>flag instead, which has the same
           effect.  In C99 mode (<b>-std=c99 </b>or <b>-std=gnu99</b>), this switch
           only affects the "asm" and "typeof" keywords, since "inline"
           is a standard keyword in ISO C99.

       <b>-fno-builtin</b>
       <b>-fno-builtin-</b><i>function</i>
           Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
           <b>__builtin_ </b>as prefix.

           GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-
           in functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to
           "alloca" may become single instructions which adjust the
           stack directly, and calls to "memcpy" may become inline copy
           loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller and faster,
           but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
           cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change
           the behavior of the functions by linking with a different
           library.  In addition, when a function is recognized as a
           built-in function, GCC may use information about that
           function to warn about problems with calls to that function,
           or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting
           code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
           warnings are given with <b>-Wformat </b>for bad calls to "printf"
           when "printf" is built in and "strlen" is known not to modify
           global memory.

           With the <b>-fno-builtin-</b><i>function</i> option only the built-in
           function <i>function</i> is disabled.  <i>function</i> must not begin with
           <b>__builtin_</b>.  If a function is named that is not built-in in
           this version of GCC, this option is ignored.  There is no
           corresponding <b>-fbuiltin-</b><i>function</i> option; if you wish to
           enable built-in functions selectively when using <b>-fno-builtin</b>
           or <b>-ffreestanding</b>, you may define macros such as:

                   #define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
                   #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))

       <b>-fgimple</b>
           Enable parsing of function definitions marked with
           "__GIMPLE".  This is an experimental feature that allows unit
           testing of GIMPLE passes.

       <b>-fhosted</b>
           Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment.  This
           implies <b>-fbuiltin</b>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
           entire standard library is available, and in which "main" has
           a return type of "int".  Examples are nearly everything
           except a kernel.  This is equivalent to <b>-fno-freestanding</b>.

       <b>-ffreestanding</b>
           Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.
           This implies <b>-fno-builtin</b>.  A freestanding environment is one
           in which the standard library may not exist, and program
           startup may not necessarily be at "main".  The most obvious
           example is an OS kernel.  This is equivalent to <b>-fno-hosted</b>.

       <b>-fopenacc</b>
           Enable handling of OpenACC directives "#pragma acc" in C/C++
           and "!$acc" in Fortran.  When <b>-fopenacc </b>is specified, the
           compiler generates accelerated code according to the OpenACC
           Application Programming Interface v2.0
           &lt;<b><a href="https://www.openacc.org">https://www.openacc.org</a> </b>&gt;.  This option implies <b>-pthread</b>, and
           thus is only supported on targets that have support for
           <b>-pthread</b>.

       <b>-fopenacc-dim=</b><i>geom</i>
           Specify default compute dimensions for parallel offload
           regions that do not explicitly specify.  The <i>geom</i> value is a
           triple of ':'-separated sizes, in order 'gang', 'worker' and,
           'vector'.  A size can be omitted, to use a target-specific
           default value.

       <b>-fopenmp</b>
           Enable handling of OpenMP directives "#pragma omp" in C/C++
           and "!$omp" in Fortran.  When <b>-fopenmp </b>is specified, the
           compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP
           Application Program Interface v4.5 &lt;<b><a href="https://www.openmp.org">https://www.openmp.org</a> </b>&gt;.
           This option implies <b>-pthread</b>, and thus is only supported on
           targets that have support for <b>-pthread</b>. <b>-fopenmp </b>implies
           <b>-fopenmp-simd</b>.

       <b>-fopenmp-simd</b>
           Enable handling of OpenMP's SIMD directives with "#pragma
           omp" in C/C++ and "!$omp" in Fortran. Other OpenMP directives
           are ignored.

       <b>-fgnu-tm</b>
           When the option <b>-fgnu-tm </b>is specified, the compiler generates
           code for the Linux variant of Intel's current Transactional
           Memory ABI specification document (Revision 1.1, May 6 2009).
           This is an experimental feature whose interface may change in
           future versions of GCC, as the official specification
           changes.  Please note that not all architectures are
           supported for this feature.

           For more information on GCC's support for transactional
           memory,

           Note that the transactional memory feature is not supported
           with non-call exceptions (<b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>).

       <b>-fms-extensions</b>
           Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header
           files.

           In C++ code, this allows member names in structures to be
           similar to previous types declarations.

                   typedef int UOW;
                   struct ABC {
                     UOW UOW;
                   };

           Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are
           only accepted with this option.

           Note that this option is off for all targets but x86 targets
           using ms-abi.

       <b>-fplan9-extensions</b>
           Accept some non-standard constructs used in Plan 9 code.

           This enables <b>-fms-extensions</b>, permits passing pointers to
           structures with anonymous fields to functions that expect
           pointers to elements of the type of the field, and permits
           referring to anonymous fields declared using a typedef.
           This is only supported for C, not C++.

       <b>-fcond-mismatch</b>
           Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the
           second and third arguments.  The value of such an expression
           is void.  This option is not supported for C++.

       <b>-flax-vector-conversions</b>
           Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing
           numbers of elements and/or incompatible element types.  This
           option should not be used for new code.

       <b>-funsigned-char</b>
           Let the type "char" be unsigned, like "unsigned char".

           Each kind of machine has a default for what "char" should be.
           It is either like "unsigned char" by default or like "signed
           char" by default.

           Ideally, a portable program should always use "signed char"
           or "unsigned char" when it depends on the signedness of an
           object.  But many programs have been written to use plain
           "char" and expect it to be signed, or expect it to be
           unsigned, depending on the machines they were written for.
           This option, and its inverse, let you make such a program
           work with the opposite default.

           The type "char" is always a distinct type from each of
           "signed char" or "unsigned char", even though its behavior is
           always just like one of those two.

       <b>-fsigned-char</b>
           Let the type "char" be signed, like "signed char".

           Note that this is equivalent to <b>-fno-unsigned-char</b>, which is
           the negative form of <b>-funsigned-char</b>.  Likewise, the option
           <b>-fno-signed-char </b>is equivalent to <b>-funsigned-char</b>.

       <b>-fsigned-bitfields</b>
       <b>-funsigned-bitfields</b>
       <b>-fno-signed-bitfields</b>
       <b>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</b>
           These options control whether a bit-field is signed or
           unsigned, when the declaration does not use either "signed"
           or "unsigned".  By default, such a bit-field is signed,
           because this is consistent: the basic integer types such as
           "int" are signed types.

       <b>-fsso-struct=</b><i>endianness</i>
           Set the default scalar storage order of structures and unions
           to the specified endianness.  The accepted values are <b>big-</b>
           <b>endian</b>, <b>little-endian </b>and <b>native </b>for the native endianness of
           the target (the default).  This option is not supported for
           C++.

           <b>Warning: </b>the <b>-fsso-struct </b>switch causes GCC to generate code
           that is not binary compatible with code generated without it
           if the specified endianness is not the native endianness of

   <b>Options Controlling C++ Dialect</b>
       This section describes the command-line options that are only
       meaningful for C++ programs.  You can also use most of the GNU
       compiler options regardless of what language your program is in.
       For example, you might compile a file <i>firstClass.C</i> like this:

               g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c firstClass.C

       In this example, only <b>-fstrict-enums </b>is an option meant only for
       C++ programs; you can use the other options with any language
       supported by GCC.

       Some options for compiling C programs, such as <b>-std</b>, are also
       relevant for C++ programs.

       Here is a list of options that are <i>only</i> for compiling C++
       programs:

       <b>-fabi-version=</b><i>n</i>
           Use version <i>n</i> of the C++ ABI.  The default is version 0.

           Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
           the C++ ABI specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using
           version 0 will change in different versions of G++ as ABI
           bugs are fixed.

           Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared
           in G++ 3.2.

           Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared
           in G++ 3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.

           Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as
           a template argument.

           Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a
           standard mangling for vector types.

           Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the
           mangling of attribute const/volatile on function pointer
           types, decltype of a plain decl, and use of a function
           parameter in the declaration of another parameter.

           Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the
           promotion behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of
           template argument packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and --,
           and a class scope function used as a template argument.

           Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats
           nullptr_t as a builtin type and corrects the mangling of
           lambdas in default argument scope.

           Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the
           substitution behavior of function types with function-cv-
           qualifiers.

           Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the
           alignment of "nullptr_t".

           Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of
           attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling
           convention attributes (e.g. <b>stdcall</b>).

           Version 11, which first appeared in G++ 7, corrects the
           mangling of sizeof... expressions and operator names.  For
           multiple entities with the same name within a function, that
           are declared in different scopes, the mangling now changes
           starting with the twelfth occurrence.  It also implies
           <b>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</b>.

           Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8, corrects the
           calling conventions for empty classes on the x86_64 target
           and for classes with only deleted copy/move constructors.  It
           accidentally changes the calling convention for classes with
           a deleted copy constructor and a trivial move constructor.

           Version 13, which first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the
           accidental change in version 12.

           See also <b>-Wabi</b>.

       <b>-fabi-compat-version=</b><i>n</i>
           On targets that support strong aliases, G++ works around
           mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
           mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled
           name.  This switch specifies which ABI version to use for the
           alias.

           With <b>-fabi-version=0 </b>(the default), this defaults to 11 (GCC
           7 compatibility).  If another ABI version is explicitly
           selected, this defaults to 0.  For compatibility with GCC
           versions 3.2 through 4.9, use <b>-fabi-compat-version=2</b>.

           If this option is not provided but <b>-Wabi=</b><i>n</i> is, that version
           is used for compatibility aliases.  If this option is
           provided along with <b>-Wabi </b>(without the version), the version
           from this option is used for the warning.

       <b>-fno-access-control</b>
           Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful
           for working around bugs in the access control code.

       <b>-faligned-new</b>
           Enable support for C++17 "new" of types that require more
           alignment than "void* ::operator new(std::size_t)" provides.
           A numeric argument such as "-faligned-new=32" can be used to
           specify how much alignment (in bytes) is provided by that
           function, but few users will need to override the default of
           "alignof(std::max_align_t)".

           This flag is enabled by default for <b>-std=c++17</b>.

       <b>-fchar8_t</b>
       <b>-fno-char8_t</b>
           Enable support for "char8_t" as adopted for C++2a.  This
           includes the addition of a new "char8_t" fundamental type,
           changes to the types of UTF-8 string and character literals,
           new signatures for user-defined literals, associated standard
           library updates, and new "__cpp_char8_t" and
           "__cpp_lib_char8_t" feature test macros.

           This option enables functions to be overloaded for ordinary
           and UTF-8 strings:

                   int f(const char *);    // #1
                   int f(const char8_t *); // #2
                   int v1 = f("text");     // Calls #1
                   int v2 = f(u8"text");   // Calls #2

           and introduces new signatures for user-defined literals:

                   int operator""_udl1(char8_t);
                   int v3 = u8'x'_udl1;
                   int operator""_udl2(const char8_t*, std::size_t);
                   int v4 = u8"text"_udl2;
                   template&lt;typename T, T...&gt; int operator""_udl3();
                   int v5 = u8"text"_udl3;

           The change to the types of UTF-8 string and character
           literals introduces incompatibilities with ISO C++11 and
           later standards.  For example, the following code is well-
           formed under ISO C++11, but is ill-formed when <b>-fchar8_t </b>is
           specified.

                   char ca[] = u8"xx";     // error: char-array initialized from wide
                                           //        string
                   const char *cp = u8"xx";// error: invalid conversion from
                                           //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
                   int f(const char*);
                   auto v = f(u8"xx");     // error: invalid conversion from
                                           //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
                   std::string s{u8"xx"};  // error: no matching function for call to
                                           //        `std::basic_string&lt;char&gt;::basic_string()'
                   using namespace std::literals;
                   s = u8"xx"s;            // error: conversion from
                                           //        `basic_string&lt;char8_t&gt;' to non-scalar
                                           //        type `basic_string&lt;char&gt;' requested

       <b>-fcheck-new</b>
           Check that the pointer returned by "operator new" is non-null
           before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This
           check is normally unnecessary because the C++ standard
           specifies that "operator new" only returns 0 if it is
           declared "throw()", in which case the compiler always checks
           the return value even without this option.  In all other
           cases, when "operator new" has a non-empty exception
           specification, memory exhaustion is signalled by throwing
           "std::bad_alloc".  See also <b>new (nothrow)</b>.

       <b>-fconcepts</b>
           Enable support for the C++ Extensions for Concepts Technical
           Specification, ISO 19217 (2015), which allows code like

                   template &lt;class T&gt; concept bool Addable = requires (T t) { t + t; };
                   template &lt;Addable T&gt; T add (T a, T b) { return a + b; }

       <b>-fconstexpr-depth=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr
           functions to <i>n</i>.  A limit is needed to detect endless
           recursion during constant expression evaluation.  The minimum
           specified by the standard is 512.

       <b>-fconstexpr-loop-limit=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the maximum number of iterations for a loop in C++14
           constexpr functions to <i>n</i>.  A limit is needed to detect
           infinite loops during constant expression evaluation.  The
           default is 262144 (1&lt;&lt;18).

       <b>-fconstexpr-ops-limit=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the maximum number of operations during a single
           constexpr evaluation.  Even when number of iterations of a
           single loop is limited with the above limit, if there are
           several nested loops and each of them has many iterations but
           still smaller than the above limit, or if in a body of some
           loop or even outside of a loop too many expressions need to
           be evaluated, the resulting constexpr evaluation might take
           too long.  The default is 33554432 (1&lt;&lt;25).

       <b>-fdeduce-init-list</b>
           Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
           "std::initializer_list" from a brace-enclosed initializer
           list, i.e.

                   template &lt;class T&gt; auto forward(T t) -&gt; decltype (realfn (t))
                   {
                     return realfn (t);
                   }

                   void f()
                   {
                     forward({1,2}); // call forward&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt;
                   }

           This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
           originally proposed semantics for the C++11 standard, but was
           not part of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.
           This option is deprecated, and may be removed in a future
           version of G++.

       <b>-fno-elide-constructors</b>
           The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a
           temporary that is only used to initialize another object of
           the same type.  Specifying this option disables that
           optimization, and forces G++ to call the copy constructor in
           all cases.  This option also causes G++ to call trivial
           member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline.

           In C++17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries,
           but this option still affects trivial member functions.

       <b>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</b>
           Don't generate code to check for violation of exception
           specifications at run time.  This option violates the C++
           standard, but may be useful for reducing code size in
           production builds, much like defining "NDEBUG".  This does
           not give user code permission to throw exceptions in
           violation of the exception specifications; the compiler still
           optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
           unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run
           time.

       <b>-fextern-tls-init</b>
       <b>-fno-extern-tls-init</b>
           The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow "thread_local" and
           "threadprivate" variables to have dynamic (runtime)
           initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable
           goes through a wrapper function that performs any necessary
           initialization.  When the use and definition of the variable
           are in the same translation unit, this overhead can be
           optimized away, but when the use is in a different
           translation unit there is significant overhead even if the
           variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
           the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
           non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization
           (either because the variable is statically initialized, or a
           use of the variable in the defining TU will be executed
           before any uses in another TU), they can avoid this overhead
           with the <b>-fno-extern-tls-init </b>option.

           On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
           <b>-fextern-tls-init</b>.  On targets that do not support symbol
           aliases, the default is <b>-fno-extern-tls-init</b>.

       <b>-fno-gnu-keywords</b>
           Do not recognize "typeof" as a keyword, so that code can use
           this word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword
           "__typeof__" instead.  This option is implied by the strict
           ISO C++ dialects: <b>-ansi</b>, <b>-std=c++98</b>, <b>-std=c++11</b>, etc.

       <b>-fno-implicit-templates</b>
           Never emit code for non-inline templates that are
           instantiated implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for
           explicit instantiations.  If you use this option, you must
           take care to structure your code to include all the necessary
           explicit instantiations to avoid getting undefined symbols at
           link time.

       <b>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</b>
           Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline
           templates, either.  The default is to handle inlines
           differently so that compiles with and without optimization
           need the same set of explicit instantiations.

       <b>-fno-implement-inlines</b>
           To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline
           functions controlled by "#pragma implementation".  This
           causes linker errors if these functions are not inlined
           everywhere they are called.

       <b>-fms-extensions</b>
           Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such
           as implicit int and getting a pointer to member function via
           non-standard syntax.

       <b>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</b>
           Enable the P0136 adjustment to the semantics of C++11
           constructor inheritance.  This is part of C++17 but also
           considered to be a Defect Report against C++11 and C++14.
           This flag is enabled by default unless <b>-fabi-version=10 </b>or
           lower is specified.

       <b>-fnew-ttp-matching</b>
           Enable the P0522 resolution to Core issue 150, template
           template parameters and default arguments: this allows a
           template with default template arguments as an argument for a
           template template parameter with fewer template parameters.
           This flag is enabled by default for <b>-std=c++17</b>.

       <b>-fno-nonansi-builtins</b>
           Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not
           mandated by ANSI/ISO C.  These include "ffs", "alloca",
           "_exit", "index", "bzero", "conjf", and other related
           functions.

       <b>-fnothrow-opt</b>
           Treat a "throw()" exception specification as if it were a
           "noexcept" specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
           overhead relative to a function with no exception
           specification.  If the function has local variables of types
           with non-trivial destructors, the exception specification
           actually makes the function smaller because the EH cleanups
           for those variables can be optimized away.  The semantic
           effect is that an exception thrown out of a function with
           such an exception specification results in a call to
           "terminate" rather than "unexpected".

       <b>-fno-operator-names</b>
           Do not treat the operator name keywords "and", "bitand",
           "bitor", "compl", "not", "or" and "xor" as synonyms as
           keywords.

       <b>-fno-optional-diags</b>
           Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does
           not need to issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic
           issued by G++ is the one for a name having multiple meanings
           within a class.

       <b>-fpermissive</b>
           Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from
           errors to warnings.  Thus, using <b>-fpermissive </b>allows some
           nonconforming code to compile.

       <b>-fno-pretty-templates</b>
           When an error message refers to a specialization of a
           function template, the compiler normally prints the signature
           of the template followed by the template arguments and any
           typedefs or typenames in the signature (e.g. "void f(T) [with
           T = int]" rather than "void f(int)") so that it's clear which
           template is involved.  When an error message refers to a
           specialization of a class template, the compiler omits any
           template arguments that match the default template arguments
           for that template.  If either of these behaviors make it
           harder to understand the error message rather than easier,
           you can use <b>-fno-pretty-templates </b>to disable them.

       <b>-frepo</b>
           Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This
           option also implies <b>-fno-implicit-templates</b>.

       <b>-fno-rtti</b>
           Disable generation of information about every class with
           virtual functions for use by the C++ run-time type
           identification features ("dynamic_cast" and "typeid").  If
           you don't use those parts of the language, you can save some
           space by using this flag.  Note that exception handling uses
           the same information, but G++ generates it as needed. The
           "dynamic_cast" operator can still be used for casts that do
           not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to "void *"
           or to unambiguous base classes.

           Mixing code compiled with <b>-frtti </b>with that compiled with
           <b>-fno-rtti </b>may not work.  For example, programs may fail to
           link if a class compiled with <b>-fno-rtti </b>is used as a base for
           a class compiled with <b>-frtti</b>.

       <b>-fsized-deallocation</b>
           Enable the built-in global declarations

                   void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
                   void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;

           as introduced in C++14.  This is useful for user-defined
           replacement deallocation functions that, for example, use the
           size of the object to make deallocation faster.  Enabled by
           default under <b>-std=c++14 </b>and above.  The flag
           <b>-Wsized-deallocation </b>warns about places that might want to
           add a definition.

       <b>-fstrict-enums</b>
           Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a
           value of enumerated type can only be one of the values of the
           enumeration (as defined in the C++ standard; basically, a
           value that can be represented in the minimum number of bits
           needed to represent all the enumerators).  This assumption
           may not be valid if the program uses a cast to convert an
           arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.

       <b>-fstrong-eval-order</b>
           Evaluate member access, array subscripting, and shift
           expressions in left-to-right order, and evaluate assignment
           in right-to-left order, as adopted for C++17.  Enabled by
           default with <b>-std=c++17</b>.  <b>-fstrong-eval-order=some </b>enables
           just the ordering of member access and shift expressions, and
           is the default without <b>-std=c++17</b>.

       <b>-ftemplate-backtrace-limit=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a
           single warning or error to <i>n</i>.  The default value is 10.

       <b>-ftemplate-depth=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to
           <i>n</i>.  A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to
           detect endless recursions during template class
           instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++ conforming programs must not
           rely on a maximum depth greater than 17 (changed to 1024 in
           C++11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler can run
           out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.

       <b>-fno-threadsafe-statics</b>
           Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in
           the C++ ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.
           You can use this option to reduce code size slightly in code
           that doesn't need to be thread-safe.

       <b>-fuse-cxa-atexit</b>
           Register destructors for objects with static storage duration
           with the "__cxa_atexit" function rather than the "atexit"
           function.  This option is required for fully standards-
           compliant handling of static destructors, but only works if
           your C library supports "__cxa_atexit".

       <b>-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr</b>
           Don't use the "__cxa_get_exception_ptr" runtime routine.
           This causes "std::uncaught_exception" to be incorrect, but is
           necessary if the runtime routine is not available.

       <b>-fvisibility-inlines-hidden</b>
           This switch declares that the user does not attempt to
           compare pointers to inline functions or methods where the
           addresses of the two functions are taken in different shared
           objects.

           The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline
           methods with "__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))" so
           that they do not appear in the export table of a DSO and do
           not require a PLT indirection when used within the DSO.
           Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect on load and
           link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
           dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of
           templates.

           The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking
           the methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect
           static variables local to the function or cause the compiler
           to deduce that the function is defined in only one shared
           object.

           You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to
           negate the effect of the switch for that method.  For
           example, if you do want to compare pointers to a particular
           inline method, you might mark it as having default
           visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
           visibility has no effect.

           Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this
           option as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared
           library boundary.

       <b>-fvisibility-ms-compat</b>
           This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's
           C++ linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual
           Studio.

           The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:

           1.  It sets the default visibility to "hidden", like
               <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b>.

           2.  Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

           3.  The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without
               explicit visibility specifications that are defined in
               more than one shared object: those declarations are
               permitted if they are permitted when this option is not
               used.

           In new code it is better to use <b>-fvisibility=hidden </b>and
           export those classes that are intended to be externally
           visible.  Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely,
           perhaps accidentally, on the Visual Studio behavior.

           Among the consequences of these changes are that static data
           members of the same type with the same name but defined in
           different shared objects are different, so changing one does
           not change the other; and that pointers to function members
           defined in different shared objects may not compare equal.
           When this flag is given, it is a violation of the ODR to
           define types with the same name differently.

       <b>-fno-weak</b>
           Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the
           linker.  By default, G++ uses weak symbols if they are
           available.  This option exists only for testing, and should
           not be used by end-users; it results in inferior code and has
           no benefits.  This option may be removed in a future release
           of G++.

       <b>-nostdinc++</b>
           Do not search for header files in the standard directories
           specific to C++, but do still search the other standard
           directories.  (This option is used when building the C++
           library.)

       In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation
       options have meanings only for C++ programs:

       <b>-Wabi </b>(C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when G++ it generates code that is probably not
           compatible with the vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Since G++ now
           defaults to updating the ABI with each major release,
           normally <b>-Wabi </b>will warn only if there is a check added later
           in a release series for an ABI issue discovered since the
           initial release.  <b>-Wabi </b>will warn about more things if an
           older ABI version is selected (with <b>-fabi-version=</b><i>n</i>).

           <b>-Wabi </b>can also be used with an explicit version number to
           warn about compatibility with a particular <b>-fabi-version</b>
           level, e.g. <b>-Wabi=2 </b>to warn about changes relative to
           <b>-fabi-version=2</b>.

           If an explicit version number is provided and
           <b>-fabi-compat-version </b>is not specified, the version number
           from this option is used for compatibility aliases.  If no
           explicit version number is provided with this option, but
           <b>-fabi-compat-version </b>is specified, that version number is
           used for ABI warnings.

           Although an effort has been made to warn about all such
           cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned
           about, even though G++ is generating incompatible code.
           There may also be cases where warnings are emitted even
           though the code that is generated is compatible.

           You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you
           are concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may
           not be binary compatible with code generated by other
           compilers.

           Known incompatibilities in <b>-fabi-version=2 </b>(which was the
           default from GCC 3.4 to 4.9) include:

           *   A template with a non-type template parameter of
               reference type was mangled incorrectly:

                       extern int N;
                       template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {};
                       void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2}

               This was fixed in <b>-fabi-version=3</b>.

           *   SIMD vector types declared using "__attribute
               ((vector_size))" were mangled in a non-standard way that
               does not allow for overloading of functions taking
               vectors of different sizes.

               The mangling was changed in <b>-fabi-version=4</b>.

           *   "__attribute ((const))" and "noreturn" were mangled as
               type qualifiers, and "decltype" of a plain declaration
               was folded away.

               These mangling issues were fixed in <b>-fabi-version=5</b>.

           *   Scoped enumerators passed as arguments to a variadic
               function are promoted like unscoped enumerators, causing
               "va_arg" to complain.  On most targets this does not
               actually affect the parameter passing ABI, as there is no
               way to pass an argument smaller than "int".

               Also, the ABI changed the mangling of template argument
               packs, "const_cast", "static_cast", prefix
               increment/decrement, and a class scope function used as a
               template argument.

               These issues were corrected in <b>-fabi-version=6</b>.

           *   Lambdas in default argument scope were mangled
               incorrectly, and the ABI changed the mangling of
               "nullptr_t".

               These issues were corrected in <b>-fabi-version=7</b>.

           *   When mangling a function type with function-cv-
               qualifiers, the un-qualified function type was
               incorrectly treated as a substitution candidate.

               This was fixed in <b>-fabi-version=8</b>, the default for GCC
               5.1.

           *   "decltype(nullptr)" incorrectly had an alignment of 1,
               leading to unaligned accesses.  Note that this did not
               affect the ABI of a function with a "nullptr_t"
               parameter, as parameters have a minimum alignment.

               This was fixed in <b>-fabi-version=9</b>, the default for GCC
               5.2.

           *   Target-specific attributes that affect the identity of a
               type, such as ia32 calling conventions on a function type
               (stdcall, regparm, etc.), did not affect the mangled
               name, leading to name collisions when function pointers
               were used as template arguments.

               This was fixed in <b>-fabi-version=10</b>, the default for GCC
               6.1.

           It also warns about psABI-related changes.  The known psABI
           changes at this point include:

           *   For SysV/x86-64, unions with "long double" members are
               passed in memory as specified in psABI.  For example:

                       union U {
                         long double ld;
                         int i;
                       };

               "union U" is always passed in memory.

       <b>-Wabi-tag </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a type with an ABI tag is used in a context that
           does not have that ABI tag.  See <b>C++ Attributes </b>for more
           information about ABI tags.

       <b>-Wctor-dtor-privacy </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors
           or destructors in that class are private, and it has neither
           friends nor public static member functions.  Also warn if
           there are no non-private methods, and there's at least one
           private member function that isn't a constructor or
           destructor.

       <b>-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when "delete" is used to destroy an instance of a class
           that has virtual functions and non-virtual destructor. It is
           unsafe to delete an instance of a derived class through a
           pointer to a base class if the base class does not have a
           virtual destructor.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wdeprecated-copy </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn that the implicit declaration of a copy constructor or
           copy assignment operator is deprecated if the class has a
           user-provided copy constructor or copy assignment operator,
           in C++11 and up.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.  With
           <b>-Wdeprecated-copy-dtor</b>, also deprecate if the class has a
           user-provided destructor.

       <b>-Wno-init-list-lifetime </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Do not warn about uses of "std::initializer_list" that are
           likely to result in dangling pointers.  Since the underlying
           array for an "initializer_list" is handled like a normal C++
           temporary object, it is easy to inadvertently keep a pointer
           to the array past the end of the array's lifetime.  For
           example:

           *   If a function returns a temporary "initializer_list", or
               a local "initializer_list" variable, the array's lifetime
               ends at the end of the return statement, so the value
               returned has a dangling pointer.

           *   If a new-expression creates an "initializer_list", the
               array only lives until the end of the enclosing full-
               expression, so the "initializer_list" in the heap has a
               dangling pointer.

           *   When an "initializer_list" variable is assigned from a
               brace-enclosed initializer list, the temporary array
               created for the right side of the assignment only lives
               until the end of the full-expression, so at the next
               statement the "initializer_list" variable has a dangling
               pointer.

                       // li's initial underlying array lives as long as li
                       std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; li = { 1,2,3 };
                       // assignment changes li to point to a temporary array
                       li = { 4, 5 };
                       // now the temporary is gone and li has a dangling pointer
                       int i = li.begin()[0] // undefined behavior

           *   When a list constructor stores the "begin" pointer from
               the "initializer_list" argument, this doesn't extend the
               lifetime of the array, so if a class variable is
               constructed from a temporary "initializer_list", the
               pointer is left dangling by the end of the variable
               declaration statement.

       <b>-Wliteral-suffix </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-
           suffix which does not begin with an underscore.  As a
           conforming extension, GCC treats such suffixes as separate
           preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards
           compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from
           "&lt;inttypes.h&gt;".  For example:

                   #define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
                   #include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
                   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

                   int main() {
                     int64_t i64 = 123;
                     printf("My int64: %" PRId64"\n", i64);
                   }

           In this case, "PRId64" is treated as a separate preprocessing
           token.

           Additionally, warn when a user-defined literal operator is
           declared with a literal suffix identifier that doesn't begin
           with an underscore. Literal suffix identifiers that don't
           begin with an underscore are reserved for future
           standardization.

           This warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wlto-type-mismatch</b>
           During the link-time optimization warn about type mismatches
           in global declarations from different compilation units.
           Requires <b>-flto </b>to be enabled.  Enabled by default.

       <b>-Wno-narrowing </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           For C++11 and later standards, narrowing conversions are
           diagnosed by default, as required by the standard.  A
           narrowing conversion from a constant produces an error, and a
           narrowing conversion from a non-constant produces a warning,
           but <b>-Wno-narrowing </b>suppresses the diagnostic.  Note that this
           does not affect the meaning of well-formed code; narrowing
           conversions are still considered ill-formed in SFINAE
           contexts.

           With <b>-Wnarrowing </b>in C++98, warn when a narrowing conversion
           prohibited by C++11 occurs within <b>{ }</b>, e.g.

                   int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing from double to int

           This flag is included in <b>-Wall </b>and <b>-Wc++11-compat</b>.

       <b>-Wnoexcept </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of
           a call to a function that does not have a non-throwing
           exception specification (i.e. "throw()" or "noexcept") but is
           known by the compiler to never throw an exception.

       <b>-Wnoexcept-type </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if the C++17 feature making "noexcept" part of a
           function type changes the mangled name of a symbol relative
           to C++14.  Enabled by <b>-Wabi </b>and <b>-Wc++17-compat</b>.

           As an example:

                   template &lt;class T&gt; void f(T t) { t(); };
                   void g() noexcept;
                   void h() { f(g); }

           In C++14, "f" calls "f&lt;void(*)()&gt;", but in C++17 it calls
           "f&lt;void(*)()noexcept&gt;".

       <b>-Wclass-memaccess </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when the destination of a call to a raw memory function
           such as "memset" or "memcpy" is an object of class type, and
           when writing into such an object might bypass the class non-
           trivial or deleted constructor or copy assignment, violate
           const-correctness or encapsulation, or corrupt virtual table
           pointers.  Modifying the representation of such objects may
           violate invariants maintained by member functions of the
           class.  For example, the call to "memset" below is undefined
           because it modifies a non-trivial class object and is,
           therefore, diagnosed.  The safe way to either initialize or
           clear the storage of objects of such types is by using the
           appropriate constructor or assignment operator, if one is
           available.

                   std::string str = "abc";
                   memset (&amp;str, 0, sizeof str);

           The <b>-Wclass-memaccess </b>option is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.  Explicitly
           casting the pointer to the class object to "void *" or to a
           type that can be safely accessed by the raw memory function
           suppresses the warning.

       <b>-Wnon-virtual-dtor </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible
           non-virtual destructor itself or in an accessible polymorphic
           base class, in which case it is possible but unsafe to delete
           an instance of a derived class through a pointer to the class
           itself or base class.  This warning is automatically enabled
           if <b>-Weffc++ </b>is specified.

       <b>-Wregister </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn on uses of the "register" storage class specifier,
           except when it is part of the GNU <b>Explicit Register Variables</b>
           extension.  The use of the "register" keyword as storage
           class specifier has been deprecated in C++11 and removed in
           C++17.  Enabled by default with <b>-std=c++17</b>.

       <b>-Wreorder </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code
           does not match the order in which they must be executed.  For
           instance:

                   struct A {
                     int i;
                     int j;
                     A(): j (0), i (1) { }
                   };

           The compiler rearranges the member initializers for "i" and
           "j" to match the declaration order of the members, emitting a
           warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-pessimizing-move </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           This warning warns when a call to "std::move" prevents copy
           elision.  A typical scenario when copy elision can occur is
           when returning in a function with a class return type, when
           the expression being returned is the name of a non-volatile
           automatic object, and is not a function parameter, and has
           the same type as the function return type.

                   struct T {
                   ...
                   };
                   T fn()
                   {
                     T t;
                     ...
                     return std::move (t);
                   }

           But in this example, the "std::move" call prevents copy
           elision.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-redundant-move </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           This warning warns about redundant calls to "std::move"; that
           is, when a move operation would have been performed even
           without the "std::move" call.  This happens because the
           compiler is forced to treat the object as if it were an
           rvalue in certain situations such as returning a local
           variable, where copy elision isn't applicable.  Consider:

                   struct T {
                   ...
                   };
                   T fn(T t)
                   {
                     ...
                     return std::move (t);
                   }

           Here, the "std::move" call is redundant.  Because G++
           implements Core Issue 1579, another example is:

                   struct T { // convertible to U
                   ...
                   };
                   struct U {
                   ...
                   };
                   U fn()
                   {
                     T t;
                     ...
                     return std::move (t);
                   }

           In this example, copy elision isn't applicable because the
           type of the expression being returned and the function return
           type differ, yet G++ treats the return value as if it were
           designated by an rvalue.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-fext-numeric-literals </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Accept imaginary, fixed-point, or machine-defined literal
           number suffixes as GNU extensions.  When this option is
           turned off these suffixes are treated as C++11 user-defined
           literal numeric suffixes.  This is on by default for all
           pre-C++11 dialects and all GNU dialects: <b>-std=c++98</b>,
           <b>-std=gnu++98</b>, <b>-std=gnu++11</b>, <b>-std=gnu++14</b>.  This option is off
           by default for ISO C++11 onwards (<b>-std=c++11</b>, ...).

       The following <b>-W... </b>options are not affected by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Weffc++ </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from
           Scott Meyers' <i>Effective C++</i> series of books:

           *   Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for
               classes with dynamically-allocated memory.

           *   Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.

           *   Have "operator=" return a reference to *this.

           *   Don't try to return a reference when you must return an
               object.

           *   Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment
               and decrement operators.

           *   Never overload "&amp;&amp;", "||", or ",".

           This option also enables <b>-Wnon-virtual-dtor</b>, which is also
           one of the effective C++ recommendations.  However, the check
           is extended to warn about the lack of virtual destructor in
           accessible non-polymorphic bases classes too.

           When selecting this option, be aware that the standard
           library headers do not obey all of these guidelines; use <b>grep</b>
           <b>-v </b>to filter out those warnings.

       <b>-Wstrict-null-sentinel </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about the use of an uncasted "NULL" as sentinel.  When
           compiling only with GCC this is a valid sentinel, as "NULL"
           is defined to "__null".  Although it is a null pointer
           constant rather than a null pointer, it is guaranteed to be
           of the same size as a pointer.  But this use is not portable
           across different compilers.

       <b>-Wno-non-template-friend </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable warnings when non-template friend functions are
           declared within a template.  In very old versions of GCC that
           predate implementation of the ISO standard, declarations such
           as <b>friend int foo(int)</b>, where the name of the friend is an
           unqualified-id, could be interpreted as a particular
           specialization of a template function; the warning exists to
           diagnose compatibility problems, and is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wold-style-cast </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is
           used within a C++ program.  The new-style casts
           ("dynamic_cast", "static_cast", "reinterpret_cast", and
           "const_cast") are less vulnerable to unintended effects and
           much easier to search for.

       <b>-Woverloaded-virtual </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from
           a base class.  For example, in:

                   struct A {
                     virtual void f();
                   };

                   struct B: public A {
                     void f(int);
                   };

           the "A" class version of "f" is hidden in "B", and code like:

                   B* b;
                   b-&gt;f();

           fails to compile.

       <b>-Wno-pmf-conversions </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to
           member function to a plain pointer.

       <b>-Wsign-promo </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from
           unsigned or enumerated type to a signed type, over a
           conversion to an unsigned type of the same size.  Previous
           versions of G++ tried to preserve unsignedness, but the
           standard mandates the current behavior.

       <b>-Wtemplates </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a primary template declaration is encountered.
           Some coding rules disallow templates, and this may be used to
           enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system
           header file, such as the STL, so one can still use the STL.
           One may also instantiate or specialize templates.

       <b>-Wmultiple-inheritance </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a class is defined with multiple direct base
           classes.  Some coding rules disallow multiple inheritance,
           and this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is
           inactive inside a system header file, such as the STL, so one
           can still use the STL.  One may also define classes that
           indirectly use multiple inheritance.

       <b>-Wvirtual-inheritance</b>
           Warn when a class is defined with a virtual direct base
           class.  Some coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and
           this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is
           inactive inside a system header file, such as the STL, so one
           can still use the STL.  One may also define classes that
           indirectly use virtual inheritance.

       <b>-Wnamespaces</b>
           Warn when a namespace definition is opened.  Some coding
           rules disallow namespaces, and this may be used to enforce
           that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header
           file, such as the STL, so one can still use the STL.  One may
           also use using directives and qualified names.

       <b>-Wno-terminate </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable the warning about a throw-expression that will
           immediately result in a call to "terminate".

       <b>-Wno-class-conversion </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Disable the warning about the case when a conversion function
           converts an object to the same type, to a base class of that
           type, or to void; such a conversion function will never be
           called.

   <b>Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialects</b>
       (NOTE: This manual does not describe the Objective-C and
       Objective-C++ languages themselves.

       This section describes the command-line options that are only
       meaningful for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs.  You can
       also use most of the language-independent GNU compiler options.
       For example, you might compile a file <i>some_class.m</i> like this:

               gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m

       In this example, <b>-fgnu-runtime </b>is an option meant only for
       Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the other
       options with any language supported by GCC.

       Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language,
       Objective-C compilations may also use options specific to the C
       front-end (e.g., <b>-Wtraditional</b>).  Similarly, Objective-C++
       compilations may use C++-specific options (e.g., <b>-Wabi</b>).

       Here is a list of options that are <i>only</i> for compiling Objective-C
       and Objective-C++ programs:

       <b>-fconstant-string-class=</b><i>class-name</i>
           Use <i>class-name</i> as the name of the class to instantiate for
           each literal string specified with the syntax "@"..."".  The
           default class name is "NXConstantString" if the GNU runtime
           is being used, and "NSConstantString" if the NeXT runtime is
           being used (see below).  The <b>-fconstant-cfstrings </b>option, if
           also present, overrides the <b>-fconstant-string-class </b>setting
           and cause "@"..."" literals to be laid out as constant
           CoreFoundation strings.

       <b>-fgnu-runtime</b>
           Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU
           Objective-C runtime.  This is the default for most types of
           systems.

       <b>-fnext-runtime</b>
           Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is
           the default for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac
           OS X.  The macro "__NEXT_RUNTIME__" is predefined if (and
           only if) this option is used.

       <b>-fno-nil-receivers</b>
           Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches ("[receiver
           message:arg]") in this translation unit ensure that the
           receiver is not "nil".  This allows for more efficient entry
           points in the runtime to be used.  This option is only
           available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime and ABI
           version 0 or 1.

       <b>-fobjc-abi-version=</b><i>n</i>
           Use version <i>n</i> of the Objective-C ABI for the selected
           runtime.  This option is currently supported only for the
           NeXT runtime.  In that case, Version 0 is the traditional
           (32-bit) ABI without support for properties and other
           Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the traditional
           (32-bit) ABI with support for properties and other Objective-
           C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64-bit) ABI.  If
           nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit
           target machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target machines.

       <b>-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors</b>
           For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance
           variables is a C++ object with a non-trivial default
           constructor.  If so, synthesize a special "- (id)
           .cxx_construct" instance method which runs non-trivial
           default constructors on any such instance variables, in
           order, and then return "self".  Similarly, check if any
           instance variable is a C++ object with a non-trivial
           destructor, and if so, synthesize a special "- (void)
           .cxx_destruct" method which runs all such default
           destructors, in reverse order.

           The "- (id) .cxx_construct" and "- (void) .cxx_destruct"
           methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
           declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those
           inherited from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the
           Objective-C runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's
           inheritance hierarchy.  The "- (id) .cxx_construct" methods
           are invoked by the runtime immediately after a new object
           instance is allocated; the "- (void) .cxx_destruct" methods
           are invoked immediately before the runtime deallocates an
           object instance.

           As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4
           and later has support for invoking the "- (id)
           .cxx_construct" and "- (void) .cxx_destruct" methods.

       <b>-fobjc-direct-dispatch</b>
           Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this
           is accomplished via the comm page.

       <b>-fobjc-exceptions</b>
           Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
           Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++.  This option
           is required to use the Objective-C keywords @try, @throw,
           @catch, @finally and @synchronized.  This option is available
           with both the GNU runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not
           available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X
           10.2 and earlier).

       <b>-fobjc-gc</b>
           Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and
           Objective-C++ programs.  This option is only available with
           the NeXT runtime; the GNU runtime has a different garbage
           collection implementation that does not require special
           compiler flags.

       <b>-fobjc-nilcheck</b>
           For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the ABI, check for a
           nil receiver in method invocations before doing the actual
           method call.  This is the default and can be disabled using
           <b>-fno-objc-nilcheck</b>.  Class methods and super calls are never
           checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set
           to.  Currently this flag does nothing when the GNU runtime,
           or an older version of the NeXT runtime ABI, is used.

       <b>-fobjc-std=objc1</b>
           Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the
           language recognized by GCC 4.0.  This only affects the
           Objective-C additions to the C/C++ language; it does not
           affect conformance to C/C++ standards, which is controlled by
           the separate C/C++ dialect option flags.  When this option is
           used with the Objective-C or Objective-C++ compiler, any
           Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by GCC 4.0 is
           rejected.  This is useful if you need to make sure that your
           Objective-C code can be compiled with older versions of GCC.

       <b>-freplace-objc-classes</b>
           Emit a special marker instructing <i><b>ld</b>(1) </i>not to statically
           link in the resulting object file, and allow <i><b>dyld</b>(1) </i>to load
           it in at run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with
           the Fix-and-Continue debugging mode, where the object file in
           question may be recompiled and dynamically reloaded in the
           course of program execution, without the need to restart the
           program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality is
           only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac OS
           X 10.3 and later.

       <b>-fzero-link</b>
           When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily
           replaces calls to "objc_getClass("...")" (when the name of
           the class is known at compile time) with static class
           references that get initialized at load time, which improves
           run-time performance.  Specifying the <b>-fzero-link </b>flag
           suppresses this behavior and causes calls to
           "objc_getClass("...")"  to be retained.  This is useful in
           Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows for individual
           class implementations to be modified during program
           execution.  The GNU runtime currently always retains calls to
           "objc_get_class("...")"  regardless of command-line options.

       <b>-fno-local-ivars</b>
           By default instance variables in Objective-C can be accessed
           as if they were local variables from within the methods of
           the class they're declared in.  This can lead to shadowing
           between instance variables and other variables declared
           either locally inside a class method or globally with the
           same name.  Specifying the <b>-fno-local-ivars </b>flag disables
           this behavior thus avoiding variable shadowing issues.

       <b>-fivar-visibility=</b>[<b>public</b>|<b>protected</b>|<b>private</b>|<b>package</b>]
           Set the default instance variable visibility to the specified
           option so that instance variables declared outside the scope
           of any access modifier directives default to the specified
           visibility.

       <b>-gen-decls</b>
           Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the
           source file to a file named <i>sourcename.decl</i>.

       <b>-Wassign-intercept </b>(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted
           by the garbage collector.

       <b>-Wno-protocol </b>(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is
           issued for every method in the protocol that is not
           implemented by the class.  The default behavior is to issue a
           warning for every method not explicitly implemented in the
           class, even if a method implementation is inherited from the
           superclass.  If you use the <b>-Wno-protocol </b>option, then
           methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be
           implemented, and no warning is issued for them.

       <b>-Wselector </b>(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same
           selector are found during compilation.  The check is
           performed on the list of methods in the final stage of
           compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed for each
           selector appearing in a "@selector(...)"  expression, and a
           corresponding method for that selector has been found during
           compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only
           at the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if
           the final stage of compilation is not reached, for example
           because an error is found during compilation, or because the
           <b>-fsyntax-only </b>option is being used.

       <b>-Wstrict-selector-match </b>(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or
           return types are found for a given selector when attempting
           to send a message using this selector to a receiver of type
           "id" or "Class".  When this flag is off (which is the default
           behavior), the compiler omits such warnings if any
           differences found are confined to types that share the same
           size and alignment.

       <b>-Wundeclared-selector </b>(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if a "@selector(...)" expression referring to an
           undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered
           undeclared if no method with that name has been declared
           before the "@selector(...)" expression, either explicitly in
           an @interface or @protocol declaration, or implicitly in an
           @implementation section.  This option always performs its
           checks as soon as a "@selector(...)" expression is found,
           while <b>-Wselector </b>only performs its checks in the final stage
           of compilation.  This also enforces the coding style
           convention that methods and selectors must be declared before
           being used.

       <b>-print-objc-runtime-info</b>
           Generate C header describing the largest structure that is
           passed by value, if any.

   <b>Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting</b>
       Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted
       irrespective of the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).
       You can use the options described below to control the formatting
       algorithm for diagnostic messages, e.g. how many characters per
       line, how often source location information should be reported.
       Note that some language front ends may not honor these options.

       <b>-fmessage-length=</b><i>n</i>
           Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of
           about <i>n</i> characters.  If <i>n</i> is zero, then no line-wrapping is
           done; each error message appears on a single line.  This is
           the default for all front ends.

           Note - this option also affects the display of the <b>#error </b>and
           <b>#warning </b>pre-processor directives, and the <b>deprecated</b>
           function/type/variable attribute.  It does not however affect
           the <b>pragma GCC warning </b>and <b>pragma GCC error </b>pragmas.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once</b>
           Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the
           diagnostic messages reporter to emit source location
           information <i>once</i>; that is, in case the message is too long to
           fit on a single physical line and has to be wrapped, the
           source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again, over and
           over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
           behavior.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</b>
           Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the
           diagnostic messages reporter to emit the same source location
           information (as prefix) for physical lines that result from
           the process of breaking a message which is too long to fit on
           a single line.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-color[=</b><i>WHEN</i><b>]</b>
       <b>-fno-diagnostics-color</b>
           Use color in diagnostics.  <i>WHEN</i> is <b>never</b>, <b>always</b>, or <b>auto</b>.
           The default depends on how the compiler has been configured,
           it can be any of the above <i>WHEN</i> options or also <b>never </b>if
           <b>GCC_COLORS </b>environment variable isn't present in the
           environment, and <b>auto </b>otherwise.  <b>auto </b>means to use color
           only when the standard error is a terminal.  The forms
           <b>-fdiagnostics-color </b>and <b>-fno-diagnostics-color </b>are aliases
           for <b>-fdiagnostics-color=always </b>and <b>-fdiagnostics-color=never</b>,
           respectively.

           The colors are defined by the environment variable
           <b>GCC_COLORS</b>.  Its value is a colon-separated list of
           capabilities and Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) substrings.
           SGR commands are interpreted by the terminal or terminal
           emulator.  (See the section in the documentation of your text
           terminal for permitted values and their meanings as character
           attributes.)  These substring values are integers in decimal
           representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.
           Common values to concatenate include <b>1 </b>for bold, <b>4 </b>for
           underline, <b>5 </b>for blink, <b>7 </b>for inverse, <b>39 </b>for default
           foreground color, <b>30 </b>to <b>37 </b>for foreground colors, <b>90 </b>to <b>97</b>
           for 16-color mode foreground colors, <b>38;5;0 </b>to <b>38;5;255 </b>for
           88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors, <b>49 </b>for
           default background color, <b>40 </b>to <b>47 </b>for background colors, <b>100</b>
           to <b>107 </b>for 16-color mode background colors, and <b>48;5;0 </b>to
           <b>48;5;255 </b>for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.

           The default <b>GCC_COLORS </b>is

                   error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:range1=32:range2=34:locus=01:\
                   quote=01:fixit-insert=32:fixit-delete=31:\
                   diff-filename=01:diff-hunk=32:diff-delete=31:diff-insert=32:\
                   type-diff=01;32

           where <b>01;31 </b>is bold red, <b>01;35 </b>is bold magenta, <b>01;36 </b>is bold
           cyan, <b>32 </b>is green, <b>34 </b>is blue, <b>01 </b>is bold, and <b>31 </b>is red.
           Setting <b>GCC_COLORS </b>to the empty string disables colors.
           Supported capabilities are as follows.

           "error="
               SGR substring for error: markers.

           "warning="
               SGR substring for warning: markers.

           "note="
               SGR substring for note: markers.

           "range1="
               SGR substring for first additional range.

           "range2="
               SGR substring for second additional range.

           "locus="
               SGR substring for location information, <b>file:line </b>or
               <b>file:line:column </b>etc.

           "quote="
               SGR substring for information printed within quotes.

           "fixit-insert="
               SGR substring for fix-it hints suggesting text to be
               inserted or replaced.

           "fixit-delete="
               SGR substring for fix-it hints suggesting text to be
               deleted.

           "diff-filename="
               SGR substring for filename headers within generated
               patches.

           "diff-hunk="
               SGR substring for the starts of hunks within generated
               patches.

           "diff-delete="
               SGR substring for deleted lines within generated patches.

           "diff-insert="
               SGR substring for inserted lines within generated
               patches.

           "type-diff="
               SGR substring for highlighting mismatching types within
               template arguments in the C++ frontend.

       <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</b>
           By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating
           the command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic
           (if such an option is known to the diagnostic machinery).
           Specifying the <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-option </b>flag suppresses
           that behavior.

       <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-caret</b>
           By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original
           source line and a caret <b>^ </b>indicating the column.  This option
           suppresses this information.  The source line is truncated to
           <i>n</i> characters, if the <b>-fmessage-length=n </b>option is given.
           When the output is done to the terminal, the width is limited
           to the width given by the <b>COLUMNS </b>environment variable or, if
           not set, to the terminal width.

       <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-labels</b>
           By default, when printing source code (via
           <b>-fdiagnostics-show-caret</b>), diagnostics can label ranges of
           source code with pertinent information, such as the types of
           expressions:

                       printf ("foo %s bar", long_i + long_j);
                                    ~^       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                     |              |
                                     char *         long int

           This option suppresses the printing of these labels (in the
           example above, the vertical bars and the "char *" and "long
           int" text).

       <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-line-numbers</b>
           By default, when printing source code (via
           <b>-fdiagnostics-show-caret</b>), a left margin is printed, showing
           line numbers.  This option suppresses this left margin.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-minimum-margin-width=</b><i>width</i>
           This option controls the minimum width of the left margin
           printed by <b>-fdiagnostics-show-line-numbers</b>.  It defaults to
           6.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</b>
           Emit fix-it hints in a machine-parseable format, suitable for
           consumption by IDEs.  For each fix-it, a line will be printed
           after the relevant diagnostic, starting with the string "fix-
           it:".  For example:

                   fix-it:"test.c":{45:3-45:21}:"gtk_widget_show_all"

           The location is expressed as a half-open range, expressed as
           a count of bytes, starting at byte 1 for the initial column.
           In the above example, bytes 3 through 20 of line 45 of
           "test.c" are to be replaced with the given string:

                   00000000011111111112222222222
                   12345678901234567890123456789
                     gtk_widget_showall (dlg);
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                     gtk_widget_show_all

           The filename and replacement string escape backslash as "\\",
           tab as "\t", newline as "\n", double quotes as "\"", non-
           printable characters as octal (e.g. vertical tab as "\013").

           An empty replacement string indicates that the given range is
           to be removed.  An empty range (e.g. "45:3-45:3") indicates
           that the string is to be inserted at the given position.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-generate-patch</b>
           Print fix-it hints to stderr in unified diff format, after
           any diagnostics are printed.  For example:

                   --- test.c
                   +++ test.c
                   @ -42,5 +42,5 @

                    void show_cb(GtkDialog *dlg)
                    {
                   -  gtk_widget_showall(dlg);
                   +  gtk_widget_show_all(dlg);
                    }

           The diff may or may not be colorized, following the same
           rules as for diagnostics (see <b>-fdiagnostics-color</b>).

       <b>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree</b>
           In the C++ frontend, when printing diagnostics showing
           mismatching template types, such as:

                     could not convert 'std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;()'
                       from 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;' to 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;

           the <b>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree </b>flag enables printing a
           tree-like structure showing the common and differing parts of
           the types, such as:

                     map&lt;
                       [...],
                       vector&lt;
                         [double != float]&gt;&gt;

           The parts that differ are highlighted with color ("double"
           and "float" in this case).

       <b>-fno-elide-type</b>
           By default when the C++ frontend prints diagnostics showing
           mismatching template types, common parts of the types are
           printed as "[...]" to simplify the error message.  For
           example:

                     could not convert 'std::map&lt;int, std::vector&lt;double&gt; &gt;()'
                       from 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;double&gt;&gt;' to 'map&lt;[...],vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;

           Specifying the <b>-fno-elide-type </b>flag suppresses that behavior.
           This flag also affects the output of the
           <b>-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree </b>flag.

       <b>-fno-show-column</b>
           Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be
           necessary if diagnostics are being scanned by a program that
           does not understand the column numbers, such as <b>dejagnu</b>.

       <b>-fdiagnostics-format=</b><i>FORMAT</i>
           Select a different format for printing diagnostics.  <i>FORMAT</i>
           is <b>text </b>or <b>json</b>.  The default is <b>text</b>.

           The <b>json </b>format consists of a top-level JSON array containing
           JSON objects representing the diagnostics.

           The JSON is emitted as one line, without formatting; the
           examples below have been formatted for clarity.

           Diagnostics can have child diagnostics.  For example, this
           error and note:

                   misleading-indentation.c:15:3: warning: this 'if' clause does not
                     guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation]
                      15 |   if (flag)
                         |   ^~
                   misleading-indentation.c:17:5: note: ...this statement, but the latter

                         |     ^

           might be printed in JSON form (after formatting) like this:

                   ]

           where the "note" is a child of the "warning".

           A diagnostic has a "kind".  If this is "warning", then there
           is an "option" key describing the command-line option
           controlling the warning.

           A diagnostic can contain zero or more locations.  Each
           location has up to three positions within it: a "caret"
           position and optional "start" and "finish" positions.  A
           location can also have an optional "label" string.  For
           example, this error:

                   bad-binary-ops.c:64:23: error: invalid operands to binary + (have 'S' {aka
                      'struct s'} and 'T' {aka 'struct t'})

           token at column 23.  It has two secondary locations,

                       }

           If a diagnostic contains fix-it hints, it has a "fixits"
           array, consisting of half-open intervals, similar to the
           output of <b>-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits</b>.  For example, this
           diagnostic with a replacement fix-it hint:

           where the fix-it hint suggests replacing the text from
           "start" up to but not including "next" with "string"'s value.
           Deletions are expressed via an empty value for "string",
           insertions by having "start" equal "next".

   <b>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</b>
       Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
       are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
       may have been an error.

       The following language-independent options do not enable specific
       warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.

       <b>-fsyntax-only</b>
           Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything
           beyond that.

       <b>-fmax-errors=</b><i>n</i>
           Limits the maximum number of error messages to <i>n</i>, at which
           point GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue
           processing the source code.  If <i>n</i> is 0 (the default), there
           is no limit on the number of error messages produced.  If
           <b>-Wfatal-errors </b>is also specified, then <b>-Wfatal-errors </b>takes
           precedence over this option.

       <b>-w  </b>Inhibit all warning messages.

       <b>-Werror</b>
           Make all warnings into errors.

       <b>-Werror=</b>
           Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for
           a warning is appended; for example <b>-Werror=switch </b>turns the
           warnings controlled by <b>-Wswitch </b>into errors.  This switch
           takes a negative form, to be used to negate <b>-Werror </b>for
           specific warnings; for example <b>-Wno-error=switch </b>makes
           <b>-Wswitch </b>warnings not be errors, even when <b>-Werror </b>is in
           effect.

           The warning message for each controllable warning includes
           the option that controls the warning.  That option can then
           be used with <b>-Werror= </b>and <b>-Wno-error= </b>as described above.
           (Printing of the option in the warning message can be
           disabled using the <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-option </b>flag.)

           Note that specifying <b>-Werror=</b><i>foo</i> automatically implies <b>-W</b><i>foo</i>.
           However, <b>-Wno-error=</b><i>foo</i> does not imply anything.

       <b>-Wfatal-errors</b>
           This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the
           first error occurred rather than trying to keep going and
           printing further error messages.

       You can request many specific warnings with options beginning
       with <b>-W</b>, for example <b>-Wimplicit </b>to request warnings on implicit
       declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
       negative form beginning <b>-Wno- </b>to turn off warnings; for example,
       <b>-Wno-implicit</b>.  This manual lists only one of the two forms,
       whichever is not the default.  For further language-specific
       options also refer to <b>C++ Dialect Options </b>and <b>Objective-C and</b>
       <b>Objective-C++ Dialect Options</b>.

       Some options, such as <b>-Wall </b>and <b>-Wextra</b>, turn on other options,
       such as <b>-Wunused</b>, which may turn on further options, such as
       <b>-Wunused-value</b>. The combined effect of positive and negative
       forms is that more specific options have priority over less
       specific ones, independently of their position in the command-
       line. For options of the same specificity, the last one takes
       effect. Options enabled or disabled via pragmas take effect as if
       they appeared at the end of the command-line.

       When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
       <b>-Wunknown-warning</b>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating that the
       option is not recognized.  However, if the <b>-Wno- </b>form is used,
       the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is produced for
       <b>-Wno-unknown-warning </b>unless other diagnostics are being produced.
       This allows the use of new <b>-Wno- </b>options with old compilers, but
       if something goes wrong, the compiler warns that an unrecognized
       option is present.

       The effectiveness of some warnings depends on optimizations also
       being enabled. For example <b>-Wsuggest-final-types </b>is more
       effective with link-time optimization and <b>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</b>
       will not warn at all unless optimization is enabled.

       <b>-Wpedantic</b>
       <b>-pedantic</b>
           Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
           reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some
           other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO
           C, follows the version of the ISO C standard specified by any
           <b>-std </b>option used.

           Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with
           or without this option (though a rare few require <b>-ansi </b>or a
           <b>-std </b>option specifying the required version of ISO C).
           However, without this option, certain GNU extensions and
           traditional C and C++ features are supported as well.  With
           this option, they are rejected.

           <b>-Wpedantic </b>does not cause warning messages for use of the
           alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <b>__</b>.
           Pedantic warnings are also disabled in the expression that
           follows "__extension__".  However, only system header files
           should use these escape routes; application programs should
           avoid them.

           Some users try to use <b>-Wpedantic </b>to check programs for strict
           ISO C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite
           what they want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but not
           all---only those for which ISO C <i>requires</i> a diagnostic, and
           some others for which diagnostics have been added.

           A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be
           useful in some instances, but would require considerable
           additional work and would be quite different from <b>-Wpedantic</b>.
           We don't have plans to support such a feature in the near
           future.

           Where the standard specified with <b>-std </b>represents a GNU
           extended dialect of C, such as <b>gnu90 </b>or <b>gnu99</b>, there is a
           corresponding <i>base standard</i>, the version of ISO C on which
           the GNU extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <b>-Wpedantic</b>
           are given where they are required by the base standard.  (It
           does not make sense for such warnings to be given only for
           features not in the specified GNU C dialect, since by
           definition the GNU dialects of C include all features the
           compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
           nothing to warn about.)

       <b>-pedantic-errors</b>
           Give an error whenever the <i>base standard</i> (see <b>-Wpedantic</b>)
           requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined
           behavior at compile-time and in some other cases that do not
           prevent compilation of programs that are valid according to
           the standard. This is not equivalent to <b>-Werror=pedantic</b>,
           since there are errors enabled by this option and not enabled
           by the latter and vice versa.

       <b>-Wall</b>
           This enables all the warnings about constructions that some
           users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or
           modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with
           macros.  This also enables some language-specific warnings
           described in <b>C++ Dialect Options </b>and <b>Objective-C and</b>
           <b>Objective-C++ Dialect Options</b>.

           <b>-Wall </b>turns on the following warning flags:

           <b>-Waddress -Warray-bounds=1 </b>(only with <b>-O2</b>) <b>-Wbool-compare</b>
           <b>-Wbool-operation -Wc++11-compat  -Wc++14-compat -Wcatch-value</b>

           <b>-Wunknown-pragmas -Wunused-function -Wunused-label</b>
           <b>-Wunused-value -Wunused-variable -Wvolatile-register-var</b>

           Note that some warning flags are not implied by <b>-Wall</b>.  Some
           of them warn about constructions that users generally do not
           consider questionable, but which occasionally you might wish
           to check for; others warn about constructions that are
           necessary or hard to avoid in some cases, and there is no
           simple way to modify the code to suppress the warning. Some
           of them are enabled by <b>-Wextra </b>but many of them must be
           enabled individually.

       <b>-Wextra</b>
           This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
           <b>-Wall</b>. (This option used to be called <b>-W</b>.  The older name is
           still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)

           The option <b>-Wextra </b>also prints warning messages for the
           following cases:

           *   A pointer is compared against integer zero with "&lt;",

       <b>-Wchar-subscripts</b>
           Warn if an array subscript has type "char".  This is a common
           cause of error, as programmers often forget that this type is
           signed on some machines.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</b>
           Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
           <b>-fprofile-use </b>option.  If a source file is changed between

           files with the profile feedback can fail to match the source
           file and GCC cannot use the profile feedback information.  By
           default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an error.
           <b>-Wno-coverage-mismatch </b>can be used to disable the warning or
           <b>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch </b>can be used to disable the
           error.  Disabling the error for this warning can result in
           poorly optimized code and is useful only in the case of very
           minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base.
           Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.

       <b>-Wno-cpp</b>
           (C, Objective-C, C++, Objective-C++ and Fortran only)

           Suppress warning messages emitted by "#warning" directives.

       <b>-Wdouble-promotion </b>(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Give a warning when a value of type "float" is implicitly
           promoted to "double".  CPUs with a 32-bit "single-precision"
           floating-point unit implement "float" in hardware, but
           emulate "double" in software.  On such a machine, doing
           computations using "double" values is much more expensive
           because of the overhead required for software emulation.

           It is easy to accidentally do computations with "double"
           because floating-point literals are implicitly of type
           "double".  For example, in:

                   float area(float radius)
                   {
                      return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
                   }

           the compiler performs the entire computation with "double"
           because the floating-point literal is a "double".

       <b>-Wduplicate-decl-specifier </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if a declaration has duplicate "const", "volatile",
           "restrict" or "_Atomic" specifier.  This warning is enabled
           by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wformat</b>
       <b>-Wformat=</b><i>n</i>
           Check calls to "printf" and "scanf", etc., to make sure that
           the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format
           string specified, and that the conversions specified in the
           format string make sense.  This includes standard functions,
           and others specified by format attributes, in the "printf",
           "scanf", "strftime" and "strfmon" (an X/Open extension, not
           in the C standard) families (or other target-specific
           families).  Which functions are checked without format
           attributes having been specified depends on the standard
           version selected, and such checks of functions without the
           attribute specified are disabled by <b>-ffreestanding </b>or
           <b>-fno-builtin</b>.

           The formats are checked against the format features supported
           by GNU libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99
           features, as well as features from the Single Unix
           Specification and some BSD and GNU extensions.  Other library
           implementations may not support all these features; GCC does
           not support warning about features that go beyond a
           particular library's limitations.  However, if <b>-Wpedantic </b>is
           used with <b>-Wformat</b>, warnings are given about format features
           not in the selected standard version (but not for "strfmon"
           formats, since those are not in any version of the C
           standard).

           <b>-Wformat=1</b>
           <b>-Wformat</b>
               Option <b>-Wformat </b>is equivalent to <b>-Wformat=1</b>, and
               <b>-Wno-format </b>is equivalent to <b>-Wformat=0</b>.  Since <b>-Wformat</b>
               also checks for null format arguments for several
               functions, <b>-Wformat </b>also implies <b>-Wnonnull</b>.  Some aspects
               of this level of format checking can be disabled by the
               options: <b>-Wno-format-contains-nul</b>,
               <b>-Wno-format-extra-args</b>, and <b>-Wno-format-zero-length</b>.
               <b>-Wformat </b>is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           <b>-Wno-format-contains-nul</b>
               If <b>-Wformat </b>is specified, do not warn about format
               strings that contain NUL bytes.

           <b>-Wno-format-extra-args</b>
               If <b>-Wformat </b>is specified, do not warn about excess
               arguments to a "printf" or "scanf" format function.  The
               C standard specifies that such arguments are ignored.

               Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments
               that are specified with <b>$ </b>operand number specifications,
               normally warnings are still given, since the
               implementation could not know what type to pass to
               "va_arg" to skip the unused arguments.  However, in the
               case of "scanf" formats, this option suppresses the
               warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since
               the Single Unix Specification says that such unused
               arguments are allowed.

           <b>-Wformat-overflow</b>
           <b>-Wformat-overflow=</b><i>level</i>
               Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such
               as "sprintf" and "vsprintf" that might overflow the
               destination buffer.  When the exact number of bytes
               written by a format directive cannot be determined at
               compile-time it is estimated based on heuristics that
               depend on the <i>level</i> argument and on optimization.  While
               enabling optimization will in most cases improve the
               accuracy of the warning, it may also result in false
               positives.

               <b>-Wformat-overflow</b>
               <b>-Wformat-overflow=1</b>
                   Level <i>1</i> of <b>-Wformat-overflow </b>enabled by <b>-Wformat</b>
                   employs a conservative approach that warns only about
                   calls that most likely overflow the buffer.  At this
                   level, numeric arguments to format directives with
                   unknown values are assumed to have the value of one,
                   and strings of unknown length to be empty.  Numeric
                   arguments that are known to be bounded to a subrange
                   of their type, or string arguments whose output is
                   bounded either by their directive's precision or by a
                   finite set of string literals, are assumed to take on
                   the value within the range that results in the most
                   bytes on output.  For example, the call to "sprintf"
                   below is diagnosed because even with both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
                   equal to zero, the terminating NUL character ('\0')
                   appended by the function to the destination buffer
                   will be written past its end.  Increasing the size of
                   the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid
                   the warning, though it may not be sufficient to avoid
                   the overflow.

                           void f (int a, int b)
                           {
                             char buf [13];
                             sprintf (buf, "a = %i, b = %i\n", a, b);
                           }

               <b>-Wformat-overflow=2</b>
                   Level <i>2</i> warns also about calls that might overflow
                   the destination buffer given an argument of
                   sufficient length or magnitude.  At level <i>2</i>, unknown
                   numeric arguments are assumed to have the minimum
                   representable value for signed types with a precision
                   greater than 1, and the maximum representable value
                   otherwise.  Unknown string arguments whose length
                   cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the
                   directive's precision, or by a finite set of string
                   literals they may evaluate to, or the character array
                   they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character
                   long.

                   At level <i>2</i>, the call in the example above is again
                   diagnosed, but this time because with <i>a</i> equal to a
                   32-bit "INT_MIN" the first %i directive will write
                   some of its digits beyond the end of the destination
                   buffer.  To make the call safe regardless of the
                   values of the two variables, the size of the
                   destination buffer must be increased to at least 34
                   bytes.  GCC includes the minimum size of the buffer
                   in an informational note following the warning.

                   An alternative to increasing the size of the
                   destination buffer is to constrain the range of
                   formatted values.  The maximum length of string
                   arguments can be bounded by specifying the precision
                   in the format directive.  When numeric arguments of
                   format directives can be assumed to be bounded by
                   less than the precision of their type, choosing an
                   appropriate length modifier to the format specifier
                   will reduce the required buffer size.  For example,
                   if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in the example above can be assumed to be
                   within the precision of the "short int" type then
                   using either the %hi format directive or casting the
                   argument to "short" reduces the maximum required size
                   of the buffer to 24 bytes.

                           void f (int a, int b)
                           {
                             char buf [23];
                             sprintf (buf, "a = %hi, b = %i\n", a, (short)b);
                           }

           <b>-Wno-format-zero-length</b>
               If <b>-Wformat </b>is specified, do not warn about zero-length
               formats.  The C standard specifies that zero-length
               formats are allowed.

           <b>-Wformat=2</b>
               Enable <b>-Wformat </b>plus additional format checks.  Currently
               equivalent to <b>-Wformat -Wformat-nonliteral</b>
               <b>-Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k</b>.

           <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b>
               If <b>-Wformat </b>is specified, also warn if the format string
               is not a string literal and so cannot be checked, unless
               the format function takes its format arguments as a
               "va_list".

           <b>-Wformat-security</b>
               If <b>-Wformat </b>is specified, also warn about uses of format
               functions that represent possible security problems.  At
               present, this warns about calls to "printf" and "scanf"
               functions where the format string is not a string literal
               and there are no format arguments, as in "printf (foo);".
               This may be a security hole if the format string came
               from untrusted input and contains <b>%n</b>.  (This is currently
               a subset of what <b>-Wformat-nonliteral </b>warns about, but in
               future warnings may be added to <b>-Wformat-security </b>that
               are not included in <b>-Wformat-nonliteral</b>.)

           <b>-Wformat-signedness</b>
               If <b>-Wformat </b>is specified, also warn if the format string
               requires an unsigned argument and the argument is signed
               and vice versa.

           <b>-Wformat-truncation</b>
           <b>-Wformat-truncation=</b><i>level</i>
               Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such
               as "snprintf" and "vsnprintf" that might result in output
               truncation.  When the exact number of bytes written by a
               format directive cannot be determined at compile-time it
               is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the <i>level</i>
               argument and on optimization.  While enabling
               optimization will in most cases improve the accuracy of
               the warning, it may also result in false positives.
               Except as noted otherwise, the option uses the same logic
               <b>-Wformat-overflow</b>.

               <b>-Wformat-truncation</b>
               <b>-Wformat-truncation=1</b>
                   Level <i>1</i> of <b>-Wformat-truncation </b>enabled by <b>-Wformat</b>
                   employs a conservative approach that warns only about
                   calls to bounded functions whose return value is
                   unused and that will most likely result in output
                   truncation.

               <b>-Wformat-truncation=2</b>
                   Level <i>2</i> warns also about calls to bounded functions
                   whose return value is used and that might result in
                   truncation given an argument of sufficient length or

           <b>-Wformat-y2k</b>
               If <b>-Wformat </b>is specified, also warn about "strftime"
               formats that may yield only a two-digit year.

       <b>-Wnonnull</b>
           Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
           requiring a non-null value by the "nonnull" function
           attribute.

           <b>-Wnonnull </b>is included in <b>-Wall </b>and <b>-Wformat</b>.  It can be
           disabled with the <b>-Wno-nonnull </b>option.

       <b>-Wnonnull-compare</b>
           Warn when comparing an argument marked with the "nonnull"
           function attribute against null inside the function.

           <b>-Wnonnull-compare </b>is included in <b>-Wall</b>.  It can be disabled
           with the <b>-Wno-nonnull-compare </b>option.

       <b>-Wnull-dereference</b>
           Warn if the compiler detects paths that trigger erroneous or
           undefined behavior due to dereferencing a null pointer.  This
           option is only active when <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks </b>is
           active, which is enabled by optimizations in most targets.
           The precision of the warnings depends on the optimization
           options used.

       <b>-Winit-self </b>(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about uninitialized variables that are initialized with
           themselves.  Note this option can only be used with the
           <b>-Wuninitialized </b>option.

           For example, GCC warns about "i" being uninitialized in the
           following snippet only when <b>-Winit-self </b>has been specified:

                   int f()
                   {
                     int i = i;
                     return i;
                   }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall </b>in C++.

       <b>-Wimplicit-int </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.  This
           warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wimplicit-function-declaration </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Give a warning whenever a function is used before being
           declared. In C99 mode (<b>-std=c99 </b>or <b>-std=gnu99</b>), this warning
           is enabled by default and it is made into an error by
           <b>-pedantic-errors</b>. This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wimplicit </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Same as <b>-Wimplicit-int </b>and <b>-Wimplicit-function-declaration</b>.
           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough</b>
           <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough </b>is the same as
           <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 </b>and <b>-Wno-implicit-fallthrough </b>is the
           same as <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0</b>.

       <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=</b><i>n</i>
           Warn when a switch case falls through.  For example:

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                     case 1:
                       a = 1;
                       break;
                     case 2:
                       a = 2;
                     case 3:
                       a = 3;
                       break;
                     }

           This warning does not warn when the last statement of a case
           cannot fall through, e.g. when there is a return statement or
           a call to function declared with the noreturn attribute.
           <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough= </b>also takes into account control flow
           statements, such as ifs, and only warns when appropriate.
           E.g.

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                     case 1:
                       if (i &gt; 3) {
                         bar (5);
                         break;
                       } else if (i &lt; 1) {
                         bar (0);
                       } else
                         return;
                     default:
                       ...
                     }

           Since there are occasions where a switch case fall through is
           desirable, GCC provides an attribute, "__attribute__
           ((fallthrough))", that is to be used along with a null
           statement to suppress this warning that would normally occur:

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                     case 1:
                       bar (0);
                       __attribute__ ((fallthrough));
                     default:
                       ...
                     }

           C++17 provides a standard way to suppress the
           <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough </b>warning using "[[fallthrough]];"
           instead of the GNU attribute.  In C++11 or C++14 users can
           use "[[gnu::fallthrough]];", which is a GNU extension.
           Instead of these attributes, it is also possible to add a
           fallthrough comment to silence the warning.  The whole body
           of the C or C++ style comment should match the given regular
           expressions listed below.  The option argument <i>n</i> specifies
           what kind of comments are accepted:

           *&lt;<b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0 </b>disables the warning altogether.&gt;
           *&lt;<b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=1 </b>matches ".*" regular&gt;
               expression, any comment is used as fallthrough comment.

           *&lt;<b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=2 </b>case insensitively matches&gt;
               ".*falls?[ \t-]*thr(ough|u).*" regular expression.

           *&lt;<b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 </b>case sensitively matches one of

               following regular expressions:

           *&lt;<b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5 </b>doesn't recognize any comments as&gt;
               fallthrough comments, only attributes disable the
               warning.

           The comment needs to be followed after optional whitespace
           and other comments by "case" or "default" keywords or by a
           user label that precedes some "case" or "default" label.

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                     case 1:

                       /* FALLTHRU */
                     default:
                       ...
                     }

           The <b>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 </b>warning is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wif-not-aligned </b>(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Control if warning triggered by the "warn_if_not_aligned"
           attribute should be issued.  This is enabled by default.  Use
           <b>-Wno-if-not-aligned </b>to disable it.

       <b>-Wignored-qualifiers </b>(C and C++ only)
           Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
           such as "const".  For ISO C such a type qualifier has no
           effect, since the value returned by a function is not an
           lvalue.  For C++, the warning is only emitted for scalar
           types or "void".  ISO C prohibits qualified "void" return
           types on function definitions, so such return types always
           receive a warning even without this option.

           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wignored-attributes </b>(C and C++ only)
           Warn when an attribute is ignored.  This is different from
           the <b>-Wattributes </b>option in that it warns whenever the
           compiler decides to drop an attribute, not that the attribute
           is either unknown, used in a wrong place, etc.  This warning
           is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wmain</b>
           Warn if the type of "main" is suspicious.  "main" should be a
           function with external linkage, returning int, taking either
           zero arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.
           This warning is enabled by default in C++ and is enabled by
           either <b>-Wall </b>or <b>-Wpedantic</b>.

       <b>-Wmisleading-indentation </b>(C and C++ only)
           Warn when the indentation of the code does not reflect the
           block structure.  Specifically, a warning is issued for "if",
           "else", "while", and "for" clauses with a guarded statement
           that does not use braces, followed by an unguarded statement
           with the same indentation.

           In the following example, the call to "bar" is misleadingly
           indented as if it were guarded by the "if" conditional.

                     if (some_condition ())
                       foo ();
                       bar ();  /* Gotcha: this is not guarded by the "if".  */

           In the case of mixed tabs and spaces, the warning uses the
           <b>-ftabstop= </b>option to determine if the statements line up
           (defaulting to 8).

           The warning is not issued for code involving multiline
           preprocessor logic such as the following example.

                     if (flagA)
                       foo (0);
                   #if SOME_CONDITION_THAT_DOES_NOT_HOLD
                     if (flagB)
                   #endif
                       foo (1);

           The warning is not issued after a "#line" directive, since
           this typically indicates autogenerated code, and no
           assumptions can be made about the layout of the file that the
           directive references.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall </b>in C and C++.

       <b>-Wmissing-attributes</b>
           Warn when a declaration of a function is missing one or more
           attributes that a related function is declared with and whose
           absence may adversely affect the correctness or efficiency of
           generated code.  For example, the warning is issued for
           declarations of aliases that use attributes to specify less
           restrictive requirements than those of their targets.  This
           typically represents a potential optimization opportunity.
           By contrast, the <b>-Wattribute-alias=2 </b>option controls warnings
           issued when the alias is more restrictive than the target,
           which could lead to incorrect code generation.  Attributes
           considered include "alloc_align", "alloc_size", "cold",
           "const", "hot", "leaf", "malloc", "nonnull", "noreturn",
           "nothrow", "pure", "returns_nonnull", and "returns_twice".

           In C++, the warning is issued when an explicit specialization
           of a primary template declared with attribute "alloc_align",
           "alloc_size", "assume_aligned", "format", "format_arg",
           "malloc", or "nonnull" is declared without it.  Attributes
           "deprecated", "error", and "warning" suppress the warning..

           You can use the "copy" attribute to apply the same set of
           attributes to a declaration as that on another declaration
           without explicitly enumerating the attributes. This attribute
           can be applied to declarations of functions, variables, or
           types.

           <b>-Wmissing-attributes </b>is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           For example, since the declaration of the primary function
           template below makes use of both attribute "malloc" and
           "alloc_size" the declaration of the explicit specialization
           of the template is diagnosed because it is missing one of the
           attributes.

                   template &lt;class T&gt;
                   T* __attribute__ ((malloc, alloc_size (1)))
                   allocate (size_t);

                   template &lt;&gt;
                   void* __attribute__ ((malloc))   // missing alloc_size
                   allocate&lt;void&gt; (size_t);

       <b>-Wmissing-braces</b>
           Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully
           bracketed.  In the following example, the initializer for "a"
           is not fully bracketed, but that for "b" is fully bracketed.
           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall </b>in C.

                   int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
                   int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wmissing-include-dirs </b>(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++
       only)
           Warn if a user-supplied include directory does not exist.

       <b>-Wmissing-profile</b>
           Warn if feedback profiles are missing when using the
           <b>-fprofile-use </b>option.  This option diagnoses those cases
           where a new function or a new file is added to the user code
           between compiling with <b>-fprofile-generate </b>and with
           <b>-fprofile-use</b>, without regenerating the profiles.  In these
           cases, the profile feedback data files do not contain any
           profile feedback information for the newly added function or
           file respectively.  Also, in the case when profile count data
           (.gcda) files are removed, GCC cannot use any profile
           feedback information.  In all these cases, warnings are
           issued to inform the user that a profile generation step is
           due.  <b>-Wno-missing-profile </b>can be used to disable the
           warning.  Ignoring the warning can result in poorly optimized
           code.  Completely disabling the warning is not recommended
           and should be done only when non-existent profile data is
           justified.

       <b>-Wmultistatement-macros</b>
           Warn about unsafe multiple statement macros that appear to be
           guarded by a clause such as "if", "else", "for", "switch", or
           "while", in which only the first statement is actually
           guarded after the macro is expanded.

           For example:

                   #define DOIT x++; y++
                   if (c)
                     DOIT;

           will increment "y" unconditionally, not just when "c" holds.
           The can usually be fixed by wrapping the macro in a do-while
           loop:

                   #define DOIT do { x++; y++; } while (0)
                   if (c)
                     DOIT;

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall </b>in C and C++.

       <b>-Wparentheses</b>
           Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as
           when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
           is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence
           people often get confused about.

           Also warn if a comparison like "x&lt;=y&lt;=z" appears; this is
           equivalent to "(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z", which is a different
           interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

           Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to "?:"
           with omitted middle operand. When the condition in the "?":
           operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is always
           1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed inside
           the conditional expression instead.

           For C++ this also warns for some cases of unnecessary
           parentheses in declarations, which can indicate an attempt at
           a function call instead of a declaration:

                   {
                     // Declares a local variable called mymutex.
                     std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; (mymutex);
                     // User meant std::unique_lock&lt;std::mutex&gt; lock (mymutex);
                   }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wsequence-point</b>
           Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of
           violations of sequence point rules in the C and C++
           standards.

           The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions
           in a C/C++ program are evaluated in terms of <i>sequence points</i>,
           which represent a partial ordering between the execution of
           parts of the program: those executed before the sequence
           point, and those executed after it.  These occur after the
           evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a
           larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand
           of a "&amp;&amp;", "||", "? :" or "," (comma) operator, before a
           function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments
           and the expression denoting the called function), and in
           certain other places.  Other than as expressed by the
           sequence point rules, the order of evaluation of
           subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All these
           rules describe only a partial order rather than a total
           order, since, for example, if two functions are called within
           one expression with no sequence point between them, the order
           in which the functions are called is not specified.  However,
           the standards committee have ruled that function calls do not
           overlap.

           It is not specified when between sequence points
           modifications to the values of objects take effect.  Programs
           whose behavior depends on this have undefined behavior; the C
           and C++ standards specify that "Between the previous and next
           sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified
           at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
           Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine
           the value to be stored.".  If a program breaks these rules,
           the results on any particular implementation are entirely
           unpredictable.

           Examples of code with undefined behavior are "a = a++;",
           "a[n] = b[n++]" and "a[i++] = i;".  Some more complicated
           cases are not diagnosed by this option, and it may give an
           occasional false positive result, but in general it has been
           found fairly effective at detecting this sort of problem in
           programs.

           The C++17 standard will define the order of evaluation of
           operands in more cases: in particular it requires that the
           right-hand side of an assignment be evaluated before the
           left-hand side, so the above examples are no longer
           undefined.  But this warning will still warn about them, to
           help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C and
           earlier revisions of C++.

           The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some
           debate over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules
           in subtle cases.  Links to discussions of the problem,
           including proposed formal definitions, may be found on the
           GCC readings page, at &lt;<b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a> </b>&gt;.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall </b>for C and C++.

       <b>-Wno-return-local-addr</b>
           Do not warn about returning a pointer (or in C++, a
           reference) to a variable that goes out of scope after the
           function returns.

       <b>-Wreturn-type</b>
           Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that
           defaults to "int".  Also warn about any "return" statement
           with no return value in a function whose return type is not
           "void" (falling off the end of the function body is
           considered returning without a value).

           For C only, warn about a "return" statement with an
           expression in a function whose return type is "void", unless
           the expression type is also "void".  As a GNU extension, the
           latter case is accepted without a warning unless <b>-Wpedantic</b>
           is used.  Attempting to use the return value of a non-"void"
           function other than "main" that flows off the end by reaching
           the closing curly brace that terminates the function is
           undefined.

           Unlike in C, in C++, flowing off the end of a non-"void"
           function other than "main" results in undefined behavior even
           when the value of the function is not used.

           This warning is enabled by default in C++ and by <b>-Wall</b>
           otherwise.

       <b>-Wshift-count-negative</b>
           Warn if shift count is negative. This warning is enabled by
           default.

       <b>-Wshift-count-overflow</b>
           Warn if shift count &gt;= width of type. This warning is enabled
           by default.

       <b>-Wshift-negative-value</b>
           Warn if left shifting a negative value.  This warning is
           enabled by <b>-Wextra </b>in C99 (and newer) and C++11 to C++17
           modes.

       <b>-Wshift-overflow</b>
       <b>-Wshift-overflow=</b><i>n</i>
           Warn about left shift overflows.  This warning is enabled by
           default in C99 and C++11 modes (and newer).

           <b>-Wshift-overflow=1</b>
               This is the warning level of <b>-Wshift-overflow </b>and is
               enabled by default in C99 and C++11 modes (and newer).
               This warning level does not warn about left-shifting 1
               into the sign bit.  (However, in C, such an overflow is
               still rejected in contexts where an integer constant
               expression is required.)  No warning is emitted in C++2A
               mode (and newer), as signed left shifts always wrap.

           <b>-Wshift-overflow=2</b>
               This warning level also warns about left-shifting 1 into
               the sign bit, unless C++14 mode (or newer) is active.

       <b>-Wswitch</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement has an index of enumerated
           type and lacks a "case" for one or more of the named codes of
           that enumeration.  (The presence of a "default" label
           prevents this warning.)  "case" labels outside the
           enumeration range also provoke warnings when this option is
           used (even if there is a "default" label).  This warning is
           enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wswitch-default</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement does not have a "default"
           case.

       <b>-Wswitch-enum</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement has an index of enumerated
           type and lacks a "case" for one or more of the named codes of
           that enumeration.  "case" labels outside the enumeration
           range also provoke warnings when this option is used.  The
           only difference between <b>-Wswitch </b>and this option is that this
           option gives a warning about an omitted enumeration code even
           if there is a "default" label.

       <b>-Wswitch-bool</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement has an index of boolean
           type and the case values are outside the range of a boolean
           type.  It is possible to suppress this warning by casting the
           controlling expression to a type other than "bool".  For
           example:

                   switch ((int) (a == 4))
                     {
                     ...
                     }

           This warning is enabled by default for C and C++ programs.

       <b>-Wswitch-unreachable</b>
           Warn whenever a "switch" statement contains statements
           between the controlling expression and the first case label,
           which will never be executed.  For example:

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                      i = 15;
                     ...
                      case 5:
                     ...
                     }

           <b>-Wswitch-unreachable </b>does not warn if the statement between
           the controlling expression and the first case label is just a
           declaration:

                   switch (cond)
                     {
                      int i;
                     ...
                      case 5:
                      i = 5;
                     ...
                     }

           This warning is enabled by default for C and C++ programs.

       <b>-Wsync-nand </b>(C and C++ only)
           Warn when "__sync_fetch_and_nand" and "__sync_nand_and_fetch"
           built-in functions are used.  These functions changed
           semantics in GCC 4.4.

       <b>-Wunused-but-set-parameter</b>
           Warn whenever a function parameter is assigned to, but
           otherwise unused (aside from its declaration).

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wunused </b>together with
           <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-but-set-variable</b>
           Warn whenever a local variable is assigned to, but otherwise
           unused (aside from its declaration).  This warning is enabled
           by <b>-Wall</b>.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wunused</b>, which is enabled by
           <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-function</b>
           Warn whenever a static function is declared but not defined
           or a non-inline static function is unused.  This warning is
           enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-label</b>
           Warn whenever a label is declared but not used.  This warning
           is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

       <b>-Wunused-local-typedefs </b>(C, Objective-C, C++ and Objective-C++
       only)
           Warn when a typedef locally defined in a function is not
           used.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-parameter</b>
           Warn whenever a function parameter is unused aside from its
           declaration.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

       <b>-Wno-unused-result</b>
           Do not warn if a caller of a function marked with attribute
           "warn_unused_result" does not use its return value. The
           default is <b>-Wunused-result</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-variable</b>
           Warn whenever a local or static variable is unused aside from
           its declaration. This option implies
           <b>-Wunused-const-variable=1 </b>for C, but not for C++. This
           warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

       <b>-Wunused-const-variable</b>
       <b>-Wunused-const-variable=</b><i>n</i>
           Warn whenever a constant static variable is unused aside from
           its declaration.  <b>-Wunused-const-variable=1 </b>is enabled by
           <b>-Wunused-variable </b>for C, but not for C++. In C this declares
           variable storage, but in C++ this is not an error since const
           variables take the place of "#define"s.

           To suppress this warning use the "unused" attribute.

           <b>-Wunused-const-variable=1</b>
               This is the warning level that is enabled by
               <b>-Wunused-variable </b>for C.  It warns only about unused
               static const variables defined in the main compilation
               unit, but not about static const variables declared in
               any header included.

           <b>-Wunused-const-variable=2</b>
               This warning level also warns for unused constant static
               variables in headers (excluding system headers).  This is
               the warning level of <b>-Wunused-const-variable </b>and must be
               explicitly requested since in C++ this isn't an error and
               in C it might be harder to clean up all headers included.

       <b>-Wunused-value</b>
           Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is
           explicitly not used. To suppress this warning cast the unused
           expression to "void". This includes an expression-statement
           or the left-hand side of a comma expression that contains no
           side effects. For example, an expression such as "x[i,j]"
           causes a warning, while "x[(void)i,j]" does not.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wunused</b>
           All the above <b>-Wunused </b>options combined.

           In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter,
           you must either specify <b>-Wextra -Wunused </b>(note that <b>-Wall</b>
           implies <b>-Wunused</b>), or separately specify <b>-Wunused-parameter</b>.

       <b>-Wuninitialized</b>
           Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being
           initialized or if a variable may be clobbered by a "setjmp"
           call. In C++, warn if a non-static reference or non-static
           "const" member appears in a class without constructors.

           If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized
           value of the variable in its own initializer, use the
           <b>-Winit-self </b>option.

           These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or
           clobbered elements of structure, union or array variables as
           well as for variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as
           a whole.  They do not occur for variables or elements
           declared "volatile".  Because these warnings depend on
           optimization, the exact variables or elements for which there
           are warnings depends on the precise optimization options and
           version of GCC used.

           Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is
           used only to compute a value that itself is never used,
           because such computations may be deleted by data flow
           analysis before the warnings are printed.

       <b>-Winvalid-memory-model</b>
           Warn for invocations of <b>__atomic Builtins</b>, <b>__sync Builtins</b>,
           and the C11 atomic generic functions with a memory
           consistency argument that is either invalid for the operation
           or outside the range of values of the "memory_order"
           enumeration.  For example, since the "__atomic_store" and
           "__atomic_store_n" built-ins are only defined for the
           relaxed, release, and sequentially consistent memory orders
           the following code is diagnosed:

                   void store (int *i)
                   {
                     __atomic_store_n (i, 0, memory_order_consume);
                   }

           <b>-Winvalid-memory-model </b>is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</b>
           For an automatic (i.e. local) variable, if there exists a
           path from the function entry to a use of the variable that is
           initialized, but there exist some other paths for which the
           variable is not initialized, the compiler emits a warning if
           it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not executed at
           run time.

           These warnings are only possible in optimizing compilation,
           because otherwise GCC does not keep track of the state of
           variables.

           These warnings are made optional because GCC may not be able
           to determine when the code is correct in spite of appearing
           to have an error.  Here is one example of how this can
           happen:

                   {
                     int x;
                     switch (y)
                       {
                       case 1: x = 1;
                         break;
                       case 2: x = 4;
                         break;
                       case 3: x = 5;
                       }
                     foo (x);
                   }

           If the value of "y" is always 1, 2 or 3, then "x" is always
           initialized, but GCC doesn't know this. To suppress the
           warning, you need to provide a default case with <i>assert</i>(0) or
           similar code.

           This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable
           might be changed by a call to "longjmp".  The compiler sees
           only the calls to "setjmp".  It cannot know where "longjmp"
           will be called; in fact, a signal handler could call it at
           any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
           even when there is in fact no problem because "longjmp"
           cannot in fact be called at the place that would cause a
           problem.

           Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the
           functions you use that never return as "noreturn".

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall </b>or <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b>
           Warn when a "#pragma" directive is encountered that is not
           understood by GCC.  If this command-line option is used,
           warnings are even issued for unknown pragmas in system header
           files.  This is not the case if the warnings are only enabled
           by the <b>-Wall </b>command-line option.

       <b>-Wno-pragmas</b>
           Do not warn about misuses of pragmas, such as incorrect
           parameters, invalid syntax, or conflicts between pragmas.
           See also <b>-Wunknown-pragmas</b>.

       <b>-Wno-prio-ctor-dtor</b>
           Do not warn if a priority from 0 to 100 is used for
           constructor or destructor.  The use of constructor and
           destructor attributes allow you to assign a priority to the
           constructor/destructor to control its order of execution
           before "main" is called or after it returns.  The priority
           values must be greater than 100 as the compiler reserves
           priority values between 0--100 for the implementation.

       <b>-Wstrict-aliasing</b>
           This option is only active when <b>-fstrict-aliasing </b>is active.
           It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing
           rules that the compiler is using for optimization.  The
           warning does not catch all cases, but does attempt to catch
           the more common pitfalls.  It is included in <b>-Wall</b>.  It is
           equivalent to <b>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</b>

       <b>-Wstrict-aliasing=n</b>
           This option is only active when <b>-fstrict-aliasing </b>is active.
           It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing
           rules that the compiler is using for optimization.  Higher
           levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
           Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the
           way <b>-O </b>works.  <b>-Wstrict-aliasing </b>is equivalent to
           <b>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</b>.

           Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.  Possibly
           useful when higher levels do not warn but <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>
           still breaks the code, as it has very few false negatives.
           However, it has many false positives.  Warns for all pointer
           conversions between possibly incompatible types, even if
           never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.

           Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.  May still have
           many false positives (not as many as level 1 though), and few
           false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).  Unlike
           level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
           incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.

           Level 3 (default for <b>-Wstrict-aliasing</b>): Should have very few
           false positives and few false negatives.  Slightly slower
           than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.  Takes care
           of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
           "*(int*)&amp;some_float".  If optimization is enabled, it also
           runs in the back end, where it deals with multiple statement
           cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.  Only warns
           when the converted pointer is dereferenced.  Does not warn
           about incomplete types.

       <b>-Wstrict-overflow</b>
       <b>-Wstrict-overflow=</b><i>n</i>
           This option is only active when signed overflow is undefined.
           It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on
           the assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note
           that it does not warn about all cases where the code might
           overflow: it only warns about cases where the compiler
           implements some optimization.  Thus this warning depends on
           the optimization level.

           An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not
           occur is perfectly safe if the values of the variables
           involved are such that overflow never does, in fact, occur.
           Therefore this warning can easily give a false positive: a
           warning about code that is not actually a problem.  To help
           focus on important issues, several warning levels are
           defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of undefined
           signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
           requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will
           be executed at all.

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=1</b>
               Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to
               avoid.  For example the compiler simplifies "x + 1 &gt; x"
               to 1.  This level of <b>-Wstrict-overflow </b>is enabled by
               <b>-Wall</b>; higher levels are not, and must be explicitly
               requested.

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=2</b>
               Also warn about other cases where a comparison is
               simplified to a constant.  For example: "abs (x) &gt;= 0".
               This can only be simplified when signed integer overflow
               is undefined, because "abs (INT_MIN)" overflows to
               "INT_MIN", which is less than zero.  <b>-Wstrict-overflow</b>
               (with no level) is the same as <b>-Wstrict-overflow=2</b>.

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=3</b>
               Also warn about other cases where a comparison is
               simplified.  For example: "x + 1 &gt; 1" is simplified to "x
               &gt; 0".

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=4</b>
               Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the
               above cases.  For example: "(x * 10) / 5" is simplified
               to "x * 2".

           <b>-Wstrict-overflow=5</b>
               Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the
               magnitude of a constant involved in a comparison.  For
               example: "x + 2 &gt; y" is simplified to "x + 1 &gt;= y".  This
               is reported only at the highest warning level because
               this simplification applies to many comparisons, so this
               warning level gives a very large number of false
               positives.

       <b>-Wstringop-overflow</b>
       <b>-Wstringop-overflow=</b><i>type</i>
           Warn for calls to string manipulation functions such as
           "memcpy" and "strcpy" that are determined to overflow the
           destination buffer.  The optional argument is one greater
           than the type of Object Size Checking to perform to determine
           the size of the destination.  The argument is meaningful only
           for functions that operate on character arrays but not for
           raw memory functions like "memcpy" which always make use of
           Object Size type-0.  The option also warns for calls that
           specify a size in excess of the largest possible object or at
           most "SIZE_MAX / 2" bytes.  The option produces the best
           results with optimization enabled but can detect a small
           subset of simple buffer overflows even without optimization
           in calls to the GCC built-in functions like
           "__builtin_memcpy" that correspond to the standard functions.
           In any case, the option warns about just a subset of buffer
           overflows detected by the corresponding overflow checking
           built-ins.  For example, the option will issue a warning for
           the "strcpy" call below because it copies at least 5
           characters (the string "blue" including the terminating NUL)
           into the buffer of size 4.

                   enum Color { blue, purple, yellow };
                   const char* f (enum Color clr)
                   {
                     static char buf [4];
                     const char *str;
                     switch (clr)
                       {
                         case blue: str = "blue"; break;
                         case purple: str = "purple"; break;
                         case yellow: str = "yellow"; break;
                       }

                     return strcpy (buf, str);   // warning here
                   }

           Option <b>-Wstringop-overflow=2 </b>is enabled by default.

           <b>-Wstringop-overflow</b>
           <b>-Wstringop-overflow=1</b>
               The <b>-Wstringop-overflow=1 </b>option uses type-zero Object
               Size Checking to determine the sizes of destination
               objects.  This is the default setting of the option.  At
               this setting the option will not warn for writes past the
               end of subobjects of larger objects accessed by pointers
               unless the size of the largest surrounding object is
               known.  When the destination may be one of several
               objects it is assumed to be the largest one of them.  On
               Linux systems, when optimization is enabled at this
               setting the option warns for the same code as when the
               "_FORTIFY_SOURCE" macro is defined to a non-zero value.

           <b>-Wstringop-overflow=2</b>
               The <b>-Wstringop-overflow=2 </b>option uses type-one Object
               Size Checking to determine the sizes of destination
               objects.  At this setting the option will warn about
               overflows when writing to members of the largest complete
               objects whose exact size is known.  It will, however, not
               warn for excessive writes to the same members of unknown
               objects referenced by pointers since they may point to
               arrays containing unknown numbers of elements.

           <b>-Wstringop-overflow=3</b>
               The <b>-Wstringop-overflow=3 </b>option uses type-two Object
               Size Checking to determine the sizes of destination
               objects.  At this setting the option warns about
               overflowing the smallest object or data member.  This is
               the most restrictive setting of the option that may
               result in warnings for safe code.

           <b>-Wstringop-overflow=4</b>
               The <b>-Wstringop-overflow=4 </b>option uses type-three Object
               Size Checking to determine the sizes of destination
               objects.  At this setting the option will warn about
               overflowing any data members, and when the destination is
               one of several objects it uses the size of the largest of
               them to decide whether to issue a warning.  Similarly to
               <b>-Wstringop-overflow=3 </b>this setting of the option may
               result in warnings for benign code.

       <b>-Wstringop-truncation</b>
           Warn for calls to bounded string manipulation functions such
           as "strncat", "strncpy", and "stpncpy" that may either
           truncate the copied string or leave the destination
           unchanged.

           In the following example, the call to "strncat" specifies a
           bound that is less than the length of the source string.  As
           a result, the copy of the source will be truncated and so the
           call is diagnosed.  To avoid the warning use "bufsize -
           strlen (buf) - 1)" as the bound.

                   void append (char *buf, size_t bufsize)
                   {
                     strncat (buf, ".txt", 3);
                   }

           As another example, the following call to "strncpy" results
           in copying to "d" just the characters preceding the
           terminating NUL, without appending the NUL to the end.
           Assuming the result of "strncpy" is necessarily a NUL-
           terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call is
           diagnosed.  To avoid the warning when the result is not
           expected to be NUL-terminated, call "memcpy" instead.

                   void copy (char *d, const char *s)
                   {
                     strncpy (d, s, strlen (s));
                   }

           In the following example, the call to "strncpy" specifies the
           size of the destination buffer as the bound.  If the length
           of the source string is equal to or greater than this size
           the result of the copy will not be NUL-terminated.
           Therefore, the call is also diagnosed.  To avoid the warning,
           specify "sizeof buf - 1" as the bound and set the last
           element of the buffer to "NUL".

                   void copy (const char *s)
                   {
                     char buf[80];
                     strncpy (buf, s, sizeof buf);
                     ...
                   }

           In situations where a character array is intended to store a
           sequence of bytes with no terminating "NUL" such an array may
           be annotated with attribute "nonstring" to avoid this
           warning.  Such arrays, however, are not suitable arguments to
           functions that expect "NUL"-terminated strings.  To help
           detect accidental misuses of such arrays GCC issues warnings
           unless it can prove that the use is safe.

       <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=</b>[<b>pure</b>|<b>const</b>|<b>noreturn</b>|<b>format</b>|<b>cold</b>|<b>malloc</b>]
           Warn for cases where adding an attribute may be beneficial.
           The attributes currently supported are listed below.

           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=pure</b>
           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=const</b>
           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn</b>
           <b>-Wmissing-noreturn</b>
           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=malloc</b>
               Warn about functions that might be candidates for
               attributes "pure", "const" or "noreturn" or "malloc". The
               compiler only warns for functions visible in other
               compilation units or (in the case of "pure" and "const")
               if it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A
               function returns normally if it doesn't contain an
               infinite loop or return abnormally by throwing, calling
               "abort" or trapping.  This analysis requires option
               <b>-fipa-pure-const</b>, which is enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and
               higher.  Higher optimization levels improve the accuracy
               of the analysis.

           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=format</b>
           <b>-Wmissing-format-attribute</b>
               Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for
               "format" attributes.  Note these are only possible
               candidates, not absolute ones.  GCC guesses that function
               pointers with "format" attributes that are used in
               assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
               statements should have a corresponding "format" attribute
               in the resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the
               assignment or initialization, the type of the parameter
               variable, or the return type of the containing function
               respectively should also have a "format" attribute to
               avoid the warning.

               GCC also warns about function definitions that might be
               candidates for "format" attributes.  Again, these are
               only possible candidates.  GCC guesses that "format"
               attributes might be appropriate for any function that
               calls a function like "vprintf" or "vscanf", but this
               might not always be the case, and some functions for
               which "format" attributes are appropriate may not be
               detected.

           <b>-Wsuggest-attribute=cold</b>
               Warn about functions that might be candidates for "cold"
               attribute.  This is based on static detection and
               generally will only warn about functions which always
               leads to a call to another "cold" function such as
               wrappers of C++ "throw" or fatal error reporting
               functions leading to "abort".

       <b>-Wsuggest-final-types</b>
           Warn about types with virtual methods where code quality
           would be improved if the type were declared with the C++11
           "final" specifier, or, if possible, declared in an anonymous
           namespace. This allows GCC to more aggressively devirtualize
           the polymorphic calls. This warning is more effective with
           link time optimization, where the information about the class
           hierarchy graph is more complete.

       <b>-Wsuggest-final-methods</b>
           Warn about virtual methods where code quality would be
           improved if the method were declared with the C++11 "final"
           specifier, or, if possible, its type were declared in an
           anonymous namespace or with the "final" specifier.  This
           warning is more effective with link-time optimization, where
           the information about the class hierarchy graph is more
           complete. It is recommended to first consider suggestions of
           <b>-Wsuggest-final-types </b>and then rebuild with new annotations.

       <b>-Wsuggest-override</b>
           Warn about overriding virtual functions that are not marked
           with the override keyword.

       <b>-Walloc-zero</b>
           Warn about calls to allocation functions decorated with
           attribute "alloc_size" that specify zero bytes, including
           those to the built-in forms of the functions "aligned_alloc",
           "alloca", "calloc", "malloc", and "realloc".  Because the
           behavior of these functions when called with a zero size
           differs among implementations (and in the case of "realloc"
           has been deprecated) relying on it may result in subtle
           portability bugs and should be avoided.

       <b>-Walloc-size-larger-than=</b><i>byte-size</i>
           Warn about calls to functions decorated with attribute
           "alloc_size" that attempt to allocate objects larger than the
           specified number of bytes, or where the result of the size
           computation in an integer type with infinite precision would
           exceed the value of <b>PTRDIFF_MAX </b>on the target.
           <b>-Walloc-size-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX </b>is enabled by default.
           Warnings controlled by the option can be disabled either by
           specifying <i>byte-size</i> of <b>SIZE_MAX </b>or more or by
           <b>-Wno-alloc-size-larger-than</b>.

       <b>-Wno-alloc-size-larger-than</b>
           Disable <b>-Walloc-size-larger-than= </b>warnings.  The option is
           equivalent to <b>-Walloc-size-larger-than=SIZE_MAX </b>or larger.

       <b>-Walloca</b>
           This option warns on all uses of "alloca" in the source.

       <b>-Walloca-larger-than=</b><i>byte-size</i>
           This option warns on calls to "alloca" with an integer
           argument whose value is either zero, or that is not bounded
           by a controlling predicate that limits its value to at most
           <i>byte-size</i>.  It also warns for calls to "alloca" where the
           bound value is unknown.  Arguments of non-integer types are
           considered unbounded even if they appear to be constrained to
           the expected range.

           For example, a bounded case of "alloca" could be:

                   void func (size_t n)
                   {
                     void *p;
                     if (n &lt;= 1000)
                       p = alloca (n);
                     else
                       p = malloc (n);
                     f (p);
                   }

           In the above example, passing "-Walloca-larger-than=1000"
           would not issue a warning because the call to "alloca" is
           known to be at most 1000 bytes.  However, if
           "-Walloca-larger-than=500" were passed, the compiler would
           emit a warning.

           Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of "alloca" with
           no controlling predicate constraining its integer argument.
           For example:

                   void func ()
                   {
                     void *p = alloca (n);
                     f (p);
                   }

           If "-Walloca-larger-than=500" were passed, the above would
           trigger a warning, but this time because of the lack of
           bounds checking.

           Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed
           integers could cause a warning:

                   void func (signed int n)
                   {
                     if (n &lt; 500)
                       {
                         p = alloca (n);
                         f (p);
                       }
                   }

           In the above example, <i>n</i> could be negative, causing a larger
           than expected argument to be implicitly cast into the
           "alloca" call.

           This option also warns when "alloca" is used in a loop.

           <b>-Walloca-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX </b>is enabled by default but is
           usually only effective  when <b>-ftree-vrp </b>is active (default
           for <b>-O2 </b>and above).

           See also <b>-Wvla-larger-than=byte-size</b>.

       <b>-Wno-alloca-larger-than</b>
           Disable <b>-Walloca-larger-than= </b>warnings.  The option is
           equivalent to <b>-Walloca-larger-than=SIZE_MAX </b>or larger.

       <b>-Warray-bounds</b>
       <b>-Warray-bounds=</b><i>n</i>
           This option is only active when <b>-ftree-vrp </b>is active (default
           for <b>-O2 </b>and above). It warns about subscripts to arrays that
           are always out of bounds. This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           <b>-Warray-bounds=1</b>
               This is the warning level of <b>-Warray-bounds </b>and is
               enabled by <b>-Wall</b>; higher levels are not, and must be
               explicitly requested.

           <b>-Warray-bounds=2</b>
               This warning level also warns about out of bounds access
               for arrays at the end of a struct and for arrays accessed
               through pointers. This warning level may give a larger
               number of false positives and is deactivated by default.

       <b>-Wattribute-alias=</b><i>n</i>
       <b>-Wno-attribute-alias</b>
           Warn about declarations using the "alias" and similar
           attributes whose target is incompatible with the type of the
           alias.

           <b>-Wattribute-alias=1</b>
               The default warning level of the <b>-Wattribute-alias </b>option
               diagnoses incompatibilities between the type of the alias
               declaration and that of its target.  Such
               incompatibilities are typically indicative of bugs.

           <b>-Wattribute-alias=2</b>
               At this level <b>-Wattribute-alias </b>also diagnoses cases
               where the attributes of the alias declaration are more
               restrictive than the attributes applied to its target.
               These mismatches can potentially result in incorrect code
               generation.  In other cases they may be benign and could
               be resolved simply by adding the missing attribute to the
               target.  For comparison, see the <b>-Wmissing-attributes</b>
               option, which controls diagnostics when the alias
               declaration is less restrictive than the target, rather
               than more restrictive.

               Attributes considered include "alloc_align",
               "alloc_size", "cold", "const", "hot", "leaf", "malloc",
               "nonnull", "noreturn", "nothrow", "pure",
               "returns_nonnull", and "returns_twice".

           <b>-Wattribute-alias </b>is equivalent to <b>-Wattribute-alias=1</b>.  This
           is the default.  You can disable these warnings with either
           <b>-Wno-attribute-alias </b>or <b>-Wattribute-alias=0</b>.

       <b>-Wbool-compare</b>
           Warn about boolean expression compared with an integer value
           different from "true"/"false".  For instance, the following
           comparison is always false:

                   int n = 5;
                   ...
                   if ((n &gt; 1) == 2) { ... }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wbool-operation</b>
           Warn about suspicious operations on expressions of a boolean
           type.  For instance, bitwise negation of a boolean is very
           likely a bug in the program.  For C, this warning also warns
           about incrementing or decrementing a boolean, which rarely
           makes sense.  (In C++, decrementing a boolean is always
           invalid.  Incrementing a boolean is invalid in C++17, and
           deprecated otherwise.)

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wduplicated-branches</b>
           Warn when an if-else has identical branches.  This warning
           detects cases like

                   if (p != NULL)
                     return 0;
                   else
                     return 0;

           It doesn't warn when both branches contain just a null
           statement.  This warning also warn for conditional operators:

                     int i = x ? *p : *p;

       <b>-Wduplicated-cond</b>
           Warn about duplicated conditions in an if-else-if chain.  For
           instance, warn for the following code:

                   if (p-&gt;q != NULL) { ... }
                   else if (p-&gt;q != NULL) { ... }

       <b>-Wframe-address</b>
           Warn when the <b>__builtin_frame_address </b>or
           <b>__builtin_return_address </b>is called with an argument greater
           than 0.  Such calls may return indeterminate values or crash
           the program.  The warning is included in <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-discarded-qualifiers </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Do not warn if type qualifiers on pointers are being
           discarded.  Typically, the compiler warns if a "const char *"
           variable is passed to a function that takes a "char *"
           parameter.  This option can be used to suppress such a
           warning.

       <b>-Wno-discarded-array-qualifiers </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Do not warn if type qualifiers on arrays which are pointer
           targets are being discarded. Typically, the compiler warns if
           a "const int (*)[]" variable is passed to a function that
           takes a "int (*)[]" parameter.  This option can be used to
           suppress such a warning.

       <b>-Wno-incompatible-pointer-types </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Do not warn when there is a conversion between pointers that
           have incompatible types.  This warning is for cases not
           covered by <b>-Wno-pointer-sign</b>, which warns for pointer
           argument passing or assignment with different signedness.

       <b>-Wno-int-conversion </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Do not warn about incompatible integer to pointer and pointer
           to integer conversions.  This warning is about implicit
           conversions; for explicit conversions the warnings
           <b>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast </b>and <b>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast </b>may be
           used.

       <b>-Wno-div-by-zero</b>
           Do not warn about compile-time integer division by zero.
           Floating-point division by zero is not warned about, as it
           can be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.

       <b>-Wsystem-headers</b>
           Print warning messages for constructs found in system header
           files.  Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed,
           on the assumption that they usually do not indicate real
           problems and would only make the compiler output harder to
           read.  Using this command-line option tells GCC to emit
           warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
           code.  However, note that using <b>-Wall </b>in conjunction with
           this option does <i>not</i> warn about unknown pragmas in system
           headers---for that, <b>-Wunknown-pragmas </b>must also be used.

       <b>-Wtautological-compare</b>
           Warn if a self-comparison always evaluates to true or false.
           This warning detects various mistakes such as:

                   int i = 1;
                   ...
                   if (i &gt; i) { ... }

           This warning also warns about bitwise comparisons that always
           evaluate to true or false, for instance:

                   if ((a &amp; 16) == 10) { ... }

           will always be false.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wtrampolines</b>
           Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested
           functions.  A trampoline is a small piece of data or code
           that is created at run time on the stack when the address of
           a nested function is taken, and is used to call the nested
           function indirectly.  For some targets, it is made up of data
           only and thus requires no special treatment.  But, for most
           targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack to
           be made executable in order for the program to work properly.

       <b>-Wfloat-equal</b>
           Warn if floating-point values are used in equality
           comparisons.

           The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for
           the programmer) to consider floating-point values as
           approximations to infinitely precise real numbers.  If you
           are doing this, then you need to compute (by analyzing the
           code, or in some other way) the maximum or likely maximum
           error that the computation introduces, and allow for it when
           performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's
           a different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for
           equality, you should check to see whether the two values have
           ranges that overlap; and this is done with the relational
           operators, so equality comparisons are probably mistaken.

       <b>-Wtraditional </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
           traditional and ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that
           have no traditional C equivalent, and/or problematic
           constructs that should be avoided.

           *   Macro parameters that appear within string literals in
               the macro body.  In traditional C macro replacement takes
               place within string literals, but in ISO C it does not.

           *   In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not
               exist.  Traditional preprocessors only considered a line
               to be a directive if the <b># </b>appeared in column 1 on the
               line.  Therefore <b>-Wtraditional </b>warns about directives
               that traditional C understands but ignores because the <b>#</b>
               does not appear as the first character on the line.  It
               also suggests you hide directives like "#pragma" not
               understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
               traditional implementations do not recognize "#elif", so
               this option suggests avoiding it altogether.

           *   A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

           *   The unary plus operator.

           *   The <b>U </b>integer constant suffix, or the <b>F </b>or <b>L </b>floating-
               point constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the
               <b>L </b>suffix on integer constants.)  Note, these suffixes
               appear in macros defined in the system headers of most
               modern systems, e.g. the <b>_MIN</b>/<b>_MAX </b>macros in
               "&lt;limits.h&gt;".  Use of these macros in user code might
               normally lead to spurious warnings, however GCC's
               integrated preprocessor has enough context to avoid
               warning in these cases.

           *   A function declared external in one block and then used
               after the end of the block.

           *   A "switch" statement has an operand of type "long".

           *   A non-"static" function declaration follows a "static"
               one.  This construct is not accepted by some traditional
               C compilers.

           *   The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width
               or signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is
               only issued if the base of the constant is ten.  I.e.
               hexadecimal or octal values, which typically represent
               bit patterns, are not warned about.

           *   Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

           *   Initialization of automatic aggregates.

           *   Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a
               separate namespace for labels.

           *   Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero,
               the warning is omitted.  This is done under the
               assumption that the zero initializer in user code appears
               conditioned on e.g. "__STDC__" to avoid missing
               initializer warnings and relies on default initialization
               to zero in the traditional C case.

           *   Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point
               values and vice versa.  The absence of these prototypes
               when compiling with traditional C causes serious
               problems.  This is a subset of the possible conversion
               warnings; for the full set use <b>-Wtraditional-conversion</b>.

           *   Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning
               intentionally is <i>not</i> issued for prototype declarations or
               variadic functions because these ISO C features appear in
               your code when using libiberty's traditional C
               compatibility macros, "PARAMS" and "VPARAMS".  This
               warning is also bypassed for nested functions because
               that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not
               relevant to traditional C compatibility.

       <b>-Wtraditional-conversion </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is
           different from what would happen to the same argument in the
           absence of a prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed
           point to floating and vice versa, and conversions changing
           the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument except when
           the same as the default promotion.

       <b>-Wdeclaration-after-statement </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a
           block.  This construct, known from C++, was introduced with
           ISO C99 and is by default allowed in GCC.  It is not
           supported by ISO C90.

       <b>-Wshadow</b>
           Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows
           another variable, parameter, type, class member (in C++), or
           instance variable (in Objective-C) or whenever a built-in
           function is shadowed. Note that in C++, the compiler warns if
           a local variable shadows an explicit typedef, but not if it
           shadows a struct/class/enum.  Same as <b>-Wshadow=global</b>.

       <b>-Wno-shadow-ivar </b>(Objective-C only)
           Do not warn whenever a local variable shadows an instance
           variable in an Objective-C method.

       <b>-Wshadow=global</b>
           The default for <b>-Wshadow</b>. Warns for any (global) shadowing.

       <b>-Wshadow=local</b>
           Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or
           parameter.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wshadow=global</b>.

       <b>-Wshadow=compatible-local</b>
           Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or
           parameter whose type is compatible with that of the shadowing
           variable. In C++, type compatibility here means the type of
           the shadowing variable can be converted to that of the
           shadowed variable. The creation of this flag (in addition to
           <b>-Wshadow=local</b>) is based on the idea that when a local
           variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most
           likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the
           following example:

                   for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
                   {
                     for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
                     {
                       ...
                     }
                     ...
                   }

           Since the two variable "i" in the example above have
           incompatible types, enabling only <b>-Wshadow=compatible-local</b>
           will not emit a warning.  Because their types are
           incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one in place
           of the other, type checking will catch that and emit an error
           or warning. So not warning (about shadowing) in this case
           will not lead to undetected bugs. Use of this flag instead of
           <b>-Wshadow=local </b>can possibly reduce the number of warnings
           triggered by intentional shadowing.

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wshadow=local</b>.

       <b>-Wlarger-than=</b><i>byte-size</i>
           Warn whenever an object is defined whose size exceeds <i>byte-</i>
           <i>size</i>.  <b>-Wlarger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX </b>is enabled by default.
           Warnings controlled by the option can be disabled either by
           specifying <i>byte-size</i> of <b>SIZE_MAX </b>or more or by
           <b>-Wno-larger-than</b>.

       <b>-Wno-larger-than</b>
           Disable <b>-Wlarger-than= </b>warnings.  The option is equivalent to
           <b>-Wlarger-than=SIZE_MAX </b>or larger.

       <b>-Wframe-larger-than=</b><i>byte-size</i>
           Warn if the size of a function frame exceeds <i>byte-size</i>.  The
           computation done to determine the stack frame size is
           approximate and not conservative.  The actual requirements
           may be somewhat greater than <i>byte-size</i> even if you do not get
           a warning.  In addition, any space allocated via "alloca",
           variable-length arrays, or related constructs is not included
           by the compiler when determining whether or not to issue a
           warning.  <b>-Wframe-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX </b>is enabled by
           default.  Warnings controlled by the option can be disabled
           either by specifying <i>byte-size</i> of <b>SIZE_MAX </b>or more or by
           <b>-Wno-frame-larger-than</b>.

       <b>-Wno-frame-larger-than</b>
           Disable <b>-Wframe-larger-than= </b>warnings.  The option is
           equivalent to <b>-Wframe-larger-than=SIZE_MAX </b>or larger.

       <b>-Wno-free-nonheap-object</b>
           Do not warn when attempting to free an object that was not
           allocated on the heap.

       <b>-Wstack-usage=</b><i>byte-size</i>
           Warn if the stack usage of a function might exceed <i>byte-size</i>.
           The computation done to determine the stack usage is
           conservative.  Any space allocated via "alloca", variable-
           length arrays, or related constructs is included by the
           compiler when determining whether or not to issue a warning.

           The message is in keeping with the output of <b>-fstack-usage</b>.

           *   If the stack usage is fully static but exceeds the
               specified amount, it's:

                         warning: stack usage is 1120 bytes

           *   If the stack usage is (partly) dynamic but bounded, it's:

                         warning: stack usage might be 1648 bytes

           *   If the stack usage is (partly) dynamic and not bounded,
               it's:

                         warning: stack usage might be unbounded

           <b>-Wstack-usage=PTRDIFF_MAX </b>is enabled by default.  Warnings
           controlled by the option can be disabled either by specifying
           <i>byte-size</i> of <b>SIZE_MAX </b>or more or by <b>-Wno-stack-usage</b>.

       <b>-Wno-stack-usage</b>
           Disable <b>-Wstack-usage= </b>warnings.  The option is equivalent to
           <b>-Wstack-usage=SIZE_MAX </b>or larger.

       <b>-Wunsafe-loop-optimizations</b>
           Warn if the loop cannot be optimized because the compiler
           cannot assume anything on the bounds of the loop indices.
           With <b>-funsafe-loop-optimizations </b>warn if the compiler makes
           such assumptions.

       <b>-Wno-pedantic-ms-format </b>(MinGW targets only)
           When used in combination with <b>-Wformat </b>and <b>-pedantic </b>without
           GNU extensions, this option disables the warnings about non-
           ISO "printf" / "scanf" format width specifiers "I32", "I64",
           and "I" used on Windows targets, which depend on the MS
           runtime.

       <b>-Waligned-new</b>
           Warn about a new-expression of a type that requires greater
           alignment than the "alignof(std::max_align_t)" but uses an
           allocation function without an explicit alignment parameter.
           This option is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

           Normally this only warns about global allocation functions,
           but <b>-Waligned-new=all </b>also warns about class member
           allocation functions.

       <b>-Wplacement-new</b>
       <b>-Wplacement-new=</b><i>n</i>
           Warn about placement new expressions with undefined behavior,
           such as constructing an object in a buffer that is smaller
           than the type of the object.  For example, the placement new
           expression below is diagnosed because it attempts to
           construct an array of 64 integers in a buffer only 64 bytes
           large.

                   char buf [64];
                   new (buf) int[64];

           This warning is enabled by default.

           <b>-Wplacement-new=1</b>
               This is the default warning level of <b>-Wplacement-new</b>.  At
               this level the warning is not issued for some strictly
               undefined constructs that GCC allows as extensions for
               compatibility with legacy code.  For example, the
               following "new" expression is not diagnosed at this level
               even though it has undefined behavior according to the
               C++ standard because it writes past the end of the one-
               element array.

                       struct S { int n, a[1]; };
                       S *s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 31 * sizeof s-&gt;a[0]);
                       new (s-&gt;a)int [32]();

           <b>-Wplacement-new=2</b>
               At this level, in addition to diagnosing all the same
               constructs as at level 1, a diagnostic is also issued for
               placement new expressions that construct an object in the
               last member of structure whose type is an array of a
               single element and whose size is less than the size of
               the object being constructed.  While the previous example
               would be diagnosed, the following construct makes use of
               the flexible member array extension to avoid the warning
               at level 2.

                       struct S { int n, a[]; };
                       S *s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 32 * sizeof s-&gt;a[0]);
                       new (s-&gt;a)int [32]();

       <b>-Wpointer-arith</b>
           Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function
           type or of "void".  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1,
           for convenience in calculations with "void *" pointers and
           pointers to functions.  In C++, warn also when an arithmetic
           operation involves "NULL".  This warning is also enabled by
           <b>-Wpedantic</b>.

       <b>-Wpointer-compare</b>
           Warn if a pointer is compared with a zero character constant.
           This usually means that the pointer was meant to be
           dereferenced.  For example:

                   const char *p = foo ();
                   if (p == '\0')
                     return 42;

           Note that the code above is invalid in C++11.

           This warning is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wtype-limits</b>
           Warn if a comparison is always true or always false due to
           the limited range of the data type, but do not warn for
           constant expressions.  For example, warn if an unsigned
           variable is compared against zero with "&lt;" or "&gt;=".  This
           warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wabsolute-value </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn for calls to standard functions that compute the
           absolute value of an argument when a more appropriate
           standard function is available.  For example, calling
           "abs(3.14)" triggers the warning because the appropriate
           function to call to compute the absolute value of a double
           argument is "fabs".  The option also triggers warnings when
           the argument in a call to such a function has an unsigned
           type.  This warning can be suppressed with an explicit type
           cast and it is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wcomment</b>
       <b>-Wcomments</b>
           Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <b>/* </b>appears in a <b>/*</b>
           comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a <b>//</b>
           comment.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wtrigraphs</b>
           Warn if any trigraphs are encountered that might change the
           meaning of the program.  Trigraphs within comments are not
           warned about, except those that would form escaped newlines.

           This option is implied by <b>-Wall</b>.  If <b>-Wall </b>is not given, this
           option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To get
           trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other <b>-Wall</b>
           warnings, use <b>-trigraphs -Wall -Wno-trigraphs</b>.

       <b>-Wundef</b>
           Warn if an undefined identifier is evaluated in an "#if"
           directive.  Such identifiers are replaced with zero.

       <b>-Wexpansion-to-defined</b>
           Warn whenever <b>defined </b>is encountered in the expansion of a
           macro (including the case where the macro is expanded by an
           <b>#if </b>directive).  Such usage is not portable.  This warning is
           also enabled by <b>-Wpedantic </b>and <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wunused-macros</b>
           Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.
           A macro is <i>used</i> if it is expanded or tested for existence at
           least once.  The preprocessor also warns if the macro has not
           been used at the time it is redefined or undefined.

           Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and
           macros defined in include files are not warned about.

           <i>Note:</i> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
           conditional blocks, then the preprocessor reports it as
           unused.  To avoid the warning in such a case, you might
           improve the scope of the macro's definition by, for example,
           moving it into the first skipped block.  Alternatively, you
           could provide a dummy use with something like:

                   #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
                   #endif

       <b>-Wno-endif-labels</b>
           Do not warn whenever an "#else" or an "#endif" are followed
           by text.  This sometimes happens in older programs with code
           of the form

                   #if FOO
                   ...
                   #else FOO
                   ...
                   #endif FOO

           The second and third "FOO" should be in comments.  This
           warning is on by default.

       <b>-Wbad-function-cast </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn when a function call is cast to a non-matching type.
           For example, warn if a call to a function returning an
           integer type is cast to a pointer type.

       <b>-Wc90-c99-compat </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn about features not present in ISO C90, but present in
           ISO C99.  For instance, warn about use of variable length
           arrays, "long long" type, "bool" type, compound literals,
           designated initializers, and so on.  This option is
           independent of the standards mode.  Warnings are disabled in
           the expression that follows "__extension__".

       <b>-Wc99-c11-compat </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn about features not present in ISO C99, but present in
           ISO C11.  For instance, warn about use of anonymous
           structures and unions, "_Atomic" type qualifier,
           "_Thread_local" storage-class specifier, "_Alignas"
           specifier, "Alignof" operator, "_Generic" keyword, and so on.
           This option is independent of the standards mode.  Warnings
           are disabled in the expression that follows "__extension__".

       <b>-Wc11-c2x-compat </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn about features not present in ISO C11, but present in
           ISO C2X.  For instance, warn about omitting the string in
           "_Static_assert".  This option is independent of the
           standards mode.  Warnings are disabled in the expression that
           follows "__extension__".

       <b>-Wc++-compat </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn about ISO C constructs that are outside of the common
           subset of ISO C and ISO C++, e.g. request for implicit
           conversion from "void *" to a pointer to non-"void" type.

       <b>-Wc++11-compat </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO
           C++ 1998 and ISO C++ 2011, e.g., identifiers in ISO C++ 1998
           that are keywords in ISO C++ 2011.  This warning turns on
           <b>-Wnarrowing </b>and is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wc++14-compat </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO
           C++ 2011 and ISO C++ 2014.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wc++17-compat </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about C++ constructs whose meaning differs between ISO
           C++ 2014 and ISO C++ 2017.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wcast-qual</b>
           Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type
           qualifier from the target type.  For example, warn if a
           "const char *" is cast to an ordinary "char *".

           Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier
           in an unsafe way.  For example, casting "char **" to "const
           char **" is unsafe, as in this example:

                     /* p is char ** value.  */
                     const char **q = (const char **) p;
                     /* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK.  */
                     *q = "string";
                     /* Now char** pointer points to read-only memory.  */
                     **p = 'b';

       <b>-Wcast-align</b>
           Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required
           alignment of the target is increased.  For example, warn if a
           "char *" is cast to an "int *" on machines where integers can
           only be accessed at two- or four-byte boundaries.

       <b>-Wcast-align=strict</b>
           Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required
           alignment of the target is increased.  For example, warn if a
           "char *" is cast to an "int *" regardless of the target
           machine.

       <b>-Wcast-function-type</b>
           Warn when a function pointer is cast to an incompatible
           function pointer.  In a cast involving function types with a
           variable argument list only the types of initial arguments
           that are provided are considered.  Any parameter of pointer-
           type matches any other pointer-type.  Any benign differences
           in integral types are ignored, like "int" vs. "long" on ILP32
           targets.  Likewise type qualifiers are ignored.  The function
           type "void (*) (void)" is special and matches everything,
           which can be used to suppress this warning.  In a cast
           involving pointer to member types this warning warns whenever
           the type cast is changing the pointer to member type.  This
           warning is enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wwrite-strings</b>
           When compiling C, give string constants the type "const
           char[<i>length]"</i> so that copying the address of one into a
           non-"const" "char *" pointer produces a warning.  These
           warnings help you find at compile time code that can try to
           write into a string constant, but only if you have been very
           careful about using "const" in declarations and prototypes.
           Otherwise, it is just a nuisance. This is why we did not make
           <b>-Wall </b>request these warnings.

           When compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from
           string literals to "char *".  This warning is enabled by
           default for C++ programs.

       <b>-Wcatch-value</b>
       <b>-Wcatch-value=</b><i>n</i> (C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about catch handlers that do not catch via reference.
           With <b>-Wcatch-value=1 </b>(or <b>-Wcatch-value </b>for short) warn about
           polymorphic class types that are caught by value.  With
           <b>-Wcatch-value=2 </b>warn about all class types that are caught by
           value. With <b>-Wcatch-value=3 </b>warn about all types that are not
           caught by reference. <b>-Wcatch-value </b>is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wclobbered</b>
           Warn for variables that might be changed by "longjmp" or
           "vfork".  This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wconditionally-supported </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn for conditionally-supported (C++11 [intro.defs])
           constructs.

       <b>-Wconversion</b>
           Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This
           includes conversions between real and integer, like "abs (x)"
           when "x" is "double"; conversions between signed and
           unsigned, like "unsigned ui = -1"; and conversions to smaller
           types, like "sqrtf (M_PI)". Do not warn for explicit casts
           like "abs ((int) x)" and "ui = (unsigned) -1", or if the
           value is not changed by the conversion like in "abs (2.0)".
           Warnings about conversions between signed and unsigned
           integers can be disabled by using <b>-Wno-sign-conversion</b>.

           For C++, also warn for confusing overload resolution for
           user-defined conversions; and conversions that never use a
           type conversion operator: conversions to "void", the same
           type, a base class or a reference to them. Warnings about
           conversions between signed and unsigned integers are disabled
           by default in C++ unless <b>-Wsign-conversion </b>is explicitly
           enabled.

       <b>-Wno-conversion-null </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Do not warn for conversions between "NULL" and non-pointer
           types. <b>-Wconversion-null </b>is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when a literal <b>0 </b>is used as null pointer constant.  This
           can be useful to facilitate the conversion to "nullptr" in
           C++11.

       <b>-Wsubobject-linkage </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if a class type has a base or a field whose type uses
           the anonymous namespace or depends on a type with no linkage.
           If a type A depends on a type B with no or internal linkage,
           defining it in multiple translation units would be an ODR
           violation because the meaning of B is different in each
           translation unit.  If A only appears in a single translation
           unit, the best way to silence the warning is to give it
           internal linkage by putting it in an anonymous namespace as
           well.  The compiler doesn't give this warning for types
           defined in the main .C file, as those are unlikely to have
           multiple definitions.  <b>-Wsubobject-linkage </b>is enabled by
           default.

       <b>-Wdangling-else</b>
           Warn about constructions where there may be confusion to
           which "if" statement an "else" branch belongs.  Here is an
           example of such a case:

                   {
                     if (a)
                       if (b)
                         foo ();
                     else
                       bar ();
                   }

           In C/C++, every "else" branch belongs to the innermost
           possible "if" statement, which in this example is "if (b)".
           This is often not what the programmer expected, as
           illustrated in the above example by indentation the
           programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
           confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag is specified.
           To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the
           innermost "if" statement so there is no way the "else" can
           belong to the enclosing "if".  The resulting code looks like
           this:

                   {
                     if (a)
                       {
                         if (b)
                           foo ();
                         else
                           bar ();
                       }
                   }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wparentheses</b>.

       <b>-Wdate-time</b>
           Warn when macros "__TIME__", "__DATE__" or "__TIMESTAMP__"
           are encountered as they might prevent bit-wise-identical
           reproducible compilations.

       <b>-Wdelete-incomplete </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when deleting a pointer to incomplete type, which may
           cause undefined behavior at runtime.  This warning is enabled
           by default.

       <b>-Wuseless-cast </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn when an expression is casted to its own type.

       <b>-Wempty-body</b>
           Warn if an empty body occurs in an "if", "else" or "do while"
           statement.  This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wenum-compare</b>
           Warn about a comparison between values of different
           enumerated types.  In C++ enumerated type mismatches in
           conditional expressions are also diagnosed and the warning is
           enabled by default.  In C this warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wextra-semi </b>(C++, Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about redundant semicolon after in-class function
           definition.

       <b>-Wjump-misses-init </b>(C, Objective-C only)
           Warn if a "goto" statement or a "switch" statement jumps
           forward across the initialization of a variable, or jumps
           backward to a label after the variable has been initialized.
           This only warns about variables that are initialized when
           they are declared.  This warning is only supported for C and
           Objective-C; in C++ this sort of branch is an error in any
           case.

           <b>-Wjump-misses-init </b>is included in <b>-Wc++-compat</b>.  It can be
           disabled with the <b>-Wno-jump-misses-init </b>option.

       <b>-Wsign-compare</b>
           Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values
           could produce an incorrect result when the signed value is
           converted to unsigned.  In C++, this warning is also enabled
           by <b>-Wall</b>.  In C, it is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wsign-conversion</b>
           Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an
           integer value, like assigning a signed integer expression to
           an unsigned integer variable. An explicit cast silences the
           warning. In C, this option is enabled also by <b>-Wconversion</b>.

       <b>-Wfloat-conversion</b>
           Warn for implicit conversions that reduce the precision of a
           real value.  This includes conversions from real to integer,
           and from higher precision real to lower precision real
           values.  This option is also enabled by <b>-Wconversion</b>.

       <b>-Wno-scalar-storage-order</b>
           Do not warn on suspicious constructs involving reverse scalar
           storage order.

       <b>-Wsized-deallocation </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn about a definition of an unsized deallocation function

                   void operator delete (void *) noexcept;
                   void operator delete[] (void *) noexcept;

           without a definition of the corresponding sized deallocation
           function

                   void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
                   void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;

           or vice versa.  Enabled by <b>-Wextra </b>along with
           <b>-fsized-deallocation</b>.

       <b>-Wsizeof-pointer-div</b>
           Warn for suspicious divisions of two sizeof expressions that
           divide the pointer size by the element size, which is the
           usual way to compute the array size but won't work out
           correctly with pointers.  This warning warns e.g. about
           "sizeof (ptr) / sizeof (ptr[0])" if "ptr" is not an array,
           but a pointer.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess</b>
           Warn for suspicious length parameters to certain string and
           memory built-in functions if the argument uses "sizeof".
           This warning triggers for example for "memset (ptr, 0, sizeof
           (ptr));" if "ptr" is not an array, but a pointer, and
           suggests a possible fix, or about "memcpy (&amp;foo, ptr, sizeof
           (&amp;foo));".  <b>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess </b>also warns about calls
           to bounded string copy functions like "strncat" or "strncpy"
           that specify as the bound a "sizeof" expression of the source
           array.  For example, in the following function the call to
           "strncat" specifies the size of the source string as the
           bound.  That is almost certainly a mistake and so the call is
           diagnosed.

                   void make_file (const char *name)
                   {
                     char path[PATH_MAX];
                     strncpy (path, name, sizeof path - 1);
                     strncat (path, ".text", sizeof ".text");
                     ...
                   }

           The <b>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess </b>option is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wsizeof-array-argument</b>
           Warn when the "sizeof" operator is applied to a parameter
           that is declared as an array in a function definition.  This
           warning is enabled by default for C and C++ programs.

       <b>-Wmemset-elt-size</b>
           Warn for suspicious calls to the "memset" built-in function,
           if the first argument references an array, and the third
           argument is a number equal to the number of elements, but not
           equal to the size of the array in memory.  This indicates
           that the user has omitted a multiplication by the element
           size.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wmemset-transposed-args</b>
           Warn for suspicious calls to the "memset" built-in function
           where the second argument is not zero and the third argument
           is zero.  For example, the call "memset (buf, sizeof buf, 0)"
           is diagnosed because "memset (buf, 0, sizeof buf)" was meant
           instead.  The diagnostic is only emitted if the third
           argument is a literal zero.  Otherwise, if it is an
           expression that is folded to zero, or a cast of zero to some
           type, it is far less likely that the arguments have been
           mistakenly transposed and no warning is emitted.  This
           warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Waddress</b>
           Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include
           using the address of a function in a conditional expression,
           such as "void func(void); if (func)", and comparisons against
           the memory address of a string literal, such as "if (x ==
           "abc")".  Such uses typically indicate a programmer error:
           the address of a function always evaluates to true, so their
           use in a conditional usually indicate that the programmer
           forgot the parentheses in a function call; and comparisons
           against string literals result in unspecified behavior and
           are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
           programmer intended to use "strcmp".  This warning is enabled
           by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Waddress-of-packed-member</b>
           Warn when the address of packed member of struct or union is
           taken, which usually results in an unaligned pointer value.
           This is enabled by default.

       <b>-Wlogical-op</b>
           Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in
           expressions.  This includes using logical operators in
           contexts where a bit-wise operator is likely to be expected.
           Also warns when the operands of a logical operator are the
           same:

                   extern int a;
                   if (a &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; a &lt; 0) { ... }

       <b>-Wlogical-not-parentheses</b>
           Warn about logical not used on the left hand side operand of
           a comparison.  This option does not warn if the right operand
           is considered to be a boolean expression.  Its purpose is to
           detect suspicious code like the following:

                   int a;
                   ...
                   if (!a &gt; 1) { ... }

           It is possible to suppress the warning by wrapping the LHS
           into parentheses:

                   if ((!a) &gt; 1) { ... }

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Waggregate-return</b>
           Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are
           defined or called.  (In languages where you can return an
           array, this also elicits a warning.)

       <b>-Wno-aggressive-loop-optimizations</b>
           Warn if in a loop with constant number of iterations the
           compiler detects undefined behavior in some statement during
           one or more of the iterations.

       <b>-Wno-attributes</b>
           Do not warn if an unexpected "__attribute__" is used, such as
           unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to
           variables, etc.  This does not stop errors for incorrect use
           of supported attributes.

       <b>-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch</b>
           Warn if a built-in function is declared with an incompatible
           signature or as a non-function, or when a built-in function
           declared with a type that does not include a prototype is
           called with arguments whose promoted types do not match those
           expected by the function.  When <b>-Wextra </b>is specified, also
           warn when a built-in function that takes arguments is
           declared without a prototype.  The
           <b>-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch </b>warning is enabled by
           default.  To avoid the warning include the appropriate header
           to bring the prototypes of built-in functions into scope.

           For example, the call to "memset" below is diagnosed by the
           warning because the function expects a value of type "size_t"
           as its argument but the type of 32 is "int".  With <b>-Wextra</b>,
           the declaration of the function is diagnosed as well.

                   extern void* memset ();
                   void f (void *d)
                   {
                     memset (d, '\0', 32);
                   }

       <b>-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined</b>
           Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This
           suppresses warnings for redefinition of "__TIMESTAMP__",
           "__TIME__", "__DATE__", "__FILE__", and "__BASE_FILE__".

       <b>-Wstrict-prototypes </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying
           the argument types.  (An old-style function definition is
           permitted without a warning if preceded by a declaration that
           specifies the argument types.)

       <b>-Wold-style-declaration </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in
           a declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers
           like "static" are not the first things in a declaration.
           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wold-style-definition </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning
           is given even if there is a previous prototype.

       <b>-Wmissing-parameter-type </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in
           K&amp;R-style functions:

                   void foo(bar) { }

           This warning is also enabled by <b>-Wextra</b>.

       <b>-Wmissing-prototypes </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
           prototype declaration.  This warning is issued even if the
           definition itself provides a prototype.  Use this option to
           detect global functions that do not have a matching prototype
           declaration in a header file.  This option is not valid for
           C++ because all function declarations provide prototypes and
           a non-matching declaration declares an overload rather than
           conflict with an earlier declaration.  Use
           <b>-Wmissing-declarations </b>to detect missing declarations in C++.

       <b>-Wmissing-declarations</b>
           Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
           declaration.  Do so even if the definition itself provides a
           prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions that
           are not declared in header files.  In C, no warnings are
           issued for functions with previous non-prototype
           declarations; use <b>-Wmissing-prototypes </b>to detect missing
           prototypes.  In C++, no warnings are issued for function
           templates, or for inline functions, or for functions in
           anonymous namespaces.

       <b>-Wmissing-field-initializers</b>
           Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.
           For example, the following code causes such a warning,
           because "x.h" is implicitly zero:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   struct s x = { 3, 4 };

           This option does not warn about designated initializers, so
           the following modification does not trigger a warning:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };

           In C this option does not warn about the universal zero
           initializer <b>{ 0 }</b>:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   struct s x = { 0 };

           Likewise, in C++ this option does not warn about the empty {
           } initializer, for example:

                   struct s { int f, g, h; };
                   s x = { };

           This warning is included in <b>-Wextra</b>.  To get other <b>-Wextra</b>
           warnings without this one, use <b>-Wextra</b>
           <b>-Wno-missing-field-initializers</b>.

       <b>-Wno-multichar</b>
           Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (<b>'FOOF'</b>) is used.
           Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
           implementation-defined values, and should not be used in
           portable code.

       <b>-Wnormalized=</b>[<b>none</b>|<b>id</b>|<b>nfc</b>|<b>nfkc</b>]
           In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they
           are different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes
           when characters outside the basic ASCII character set are
           used, you can have two different character sequences that
           look the same.  To avoid confusion, the ISO 10646 standard
           sets out some <i>normalization rules</i> which when applied ensure
           that two sequences that look the same are turned into the
           same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers
           that have not been normalized; this option controls that
           warning.

           There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The
           default is <b>-Wnormalized=nfc</b>, which warns about any identifier
           that is not in the ISO 10646 "C" normalized form, <i>NFC</i>.  NFC
           is the recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to
           <b>-Wnormalized</b>.

           Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in
           identifiers by ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC,
           are not allowed in identifiers.  That is, there's no way to
           use these symbols in portable ISO C or C++ and have all your
           identifiers in NFC.  <b>-Wnormalized=id </b>suppresses the warning
           for these characters.  It is hoped that future versions of
           the standards involved will correct this, which is why this
           option is not the default.

           You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
           <b>-Wnormalized=none </b>or <b>-Wno-normalized</b>.  You should only do
           this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
           "D"), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
           literally impossible to see.

           Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look
           identical in some fonts or display methodologies, especially
           once formatting has been applied.  For instance "\u207F",
           "SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL LETTER N", displays just like a
           regular "n" that has been placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646
           defines the <i>NFKC</i> normalization scheme to convert all these
           into a standard form as well, and GCC warns if your code is
           not in NFKC if you use <b>-Wnormalized=nfkc</b>.  This warning is
           comparable to warning about every identifier that contains
           the letter O because it might be confused with the digit 0,
           and so is not the default, but may be useful as a local
           coding convention if the programming environment cannot be
           fixed to display these characters distinctly.

       <b>-Wno-attribute-warning</b>
           Do not warn about usage of functions declared with "warning"
           attribute.  By default, this warning is enabled.
           <b>-Wno-attribute-warning </b>can be used to disable the warning or
           <b>-Wno-error=attribute-warning </b>can be used to disable the error
           when compiled with <b>-Werror </b>flag.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated</b>
           Do not warn about usage of deprecated features.

       <b>-Wno-deprecated-declarations</b>
           Do not warn about uses of functions, variables, and types
           marked as deprecated by using the "deprecated" attribute.

       <b>-Wno-overflow</b>
           Do not warn about compile-time overflow in constant
           expressions.

       <b>-Wno-odr</b>
           Warn about One Definition Rule violations during link-time
           optimization.  Requires <b>-flto-odr-type-merging </b>to be enabled.
           Enabled by default.

       <b>-Wopenmp-simd</b>
           Warn if the vectorizer cost model overrides the OpenMP simd
           directive set by user.  The <b>-fsimd-cost-model=unlimited</b>
           option can be used to relax the cost model.

       <b>-Woverride-init </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if an initialized field without side effects is
           overridden when using designated initializers.

           This warning is included in <b>-Wextra</b>.  To get other <b>-Wextra</b>
           warnings without this one, use <b>-Wextra -Wno-override-init</b>.

       <b>-Woverride-init-side-effects </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if an initialized field with side effects is overridden
           when using designated initializers.  This warning is enabled
           by default.

       <b>-Wpacked</b>
           Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the
           packed attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the
           structure.  Such structures may be mis-aligned for little
           benefit.  For instance, in this code, the variable "f.x" in
           "struct bar" is misaligned even though "struct bar" does not
           itself have the packed attribute:

                   struct foo {
                     int x;
                     char a, b, c, d;
                   } __attribute__((packed));
                   struct bar {
                     char z;
                     struct foo f;
                   };

       <b>-Wpacked-bitfield-compat</b>
           The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the "packed"
           attribute on bit-fields of type "char".  This has been fixed
           in GCC 4.4 but the change can lead to differences in the
           structure layout.  GCC informs you when the offset of such a
           field has changed in GCC 4.4.  For example there is no longer
           a 4-bit padding between field "a" and "b" in this structure:

                   struct foo
                   {
                     char a:4;
                     char b:8;
                   } __attribute__ ((packed));

           This warning is enabled by default.  Use
           <b>-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat </b>to disable this warning.

       <b>-Wpacked-not-aligned </b>(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)
           Warn if a structure field with explicitly specified alignment
           in a packed struct or union is misaligned.  For example, a
           warning will be issued on "struct S", like, "warning:
           alignment 1 of 'struct S' is less than 8", in this code:

                   struct __attribute__ ((aligned (8))) S8 { char a[8]; };
                   struct __attribute__ ((packed)) S {
                     struct S8 s8;
                   };

           This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wpadded</b>
           Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align
           an element of the structure or to align the whole structure.
           Sometimes when this happens it is possible to rearrange the
           fields of the structure to reduce the padding and so make the
           structure smaller.

       <b>-Wredundant-decls</b>
           Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same
           scope, even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and
           changes nothing.

       <b>-Wno-restrict</b>
           Warn when an object referenced by a "restrict"-qualified
           parameter (or, in C++, a "__restrict"-qualified parameter) is
           aliased by another argument, or when copies between such
           objects overlap.  For example, the call to the "strcpy"
           function below attempts to truncate the string by replacing
           its initial characters with the last four.  However, because
           the call writes the terminating NUL into "a[4]", the copies
           overlap and the call is diagnosed.

                   void foo (void)
                   {
                     char a[] = "abcd1234";
                     strcpy (a, a + 4);
                     ...
                   }

           The <b>-Wrestrict </b>option detects some instances of simple
           overlap even without optimization but works best at <b>-O2 </b>and
           above.  It is included in <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wnested-externs </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn if an "extern" declaration is encountered within a
           function.

       <b>-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor</b>
           Suppress warnings about use of C++11 inheriting constructors
           when the base class inherited from has a C variadic
           constructor; the warning is on by default because the
           ellipsis is not inherited.

       <b>-Winline</b>
           Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be
           inlined.  Even with this option, the compiler does not warn
           about failures to inline functions declared in system
           headers.

           The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine
           whether or not to inline a function.  For example, the
           compiler takes into account the size of the function being
           inlined and the amount of inlining that has already been done
           in the current function.  Therefore, seemingly insignificant
           changes in the source program can cause the warnings produced
           by <b>-Winline </b>to appear or disappear.

       <b>-Wno-invalid-offsetof </b>(C++ and Objective-C++ only)
           Suppress warnings from applying the "offsetof" macro to a
           non-POD type.  According to the 2014 ISO C++ standard,
           applying "offsetof" to a non-standard-layout type is
           undefined.  In existing C++ implementations, however,
           "offsetof" typically gives meaningful results.  This flag is
           for users who are aware that they are writing nonportable
           code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the warning
           about it.

           The restrictions on "offsetof" may be relaxed in a future
           version of the C++ standard.

       <b>-Wint-in-bool-context</b>
           Warn for suspicious use of integer values where boolean
           values are expected, such as conditional expressions (?:)
           using non-boolean integer constants in boolean context, like
           "if (a &lt;= b ? 2 : 3)".  Or left shifting of signed integers
           in boolean context, like "for (a = 0; 1 &lt;&lt; a; a++);".
           Likewise for all kinds of multiplications regardless of the
           data type.  This warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast</b>
           Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of
           a different size. In C++, casting to a pointer type of
           smaller size is an error. <b>Wint-to-pointer-cast </b>is enabled by
           default.

       <b>-Wno-pointer-to-int-cast </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Suppress warnings from casts from a pointer to an integer
           type of a different size.

       <b>-Winvalid-pch</b>
           Warn if a precompiled header is found in the search path but
           cannot be used.

       <b>-Wlong-long</b>
           Warn if "long long" type is used.  This is enabled by either
           <b>-Wpedantic </b>or <b>-Wtraditional </b>in ISO C90 and C++98 modes.  To
           inhibit the warning messages, use <b>-Wno-long-long</b>.

       <b>-Wvariadic-macros</b>
           Warn if variadic macros are used in ISO C90 mode, or if the
           GNU alternate syntax is used in ISO C99 mode.  This is
           enabled by either <b>-Wpedantic </b>or <b>-Wtraditional</b>.  To inhibit
           the warning messages, use <b>-Wno-variadic-macros</b>.

       <b>-Wvarargs</b>
           Warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle
           variable arguments like "va_start".  This is default.  To
           inhibit the warning messages, use <b>-Wno-varargs</b>.

       <b>-Wvector-operation-performance</b>
           Warn if vector operation is not implemented via SIMD
           capabilities of the architecture.  Mainly useful for the
           performance tuning.  Vector operation can be implemented
           "piecewise", which means that the scalar operation is
           performed on every vector element; "in parallel", which means
           that the vector operation is implemented using scalars of
           wider type, which normally is more performance efficient; and
           "as a single scalar", which means that vector fits into a
           scalar type.

       <b>-Wno-virtual-move-assign</b>
           Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a
           non-trivial C++11 move assignment operator.  This is
           dangerous because if the virtual base is reachable along more
           than one path, it is moved multiple times, which can mean
           both objects end up in the moved-from state.  If the move
           assignment operator is written to avoid moving from a moved-
           from object, this warning can be disabled.

       <b>-Wvla</b>
           Warn if a variable-length array is used in the code.
           <b>-Wno-vla </b>prevents the <b>-Wpedantic </b>warning of the variable-
           length array.

       <b>-Wvla-larger-than=</b><i>byte-size</i>
           If this option is used, the compiler will warn for
           declarations of variable-length arrays whose size is either
           unbounded, or bounded by an argument that allows the array
           size to exceed <i>byte-size</i> bytes.  This is similar to how
           <b>-Walloca-larger-than=</b><i>byte-size</i> works, but with variable-
           length arrays.

           Note that GCC may optimize small variable-length arrays of a
           known value into plain arrays, so this warning may not get
           triggered for such arrays.

           <b>-Wvla-larger-than=PTRDIFF_MAX </b>is enabled by default but is
           typically only effective when <b>-ftree-vrp </b>is active (default
           for <b>-O2 </b>and above).

           See also <b>-Walloca-larger-than=</b><i>byte-size</i>.

       <b>-Wno-vla-larger-than</b>
           Disable <b>-Wvla-larger-than= </b>warnings.  The option is
           equivalent to <b>-Wvla-larger-than=SIZE_MAX </b>or larger.

       <b>-Wvolatile-register-var</b>
           Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The
           volatile modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may
           eliminate reads and/or writes to register variables.  This
           warning is enabled by <b>-Wall</b>.

       <b>-Wdisabled-optimization</b>
           Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This
           warning does not generally indicate that there is anything
           wrong with your code; it merely indicates that GCC's
           optimizers are unable to handle the code effectively.  Often,
           the problem is that your code is too big or too complex; GCC
           refuses to optimize programs when the optimization itself is
           likely to take inordinate amounts of time.

       <b>-Wpointer-sign </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with
           different signedness.  This option is only supported for C
           and Objective-C.  It is implied by <b>-Wall </b>and by <b>-Wpedantic</b>,
           which can be disabled with <b>-Wno-pointer-sign</b>.

       <b>-Wstack-protector</b>
           This option is only active when <b>-fstack-protector </b>is active.
           It warns about functions that are not protected against stack
           smashing.

       <b>-Woverlength-strings</b>
           Warn about string constants that are longer than the "minimum
           maximum" length specified in the C standard.  Modern
           compilers generally allow string constants that are much
           longer than the standard's minimum limit, but very portable
           programs should avoid using longer strings.

           The limit applies <i>after</i> string constant concatenation, and
           does not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509
           characters; in C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not
           specify a normative minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose
           overlength strings in C++.

           This option is implied by <b>-Wpedantic</b>, and can be disabled
           with <b>-Wno-overlength-strings</b>.

       <b>-Wunsuffixed-float-constants </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
           a suffix.  When used together with <b>-Wsystem-headers </b>it warns
           about such constants in system header files.  This can be
           useful when preparing code to use with the
           "FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64" pragma from the decimal floating-
           point extension to C99.

       <b>-Wno-designated-init </b>(C and Objective-C only)
           Suppress warnings when a positional initializer is used to
           initialize a structure that has been marked with the
           "designated_init" attribute.

       <b>-Whsa</b>
           Issue a warning when HSAIL cannot be emitted for the compiled
           function or OpenMP construct.

   <b>Options for Debugging Your Program</b>
       To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in
       almost all cases you need only to add <b>-g </b>to your other options.

       GCC allows you to use <b>-g </b>with <b>-O</b>.  The shortcuts taken by
       optimized code may occasionally be surprising: some variables you
       declared may not exist at all; flow of control may briefly move
       where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed
       because they compute constant results or their values are already
       at hand; some statements may execute in different places because
       they have been moved out of loops.  Nevertheless it is possible
       to debug optimized output.  This makes it reasonable to use the
       optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

       If you are not using some other optimization option, consider
       using <b>-Og </b>with <b>-g</b>.  With no <b>-O </b>option at all, some compiler
       passes that collect information useful for debugging do not run
       at all, so that <b>-Og </b>may result in a better debugging experience.

       <b>-g  </b>Produce debugging information in the operating system's
           native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work
           with this debugging information.

           On most systems that use stabs format, <b>-g </b>enables use of
           extra debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra
           information makes debugging work better in GDB but probably
           makes other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.
           If you want to control for certain whether to generate the
           extra information, use <b>-gstabs+</b>, <b>-gstabs</b>, <b>-gxcoff+</b>, <b>-gxcoff</b>,
           or <b>-gvms </b>(see below).

       <b>-ggdb</b>
           Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to
           use the most expressive format available (DWARF, stabs, or
           the native format if neither of those are supported),
           including GDB extensions if at all possible.

       <b>-gdwarf</b>
       <b>-gdwarf-</b><i>version</i>
           Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
           supported).  The value of <i>version</i> may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5;
           the default version for most targets is 4.  DWARF Version 5
           is only experimental.

           Note that with DWARF Version 2, some ports require and always
           use some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind
           tables.

           Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments</b>
           for maximum benefit.

           GCC no longer supports DWARF Version 1, which is
           substantially different than Version 2 and later.  For
           historical reasons, some other DWARF-related options such as
           <b>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</b>) retain a reference to DWARF Version 2 in
           their names, but apply to all currently-supported versions of
           DWARF.

       <b>-gstabs</b>
           Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
           supported), without GDB extensions.  This is the format used
           by DBX on most BSD systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V
           Release 4 systems this option produces stabs debugging output
           that is not understood by DBX.  On System V Release 4 systems
           this option requires the GNU assembler.

       <b>-gstabs+</b>
           Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
           supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
           debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to
           make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.

       <b>-gxcoff</b>
           Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
           supported).  This is the format used by the DBX debugger on
           IBM RS/6000 systems.

       <b>-gxcoff+</b>
           Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
           supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
           debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to
           make other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program, and
           may cause assemblers other than the GNU assembler (GAS) to
           fail with an error.

       <b>-gvms</b>
           Produce debugging information in Alpha/VMS debug format (if
           that is supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on
           Alpha/VMS systems.

       <b>-g</b><i>level</i>
       <b>-ggdb</b><i>level</i>
       <b>-gstabs</b><i>level</i>
       <b>-gxcoff</b><i>level</i>
       <b>-gvms</b><i>level</i>
           Request debugging information and also use <i>level</i> to specify
           how much information.  The default level is 2.

           Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, <b>-g0</b>
           negates <b>-g</b>.

           Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making
           backtraces in parts of the program that you don't plan to
           debug.  This includes descriptions of functions and external
           variables, and line number tables, but no information about
           local variables.

           Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro
           definitions present in the program.  Some debuggers support
           macro expansion when you use <b>-g3</b>.

           If you use multiple <b>-g </b>options, with or without level
           numbers, the last such option is the one that is effective.

           <b>-gdwarf </b>does not accept a concatenated debug level, to avoid
           confusion with <b>-gdwarf-</b><i>level</i>.  Instead use an additional
           <b>-g</b><i>level</i> option to change the debug level for DWARF.

       <b>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</b>
           Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
           supported), for only symbols that are actually used.

       <b>-femit-class-debug-always</b>
           Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++ class in
           only one object file, emit it in all object files using the
           class.  This option should be used only with debuggers that
           are unable to handle the way GCC normally emits debugging
           information for classes because using this option increases
           the size of debugging information by as much as a factor of
           two.

       <b>-fno-merge-debug-strings</b>
           Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the
           debugging information that are identical in different object
           files.  Merging is not supported by all assemblers or
           linkers.  Merging decreases the size of the debug information
           in the output file at the cost of increasing link processing
           time.  Merging is enabled by default.

       <b>-fdebug-prefix-map=</b><i>old</i><b>=</b><i>new</i>
           When compiling files residing in directory <i>old</i>, record
           debugging information describing them as if the files resided
           in directory <i>new</i> instead.  This can be used to replace a
           build-time path with an install-time path in the debug info.
           It can also be used to change an absolute path to a relative
           path by using <i>.</i> for <i>new</i>.  This can give more reproducible
           builds, which are location independent, but may require an
           extra command to tell GDB where to find the source files. See
           also <b>-ffile-prefix-map</b>.

       <b>-fvar-tracking</b>
           Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are
           stored at each position in code.  Better debugging
           information is then generated (if the debugging information
           format supports this information).

           It is enabled by default when compiling with optimization
           (<b>-Os</b>, <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, ...), debugging information (<b>-g</b>) and the debug
           info format supports it.

       <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments</b>
           Annotate assignments to user variables early in the
           compilation and attempt to carry the annotations over
           throughout the compilation all the way to the end, in an
           attempt to improve debug information while optimizing.  Use
           of <b>-gdwarf-4 </b>is recommended along with it.

           It can be enabled even if var-tracking is disabled, in which
           case annotations are created and maintained, but discarded at
           the end.  By default, this flag is enabled together with
           <b>-fvar-tracking</b>, except when selective scheduling is enabled.

       <b>-gsplit-dwarf</b>
           Separate as much DWARF debugging information as possible into
           a separate output file with the extension <i>.dwo</i>.  This option
           allows the build system to avoid linking files with debug
           information.  To be useful, this option requires a debugger
           capable of reading <i>.dwo</i> files.

       <b>-gdescribe-dies</b>
           Add description attributes to some DWARF DIEs that have no
           name attribute, such as artificial variables, external
           references and call site parameter DIEs.

       <b>-gpubnames</b>
           Generate DWARF ".debug_pubnames" and ".debug_pubtypes"
           sections.

       <b>-ggnu-pubnames</b>
           Generate ".debug_pubnames" and ".debug_pubtypes" sections in
           a format suitable for conversion into a GDB index.  This
           option is only useful with a linker that can produce GDB
           index version 7.

       <b>-fdebug-types-section</b>
           When using DWARF Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put
           into their own ".debug_types" section instead of making them
           part of the ".debug_info" section.  It is more efficient to
           put them in a separate comdat section since the linker can
           then remove duplicates.  But not all DWARF consumers support
           ".debug_types" sections yet and on some objects
           ".debug_types" produces larger instead of smaller debugging
           information.

       <b>-grecord-gcc-switches</b>
       <b>-gno-record-gcc-switches</b>
           This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke
           the compiler that may affect code generation to be appended
           to the DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging
           information.  The options are concatenated with spaces
           separating them from each other and from the compiler
           version.  It is enabled by default.  See also
           <b>-frecord-gcc-switches </b>for another way of storing compiler
           options into the object file.

       <b>-gstrict-dwarf</b>
           Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version
           than selected with <b>-gdwarf-</b><i>version</i>.  On most targets using
           non-conflicting DWARF extensions from later standard versions
           is allowed.

       <b>-gno-strict-dwarf</b>
           Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than
           selected with <b>-gdwarf-</b><i>version</i>.

       <b>-gas-loc-support</b>
           Inform the compiler that the assembler supports ".loc"
           directives.  It may then use them for the assembler to
           generate DWARF2+ line number tables.

           This is generally desirable, because assembler-generated
           line-number tables are a lot more compact than those the
           compiler can generate itself.

           This option will be enabled by default if, at GCC configure
           time, the assembler was found to support such directives.

       <b>-gno-as-loc-support</b>
           Force GCC to generate DWARF2+ line number tables internally,
           if DWARF2+ line number tables are to be generated.

       <b>gas-locview-support</b>
           Inform the compiler that the assembler supports "view"
           assignment and reset assertion checking in ".loc" directives.

           This option will be enabled by default if, at GCC configure
           time, the assembler was found to support them.

       <b>gno-as-locview-support</b>
           Force GCC to assign view numbers internally, if
           <b>-gvariable-location-views </b>are explicitly requested.

       <b>-gcolumn-info</b>
       <b>-gno-column-info</b>
           Emit location column information into DWARF debugging
           information, rather than just file and line.  This option is
           enabled by default.

       <b>-gstatement-frontiers</b>
       <b>-gno-statement-frontiers</b>
           This option causes GCC to create markers in the internal
           representation at the beginning of statements, and to keep
           them roughly in place throughout compilation, using them to
           guide the output of "is_stmt" markers in the line number
           table.  This is enabled by default when compiling with
           optimization (<b>-Os</b>, <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, ...), and outputting DWARF 2
           debug information at the normal level.

       <b>-gvariable-location-views</b>
       <b>-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</b>
       <b>-gno-variable-location-views</b>
           Augment variable location lists with progressive view numbers
           implied from the line number table.  This enables debug
           information consumers to inspect state at certain points of
           the program, even if no instructions associated with the
           corresponding source locations are present at that point.  If
           the assembler lacks support for view numbers in line number
           tables, this will cause the compiler to emit the line number
           table, which generally makes them somewhat less compact.  The
           augmented line number tables and location lists are fully
           backward-compatible, so they can be consumed by debug
           information consumers that are not aware of these
           augmentations, but they won't derive any benefit from them
           either.

           This is enabled by default when outputting DWARF 2 debug
           information at the normal level, as long as there is
           assembler support, <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments </b>is enabled and
           <b>-gstrict-dwarf </b>is not.  When assembler support is not
           available, this may still be enabled, but it will force GCC
           to output internal line number tables, and if
           <b>-ginternal-reset-location-views </b>is not enabled, that will
           most certainly lead to silently mismatching location views.

           There is a proposed representation for view numbers that is
           not backward compatible with the location list format
           introduced in DWARF 5, that can be enabled with
           <b>-gvariable-location-views=incompat5</b>.  This option may be
           removed in the future, is only provided as a reference
           implementation of the proposed representation.  Debug
           information consumers are not expected to support this
           extended format, and they would be rendered unable to decode
           location lists using it.

       <b>-ginternal-reset-location-views</b>
       <b>-gno-internal-reset-location-views</b>
           Attempt to determine location views that can be omitted from
           location view lists.  This requires the compiler to have very
           accurate insn length estimates, which isn't always the case,
           and it may cause incorrect view lists to be generated
           silently when using an assembler that does not support
           location view lists.  The GNU assembler will flag any such
           error as a "view number mismatch".  This is only enabled on
           ports that define a reliable estimation function.

       <b>-ginline-points</b>
       <b>-gno-inline-points</b>
           Generate extended debug information for inlined functions.
           Location view tracking markers are inserted at inlined entry
           points, so that address and view numbers can be computed and
           output in debug information.  This can be enabled
           independently of location views, in which case the view
           numbers won't be output, but it can only be enabled along
           with statement frontiers, and it is only enabled by default
           if location views are enabled.

       <b>-gz</b>[<b>=</b><i>type</i>]
           Produce compressed debug sections in DWARF format, if that is
           supported.  If <i>type</i> is not given, the default type depends on
           the capabilities of the assembler and linker used.  <i>type</i> may
           be one of <b>none </b>(don't compress debug sections), <b>zlib </b>(use
           zlib compression in ELF gABI format), or <b>zlib-gnu </b>(use zlib
           compression in traditional GNU format).  If the linker
           doesn't support writing compressed debug sections, the option
           is rejected.  Otherwise, if the assembler does not support
           them, <b>-gz </b>is silently ignored when producing object files.

       <b>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</b>
           Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the
           base name of the compilation source file matches the base
           name of file in which the struct is defined.

           This option substantially reduces the size of debugging
           information, but at significant potential loss in type
           information to the debugger.  See <b>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</b>
           for a less aggressive option.  See
           <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed </b>for more detailed control.

           This option works only with DWARF debug output.

       <b>-femit-struct-debug-reduced</b>
           Emit debug information for struct-like types only when the
           base name of the compilation source file matches the base
           name of file in which the type is defined, unless the struct
           is a template or defined in a system header.

           This option significantly reduces the size of debugging
           information, with some potential loss in type information to
           the debugger.  See <b>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly </b>for a more
           aggressive option.  See <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed </b>for more
           detailed control.

           This option works only with DWARF debug output.

       <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed</b>[<b>=</b><i>spec-list</i>]
           Specify the struct-like types for which the compiler
           generates debug information.  The intent is to reduce
           duplicate struct debug information between different object
           files within the same program.

           This option is a detailed version of
           <b>-femit-struct-debug-reduced </b>and <b>-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</b>,
           which serves for most needs.

           A specification has the
           syntax[<b>dir:</b>|<b>ind:</b>][<b>ord:</b>|<b>gen:</b>](<b>any</b>|<b>sys</b>|<b>base</b>|<b>none</b>)

           The optional first word limits the specification to structs
           that are used directly (<b>dir:</b>) or used indirectly (<b>ind:</b>).  A
           struct type is used directly when it is the type of a
           variable, member.  Indirect uses arise through pointers to
           structs.  That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid,
           the use is indirect.  An example is <b>struct one direct; struct</b>
           <b>two * indirect;</b>.

           The optional second word limits the specification to ordinary
           structs (<b>ord:</b>) or generic structs (<b>gen:</b>).  Generic structs
           are a bit complicated to explain.  For C++, these are non-
           explicit specializations of template classes, or non-template
           classes within the above.  Other programming languages have
           generics, but <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed </b>does not yet
           implement them.

           The third word specifies the source files for those structs
           for which the compiler should emit debug information.  The
           values <b>none </b>and <b>any </b>have the normal meaning.  The value <b>base</b>
           means that the base of name of the file in which the type
           declaration appears must match the base of the name of the
           main compilation file.  In practice, this means that when
           compiling <i>foo.c</i>, debug information is generated for types
           declared in that file and <i>foo.h</i>, but not other header files.
           The value <b>sys </b>means those types satisfying <b>base </b>or declared
           in system or compiler headers.

           You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for
           your application.

           The default is <b>-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</b>.

           This option works only with DWARF debug output.

       <b>-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm</b>
           Emit DWARF unwind info as compiler generated ".eh_frame"
           section instead of using GAS ".cfi_*" directives.

       <b>-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types</b>
           Normally, when producing DWARF output, GCC avoids producing
           debug symbol output for types that are nowhere used in the
           source file being compiled.  Sometimes it is useful to have
           GCC emit debugging information for all types declared in a
           compilation unit, regardless of whether or not they are
           actually used in that compilation unit, for example if, in
           the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is not
           actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
           however, this results in a significant amount of wasted
           space.

   <b>Options That Control Optimization</b>
       These options control various sorts of optimizations.

       Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce
       the cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the
       expected results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the
       program with a breakpoint between statements, you can then assign
       a new value to any variable or change the program counter to any
       other statement in the function and get exactly the results you
       expect from the source code.

       Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to
       improve the performance and/or code size at the expense of
       compilation time and possibly the ability to debug the program.

       The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has
       of the program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single
       output file mode allows the compiler to use information gained
       from all of the files when compiling each of them.

       Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
       optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.

       Most optimizations are completely disabled at <b>-O0 </b>or if an <b>-O</b>
       level is not set on the command line, even if individual
       optimization flags are specified.  Similarly, <b>-Og </b>suppresses many
       optimization passes.

       Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly
       different set of optimizations may be enabled at each <b>-O </b>level
       than those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with <b>-Q</b>
       <b>--help=optimizers </b>to find out the exact set of optimizations that
       are enabled at each level.

       <b>-O</b>
       <b>-O1 </b>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time,
           and a lot more memory for a large function.

           With <b>-O</b>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
           time, without performing any optimizations that take a great
           deal of compilation time.

           <b>-O </b>turns on the following optimization flags:

           <b>-fauto-inc-dec -fbranch-count-reg -fcombine-stack-adjustments</b>
           <b>-fcompare-elim -fcprop-registers -fdce -fdefer-pop</b>
           <b>-fdelayed-branch -fdse -fforward-propagate</b>
           <b>-fguess-branch-probability -fif-conversion -fif-conversion2</b>
           <b>-finline-functions-called-once -fipa-profile -fipa-pure-const</b>
           <b>-fipa-reference -fipa-reference-addressable -fmerge-constants</b>
           <b>-fmove-loop-invariants -fomit-frame-pointer -freorder-blocks</b>
           <b>-fshrink-wrap -fshrink-wrap-separate -fsplit-wide-types</b>
           <b>-fssa-backprop -fssa-phiopt -ftree-bit-ccp -ftree-ccp</b>
           <b>-ftree-ch -ftree-coalesce-vars -ftree-copy-prop -ftree-dce</b>
           <b>-ftree-dominator-opts -ftree-dse -ftree-forwprop -ftree-fre</b>
           <b>-ftree-phiprop -ftree-pta -ftree-scev-cprop -ftree-sink</b>
           <b>-ftree-slsr -ftree-sra -ftree-ter -funit-at-a-time</b>

       <b>-O2 </b>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported
           optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  As
           compared to <b>-O</b>, this option increases both compilation time
           and the performance of the generated code.

           <b>-O2 </b>turns on all optimization flags specified by <b>-O</b>.  It also
           turns on the following optimization flags:

           <b>-falign-functions  -falign-jumps -falign-labels</b>
           <b>-falign-loops -fcaller-saves -fcode-hoisting -fcrossjumping</b>
           <b>-fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks</b>
           <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks -fdevirtualize</b>
           <b>-fdevirtualize-speculatively -fexpensive-optimizations -fgcse</b>
           <b>-fgcse-lm -fhoist-adjacent-loads -finline-small-functions</b>
           <b>-findirect-inlining -fipa-bit-cp  -fipa-cp  -fipa-icf</b>
           <b>-fipa-ra  -fipa-sra  -fipa-vrp</b>
           <b>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference -flra-remat</b>
           <b>-foptimize-sibling-calls -foptimize-strlen -fpartial-inlining</b>
           <b>-fpeephole2 -freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc</b>
           <b>-freorder-blocks-and-partition  -freorder-functions</b>
           <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop -fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2</b>
           <b>-fsched-interblock  -fsched-spec -fstore-merging</b>
           <b>-fstrict-aliasing -fthread-jumps -ftree-builtin-call-dce</b>
           <b>-ftree-pre -ftree-switch-conversion  -ftree-tail-merge</b>
           <b>-ftree-vrp</b>

           Please note the warning under <b>-fgcse </b>about invoking <b>-O2 </b>on
           programs that use computed gotos.

       <b>-O3 </b>Optimize yet more.  <b>-O3 </b>turns on all optimizations specified
           by <b>-O2 </b>and also turns on the following optimization flags:

           <b>-fgcse-after-reload -finline-functions -fipa-cp-clone</b>
           <b>-floop-interchange -floop-unroll-and-jam -fpeel-loops</b>
           <b>-fpredictive-commoning -fsplit-paths</b>
           <b>-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns -ftree-loop-distribution</b>
           <b>-ftree-loop-vectorize -ftree-partial-pre -ftree-slp-vectorize</b>
           <b>-funswitch-loops -fvect-cost-model</b>
           <b>-fversion-loops-for-strides</b>

       <b>-O0 </b>Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the
           expected results.  This is the default.

       <b>-Os </b>Optimize for size.  <b>-Os </b>enables all <b>-O2 </b>optimizations except
           those that often increase code size:

           <b>-falign-functions  -falign-jumps -falign-labels</b>
           <b>-falign-loops -fprefetch-loop-arrays</b>
           <b>-freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc</b>

           It also enables <b>-finline-functions</b>, causes the compiler to
           tune for code size rather than execution speed, and performs
           further optimizations designed to reduce code size.

       <b>-Ofast</b>
           Disregard strict standards compliance.  <b>-Ofast </b>enables all
           <b>-O3 </b>optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are
           not valid for all standard-compliant programs.  It turns on
           <b>-ffast-math </b>and the Fortran-specific <b>-fstack-arrays</b>, unless
           <b>-fmax-stack-var-size </b>is specified, and <b>-fno-protect-parens</b>.

       <b>-Og </b>Optimize debugging experience.  <b>-Og </b>should be the
           optimization level of choice for the standard edit-compile-
           debug cycle, offering a reasonable level of optimization
           while maintaining fast compilation and a good debugging
           experience.  It is a better choice than <b>-O0 </b>for producing
           debuggable code because some compiler passes that collect
           debug information are disabled at <b>-O0</b>.

           Like <b>-O0</b>, <b>-Og </b>completely disables a number of optimization
           passes so that individual options controlling them have no
           effect.  Otherwise <b>-Og </b>enables all <b>-O1 </b>optimization flags
           except for those that may interfere with debugging:

           <b>-fbranch-count-reg  -fdelayed-branch -fif-conversion</b>
           <b>-fif-conversion2 -finline-functions-called-once</b>
           <b>-fmove-loop-invariants  -fssa-phiopt -ftree-bit-ccp</b>
           <b>-ftree-pta  -ftree-sra</b>

       If you use multiple <b>-O </b>options, with or without level numbers,
       the last such option is the one that is effective.

       Options of the form <b>-f</b><i>flag</i> specify machine-independent flags.
       Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
       form of <b>-ffoo </b>is <b>-fno-foo</b>.  In the table below, only one of the
       forms is listed---the one you typically use.  You can figure out
       the other form by either removing <b>no- </b>or adding it.

       The following options control specific optimizations.  They are
       either activated by <b>-O </b>options or are related to ones that are.
       You can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-
       tuning" of optimizations to be performed is desired.

       <b>-fno-defer-pop</b>
           For machines that must pop arguments after a function call,
           always pop the arguments as soon as each function returns.
           At levels <b>-O1 </b>and higher, <b>-fdefer-pop </b>is the default; this
           allows the compiler to let arguments accumulate on the stack
           for several function calls and pop them all at once.

       <b>-fforward-propagate</b>
           Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to
           combine two instructions and checks if the result can be
           simplified.  If loop unrolling is active, two passes are
           performed and the second is scheduled after loop unrolling.

           This option is enabled by default at optimization levels <b>-O</b>,
           <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-ffp-contract=</b><i>style</i>
           <b>-ffp-contract=off </b>disables floating-point expression
           contraction.  <b>-ffp-contract=fast </b>enables floating-point
           expression contraction such as forming of fused multiply-add
           operations if the target has native support for them.
           <b>-ffp-contract=on </b>enables floating-point expression
           contraction if allowed by the language standard.  This is
           currently not implemented and treated equal to
           <b>-ffp-contract=off</b>.

           The default is <b>-ffp-contract=fast</b>.

       <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b>
           Omit the frame pointer in functions that don't need one.
           This avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore the
           frame pointer; on many targets it also makes an extra
           register available.

           On some targets this flag has no effect because the standard
           calling sequence always uses a frame pointer, so it cannot be
           omitted.

           Note that <b>-fno-omit-frame-pointer </b>doesn't guarantee the frame
           pointer is used in all functions.  Several targets always
           omit the frame pointer in leaf functions.

           Enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-foptimize-sibling-calls</b>
           Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-foptimize-strlen</b>
           Optimize various standard C string functions (e.g. "strlen",
           "strchr" or "strcpy") and their "_FORTIFY_SOURCE"
           counterparts into faster alternatives.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-fno-inline</b>
           Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked
           with the "always_inline" attribute.  This is the default when
           not optimizing.

           Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking
           them with the "noinline" attribute.

       <b>-finline-small-functions</b>
           Integrate functions into their callers when their body is
           smaller than expected function call code (so overall size of
           program gets smaller).  The compiler heuristically decides
           which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating in
           this way.  This inlining applies to all functions, even those
           not declared inline.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-findirect-inlining</b>
           Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at
           compile time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has
           any effect only when inlining itself is turned on by the
           <b>-finline-functions </b>or <b>-finline-small-functions </b>options.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-finline-functions</b>
           Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not
           declared inline.  The compiler heuristically decides which
           functions are worth integrating in this way.

           If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the
           function is declared "static", then the function is normally
           not output as assembler code in its own right.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.  Also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use</b>
           and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-finline-functions-called-once</b>
           Consider all "static" functions called once for inlining into
           their caller even if they are not marked "inline".  If a call
           to a given function is integrated, then the function is not
           output as assembler code in its own right.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O1</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3 </b>and <b>-Os</b>, but not <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fearly-inlining</b>
           Inline functions marked by "always_inline" and functions
           whose body seems smaller than the function call overhead
           early before doing <b>-fprofile-generate </b>instrumentation and
           real inlining pass.  Doing so makes profiling significantly
           cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs having large
           chains of nested wrapper functions.

           Enabled by default.

       <b>-fipa-sra</b>
           Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates,
           removal of unused parameters and replacement of parameters
           passed by reference by parameters passed by value.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3 </b>and <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-finline-limit=</b><i>n</i>
           By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be
           inlined.  This flag allows coarse control of this limit.  <i>n</i>
           is the size of functions that can be inlined in number of
           pseudo instructions.

           Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters,
           which may be specified individually by using <b>--param</b>
           <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>.  The <b>-finline-limit=</b><i>n</i> option sets some of these
           parameters as follows:

           <b>max-inline-insns-single</b>
               is set to <i>n</i>/2.

           <b>max-inline-insns-auto</b>
               is set to <i>n</i>/2.

           See below for a documentation of the individual parameters
           controlling inlining and for the defaults of these
           parameters.

           <i>Note:</i> there may be no value to <b>-finline-limit </b>that results in
           default behavior.

           <i>Note:</i> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular
           context, an abstract measurement of function's size.  In no
           way does it represent a count of assembly instructions and as
           such its exact meaning might change from one release to an
           another.

       <b>-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</b>
           This is a more fine-grained version of
           <b>-fkeep-inline-functions</b>, which applies only to functions that
           are declared using the "dllexport" attribute or declspec.

       <b>-fkeep-inline-functions</b>
           In C, emit "static" functions that are declared "inline" into
           the object file, even if the function has been inlined into
           all of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions
           using the "extern inline" extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit
           any and all inline functions into the object file.

       <b>-fkeep-static-functions</b>
           Emit "static" functions into the object file, even if the
           function is never used.

       <b>-fkeep-static-consts</b>
           Emit variables declared "static const" when optimization
           isn't turned on, even if the variables aren't referenced.

           GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the
           compiler to check if a variable is referenced, regardless of
           whether or not optimization is turned on, use the
           <b>-fno-keep-static-consts </b>option.

       <b>-fmerge-constants</b>
           Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and
           floating-point constants) across compilation units.

           This option is the default for optimized compilation if the
           assembler and linker support it.  Use <b>-fno-merge-constants </b>to
           inhibit this behavior.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fmerge-all-constants</b>
           Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

           This option implies <b>-fmerge-constants</b>.  In addition to
           <b>-fmerge-constants </b>this considers e.g. even constant
           initialized arrays or initialized constant variables with
           integral or floating-point types.  Languages like C or C++
           require each variable, including multiple instances of the
           same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
           so using this option results in non-conforming behavior.

       <b>-fmodulo-sched</b>
           Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first
           scheduling pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and
           reorders their instructions by overlapping different
           iterations.

       <b>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves</b>
           Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with
           register moves allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-
           dependences edges are deleted, which triggers the generation
           of reg-moves based on the life-range analysis.  This option
           is effective only with <b>-fmodulo-sched </b>enabled.

       <b>-fno-branch-count-reg</b>
           Disable the optimization pass that scans for opportunities to
           use "decrement and branch" instructions on a count register
           instead of instruction sequences that decrement a register,
           compare it against zero, and then branch based upon the
           result.  This option is only meaningful on architectures that
           support such instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, IA-64
           and S/390.  Note that the <b>-fno-branch-count-reg </b>option
           doesn't remove the decrement and branch instructions from the
           generated instruction stream introduced by other optimization
           passes.

           The default is <b>-fbranch-count-reg </b>at <b>-O1 </b>and higher, except
           for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fno-function-cse</b>
           Do not put function addresses in registers; make each
           instruction that calls a constant function contain the
           function's address explicitly.

           This option results in less efficient code, but some strange
           hacks that alter the assembler output may be confused by the
           optimizations performed when this option is not used.

           The default is <b>-ffunction-cse</b>

       <b>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</b>
           If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts
           variables that are initialized to zero into BSS.  This can
           save space in the resulting code.

           This option turns off this behavior because some programs
           explicitly rely on variables going to the data
           section---e.g., so that the resulting executable can find the
           beginning of that section and/or make assumptions based on
           that.

           The default is <b>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</b>.

       <b>-fthread-jumps</b>
           Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches to
           a location where another comparison subsumed by the first is
           found.  If so, the first branch is redirected to either the
           destination of the second branch or a point immediately
           following it, depending on whether the condition is known to
           be true or false.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fsplit-wide-types</b>
           When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as
           "long long" on a 32-bit system, split the registers apart and
           allocate them independently.  This normally generates better
           code for those types, but may make debugging more difficult.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fcse-follow-jumps</b>
           In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump
           instructions when the target of the jump is not reached by
           any other path.  For example, when CSE encounters an "if"
           statement with an "else" clause, CSE follows the jump when
           the condition tested is false.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fcse-skip-blocks</b>
           This is similar to <b>-fcse-follow-jumps</b>, but causes CSE to
           follow jumps that conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE
           encounters a simple "if" statement with no else clause,
           <b>-fcse-skip-blocks </b>causes CSE to follow the jump around the
           body of the "if".

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop</b>
           Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop
           optimizations are performed.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fgcse</b>
           Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.  This
           pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.

           <i>Note:</i> When compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC
           extension, you may get better run-time performance if you
           disable the global common subexpression elimination pass by
           adding <b>-fno-gcse </b>to the command line.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fgcse-lm</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-lm </b>is enabled, global common subexpression
           elimination attempts to move loads that are only killed by
           stores into themselves.  This allows a loop containing a
           load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside the loop,
           and a copy/store within the loop.

           Enabled by default when <b>-fgcse </b>is enabled.

       <b>-fgcse-sm</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-sm </b>is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
           global common subexpression elimination.  This pass attempts
           to move stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with
           <b>-fgcse-lm</b>, loops containing a load/store sequence can be
           changed to a load before the loop and a store after the loop.

           Not enabled at any optimization level.

       <b>-fgcse-las</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-las </b>is enabled, the global common subexpression
           elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after
           stores to the same memory location (both partial and full
           redundancies).

           Not enabled at any optimization level.

       <b>-fgcse-after-reload</b>
           When <b>-fgcse-after-reload </b>is enabled, a redundant load
           elimination pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of
           this pass is to clean up redundant spilling.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-faggressive-loop-optimizations</b>
           This option tells the loop optimizer to use language
           constraints to derive bounds for the number of iterations of
           a loop.  This assumes that loop code does not invoke
           undefined behavior by for example causing signed integer
           overflows or out-of-bound array accesses.  The bounds for the
           number of iterations of a loop are used to guide loop
           unrolling and peeling and loop exit test optimizations.  This
           option is enabled by default.

       <b>-funconstrained-commons</b>
           This option tells the compiler that variables declared in
           common blocks (e.g. Fortran) may later be overridden with
           longer trailing arrays. This prevents certain optimizations
           that depend on knowing the array bounds.

       <b>-fcrossjumping</b>
           Perform cross-jumping transformation.  This transformation
           unifies equivalent code and saves code size.  The resulting
           code may or may not perform better than without cross-
           jumping.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fauto-inc-dec</b>
           Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory
           accesses.  This pass is always skipped on architectures that
           do not have instructions to support this.  Enabled by default
           at <b>-O </b>and higher on architectures that support this.

       <b>-fdce</b>
           Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on RTL.  Enabled by
           default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fdse</b>
           Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on RTL.  Enabled by
           default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fif-conversion</b>
           Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less
           equivalents.  This includes use of conditional moves, min,
           max, set flags and abs instructions, and some tricks doable
           by standard arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution on
           chips where it is available is controlled by
           <b>-fif-conversion2</b>.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, but not with <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fif-conversion2</b>
           Use conditional execution (where available) to transform
           conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, but not with <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fdeclone-ctor-dtor</b>
           The C++ ABI requires multiple entry points for constructors
           and destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a complete
           object, and one for a virtual destructor that calls operator
           delete afterwards.  For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the
           base and complete variants are clones, which means two copies
           of the function.  With this option, the base and complete
           variants are changed to be thunks that call a common
           implementation.

           Enabled by <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</b>
           Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers,
           and that no code or data element resides at address zero.
           This option enables simple constant folding optimizations at
           all optimization levels.  In addition, other optimization
           passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow
           analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers;
           these assume that a memory access to address zero always
           results in a trap, so that if a pointer is checked after it
           has already been dereferenced, it cannot be null.

           Note however that in some environments this assumption is not
           true.  Use <b>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks </b>to disable this
           optimization for programs that depend on that behavior.

           This option is enabled by default on most targets.  On Nios
           II ELF, it defaults to off.  On AVR, CR16, and MSP430, this
           option is completely disabled.

           Passes that use the dataflow information are enabled
           independently at different optimization levels.

       <b>-fdevirtualize</b>
           Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct
           calls.  This is done both within a procedure and
           interprocedurally as part of indirect inlining
           (<b>-findirect-inlining</b>) and interprocedural constant
           propagation (<b>-fipa-cp</b>).  Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fdevirtualize-speculatively</b>
           Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to speculative
           direct calls.  Based on the analysis of the type inheritance
           graph, determine for a given call the set of likely targets.
           If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change the call
           into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect
           calls.  The speculative calls enable more optimizations, such
           as inlining.  When they seem useless after further
           optimization, they are converted back into original form.

       <b>-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans</b>
           Stream extra information needed for aggressive
           devirtualization when running the link-time optimizer in
           local transformation mode.  This option enables more
           devirtualization but significantly increases the size of
           streamed data. For this reason it is disabled by default.

       <b>-fexpensive-optimizations</b>
           Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively
           expensive.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-free</b>
           Attempt to remove redundant extension instructions.  This is
           especially helpful for the x86-64 architecture, which
           implicitly zero-extends in 64-bit registers after writing to
           their lower 32-bit half.

           Enabled for Alpha, AArch64 and x86 at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fno-lifetime-dse</b>
           In C++ the value of an object is only affected by changes
           within its lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object
           has an indeterminate value, and any changes during the
           lifetime of the object are dead when the object is destroyed.
           Normally dead store elimination will take advantage of this;
           if your code relies on the value of the object storage
           persisting beyond the lifetime of the object, you can use
           this flag to disable this optimization.  To preserve stores
           before the constructor starts (e.g. because your operator new
           clears the object storage) but still treat the object as dead
           after the destructor you, can use <b>-flifetime-dse=1</b>.  The
           default behavior can be explicitly selected with
           <b>-flifetime-dse=2</b>.  <b>-flifetime-dse=0 </b>is equivalent to
           <b>-fno-lifetime-dse</b>.

       <b>-flive-range-shrinkage</b>
           Attempt to decrease register pressure through register live
           range shrinkage.  This is helpful for fast processors with
           small or moderate size register sets.

       <b>-fira-algorithm=</b><i>algorithm</i>
           Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated
           register allocator.  The <i>algorithm</i> argument can be <b>priority</b>,
           which specifies Chow's priority coloring, or <b>CB</b>, which
           specifies Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring
           is not implemented for all architectures, but for those
           targets that do support it, it is the default because it
           generates better code.

       <b>-fira-region=</b><i>region</i>
           Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.
           The <i>region</i> argument should be one of the following:

           <b>all </b>Use all loops as register allocation regions.  This can
               give the best results for machines with a small and/or
               irregular register set.

           <b>mixed</b>
               Use all loops except for loops with small register
               pressure as the regions.  This value usually gives the
               best results in most cases and for most architectures,
               and is enabled by default when compiling with
               optimization for speed (<b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, ...).

           <b>one </b>Use all functions as a single region.  This typically
               results in the smallest code size, and is enabled by
               default for <b>-Os </b>or <b>-O0</b>.

       <b>-fira-hoist-pressure</b>
           Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in the code hoisting
           pass for decisions to hoist expressions.  This option usually
           results in smaller code, but it can slow the compiler down.

           This option is enabled at level <b>-Os </b>for all targets.

       <b>-fira-loop-pressure</b>
           Use IRA to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions
           to move loop invariants.  This option usually results in
           generation of faster and smaller code on machines with large
           register files (&gt;= 32 registers), but it can slow the
           compiler down.

           This option is enabled at level <b>-O3 </b>for some targets.

       <b>-fno-ira-share-save-slots</b>
           Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used hard
           registers living through a call.  Each hard register gets a
           separate stack slot, and as a result function stack frames
           are larger.

       <b>-fno-ira-share-spill-slots</b>
           Disable sharing of stack slots allocated for pseudo-
           registers.  Each pseudo-register that does not get a hard
           register gets a separate stack slot, and as a result function
           stack frames are larger.

       <b>-flra-remat</b>
           Enable CFG-sensitive rematerialization in LRA.  Instead of
           loading values of spilled pseudos, LRA tries to rematerialize
           (recalculate) values if it is profitable.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fdelayed-branch</b>
           If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
           instructions to exploit instruction slots available after
           delayed branch instructions.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, but not at <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fschedule-insns</b>
           If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
           instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required
           data being unavailable.  This helps machines that have slow
           floating point or memory load instructions by allowing other
           instructions to be issued until the result of the load or
           floating-point instruction is required.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-fschedule-insns2</b>
           Similar to <b>-fschedule-insns</b>, but requests an additional pass
           of instruction scheduling after register allocation has been
           done.  This is especially useful on machines with a
           relatively small number of registers and where memory load
           instructions take more than one cycle.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fno-sched-interblock</b>
           Disable instruction scheduling across basic blocks, which is
           normally enabled when scheduling before register allocation,
           i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-fno-sched-spec</b>
           Disable speculative motion of non-load instructions, which is
           normally enabled when scheduling before register allocation,
           i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-fsched-pressure</b>
           Enable register pressure sensitive insn scheduling before
           register allocation.  This only makes sense when scheduling
           before register allocation is enabled, i.e. with
           <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.  Usage of this option
           can improve the generated code and decrease its size by
           preventing register pressure increase above the number of
           available hard registers and subsequent spills in register
           allocation.

       <b>-fsched-spec-load</b>
           Allow speculative motion of some load instructions.  This
           only makes sense when scheduling before register allocation,
           i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-fsched-spec-load-dangerous</b>
           Allow speculative motion of more load instructions.  This
           only makes sense when scheduling before register allocation,
           i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns</b>
       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns=</b><i>n</i>
           Define how many insns (if any) can be moved prematurely from
           the queue of stalled insns into the ready list during the
           second scheduling pass.  <b>-fno-sched-stalled-insns </b>means that
           no insns are moved prematurely, <b>-fsched-stalled-insns=0 </b>means
           there is no limit on how many queued insns can be moved
           prematurely.  <b>-fsched-stalled-insns </b>without a value is
           equivalent to <b>-fsched-stalled-insns=1</b>.

       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep</b>
       <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=</b><i>n</i>
           Define how many insn groups (cycles) are examined for a
           dependency on a stalled insn that is a candidate for
           premature removal from the queue of stalled insns.  This has
           an effect only during the second scheduling pass, and only if
           <b>-fsched-stalled-insns </b>is used.  <b>-fno-sched-stalled-insns-dep</b>
           is equivalent to <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=0</b>.
           <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep </b>without a value is equivalent to
           <b>-fsched-stalled-insns-dep=1</b>.

       <b>-fsched2-use-superblocks</b>
           When scheduling after register allocation, use superblock
           scheduling.  This allows motion across basic block
           boundaries, resulting in faster schedules.  This option is
           experimental, as not all machine descriptions used by GCC
           model the CPU closely enough to avoid unreliable results from
           the algorithm.

           This only makes sense when scheduling after register
           allocation, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns2 </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-fsched-group-heuristic</b>
           Enable the group heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic
           favors the instruction that belongs to a schedule group.
           This is enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e.
           with <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or <b>-fschedule-insns2 </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or
           higher.

       <b>-fsched-critical-path-heuristic</b>
           Enable the critical-path heuristic in the scheduler.  This
           heuristic favors instructions on the critical path.  This is
           enabled by default when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with
           <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or <b>-fschedule-insns2 </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-fsched-spec-insn-heuristic</b>
           Enable the speculative instruction heuristic in the
           scheduler.  This heuristic favors speculative instructions
           with greater dependency weakness.  This is enabled by default
           when scheduling is enabled, i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or
           <b>-fschedule-insns2 </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-fsched-rank-heuristic</b>
           Enable the rank heuristic in the scheduler.  This heuristic
           favors the instruction belonging to a basic block with
           greater size or frequency.  This is enabled by default when
           scheduling is enabled, i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or
           <b>-fschedule-insns2 </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-fsched-last-insn-heuristic</b>
           Enable the last-instruction heuristic in the scheduler.  This
           heuristic favors the instruction that is less dependent on
           the last instruction scheduled.  This is enabled by default
           when scheduling is enabled, i.e. with <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or
           <b>-fschedule-insns2 </b>or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-fsched-dep-count-heuristic</b>
           Enable the dependent-count heuristic in the scheduler.  This
           heuristic favors the instruction that has more instructions
           depending on it.  This is enabled by default when scheduling
           is enabled, i.e.  with <b>-fschedule-insns </b>or <b>-fschedule-insns2</b>
           or at <b>-O2 </b>or higher.

       <b>-freschedule-modulo-scheduled-loops</b>
           Modulo scheduling is performed before traditional scheduling.
           If a loop is modulo scheduled, later scheduling passes may
           change its schedule.  Use this option to control that
           behavior.

       <b>-fselective-scheduling</b>
           Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
           Selective scheduling runs instead of the first scheduler
           pass.

       <b>-fselective-scheduling2</b>
           Schedule instructions using selective scheduling algorithm.
           Selective scheduling runs instead of the second scheduler
           pass.

       <b>-fsel-sched-pipelining</b>
           Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during
           selective scheduling.  This option has no effect unless one
           of <b>-fselective-scheduling </b>or <b>-fselective-scheduling2 </b>is
           turned on.

       <b>-fsel-sched-pipelining-outer-loops</b>
           When pipelining loops during selective scheduling, also
           pipeline outer loops.  This option has no effect unless
           <b>-fsel-sched-pipelining </b>is turned on.

       <b>-fsemantic-interposition</b>
           Some object formats, like ELF, allow interposing of symbols
           by the dynamic linker.  This means that for symbols exported
           from the DSO, the compiler cannot perform interprocedural
           propagation, inlining and other optimizations in anticipation
           that the function or variable in question may change. While
           this feature is useful, for example, to rewrite memory
           allocation functions by a debugging implementation, it is
           expensive in the terms of code quality.  With
           <b>-fno-semantic-interposition </b>the compiler assumes that if
           interposition happens for functions the overwriting function
           will have precisely the same semantics (and side effects).
           Similarly if interposition happens for variables, the
           constructor of the variable will be the same. The flag has no
           effect for functions explicitly declared inline (where it is
           never allowed for interposition to change semantics) and for
           symbols explicitly declared weak.

       <b>-fshrink-wrap</b>
           Emit function prologues only before parts of the function
           that need it, rather than at the top of the function.  This
           flag is enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fshrink-wrap-separate</b>
           Shrink-wrap separate parts of the prologue and epilogue
           separately, so that those parts are only executed when
           needed.  This option is on by default, but has no effect
           unless <b>-fshrink-wrap </b>is also turned on and the target
           supports this.

       <b>-fcaller-saves</b>
           Enable allocation of values to registers that are clobbered
           by function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and
           restore the registers around such calls.  Such allocation is
           done only when it seems to result in better code.

           This option is always enabled by default on certain machines,
           usually those which have no call-preserved registers to use
           instead.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fcombine-stack-adjustments</b>
           Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory
           references and then tries to find ways to combine them.

           Enabled by default at <b>-O1 </b>and higher.

       <b>-fipa-ra</b>
           Use caller save registers for allocation if those registers
           are not used by any called function.  In that case it is not
           necessary to save and restore them around calls.  This is
           only possible if called functions are part of same
           compilation unit as current function and they are compiled
           before it.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>, however the option is
           disabled if generated code will be instrumented for profiling
           (<b>-p</b>, or <b>-pg</b>) or if callee's register usage cannot be known
           exactly (this happens on targets that do not expose prologues
           and epilogues in RTL).

       <b>-fconserve-stack</b>
           Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler attempts to
           use less stack space, even if that makes the program slower.
           This option implies setting the <b>large-stack-frame </b>parameter
           to 100 and the <b>large-stack-frame-growth </b>parameter to 400.

       <b>-ftree-reassoc</b>
           Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by
           default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fcode-hoisting</b>
           Perform code hoisting.  Code hoisting tries to move the
           evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the
           function exit as early as possible.  This is especially
           useful as a code size optimization, but it often helps for
           code speed as well.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b>
           and higher.

       <b>-ftree-pre</b>
           Perform partial redundancy elimination (PRE) on trees.  This
           flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2 </b>and <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-ftree-partial-pre</b>
           Make partial redundancy elimination (PRE) more aggressive.
           This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-ftree-forwprop</b>
           Perform forward propagation on trees.  This flag is enabled
           by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-ftree-fre</b>
           Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The
           difference between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers
           expressions that are computed on all paths leading to the
           redundant computation.  This analysis is faster than PRE,
           though it exposes fewer redundancies.  This flag is enabled
           by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-ftree-phiprop</b>
           Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.
           This pass is enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fhoist-adjacent-loads</b>
           Speculatively hoist loads from both branches of an if-then-
           else if the loads are from adjacent locations in the same
           structure and the target architecture has a conditional move
           instruction.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2 </b>and
           higher.

       <b>-ftree-copy-prop</b>
           Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates
           unnecessary copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default
           at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fipa-pure-const</b>
           Discover which functions are pure or constant.  Enabled by
           default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fipa-reference</b>
           Discover which static variables do not escape the compilation
           unit.  Enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fipa-reference-addressable</b>
           Discover read-only, write-only and non-addressable static
           variables.  Enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fipa-stack-alignment</b>
           Reduce stack alignment on call sites if possible.  Enabled by
           default.

       <b>-fipa-pta</b>
           Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural
           modification and reference analysis.  This option can cause
           excessive memory and compile-time usage on large compilation
           units.  It is not enabled by default at any optimization
           level.

       <b>-fipa-profile</b>
           Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions
           called only from cold functions are marked as cold. Also
           functions executed once (such as "cold", "noreturn", static
           constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold functions
           and loop less parts of functions executed once are then
           optimized for size.  Enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fipa-cp</b>
           Perform interprocedural constant propagation.  This
           optimization analyzes the program to determine when values
           passed to functions are constants and then optimizes
           accordingly.  This optimization can substantially increase
           performance if the application has constants passed to
           functions.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b>, <b>-Os </b>and
           <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fipa-cp-clone</b>
           Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant
           propagation stronger.  When enabled, interprocedural constant
           propagation performs function cloning when externally visible
           function can be called with constant arguments.  Because this
           optimization can create multiple copies of functions, it may
           significantly increase code size (see <b>--param</b>
           <b>ipcp-unit-growth=</b><i>value</i>).  This flag is enabled by default at
           <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fipa-bit-cp</b>
           When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant
           propagation. This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2 </b>and by
           <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.  It requires that <b>-fipa-cp</b>
           is enabled.

       <b>-fipa-vrp</b>
           When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of value
           ranges. This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b>. It requires
           that <b>-fipa-cp </b>is enabled.

       <b>-fipa-icf</b>
           Perform Identical Code Folding for functions and read-only
           variables.  The optimization reduces code size and may
           disturb unwind stacks by replacing a function by equivalent
           one with a different name. The optimization works more
           effectively with link-time optimization enabled.

           Although the behavior is similar to the Gold Linker's ICF
           optimization, GCC ICF works on different levels and thus the
           optimizations are not same - there are equivalences that are
           found only by GCC and equivalences found only by Gold.

           This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2 </b>and <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-flive-patching=</b><i>level</i>
           Control GCC's optimizations to produce output suitable for
           live-patching.

           If the compiler's optimization uses a function's body or
           information extracted from its body to optimize/change
           another function, the latter is called an impacted function
           of the former.  If a function is patched, its impacted
           functions should be patched too.

           The impacted functions are determined by the compiler's
           interprocedural optimizations.  For example, a caller is
           impacted when inlining a function into its caller, cloning a
           function and changing its caller to call this new clone, or
           extracting a function's pureness/constness information to
           optimize its direct or indirect callers, etc.

           Usually, the more IPA optimizations enabled, the larger the
           number of impacted functions for each function.  In order to
           control the number of impacted functions and more easily
           compute the list of impacted function, IPA optimizations can
           be partially enabled at two different levels.

           The <i>level</i> argument should be one of the following:

           <b>inline-clone</b>
               Only enable inlining and cloning optimizations, which
               includes inlining, cloning, interprocedural scalar
               replacement of aggregates and partial inlining.  As a
               result, when patching a function, all its callers and its
               clones' callers are impacted, therefore need to be
               patched as well.

               <b>-flive-patching=inline-clone </b>disables the following
               optimization flags: <b>-fwhole-program  -fipa-pta</b>
               <b>-fipa-reference  -fipa-ra -fipa-icf  -fipa-icf-functions</b>
               <b>-fipa-icf-variables -fipa-bit-cp  -fipa-vrp</b>
               <b>-fipa-pure-const  -fipa-reference-addressable</b>
               <b>-fipa-stack-alignment</b>

           <b>inline-only-static</b>
               Only enable inlining of static functions.  As a result,
               when patching a static function, all its callers are
               impacted and so need to be patched as well.

               In addition to all the flags that
               <b>-flive-patching=inline-clone </b>disables,
               <b>-flive-patching=inline-only-static </b>disables the following
               additional optimization flags: <b>-fipa-cp-clone  -fipa-sra</b>
               <b>-fpartial-inlining  -fipa-cp</b>

           When <b>-flive-patching </b>is specified without any value, the
           default value is <i>inline-clone</i>.

           This flag is disabled by default.

           Note that <b>-flive-patching </b>is not supported with link-time
           optimization (<b>-flto</b>).

       <b>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference</b>
           Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due
           to dereferencing a null pointer.  Isolate those paths from
           the main control flow and turn the statement with erroneous
           or undefined behavior into a trap.  This flag is enabled by
           default at <b>-O2 </b>and higher and depends on
           <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks </b>also being enabled.

       <b>-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute</b>
           Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due
           to a null value being used in a way forbidden by a
           "returns_nonnull" or "nonnull" attribute.  Isolate those
           paths from the main control flow and turn the statement with
           erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap.  This is not
           currently enabled, but may be enabled by <b>-O2 </b>in the future.

       <b>-ftree-sink</b>
           Perform forward store motion on trees.  This flag is enabled
           by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-ftree-bit-ccp</b>
           Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees
           and propagate pointer alignment information.  This pass only
           operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
           at <b>-O1 </b>and higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.  It requires that
           <b>-ftree-ccp </b>is enabled.

       <b>-ftree-ccp</b>
           Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (CCP) on
           trees.  This pass only operates on local scalar variables and
           is enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fssa-backprop</b>
           Propagate information about uses of a value up the definition
           chain in order to simplify the definitions.  For example,
           this pass strips sign operations if the sign of a value never
           matters.  The flag is enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fssa-phiopt</b>
           Perform pattern matching on SSA PHI nodes to optimize
           conditional code.  This pass is enabled by default at <b>-O1 </b>and
           higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-ftree-switch-conversion</b>
           Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
           initializations from a scalar array.  This flag is enabled by
           default at <b>-O2 </b>and higher.

       <b>-ftree-tail-merge</b>
           Look for identical code sequences.  When found, replace one
           with a jump to the other.  This optimization is known as tail
           merging or cross jumping.  This flag is enabled by default at
           <b>-O2 </b>and higher.  The compilation time in this pass can be
           limited using <b>max-tail-merge-comparisons </b>parameter and <b>max-</b>
           <b>tail-merge-iterations </b>parameter.

       <b>-ftree-dce</b>
           Perform dead code elimination (DCE) on trees.  This flag is
           enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-ftree-builtin-call-dce</b>
           Perform conditional dead code elimination (DCE) for calls to
           built-in functions that may set "errno" but are otherwise
           free of side effects.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O2</b>
           and higher if <b>-Os </b>is not also specified.

       <b>-ftree-dominator-opts</b>
           Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
           propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and
           expression simplification) based on a dominator tree
           traversal.  This also performs jump threading (to reduce
           jumps to jumps). This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and
           higher.

       <b>-ftree-dse</b>
           Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store
           is a store into a memory location that is later overwritten
           by another store without any intervening loads.  In this case
           the earlier store can be deleted.  This flag is enabled by
           default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-ftree-ch</b>
           Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial
           since it increases effectiveness of code motion
           optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag is enabled
           by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.  It is not enabled for <b>-Os</b>,
           since it usually increases code size.

       <b>-ftree-loop-optimize</b>
           Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by
           default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-ftree-loop-linear</b>
       <b>-floop-strip-mine</b>
       <b>-floop-block</b>
           Perform loop nest optimizations.  Same as
           <b>-floop-nest-optimize</b>.  To use this code transformation, GCC
           has to be configured with <b>--with-isl </b>to enable the Graphite
           loop transformation infrastructure.

       <b>-fgraphite-identity</b>
           Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every
           SCoP we generate the polyhedral representation and transform
           it back to gimple.  Using <b>-fgraphite-identity </b>we can check
           the costs or benefits of the GIMPLE -&gt; GRAPHITE -&gt; GIMPLE
           transformation.  Some minimal optimizations are also
           performed by the code generator isl, like index splitting and
           dead code elimination in loops.

       <b>-floop-nest-optimize</b>
           Enable the isl based loop nest optimizer.  This is a generic
           loop nest optimizer based on the Pluto optimization
           algorithms.  It calculates a loop structure optimized for
           data-locality and parallelism.  This option is experimental.

       <b>-floop-parallelize-all</b>
           Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops
           that can be parallelized.  Parallelize all the loops that can
           be analyzed to not contain loop carried dependences without
           checking that it is profitable to parallelize the loops.

       <b>-ftree-coalesce-vars</b>
           While transforming the program out of the SSA representation,
           attempt to reduce copying by coalescing versions of different
           user-defined variables, instead of just compiler temporaries.
           This may severely limit the ability to debug an optimized
           program compiled with <b>-fno-var-tracking-assignments</b>.  In the
           negated form, this flag prevents SSA coalescing of user
           variables.  This option is enabled by default if optimization
           is enabled, and it does very little otherwise.

       <b>-ftree-loop-if-convert</b>
           Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops
           to branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-
           flow from the innermost loops in order to improve the ability
           of the vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is
           enabled by default if vectorization is enabled.

       <b>-ftree-loop-distribution</b>
           Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache
           performance on big loop bodies and allow further loop
           optimizations, like parallelization or vectorization, to take
           place.  For example, the loop

                   DO I = 1, N
                     A(I) = B(I) + C
                     D(I) = E(I) * F
                   ENDDO

           is transformed to

                   DO I = 1, N
                      A(I) = B(I) + C
                   ENDDO
                   DO I = 1, N
                      D(I) = E(I) * F
                   ENDDO

           This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled
           by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-ftree-loop-distribute-patterns</b>
           Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code
           generated with calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by
           default at <b>-O3</b>, and by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

           This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates
           a call to memset zero.  For example, the loop

                   DO I = 1, N
                     A(I) = 0
                     B(I) = A(I) + I
                   ENDDO

           is transformed to

                   DO I = 1, N
                      A(I) = 0
                   ENDDO
                   DO I = 1, N
                      B(I) = A(I) + I
                   ENDDO

           and the initialization loop is transformed into a call to
           memset zero.  This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.  It is
           also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-floop-interchange</b>
           Perform loop interchange outside of graphite.  This flag can
           improve cache performance on loop nest and allow further loop
           optimizations, like vectorization, to take place.  For
           example, the loop

                   for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
                     for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
                       for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
                         c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];

           is transformed to

                   for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++)
                     for (int k = 0; k &lt; N; k++)
                       for (int j = 0; j &lt; N; j++)
                         c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];

           This flag is enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled
           by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-floop-unroll-and-jam</b>
           Apply unroll and jam transformations on feasible loops.  In a
           loop nest this unrolls the outer loop by some factor and
           fuses the resulting multiple inner loops.  This flag is
           enabled by default at <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by
           <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-ftree-loop-im</b>
           Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only
           invariants that are hard to handle at RTL level (function
           calls, operations that expand to nontrivial sequences of
           insns).  With <b>-funswitch-loops </b>it also moves operands of
           conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can
           use just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.
           The pass also includes store motion.

       <b>-ftree-loop-ivcanon</b>
           Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops
           for which determining number of iterations requires
           complicated analysis.  Later optimizations then may determine
           the number easily.  Useful especially in connection with
           unrolling.

       <b>-ftree-scev-cprop</b>
           Perform final value replacement.  If a variable is modified
           in a loop in such a way that its value when exiting the loop
           can be determined using only its initial value and the number
           of loop iterations, replace uses of the final value by such a
           computation, provided it is sufficiently cheap.  This reduces
           data dependencies and may allow further simplifications.
           Enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-fivopts</b>
           Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction,
           induction variable merging and induction variable
           elimination) on trees.

       <b>-ftree-parallelize-loops=n</b>
           Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run
           in n threads.  This is only possible for loops whose
           iterations are independent and can be arbitrarily reordered.
           The optimization is only profitable on multiprocessor
           machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive, rather than
           constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option implies
           <b>-pthread</b>, and thus is only supported on targets that have
           support for <b>-pthread</b>.

       <b>-ftree-pta</b>
           Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This
           flag is enabled by default at <b>-O1 </b>and higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-ftree-sra</b>
           Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces
           structure references with scalars to prevent committing
           structures to memory too early.  This flag is enabled by
           default at <b>-O1 </b>and higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fstore-merging</b>
           Perform merging of narrow stores to consecutive memory
           addresses.  This pass merges contiguous stores of immediate
           values narrower than a word into fewer wider stores to reduce
           the number of instructions.  This is enabled by default at
           <b>-O2 </b>and higher as well as <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-ftree-ter</b>
           Perform temporary expression replacement during the
           SSA-&gt;normal phase.  Single use/single def temporaries are
           replaced at their use location with their defining
           expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the
           expanders much more complex trees to work on resulting in
           better RTL generation.  This is enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and
           higher.

       <b>-ftree-slsr</b>
           Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees.  This
           recognizes related expressions involving multiplications and
           replaces them by less expensive calculations when possible.
           This is enabled by default at <b>-O </b>and higher.

       <b>-ftree-vectorize</b>
           Perform vectorization on trees. This flag enables
           <b>-ftree-loop-vectorize </b>and <b>-ftree-slp-vectorize </b>if not
           explicitly specified.

       <b>-ftree-loop-vectorize</b>
           Perform loop vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by
           default at <b>-O3 </b>and by <b>-ftree-vectorize</b>, <b>-fprofile-use</b>, and
           <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-ftree-slp-vectorize</b>
           Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is
           enabled by default at <b>-O3 </b>and by <b>-ftree-vectorize</b>,
           <b>-fprofile-use</b>, and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fvect-cost-model=</b><i>model</i>
           Alter the cost model used for vectorization.  The <i>model</i>
           argument should be one of <b>unlimited</b>, <b>dynamic </b>or <b>cheap</b>.  With
           the <b>unlimited </b>model the vectorized code-path is assumed to be
           profitable while with the <b>dynamic </b>model a runtime check
           guards the vectorized code-path to enable it only for
           iteration counts that will likely execute faster than when
           executing the original scalar loop.  The <b>cheap </b>model disables
           vectorization of loops where doing so would be cost
           prohibitive for example due to required runtime checks for
           data dependence or alignment but otherwise is equal to the
           <b>dynamic </b>model.  The default cost model depends on other
           optimization flags and is either <b>dynamic </b>or <b>cheap</b>.

       <b>-fsimd-cost-model=</b><i>model</i>
           Alter the cost model used for vectorization of loops marked
           with the OpenMP simd directive.  The <i>model</i> argument should be
           one of <b>unlimited</b>, <b>dynamic</b>, <b>cheap</b>.  All values of <i>model</i> have
           the same meaning as described in <b>-fvect-cost-model </b>and by
           default a cost model defined with <b>-fvect-cost-model </b>is used.

       <b>-ftree-vrp</b>
           Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to
           the constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges
           of values are propagated.  This allows the optimizers to
           remove unnecessary range checks like array bound checks and
           null pointer checks.  This is enabled by default at <b>-O2 </b>and
           higher.  Null pointer check elimination is only done if
           <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks </b>is enabled.

       <b>-fsplit-paths</b>
           Split paths leading to loop backedges.  This can improve dead
           code elimination and common subexpression elimination.  This
           is enabled by default at <b>-O3 </b>and above.

       <b>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</b>
           Enables expression of values of induction variables in later
           iterations of the unrolled loop using the value in the first
           iteration.  This breaks long dependency chains, thus
           improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.

           A combination of <b>-fweb </b>and CSE is often sufficient to obtain
           the same effect.  However, that is not reliable in cases
           where the loop body is more complicated than a single basic
           block.  It also does not work at all on some architectures
           due to restrictions in the CSE pass.

           This optimization is enabled by default.

       <b>-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller</b>
           With this option, the compiler creates multiple copies of
           some local variables when unrolling a loop, which can result
           in superior code.

       <b>-fpartial-inlining</b>
           Inline parts of functions.  This option has any effect only
           when inlining itself is turned on by the <b>-finline-functions</b>
           or <b>-finline-small-functions </b>options.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fpredictive-commoning</b>
           Perform predictive commoning optimization, i.e., reusing
           computations (especially memory loads and stores) performed
           in previous iterations of loops.

           This option is enabled at level <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by
           <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</b>
           If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to
           prefetch memory to improve the performance of loops that
           access large arrays.

           This option may generate better or worse code; results are
           highly dependent on the structure of loops within the source
           code.

           Disabled at level <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fno-printf-return-value</b>
           Do not substitute constants for known return value of
           formatted output functions such as "sprintf", "snprintf",
           "vsprintf", and "vsnprintf" (but not "printf" of "fprintf").
           This transformation allows GCC to optimize or even eliminate
           branches based on the known return value of these functions
           called with arguments that are either constant, or whose
           values are known to be in a range that makes determining the
           exact return value possible.  For example, when
           <b>-fprintf-return-value </b>is in effect, both the branch and the
           body of the "if" statement (but not the call to "snprint")
           can be optimized away when "i" is a 32-bit or smaller integer
           because the return value is guaranteed to be at most 8.

                   char buf[9];
                   if (snprintf (buf, "%08x", i) &gt;= sizeof buf)
                     ...

           The <b>-fprintf-return-value </b>option relies on other
           optimizations and yields best results with <b>-O2 </b>and above.  It
           works in tandem with the <b>-Wformat-overflow </b>and
           <b>-Wformat-truncation </b>options.  The <b>-fprintf-return-value</b>
           option is enabled by default.

       <b>-fno-peephole</b>
       <b>-fno-peephole2</b>
           Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.  The
           difference between <b>-fno-peephole </b>and <b>-fno-peephole2 </b>is in how
           they are implemented in the compiler; some targets use one,
           some use the other, a few use both.

           <b>-fpeephole </b>is enabled by default.  <b>-fpeephole2 </b>enabled at
           levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fno-guess-branch-probability</b>
           Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.

           GCC uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
           not provided by profiling feedback (<b>-fprofile-arcs</b>).  These
           heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some
           branch probabilities are specified by "__builtin_expect",
           then the heuristics are used to guess branch probabilities
           for the rest of the control flow graph, taking the
           "__builtin_expect" info into account.  The interactions
           between the heuristics and "__builtin_expect" can be complex,
           and in some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics
           so that the effects of "__builtin_expect" are easier to
           understand.

           It is also possible to specify expected probability of the
           expression with "__builtin_expect_with_probability" built-in
           function.

           The default is <b>-fguess-branch-probability </b>at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>,
           <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-freorder-blocks</b>
           Reorder basic blocks in the compiled function in order to
           reduce number of taken branches and improve code locality.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-freorder-blocks-algorithm=</b><i>algorithm</i>
           Use the specified algorithm for basic block reordering.  The
           <i>algorithm</i> argument can be <b>simple</b>, which does not increase
           code size (except sometimes due to secondary effects like
           alignment), or <b>stc</b>, the "software trace cache" algorithm,
           which tries to put all often executed code together,
           minimizing the number of branches executed by making extra
           copies of code.

           The default is <b>simple </b>at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-Os</b>, and <b>stc </b>at levels
           <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-freorder-blocks-and-partition</b>
           In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled
           function, in order to reduce number of taken branches,
           partitions hot and cold basic blocks into separate sections
           of the assembly and <i>.o</i> files, to improve paging and cache
           locality performance.

           This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence
           of exception handling or unwind tables (on targets using
           setjump/longjump or target specific scheme), for linkonce
           sections, for functions with a user-defined section attribute
           and on any architecture that does not support named sections.
           When <b>-fsplit-stack </b>is used this option is not enabled by
           default (to avoid linker errors), but may be enabled
           explicitly (if using a working linker).

           Enabled for x86 at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-freorder-functions</b>
           Reorder functions in the object file in order to improve code
           locality.  This is implemented by using special subsections
           ".text.hot" for most frequently executed functions and
           ".text.unlikely" for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering
           is done by the linker so object file format must support
           named sections and linker must place them in a reasonable
           way.

           This option isn't effective unless you either provide profile
           feedback (see <b>-fprofile-arcs </b>for details) or manually
           annotate functions with "hot" or "cold" attributes.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>
           Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules
           applicable to the language being compiled.  For C (and C++),
           this activates optimizations based on the type of
           expressions.  In particular, an object of one type is assumed
           never to reside at the same address as an object of a
           different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
           example, an "unsigned int" can alias an "int", but not a
           "void*" or a "double".  A character type may alias any other
           type.

           Pay special attention to code like this:

                   union a_union {
                     int i;
                     double d;
                   };

                   int f() {
                     union a_union t;
                     t.d = 3.0;
                     return t.i;
                   }

           The practice of reading from a different union member than
           the one most recently written to (called "type-punning") is
           common.  Even with <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>, type-punning is
           allowed, provided the memory is accessed through the union
           type.  So, the code above works as expected.    However, this
           code might not:

                   int f() {
                     union a_union t;
                     int* ip;
                     t.d = 3.0;
                     ip = &amp;t.i;
                     return *ip;
                   }

           Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the
           resulting pointer and dereferencing the result has undefined
           behavior, even if the cast uses a union type, e.g.:

                   int f() {
                     double d = 3.0;
                     return ((union a_union *) &amp;d)-&gt;i;
                   }

           The <b>-fstrict-aliasing </b>option is enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>,
           <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-falign-functions</b>
       <b>-falign-functions=</b><i>n</i>
       <b>-falign-functions=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i>
       <b>-falign-functions=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i><b>:</b><i>n2</i>
       <b>-falign-functions=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i><b>:</b><i>n2</i><b>:</b><i>m2</i>
           Align the start of functions to the next power-of-two greater
           than <i>n</i>, skipping up to <i>m</i>-1 bytes.  This ensures that at least
           the first <i>m</i> bytes of the function can be fetched by the CPU
           without crossing an <i>n</i>-byte alignment boundary.

           If <i>m</i> is not specified, it defaults to <i>n</i>.

           Examples: <b>-falign-functions=32 </b>aligns functions to the next
           32-byte boundary, <b>-falign-functions=24 </b>aligns to the next
           32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 23
           bytes or less, <b>-falign-functions=32:7 </b>aligns to the next
           32-byte boundary only if this can be done by skipping 6 bytes
           or less.

           The second pair of <i>n2</i>:<i>m2</i> values allows you to specify a
           secondary alignment: <b>-falign-functions=64:7:32:3 </b>aligns to
           the next 64-byte boundary if this can be done by skipping 6
           bytes or less, otherwise aligns to the next 32-byte boundary
           if this can be done by skipping 2 bytes or less.  If <i>m2</i> is
           not specified, it defaults to <i>n2</i>.

           Some assemblers only support this flag when <i>n</i> is a power of
           two; in that case, it is rounded up.

           <b>-fno-align-functions </b>and <b>-falign-functions=1 </b>are equivalent
           and mean that functions are not aligned.

           If <i>n</i> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent
           default.  The maximum allowed <i>n</i> option value is 65536.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-flimit-function-alignment</b>
           If this option is enabled, the compiler tries to avoid
           unnecessarily overaligning functions. It attempts to instruct
           the assembler to align by the amount specified by
           <b>-falign-functions</b>, but not to skip more bytes than the size
           of the function.

       <b>-falign-labels</b>
       <b>-falign-labels=</b><i>n</i>
       <b>-falign-labels=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i>
       <b>-falign-labels=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i><b>:</b><i>n2</i>
       <b>-falign-labels=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i><b>:</b><i>n2</i><b>:</b><i>m2</i>
           Align all branch targets to a power-of-two boundary.

           Parameters of this option are analogous to the
           <b>-falign-functions </b>option.  <b>-fno-align-labels </b>and
           <b>-falign-labels=1 </b>are equivalent and mean that labels are not
           aligned.

           If <b>-falign-loops </b>or <b>-falign-jumps </b>are applicable and are
           greater than this value, then their values are used instead.

           If <i>n</i> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent
           default which is very likely to be <b>1</b>, meaning no alignment.
           The maximum allowed <i>n</i> option value is 65536.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-falign-loops</b>
       <b>-falign-loops=</b><i>n</i>
       <b>-falign-loops=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i>
       <b>-falign-loops=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i><b>:</b><i>n2</i>
       <b>-falign-loops=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i><b>:</b><i>n2</i><b>:</b><i>m2</i>
           Align loops to a power-of-two boundary.  If the loops are
           executed many times, this makes up for any execution of the
           dummy padding instructions.

           Parameters of this option are analogous to the
           <b>-falign-functions </b>option.  <b>-fno-align-loops </b>and
           <b>-falign-loops=1 </b>are equivalent and mean that loops are not
           aligned.  The maximum allowed <i>n</i> option value is 65536.

           If <i>n</i> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent
           default.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-falign-jumps</b>
       <b>-falign-jumps=</b><i>n</i>
       <b>-falign-jumps=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i>
       <b>-falign-jumps=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i><b>:</b><i>n2</i>
       <b>-falign-jumps=</b><i>n</i><b>:</b><i>m</i><b>:</b><i>n2</i><b>:</b><i>m2</i>
           Align branch targets to a power-of-two boundary, for branch
           targets where the targets can only be reached by jumping.  In
           this case, no dummy operations need be executed.

           Parameters of this option are analogous to the
           <b>-falign-functions </b>option.  <b>-fno-align-jumps </b>and
           <b>-falign-jumps=1 </b>are equivalent and mean that loops are not
           aligned.

           If <i>n</i> is not specified or is zero, use a machine-dependent
           default.  The maximum allowed <i>n</i> option value is 65536.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-funit-at-a-time</b>
           This option is left for compatibility reasons.
           <b>-funit-at-a-time </b>has no effect, while <b>-fno-unit-at-a-time</b>
           implies <b>-fno-toplevel-reorder </b>and <b>-fno-section-anchors</b>.

           Enabled by default.

       <b>-fno-toplevel-reorder</b>
           Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and "asm"
           statements.  Output them in the same order that they appear
           in the input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced
           static variables are not removed.  This option is intended to
           support existing code that relies on a particular ordering.
           For new code, it is better to use attributes when possible.

           <b>-ftoplevel-reorder </b>is the default at <b>-O1 </b>and higher, and also
           at <b>-O0 </b>if <b>-fsection-anchors </b>is explicitly requested.
           Additionally <b>-fno-toplevel-reorder </b>implies
           <b>-fno-section-anchors</b>.

       <b>-fweb</b>
           Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation
           purposes and assign each web individual pseudo register.
           This allows the register allocation pass to operate on
           pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other
           optimization passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and trivial
           dead code remover.  It can, however, make debugging
           impossible, since variables no longer stay in a "home
           register".

           Enabled by default with <b>-funroll-loops</b>.

       <b>-fwhole-program</b>
           Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole
           program being compiled.  All public functions and variables
           with the exception of "main" and those merged by attribute
           "externally_visible" become static functions and in effect
           are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural
           optimizers.

           This option should not be used in combination with <b>-flto</b>.
           Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and
           more precise information.

       <b>-flto[=</b><i>n</i><b>]</b>
           This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When
           invoked with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's
           internal representations) and writes it to special ELF
           sections in the object file.  When the object files are
           linked together, all the function bodies are read from these
           ELF sections and instantiated as if they had been part of the
           same translation unit.

           To use the link-time optimizer, <b>-flto </b>and optimization
           options should be specified at compile time and during the
           final link.  It is recommended that you compile all the files
           participating in the same link with the same options and also
           specify those options at link time.  For example:

                   gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
                   gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
                   gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o

           The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode
           representation of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside
           <i>foo.o</i> and <i>bar.o</i>.  The final invocation reads the GIMPLE
           bytecode from <i>foo.o</i> and <i>bar.o</i>, merges the two files into a
           single internal image, and compiles the result as usual.
           Since both <i>foo.o</i> and <i>bar.o</i> are merged into a single image,
           this causes all the interprocedural analyses and
           optimizations in GCC to work across the two files as if they
           were a single one.  This means, for example, that the inliner
           is able to inline functions in <i>bar.o</i> into functions in <i>foo.o</i>
           and vice-versa.

           Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:

                   gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c

           The above generates bytecode for <i>foo.c</i> and <i>bar.c</i>, merges them
           together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes
           them as usual to produce <i>myprog</i>.

           The important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-
           time optimizations you need to use the GCC driver to perform
           the link step.  GCC automatically performs link-time
           optimization if any of the objects involved were compiled
           with the <b>-flto </b>command-line option.  You can always override
           the automatic decision to do link-time optimization by
           passing <b>-fno-lto </b>to the link command.

           To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary
           to make certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler
           needs to know what functions and variables can be accessed by
           libraries and runtime outside of the link-time optimized
           unit.  When supported by the linker, the linker plugin (see
           <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>) passes information to the compiler about
           used and externally visible symbols.  When the linker plugin
           is not available, <b>-fwhole-program </b>should be used to allow the
           compiler to make these assumptions, which leads to more
           aggressive optimization decisions.

           When a file is compiled with <b>-flto </b>without
           <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>, the generated object file is larger than
           a regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes
           and the usual final code (see <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b>.  This means
           that object files with LTO information can be linked as
           normal object files; if <b>-fno-lto </b>is passed to the linker, no
           interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note that when
           <b>-fno-fat-lto-objects </b>is enabled the compile stage is faster
           but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.

           When producing the final binary, GCC only applies link-time
           optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
           Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries
           with GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC
           automatically selects which files to optimize in LTO mode and
           which files to link without further processing.

           Generally, options specified at link time override those
           specified at compile time, although in some cases GCC
           attempts to infer link-time options from the settings used to
           compile the input files.

           If you do not specify an optimization level option <b>-O </b>at link
           time, then GCC uses the highest optimization level used when
           compiling the object files.  Note that it is generally
           ineffective to specify an optimization level option only at
           link time and not at compile time, for two reasons.  First,
           compiling without optimization suppresses compiler passes
           that gather information needed for effective optimization at
           link time.  Second, some early optimization passes can be
           performed only at compile time and not at link time.

           There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
           generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the
           final link.  Currently, the following options and their
           settings are taken from the first object file that explicitly
           specifies them: <b>-fPIC</b>, <b>-fpic</b>, <b>-fpie</b>, <b>-fcommon</b>, <b>-fexceptions</b>,
           <b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>, <b>-fgnu-tm </b>and all the <b>-m </b>target flags.

           Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all
           compilation units, and trying to override this at link time
           with a conflicting value is ignored.  This includes options
           such as <b>-freg-struct-return </b>and <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>.

           Other options such as <b>-ffp-contract</b>, <b>-fno-strict-overflow</b>,
           <b>-fwrapv</b>, <b>-fno-trapv </b>or <b>-fno-strict-aliasing </b>are passed
           through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
           conflicting translation units.  Specifically
           <b>-fno-strict-overflow</b>, <b>-fwrapv </b>and <b>-fno-trapv </b>take precedence;
           and for example <b>-ffp-contract=off </b>takes precedence over
           <b>-ffp-contract=fast</b>.  You can override them at link time.

           When you need to pass options to the assembler via <b>-Wa </b>or
           <b>-Xassembler </b>make sure to either compile such translation
           units with <b>-fno-lto </b>or consistently use the same assembler
           options on all translation units.  You can alternatively also
           specify assembler options at LTO link time.

           If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with
           incompatible types in separate translation units to be linked
           together (undefined behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a
           non-fatal diagnostic may be issued.  The behavior is still
           undefined at run time.  Similar diagnostics may be raised for
           other languages.

           Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply
           interprocedural optimizations on files written in different
           languages:

                   gcc -c -flto foo.c
                   g++ -c -flto bar.cc
                   gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
                   g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran

           Notice that the final link is done with <b>g++ </b>to get the C++
           runtime libraries and <b>-lgfortran </b>is added to get the Fortran
           runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO
           mode, you should use the same link command options as when
           mixing languages in a regular (non-LTO) compilation.

           If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a
           library archive, say <i>libfoo.a</i>, it is possible to extract and
           use them in an LTO link if you are using a linker with plugin
           support.  To create static libraries suitable for LTO, use
           <b>gcc-ar </b>and <b>gcc-ranlib </b>instead of <b>ar </b>and <b>ranlib</b>; to show the
           symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use <b>gcc-nm</b>.
           Those commands require that <b>ar</b>, <b>ranlib </b>and <b>nm </b>have been
           compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the flag
           <b>-fuse-linker-plugin </b>to ensure that the library participates
           in the LTO optimization process:

                   gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo

           With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the
           needed GIMPLE files from <i>libfoo.a</i> and passes them on to the
           running GCC to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image
           to be optimized.

           If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do
           not enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside
           <i>libfoo.a</i> are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not
           participate in the LTO optimization process.  In order to
           make a static library suitable for both LTO optimization and
           usual linkage, compile its object files with <b>-flto</b>
           <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b>.

           Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the
           whole program to operate.  If the program does not require
           any symbols to be exported, it is possible to combine <b>-flto</b>
           and <b>-fwhole-program </b>to allow the interprocedural optimizers
           to use more aggressive assumptions which may lead to improved
           optimization opportunities.  Use of <b>-fwhole-program </b>is not
           needed when linker plugin is active (see
           <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>).

           The current implementation of LTO makes no attempt to
           generate bytecode that is portable between different types of
           hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
           strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one
           version of GCC do not work with an older or newer version of
           GCC.

           Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of
           debugging information on systems other than those using a
           combination of ELF and DWARF.

           If you specify the optional <i>n</i>, the optimization and code
           generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <i>n</i>
           parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <b>make </b>program.  The
           environment variable <b>MAKE </b>may be used to override the program
           used.  The default value for <i>n</i> is 1.

           You can also specify <b>-flto=jobserver </b>to use GNU make's job
           server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This is
           useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in
           parallel.  You must prepend a <b>+ </b>to the command recipe in the
           parent Makefile for this to work.  This option likely only
           works if <b>MAKE </b>is GNU make.

       <b>-flto-partition=</b><i>alg</i>
           Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time
           optimizer.  The value is either <b>1to1 </b>to specify a
           partitioning mirroring the original source files or <b>balanced</b>
           to specify partitioning into equally sized chunks (whenever
           possible) or <b>max </b>to create new partition for every symbol
           where possible.  Specifying <b>none </b>as an algorithm disables
           partitioning and streaming completely.  The default value is
           <b>balanced</b>. While <b>1to1 </b>can be used as an workaround for various
           code ordering issues, the <b>max </b>partitioning is intended for
           internal testing only.  The value <b>one </b>specifies that exactly
           one partition should be used while the value <b>none </b>bypasses
           partitioning and executes the link-time optimization step
           directly from the WPA phase.

       <b>-flto-odr-type-merging</b>
           Enable streaming of mangled types names of C++ types and
           their unification at link time.  This increases size of LTO
           object files, but enables diagnostics about One Definition
           Rule violations.

       <b>-flto-compression-level=</b><i>n</i>
           This option specifies the level of compression used for
           intermediate language written to LTO object files, and is
           only meaningful in conjunction with LTO mode (<b>-flto</b>).  Valid
           values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).
           Values outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If
           the option is not given, a default balanced compression
           setting is used.

       <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>
           Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time
           optimization.  This option relies on plugin support in the
           linker, which is available in gold or in GNU ld 2.21 or
           newer.

           This option enables the extraction of object files with
           GIMPLE bytecode out of library archives. This improves the
           quality of optimization by exposing more code to the link-
           time optimizer.  This information specifies what symbols can
           be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
           linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries
           (and shared libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar
           to <b>-fwhole-program</b>.  See <b>-flto </b>for a description of the
           effect of this flag and how to use it.

           This option is enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is
           enabled and GCC was configured for use with a linker
           supporting plugins (GNU ld 2.21 or newer or gold).

       <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b>
           Fat LTO objects are object files that contain both the
           intermediate language and the object code. This makes them
           usable for both LTO linking and normal linking. This option
           is effective only when compiling with <b>-flto </b>and is ignored at
           link time.

           <b>-fno-fat-lto-objects </b>improves compilation time over plain
           LTO, but requires the complete toolchain to be aware of LTO.
           It requires a linker with linker plugin support for basic
           functionality.  Additionally, <b>nm</b>, <b>ar </b>and <b>ranlib </b>need to
           support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build
           environment (capable of building static libraries etc).  GCC
           provides the <b>gcc-ar</b>, <b>gcc-nm</b>, <b>gcc-ranlib </b>wrappers to pass the
           right options to these tools. With non fat LTO makefiles need
           to be modified to use them.

           Note that modern binutils provide plugin auto-load mechanism.
           Installing the linker plugin into <i>$libdir/bfd-plugins</i> has the
           same effect as usage of the command wrappers (<b>gcc-ar</b>, <b>gcc-nm</b>
           and <b>gcc-ranlib</b>).

           The default is <b>-fno-fat-lto-objects </b>on targets with linker
           plugin support.

       <b>-fcompare-elim</b>
           After register allocation and post-register allocation
           instruction splitting, identify arithmetic instructions that
           compute processor flags similar to a comparison operation
           based on that arithmetic.  If possible, eliminate the
           explicit comparison operation.

           This pass only applies to certain targets that cannot
           explicitly represent the comparison operation before register
           allocation is complete.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fcprop-registers</b>
           After register allocation and post-register allocation
           instruction splitting, perform a copy-propagation pass to try
           to reduce scheduling dependencies and occasionally eliminate
           the copy.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O</b>, <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-correction</b>
           Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-
           threaded programs may be inconsistent due to missed counter
           updates. When this option is specified, GCC uses heuristics
           to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies. By default,
           GCC emits an error message when an inconsistent profile is
           detected.

           This option is enabled by <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-use</b>
       <b>-fprofile-use=</b><i>path</i>
           Enable profile feedback-directed optimizations, and the
           following optimizations, many of which are generally
           profitable only with profile feedback available:

           <b>-fbranch-probabilities  -fprofile-values -funroll-loops</b>
           <b>-fpeel-loops  -ftracer  -fvpt -finline-functions  -fipa-cp</b>
           <b>-fipa-cp-clone  -fipa-bit-cp -fpredictive-commoning</b>
           <b>-fsplit-loops  -funswitch-loops -fgcse-after-reload</b>
           <b>-ftree-loop-vectorize  -ftree-slp-vectorize</b>
           <b>-fvect-cost-model=dynamic  -ftree-loop-distribute-patterns</b>
           <b>-fprofile-reorder-functions</b>

           Before you can use this option, you must first generate
           profiling information.

           By default, GCC emits an error message if the feedback
           profiles do not match the source code.  This error can be
           turned into a warning by using <b>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</b>.
           Note this may result in poorly optimized code.  Additionally,
           by default, GCC also emits a warning message if the feedback
           profiles do not exist (see <b>-Wmissing-profile</b>).

           If <i>path</i> is specified, GCC looks at the <i>path</i> to find the
           profile feedback data files. See <b>-fprofile-dir</b>.

       <b>-fauto-profile</b>
       <b>-fauto-profile=</b><i>path</i>
           Enable sampling-based feedback-directed optimizations, and
           the following optimizations, many of which are generally
           profitable only with profile feedback available:

           <b>-fbranch-probabilities  -fprofile-values -funroll-loops</b>
           <b>-fpeel-loops  -ftracer  -fvpt -finline-functions  -fipa-cp</b>
           <b>-fipa-cp-clone  -fipa-bit-cp -fpredictive-commoning</b>
           <b>-fsplit-loops  -funswitch-loops -fgcse-after-reload</b>
           <b>-ftree-loop-vectorize  -ftree-slp-vectorize</b>
           <b>-fvect-cost-model=dynamic  -ftree-loop-distribute-patterns</b>
           <b>-fprofile-correction</b>

           <i>path</i> is the name of a file containing AutoFDO profile
           information.  If omitted, it defaults to <i>fbdata.afdo</i> in the
           current directory.

           Producing an AutoFDO profile data file requires running your
           program with the <b>perf </b>utility on a supported GNU/Linux target
           system.  For more information, see
           &lt;<b><a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/">https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/</a> </b>&gt;.

           E.g.

                   perf record -e br_inst_retired:near_taken -b -o perf.data \
                       -- your_program

           Then use the <b>create_gcov </b>tool to convert the raw profile data
           to a format that can be used by GCC.  You must also supply
           the unstripped binary for your program to this tool.  See
           &lt;<b><a href="https://github.com/google/autofdo">https://github.com/google/autofdo</a> </b>&gt;.

           E.g.

                   create_gcov --binary=your_program.unstripped --profile=perf.data \
                       --gcov=profile.afdo

       The following options control compiler behavior regarding
       floating-point arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed
       and correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.

       <b>-ffloat-store</b>
           Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and
           inhibit other options that might change whether a floating-
           point value is taken from a register or memory.

           This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines
           such as the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881)
           keep more precision than a "double" is supposed to have.
           Similarly for the x86 architecture.  For most programs, the
           excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely on
           the precise definition of IEEE floating point.  Use
           <b>-ffloat-store </b>for such programs, after modifying them to
           store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.

       <b>-fexcess-precision=</b><i>style</i>
           This option allows further control over excess precision on
           machines where floating-point operations occur in a format
           with more precision or range than the IEEE standard and
           interchange floating-point types.  By default,
           <b>-fexcess-precision=fast </b>is in effect; this means that
           operations may be carried out in a wider precision than the
           types specified in the source if that would result in faster
           code, and it is unpredictable when rounding to the types
           specified in the source code takes place.  When compiling C,
           if <b>-fexcess-precision=standard </b>is specified then excess
           precision follows the rules specified in ISO C99; in
           particular, both casts and assignments cause values to be
           rounded to their semantic types (whereas <b>-ffloat-store </b>only
           affects assignments).  This option is enabled by default for
           C if a strict conformance option such as <b>-std=c99 </b>is used.
           <b>-ffast-math </b>enables <b>-fexcess-precision=fast </b>by default
           regardless of whether a strict conformance option is used.

           <b>-fexcess-precision=standard </b>is not implemented for languages
           other than C.  On the x86, it has no effect if <b>-mfpmath=sse</b>
           or <b>-mfpmath=sse+387 </b>is specified; in the former case, IEEE
           semantics apply without excess precision, and in the latter,
           rounding is unpredictable.

       <b>-ffast-math</b>
           Sets the options <b>-fno-math-errno</b>,
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>, <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>,
           <b>-fno-rounding-math</b>, <b>-fno-signaling-nans</b>, <b>-fcx-limited-range</b>
           and <b>-fexcess-precision=fast</b>.

           This option causes the preprocessor macro "__FAST_MATH__" to
           be defined.

           This option is not turned on by any <b>-O </b>option besides <b>-Ofast</b>
           since it can result in incorrect output for programs that
           depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO
           rules/specifications for math functions. It may, however,
           yield faster code for programs that do not require the
           guarantees of these specifications.

       <b>-fno-math-errno</b>
           Do not set "errno" after calling math functions that are
           executed with a single instruction, e.g., "sqrt".  A program
           that relies on IEEE exceptions for math error handling may
           want to use this flag for speed while maintaining IEEE
           arithmetic compatibility.

           This option is not turned on by any <b>-O </b>option since it can
           result in incorrect output for programs that depend on an
           exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
           math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
           programs that do not require the guarantees of these
           specifications.

           The default is <b>-fmath-errno</b>.

           On Darwin systems, the math library never sets "errno".
           There is therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the
           possibility that it might, and <b>-fno-math-errno </b>is the
           default.

       <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>
           Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a)
           assume that arguments and results are valid and (b) may
           violate IEEE or ANSI standards.  When used at link time, it
           may include libraries or startup files that change the
           default FPU control word or other similar optimizations.

           This option is not turned on by any <b>-O </b>option since it can
           result in incorrect output for programs that depend on an
           exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
           math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
           programs that do not require the guarantees of these
           specifications.  Enables <b>-fno-signed-zeros</b>,
           <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>, <b>-fassociative-math </b>and <b>-freciprocal-math</b>.

           The default is <b>-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations</b>.

       <b>-fassociative-math</b>
           Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point
           operations.  This violates the ISO C and C++ language
           standard by possibly changing computation result.  NOTE: re-
           ordering may change the sign of zero as well as ignore NaNs
           and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and thus cannot
           be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like "(x +
           2**52) - 2**52".  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
           and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are
           required.  This option requires that both <b>-fno-signed-zeros</b>
           and <b>-fno-trapping-math </b>be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't
           make much sense with <b>-frounding-math</b>. For Fortran the option
           is automatically enabled when both <b>-fno-signed-zeros </b>and
           <b>-fno-trapping-math </b>are in effect.

           The default is <b>-fno-associative-math</b>.

       <b>-freciprocal-math</b>
           Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of
           dividing by the value if this enables optimizations.  For
           example "x / y" can be replaced with "x * (1/y)", which is
           useful if "(1/y)" is subject to common subexpression
           elimination.  Note that this loses precision and increases
           the number of flops operating on the value.

           The default is <b>-fno-reciprocal-math</b>.

       <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>
           Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume
           that arguments and results are not NaNs or +-Infs.

           This option is not turned on by any <b>-O </b>option since it can
           result in incorrect output for programs that depend on an
           exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
           math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for
           programs that do not require the guarantees of these
           specifications.

           The default is <b>-fno-finite-math-only</b>.

       <b>-fno-signed-zeros</b>
           Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore
           the signedness of zero.  IEEE arithmetic specifies the
           behavior of distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then
           prohibits simplification of expressions such as x+0.0 or
           0.0*x (even with <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>).  This option implies
           that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.

           The default is <b>-fsigned-zeros</b>.

       <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>
           Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot
           generate user-visible traps.  These traps include division by
           zero, overflow, underflow, inexact result and invalid
           operation.  This option requires that <b>-fno-signaling-nans </b>be
           in effect.  Setting this option may allow faster code if one
           relies on "non-stop" IEEE arithmetic, for example.

           This option should never be turned on by any <b>-O </b>option since
           it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
           an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications
           for math functions.

           The default is <b>-ftrapping-math</b>.

       <b>-frounding-math</b>
           Disable transformations and optimizations that assume default
           floating-point rounding behavior.  This is round-to-zero for
           all floating point to integer conversions, and round-to-
           nearest for all other arithmetic truncations.  This option
           should be specified for programs that change the FP rounding
           mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a non-default
           rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
           floating-point expressions at compile time (which may be
           affected by rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations
           that are unsafe in the presence of sign-dependent rounding
           modes.

           The default is <b>-fno-rounding-math</b>.

           This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee
           to disable all GCC optimizations that are affected by
           rounding mode.  Future versions of GCC may provide finer
           control of this setting using C99's "FENV_ACCESS" pragma.
           This command-line option will be used to specify the default
           state for "FENV_ACCESS".

       <b>-fsignaling-nans</b>
           Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may generate
           user-visible traps during floating-point operations.  Setting
           this option disables optimizations that may change the number
           of exceptions visible with signaling NaNs.  This option
           implies <b>-ftrapping-math</b>.

           This option causes the preprocessor macro "__SUPPORT_SNAN__"
           to be defined.

           The default is <b>-fno-signaling-nans</b>.

           This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee
           to disable all GCC optimizations that affect signaling NaN
           behavior.

       <b>-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact</b>
           Do not allow the built-in functions "ceil", "floor", "round"
           and "trunc", and their "float" and "long double" variants, to
           generate code that raises the "inexact" floating-point
           exception for noninteger arguments.  ISO C99 and C11 allow
           these functions to raise the "inexact" exception, but ISO/IEC
           TS 18661-1:2014, the C bindings to IEEE 754-2008, does not
           allow these functions to do so.

           The default is <b>-ffp-int-builtin-inexact</b>, allowing the
           exception to be raised.  This option does nothing unless
           <b>-ftrapping-math </b>is in effect.

           Even if <b>-fno-fp-int-builtin-inexact </b>is used, if the functions
           generate a call to a library function then the "inexact"
           exception may be raised if the library implementation does
           not follow TS 18661.

       <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b>
           Treat floating-point constants as single precision instead of
           implicitly converting them to double-precision constants.

       <b>-fcx-limited-range</b>
           When enabled, this option states that a range reduction step
           is not needed when performing complex division.  Also, there
           is no checking whether the result of a complex multiplication
           or division is "NaN + I*NaN", with an attempt to rescue the
           situation in that case.  The default is
           <b>-fno-cx-limited-range</b>, but is enabled by <b>-ffast-math</b>.

           This option controls the default setting of the ISO C99
           "CX_LIMITED_RANGE" pragma.  Nevertheless, the option applies
           to all languages.

       <b>-fcx-fortran-rules</b>
           Complex multiplication and division follow Fortran rules.
           Range reduction is done as part of complex division, but
           there is no checking whether the result of a complex
           multiplication or division is "NaN + I*NaN", with an attempt
           to rescue the situation in that case.

           The default is <b>-fno-cx-fortran-rules</b>.

       The following options control optimizations that may improve
       performance, but are not enabled by any <b>-O </b>options.  This section
       includes experimental options that may produce broken code.

       <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>
           After running a program compiled with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, you can
           compile it a second time using <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, to
           improve optimizations based on the number of times each
           branch was taken.  When a program compiled with
           <b>-fprofile-arcs </b>exits, it saves arc execution counts to a file
           called <i>sourcename.gcda</i> for each source file.  The information
           in this data file is very dependent on the structure of the
           generated code, so you must use the same source code and the
           same optimization options for both compilations.

           With <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, GCC puts a <b>REG_BR_PROB </b>note on
           each <b>JUMP_INSN </b>and <b>CALL_INSN</b>.  These can be used to improve
           optimization.  Currently, they are only used in one place: in
           <i>reorg.c</i>, instead of guessing which path a branch is most
           likely to take, the <b>REG_BR_PROB </b>values are used to exactly
           determine which path is taken more often.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-values</b>
           If combined with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, it adds code so that some
           data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.

           With <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, it reads back the data gathered
           from profiling values of expressions for usage in
           optimizations.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-generate</b>, <b>-fprofile-use</b>, and
           <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-reorder-functions</b>
           Function reordering based on profile instrumentation collects
           first time of execution of a function and orders these
           functions in ascending order.

           Enabled with <b>-fprofile-use</b>.

       <b>-fvpt</b>
           If combined with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, this option instructs the
           compiler to add code to gather information about values of
           expressions.

           With <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>, it reads back the data gathered
           and actually performs the optimizations based on them.
           Currently the optimizations include specialization of
           division operations using the knowledge about the value of
           the denominator.

           Enabled with <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-frename-registers</b>
           Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by
           making use of registers left over after register allocation.
           This optimization most benefits processors with lots of
           registers.  Depending on the debug information format adopted
           by the target, however, it can make debugging impossible,
           since variables no longer stay in a "home register".

           Enabled by default with <b>-funroll-loops</b>.

       <b>-fschedule-fusion</b>
           Performs a target dependent pass over the instruction stream
           to schedule instructions of same type together because target
           machine can execute them more efficiently if they are
           adjacent to each other in the instruction flow.

           Enabled at levels <b>-O2</b>, <b>-O3</b>, <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-ftracer</b>
           Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This
           transformation simplifies the control flow of the function
           allowing other optimizations to do a better job.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-funroll-loops</b>
           Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at
           compile time or upon entry to the loop.  <b>-funroll-loops</b>
           implies <b>-frerun-cse-after-loop</b>, <b>-fweb </b>and <b>-frename-registers</b>.
           It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal
           of loops with a small constant number of iterations).  This
           option makes code larger, and may or may not make it run
           faster.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-funroll-all-loops</b>
           Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is
           uncertain when the loop is entered.  This usually makes
           programs run more slowly.  <b>-funroll-all-loops </b>implies the
           same options as <b>-funroll-loops</b>.

       <b>-fpeel-loops</b>
           Peels loops for which there is enough information that they
           do not roll much (from profile feedback or static analysis).
           It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal
           of loops with small constant number of iterations).

           Enabled by <b>-O3</b>, <b>-fprofile-use</b>, and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fmove-loop-invariants</b>
           Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop
           optimizer.  Enabled at level <b>-O1 </b>and higher, except for <b>-Og</b>.

       <b>-fsplit-loops</b>
           Split a loop into two if it contains a condition that's
           always true for one side of the iteration space and false for
           the other.

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-funswitch-loops</b>
           Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop,
           with duplicates of the loop on both branches (modified
           according to result of the condition).

           Enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-fversion-loops-for-strides</b>
           If a loop iterates over an array with a variable stride,
           create another version of the loop that assumes the stride is
           always one.  For example:

                   for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
                     x[i * stride] = ...;

           becomes:

                   if (stride == 1)
                     for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
                       x[i] = ...;
                   else
                     for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
                       x[i * stride] = ...;

           This is particularly useful for assumed-shape arrays in
           Fortran where (for example) it allows better vectorization
           assuming contiguous accesses.  This flag is enabled by
           default at <b>-O3</b>.  It is also enabled by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and
           <b>-fauto-profile</b>.

       <b>-ffunction-sections</b>
       <b>-fdata-sections</b>
           Place each function or data item into its own section in the
           output file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The
           name of the function or the name of the data item determines
           the section's name in the output file.

           Use these options on systems where the linker can perform
           optimizations to improve locality of reference in the
           instruction space.  Most systems using the ELF object format
           have linkers with such optimizations.  On AIX, the linker
           rearranges sections (CSECTs) based on the call graph.  The
           performance impact varies.

           Together with a linker garbage collection (linker
           <b>--gc-sections </b>option) these options may lead to smaller
           statically-linked executables (after stripping).

           On ELF/DWARF systems these options do not degenerate the
           quality of the debug information.  There could be issues with
           other object files/debug info formats.

           Only use these options when there are significant benefits
           from doing so.  When you specify these options, the assembler
           and linker create larger object and executable files and are
           also slower.  These options affect code generation.  They
           prevent optimizations by the compiler and assembler using
           relative locations inside a translation unit since the
           locations are unknown until link time.  An example of such an
           optimization is relaxing calls to short call instructions.

       <b>-fbranch-target-load-optimize</b>
           Perform branch target register load optimization before
           prologue / epilogue threading.  The use of target registers
           can typically be exposed only during reload, thus hoisting
           loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs a
           separate optimization pass.

       <b>-fbranch-target-load-optimize2</b>
           Perform branch target register load optimization after
           prologue / epilogue threading.

       <b>-fbtr-bb-exclusive</b>
           When performing branch target register load optimization,
           don't reuse branch target registers within any basic block.

       <b>-fstdarg-opt</b>
           Optimize the prologue of variadic argument functions with
           respect to usage of those arguments.

       <b>-fsection-anchors</b>
           Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by
           using shared "anchor" symbols to address nearby objects.
           This transformation can help to reduce the number of GOT
           entries and GOT accesses on some targets.

           For example, the implementation of the following function
           "foo":

                   static int a, b, c;
                   int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }

           usually calculates the addresses of all three variables, but
           if you compile it with <b>-fsection-anchors</b>, it accesses the
           variables from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is
           similar to the following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):

                   int foo (void)
                   {
                     register int *xr = &amp;x;
                     return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x];
                   }

           Not all targets support this option.

       <b>--param </b><i>name</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
           In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the
           amount of optimization that is done.  For example, GCC does
           not inline functions that contain more than a certain number
           of instructions.  You can control some of these constants on
           the command line using the <b>--param </b>option.

           The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the
           values, are tied to the internals of the compiler, and are
           subject to change without notice in future releases.

           In order to get minimal, maximal and default value of a
           parameter, one can use <b>--help=param -Q </b>options.

           In each case, the <i>value</i> is an integer.  The allowable choices
           for <i>name</i> are:

           <b>predictable-branch-outcome</b>
               When branch is predicted to be taken with probability
               lower than this threshold (in percent), then it is
               considered well predictable.

           <b>max-rtl-if-conversion-insns</b>
               RTL if-conversion tries to remove conditional branches
               around a block and replace them with conditionally
               executed instructions.  This parameter gives the maximum
               number of instructions in a block which should be
               considered for if-conversion.  The compiler will also use
               other heuristics to decide whether if-conversion is
               likely to be profitable.

           <b>max-rtl-if-conversion-predictable-cost</b>
           <b>max-rtl-if-conversion-unpredictable-cost</b>
               RTL if-conversion will try to remove conditional branches
               around a block and replace them with conditionally
               executed instructions.  These parameters give the maximum
               permissible cost for the sequence that would be generated
               by if-conversion depending on whether the branch is
               statically determined to be predictable or not.  The
               units for this parameter are the same as those for the
               GCC internal seq_cost metric.  The compiler will try to
               provide a reasonable default for this parameter using the
               BRANCH_COST target macro.

           <b>max-crossjump-edges</b>
               The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for
               cross-jumping.  The algorithm used by <b>-fcrossjumping </b>is
               O(N^2) in the number of edges incoming to each block.
               Increasing values mean more aggressive optimization,
               making the compilation time increase with probably small
               improvement in executable size.

           <b>min-crossjump-insns</b>
               The minimum number of instructions that must be matched
               at the end of two blocks before cross-jumping is
               performed on them.  This value is ignored in the case
               where all instructions in the block being cross-jumped
               from are matched.

           <b>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</b>
               The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic
               blocks instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to
               a jump instruction.

           <b>max-goto-duplication-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a
               block that jumps to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2)
               behavior in a number of passes, GCC factors computed
               gotos early in the compilation process, and unfactors
               them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the end
               of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-
               insns are unfactored.

           <b>max-delay-slot-insn-search</b>
               The maximum number of instructions to consider when
               looking for an instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more
               than this arbitrary number of instructions are searched,
               the time savings from filling the delay slot are minimal,
               so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
               aggressive optimization, making the compilation time
               increase with probably small improvement in execution
               time.

           <b>max-delay-slot-live-search</b>
               When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of
               instructions to consider when searching for a block with
               valid live register information.  Increasing this
               arbitrarily chosen value means more aggressive
               optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This
               parameter should be removed when the delay slot code is
               rewritten to maintain the control-flow graph.

           <b>max-gcse-memory</b>
               The approximate maximum amount of memory that can be
               allocated in order to perform the global common
               subexpression elimination optimization.  If more memory
               than specified is required, the optimization is not done.

           <b>max-gcse-insertion-ratio</b>
               If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is
               larger than this value for any expression, then RTL PRE
               inserts or removes the expression and thus leaves
               partially redundant computations in the instruction
               stream.

           <b>max-pending-list-length</b>
               The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling
               allows before flushing the current state and starting
               over.  Large functions with few branches or calls can
               create excessively large lists which needlessly consume
               memory and resources.

           <b>max-modulo-backtrack-attempts</b>
               The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler
               should make when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values
               can exponentially increase compilation time.

           <b>max-inline-insns-single</b>
               Several parameters control the tree inliner used in GCC.
               This number sets the maximum number of instructions
               (counted in GCC's internal representation) in a single
               function that the tree inliner considers for inlining.
               This only affects functions declared inline and methods
               implemented in a class declaration (C++).

           <b>max-inline-insns-auto</b>
               When you use <b>-finline-functions </b>(included in <b>-O3</b>), a lot
               of functions that would otherwise not be considered for
               inlining by the compiler are investigated.  To those
               functions, a different (more restrictive) limit compared
               to functions declared inline can be applied.

           <b>max-inline-insns-small</b>
               This is bound applied to calls which are considered
               relevant with <b>-finline-small-functions</b>.

           <b>max-inline-insns-size</b>
               This is bound applied to calls which are optimized for
               size. Small growth may be desirable to anticipate
               optimization oppurtunities exposed by inlining.

           <b>uninlined-function-insns</b>
               Number of instructions accounted by inliner for function
               overhead such as function prologue and epilogue.

           <b>uninlined-function-time</b>
               Extra time accounted by inliner for function overhead
               such as time needed to execute function prologue and
               epilogue

           <b>uninlined-thunk-insns</b>
           <b>uninlined-thunk-time</b>
               Same as <b>--param uninlined-function-insns </b>and <b>--param</b>
               <b>uninlined-function-time </b>but applied to function thunks

           <b>inline-min-speedup</b>
               When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee
               runtime exceeds this threshold (in percent), the function
               can be inlined regardless of the limit on <b>--param max-</b>
               <b>inline-insns-single </b>and <b>--param max-inline-insns-auto</b>.

           <b>large-function-insns</b>
               The limit specifying really large functions.  For
               functions larger than this limit after inlining, inlining
               is constrained by <b>--param large-function-growth</b>.  This
               parameter is useful primarily to avoid extreme
               compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by
               the back end.

           <b>large-function-growth</b>
               Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by
               inlining in percents.  For example, parameter value 100
               limits large function growth to 2.0 times the original
               size.

           <b>large-unit-insns</b>
               The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth
               caused by inlining of units larger than this limit is
               limited by <b>--param inline-unit-growth</b>.  For small units
               this might be too tight.  For example, consider a unit
               consisting of function A that is inline and B that just
               calls A three times.  If B is small relative to A, the
               growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very
               sane.  For very large units consisting of small
               inlineable functions, however, the overall unit growth
               limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code
               size.  Thus for smaller units, the size is increased to
               <b>--param large-unit-insns </b>before applying <b>--param inline-</b>
               <b>unit-growth</b>.

           <b>inline-unit-growth</b>
               Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
               caused by inlining.  For example, parameter value 20
               limits unit growth to 1.2 times the original size. Cold
               functions (either marked cold via an attribute or by
               profile feedback) are not accounted into the unit size.

           <b>ipcp-unit-growth</b>
               Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit
               caused by interprocedural constant propagation.  For
               example, parameter value 10 limits unit growth to 1.1
               times the original size.

           <b>large-stack-frame</b>
               The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining
               the algorithm is trying to not grow past this limit too
               much.

           <b>large-stack-frame-growth</b>
               Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by
               inlining in percents.  For example, parameter value 1000
               limits large stack frame growth to 11 times the original
               size.

           <b>max-inline-insns-recursive</b>
           <b>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</b>
               Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-
               line copy of a self-recursive inline function can grow
               into by performing recursive inlining.

               <b>--param max-inline-insns-recursive </b>applies to functions
               declared inline.  For functions not declared inline,
               recursive inlining happens only when <b>-finline-functions</b>
               (included in <b>-O3</b>) is enabled; <b>--param max-inline-insns-</b>
               <b>recursive-auto </b>applies instead.

           <b>max-inline-recursive-depth</b>
           <b>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</b>
               Specifies the maximum recursion depth used for recursive
               inlining.

               <b>--param max-inline-recursive-depth </b>applies to functions
               declared inline.  For functions not declared inline,
               recursive inlining happens only when <b>-finline-functions</b>
               (included in <b>-O3</b>) is enabled; <b>--param max-inline-</b>
               <b>recursive-depth-auto </b>applies instead.

           <b>min-inline-recursive-probability</b>
               Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having
               deep recursion in average and can hurt for function
               having little recursion depth by increasing the prologue
               size or complexity of function body to other optimizers.

               When profile feedback is available (see
               <b>-fprofile-generate</b>) the actual recursion depth can be
               guessed from the probability that function recurses via a
               given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining
               only to call expressions whose probability exceeds the
               given threshold (in percents).

           <b>early-inlining-insns</b>
               Specify growth that the early inliner can make.  In
               effect it increases the amount of inlining for code
               having a large abstraction penalty.

           <b>max-early-inliner-iterations</b>
               Limit of iterations of the early inliner.  This basically
               bounds the number of nested indirect calls the early
               inliner can resolve.  Deeper chains are still handled by
               late inlining.

           <b>comdat-sharing-probability</b>
               Probability (in percent) that C++ inline function with
               comdat visibility are shared across multiple compilation
               units.

           <b>profile-func-internal-id</b>
               A parameter to control whether to use function internal
               id in profile database lookup. If the value is 0, the
               compiler uses an id that is based on function assembler
               name and filename, which makes old profile data more
               tolerant to source changes such as function reordering
               etc.

           <b>min-vect-loop-bound</b>
               The minimum number of iterations under which loops are
               not vectorized when <b>-ftree-vectorize </b>is used.  The number
               of iterations after vectorization needs to be greater
               than the value specified by this option to allow
               vectorization.

           <b>gcse-cost-distance-ratio</b>
               Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an
               expression can be moved by GCSE optimizations.  This is
               currently supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The
               bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting is
               with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have
               cost less than <b>gcse-unrestricted-cost</b>.  Specifying 0
               disables hoisting of simple expressions.

           <b>gcse-unrestricted-cost</b>
               Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical
               machine instruction, at which GCSE optimizations do not
               constrain the distance an expression can travel.  This is
               currently supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The
               lesser the cost, the more aggressive code hoisting is.
               Specifying 0 allows all expressions to travel
               unrestricted distances.

           <b>max-hoist-depth</b>
               The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions
               to hoist.  This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in
               hoisting algorithm.  The value of 0 does not limit on the
               search, but may slow down compilation of huge functions.

           <b>max-tail-merge-comparisons</b>
               The maximum amount of similar bbs to compare a bb with.
               This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in tree tail
               merging.

           <b>max-tail-merge-iterations</b>
               The maximum amount of iterations of the pass over the
               function.  This is used to limit compilation time in tree
               tail merging.

           <b>store-merging-allow-unaligned</b>
               Allow the store merging pass to introduce unaligned
               stores if it is legal to do so.

           <b>max-stores-to-merge</b>
               The maximum number of stores to attempt to merge into
               wider stores in the store merging pass.

           <b>max-unrolled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have
               to be unrolled.  If a loop is unrolled, this parameter
               also determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

           <b>max-average-unrolled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions biased by
               probabilities of their execution that a loop may have to
               be unrolled.  If a loop is unrolled, this parameter also
               determines how many times the loop code is unrolled.

           <b>max-unroll-times</b>
               The maximum number of unrollings of a single loop.

           <b>max-peeled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions that a loop may have
               to be peeled.  If a loop is peeled, this parameter also
               determines how many times the loop code is peeled.

           <b>max-peel-times</b>
               The maximum number of peelings of a single loop.

           <b>max-peel-branches</b>
               The maximum number of branches on the hot path through
               the peeled sequence.

           <b>max-completely-peeled-insns</b>
               The maximum number of insns of a completely peeled loop.

           <b>max-completely-peel-times</b>
               The maximum number of iterations of a loop to be suitable
               for complete peeling.

           <b>max-completely-peel-loop-nest-depth</b>
               The maximum depth of a loop nest suitable for complete
               peeling.

           <b>max-unswitch-insns</b>
               The maximum number of insns of an unswitched loop.

           <b>max-unswitch-level</b>
               The maximum number of branches unswitched in a single
               loop.

           <b>lim-expensive</b>
               The minimum cost of an expensive expression in the loop
               invariant motion.

           <b>iv-consider-all-candidates-bound</b>
               Bound on number of candidates for induction variables,
               below which all candidates are considered for each use in
               induction variable optimizations.  If there are more
               candidates than this, only the most relevant ones are
               considered to avoid quadratic time complexity.

           <b>iv-max-considered-uses</b>
               The induction variable optimizations give up on loops
               that contain more induction variable uses.

           <b>iv-always-prune-cand-set-bound</b>
               If the number of candidates in the set is smaller than
               this value, always try to remove unnecessary ivs from the
               set when adding a new one.

           <b>avg-loop-niter</b>
               Average number of iterations of a loop.

           <b>dse-max-object-size</b>
               Maximum size (in bytes) of objects tracked bytewise by
               dead store elimination.  Larger values may result in
               larger compilation times.

           <b>dse-max-alias-queries-per-store</b>
               Maximum number of queries into the alias oracle per
               store.  Larger values result in larger compilation times
               and may result in more removed dead stores.

           <b>scev-max-expr-size</b>
               Bound on size of expressions used in the scalar
               evolutions analyzer.  Large expressions slow the
               analyzer.

           <b>scev-max-expr-complexity</b>
               Bound on the complexity of the expressions in the scalar
               evolutions analyzer.  Complex expressions slow the
               analyzer.

           <b>max-tree-if-conversion-phi-args</b>
               Maximum number of arguments in a PHI supported by TREE if
               conversion unless the loop is marked with simd pragma.

           <b>vect-max-version-for-alignment-checks</b>
               The maximum number of run-time checks that can be
               performed when doing loop versioning for alignment in the
               vectorizer.

           <b>vect-max-version-for-alias-checks</b>
               The maximum number of run-time checks that can be

               vectorizer.

           <b>vect-max-peeling-for-alignment</b>
               The maximum number of loop peels to enhance access
               alignment for vectorizer. Value -1 means no limit.

           <b>max-iterations-to-track</b>
               The maximum number of iterations of a loop the brute-
               force algorithm for analysis of the number of iterations
               of the loop tries to evaluate.

           <b>hot-bb-count-ws-permille</b>
               A basic block profile count is considered hot if it
               contributes to the given permillage (i.e. 0...1000) of
               the entire profiled execution.

           <b>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</b>
               Select fraction of the entry block frequency of
               executions of basic block in function given basic block
               needs to have to be considered hot.

           <b>max-predicted-iterations</b>
               The maximum number of loop iterations we predict
               statically.  This is useful in cases where a function
               contains a single loop with known bound and another loop
               with unknown bound.  The known number of iterations is
               predicted correctly, while the unknown number of
               iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the
               loop without bounds appears artificially cold relative to
               the other one.

           <b>builtin-expect-probability</b>
               Control the probability of the expression having the
               specified value. This parameter takes a percentage (i.e.
               0 ... 100) as input.

           <b>builtin-string-cmp-inline-length</b>
               The maximum length of a constant string for a builtin
               string cmp call eligible for inlining.

           <b>align-threshold</b>
               Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of
               a basic block in a function to align the basic block.

           <b>align-loop-iterations</b>
               A loop expected to iterate at least the selected number
               of iterations is aligned.

           <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage</b>
           <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</b>
               This value is used to limit superblock formation once the
               given percentage of executed instructions is covered.
               This limits unnecessary code size expansion.

               The <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback </b>parameter is used
               only when profile feedback is available.  The real
               profiles (as opposed to statically estimated ones) are
               much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger
               value.

           <b>tracer-max-code-growth</b>
               Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given
               percentage.  This is a rather artificial limit, as most
               of the duplicates are eliminated later in cross jumping,
               so it may be set to much higher values than is the
               desired code growth.

           <b>tracer-min-branch-ratio</b>
               Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best
               edge is less than this threshold (in percent).

           <b>tracer-min-branch-probability</b>
           <b>tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback</b>
               Stop forward growth if the best edge has probability
               lower than this threshold.

               Similarly to <b>tracer-dynamic-coverage </b>two parameters are
               provided.  <b>tracer-min-branch-probability-feedback </b>is used
               for compilation with profile feedback and <b>tracer-min-</b>
               <b>branch-probability </b>compilation without.  The value for
               compilation with profile feedback needs to be more
               conservative (higher) in order to make tracer effective.

           <b>stack-clash-protection-guard-size</b>
               Specify the size of the operating system provided stack
               guard as 2 raised to <i>num</i> bytes.  Higher values may reduce
               the number of explicit probes, but a value larger than
               the operating system provided guard will leave code
               vulnerable to stack clash style attacks.

           <b>stack-clash-protection-probe-interval</b>
               Stack clash protection involves probing stack space as it
               is allocated.  This param controls the maximum distance
               between probes into the stack as 2 raised to <i>num</i> bytes.
               Higher values may reduce the number of explicit probes,
               but a value larger than the operating system provided
               guard will leave code vulnerable to stack clash style
               attacks.

           <b>max-cse-path-length</b>
               The maximum number of basic blocks on path that CSE
               considers.

           <b>max-cse-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions CSE processes before
               flushing.

           <b>ggc-min-expand</b>
               GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory
               allocation.  This parameter specifies the minimum
               percentage by which the garbage collector's heap should
               be allowed to expand between collections.  Tuning this
               may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
               generation.

               The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound
               of 100% when RAM &gt;= 1GB.  If "getrlimit" is available,
               the notion of "RAM" is the smallest of actual RAM and
               "RLIMIT_DATA" or "RLIMIT_AS".  If GCC is not able to
               calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower bound
               of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and <b>ggc-min-</b>
               <b>heapsize </b>to zero causes a full collection to occur at
               every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be
               useful for debugging.

           <b>ggc-min-heapsize</b>
               Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it
               begins bothering to collect garbage.  The first
               collection occurs after the heap expands by <b>ggc-min-</b>
               <b>expand</b>% beyond <b>ggc-min-heapsize</b>.  Again, tuning this may
               improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
               generation.

               The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a
               limit that tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS
               are not exceeded, but with a lower bound of 4096 (four
               megabytes) and an upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes).
               If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular
               platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this
               parameter very large effectively disables garbage
               collection.  Setting this parameter and <b>ggc-min-expand </b>to
               zero causes a full collection to occur at every
               opportunity.

           <b>max-reload-search-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instruction reload should look
               backward for equivalent register.  Increasing values mean
               more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time
               increase with probably slightly better performance.

           <b>max-cselib-memory-locations</b>
               The maximum number of memory locations cselib should take
               into account.  Increasing values mean more aggressive
               optimization, making the compilation time increase with
               probably slightly better performance.

           <b>max-sched-ready-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions ready to be issued the
               scheduler should consider at any given time during the
               first scheduling pass.  Increasing values mean more
               thorough searches, making the compilation time increase
               with probably little benefit.

           <b>max-sched-region-blocks</b>
               The maximum number of blocks in a region to be considered
               for interblock scheduling.

               The maximum number of insns in a region to be considered
               for pipelining in the selective scheduler.

           <b>min-spec-prob</b>
               The minimum probability (in percents) of reaching a
               source block for interblock speculative scheduling.

           <b>max-sched-extend-regions-iters</b>
               The maximum number of iterations through CFG to extend
               regions.  A value of 0 disables region extensions.

           <b>max-sched-insn-conflict-delay</b>
               The maximum conflict delay for an insn to be considered
               for speculative motion.

           <b>sched-spec-prob-cutoff</b>
               The minimal probability of speculation success (in
               percents), so that speculative insns are scheduled.

           <b>sched-state-edge-prob-cutoff</b>
               The minimum probability an edge must have for the
               scheduler to save its state across it.

           <b>sched-mem-true-dep-cost</b>
               Minimal distance (in CPU cycles) between store and load
               targeting same memory locations.

           <b>selsched-max-lookahead</b>
               The maximum size of the lookahead window of selective
               scheduling.  It is a depth of search for available
               instructions.

           <b>selsched-max-sched-times</b>
               The maximum number of times that an instruction is
               scheduled during selective scheduling.  This is the limit
               on the number of iterations through which the instruction
               may be pipelined.

           <b>selsched-insns-to-rename</b>
               The maximum number of best instructions in the ready list
               that are considered for renaming in the selective

           <b>sms-min-sc</b>
               The minimum value of stage count that swing modulo
               scheduler generates.

           <b>max-last-value-rtl</b>
               The maximum size measured as number of RTLs that can be
               recorded in an expression in combiner for a pseudo
               register as last known value of that register.

           <b>max-combine-insns</b>
               The maximum number of instructions the RTL combiner tries
               to combine.

           <b>integer-share-limit</b>
               Small integer constants can use a shared data structure,
               reducing the compiler's memory usage and increasing its
               speed.  This sets the maximum value of a shared integer
               constant.

           <b>ssp-buffer-size</b>
               The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that receive
               stack smashing protection when <b>-fstack-protection </b>is
               used.

           <b>min-size-for-stack-sharing</b>
               The minimum size of variables taking part in stack slot
               sharing when not optimizing.

           <b>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts</b>
               Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that
               needs to be duplicated when threading jumps.

           <b>max-fields-for-field-sensitive</b>
               Maximum number of fields in a structure treated in a
               field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.

           <b>prefetch-latency</b>
               Estimate on average number of instructions that are
               executed before prefetch finishes.  The distance
               prefetched ahead is proportional to this constant.
               Increasing this number may also lead to less streams
               being prefetched (see <b>simultaneous-prefetches</b>).

           <b>simultaneous-prefetches</b>
               Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same
               time.

           <b>l1-cache-line-size</b>
               The size of cache line in L1 data cache, in bytes.

           <b>l1-cache-size</b>
               The size of L1 data cache, in kilobytes.

           <b>l2-cache-size</b>
               The size of L2 data cache, in kilobytes.

           <b>prefetch-dynamic-strides</b>
               Whether the loop array prefetch pass should issue
               software prefetch hints for strides that are non-
               constant.  In some cases this may be beneficial, though
               the fact the stride is non-constant may make it hard to
               predict when there is clear benefit to issuing these
               hints.

               Set to 1 if the prefetch hints should be issued for non-
               constant strides.  Set to 0 if prefetch hints should be
               issued only for strides that are known to be constant and
               below <b>prefetch-minimum-stride</b>.

           <b>prefetch-minimum-stride</b>
               Minimum constant stride, in bytes, to start using
               prefetch hints for.  If the stride is less than this
               threshold, prefetch hints will not be issued.

               This setting is useful for processors that have hardware
               prefetchers, in which case there may be conflicts between
               the hardware prefetchers and the software prefetchers.
               If the hardware prefetchers have a maximum stride they
               can handle, it should be used here to improve the use of
               software prefetchers.

               A value of -1 means we don't have a threshold and
               therefore prefetch hints can be issued for any constant
               stride.

               This setting is only useful for strides that are known
               and constant.

           <b>loop-interchange-max-num-stmts</b>
               The maximum number of stmts in a loop to be interchanged.

           <b>loop-interchange-stride-ratio</b>
               The minimum ratio between stride of two loops for
               interchange to be profitable.

           <b>min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio</b>
               The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and
               the number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop.

           <b>prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio</b>
               The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and
               the number of memory references to enable prefetching in
               a loop.

           <b>use-canonical-types</b>
               Whether the compiler should use the "canonical" type
               system.  Should always be 1, which uses a more efficient
               internal mechanism for comparing types in C++ and
               Objective-C++.  However, if bugs in the canonical type
               system are causing compilation failures, set this value
               to 0 to disable canonical types.

           <b>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</b>
               Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays
               that are bigger than <b>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</b>
               times the number of branches in the switch.

           <b>max-partial-antic-length</b>
               Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during
               the tree partial redundancy elimination optimization
               (<b>-ftree-pre</b>) when optimizing at <b>-O3 </b>and above.  For some
               sorts of source code the enhanced partial redundancy
               elimination optimization can run away, consuming all of
               the memory available on the host machine.  This parameter
               sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
               which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of
               0 for this parameter allows an unlimited set length.

           <b>rpo-vn-max-loop-depth</b>
               Maximum loop depth that is value-numbered optimistically.
               When the limit hits the innermost <i>rpo-vn-max-loop-depth</i>
               loops and the outermost loop in the loop nest are value-
               numbered optimistically and the remaining ones not.

           <b>sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access</b>
               Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when
               looking for redundancies for loads and stores.  If this
               limit is hit the search is aborted and the load or store
               is not considered redundant.  The number of queries is
               algorithmically limited to the number of stores on all
               paths from the load to the function entry.

           <b>ira-max-loops-num</b>
               IRA uses regional register allocation by default.  If a
               function contains more loops than the number given by
               this parameter, only at most the given number of the most
               frequently-executed loops form regions for regional
               register allocation.

           <b>ira-max-conflict-table-size</b>
               Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress
               the conflict table, the table can still require excessive
               amounts of memory for huge functions.  If the conflict
               table for a function could be more than the size in MB
               given by this parameter, the register allocator instead
               uses a faster, simpler, and lower-quality algorithm that
               does not require building a pseudo-register conflict
               table.

           <b>ira-loop-reserved-regs</b>
               IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register
               pressure in loops for decisions to move loop invariants
               (see <b>-O3</b>).  The number of available registers reserved
               for some other purposes is given by this parameter.
               Default of the parameter is the best found from numerous
               experiments.

           <b>lra-inheritance-ebb-probability-cutoff</b>
               LRA tries to reuse values reloaded in registers in
               subsequent insns.  This optimization is called
               inheritance.  EBB is used as a region to do this
               optimization.  The parameter defines a minimal fall-
               through edge probability in percentage used to add BB to
               inheritance EBB in LRA.  The default value was chosen
               from numerous runs of SPEC2000 on x86-64.

           <b>loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop</b>
               Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in
               compilation time and in amount of needed compile-time
               memory, with very large loops.  Loops with more basic
               blocks than this parameter won't have loop invariant
               motion optimization performed on them.

           <b>loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps</b>
               Building data dependencies is expensive for very large
               loops.  This parameter limits the number of data
               references in loops that are considered for data
               dependence analysis.  These large loops are no handled by
               the optimizations using loop data dependencies.

           <b>max-vartrack-size</b>
               Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during
               variable tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If
               this limit is exceeded with variable tracking at
               assignments enabled, analysis for that function is
               retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
               the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without
               debug insns, var tracking analysis is completely disabled
               for the function.  Setting the parameter to zero makes it
               unlimited.

           <b>max-vartrack-expr-depth</b>
               Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting
               to map variable names or debug temporaries to value
               expressions.  This trades compilation time for more
               complete debug information.  If this is set too low,
               value expressions that are available and could be
               represented in debug information may end up not being
               used; setting this higher may enable the compiler to find
               more complex debug expressions, but compile time and
               memory use may grow.

           <b>max-debug-marker-count</b>
               Sets a threshold on the number of debug markers (e.g.
               begin stmt markers) to avoid complexity explosion at
               inlining or expanding to RTL.  If a function has more
               such gimple stmts than the set limit, such stmts will be
               dropped from the inlined copy of a function, and from its
               RTL expansion.

           <b>min-nondebug-insn-uid</b>
               Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.
               The range below the parameter is reserved exclusively for
               debug insns created by <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments</b>, but
               debug insns may get (non-overlapping) uids above it if
               the reserved range is exhausted.

           <b>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</b>
               IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one or
               more new parameters only when their cumulative size is
               less or equal to <b>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor </b>times the size
               of the original pointer parameter.

           <b>sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</b>
           <b>sra-max-scalarization-size-Osize</b>
               The two Scalar Reduction of Aggregates passes (SRA and
               IPA-SRA) aim to replace scalar parts of aggregates with
               uses of independent scalar variables.  These parameters
               control the maximum size, in storage units, of aggregate
               which is considered for replacement when compiling for
               speed (<b>sra-max-scalarization-size-Ospeed</b>) or size (<b>sra-</b>
               <b>max-scalarization-size-Osize</b>) respectively.

           <b>sra-max-propagations</b>
               The maximum number of artificial accesses that Scalar
               Replacement of Aggregates (SRA) will track, per one local
               variable, in order to facilitate copy propagation.

           <b>tm-max-aggregate-size</b>
               When making copies of thread-local variables in a
               transaction, this parameter specifies the size in bytes
               after which variables are saved with the logging
               functions as opposed to save/restore code sequence pairs.
               This option only applies when using <b>-fgnu-tm</b>.

           <b>graphite-max-nb-scop-params</b>
               To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop
               transforms, the number of parameters in a Static Control
               Part (SCoP) is bounded.  A value of zero can be used to
               lift the bound.  A variable whose value is unknown at
               compilation time and defined outside a SCoP is a
               parameter of the SCoP.

           <b>loop-block-tile-size</b>
               Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
               <b>-floop-block </b>or <b>-floop-strip-mine</b>, strip mine each loop
               in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The
               strip length can be changed using the <b>loop-block-tile-</b>
               <b>size </b>parameter.

           <b>ipa-cp-value-list-size</b>
               IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types
               passed to a function's parameter in order to propagate
               them and perform devirtualization.  <b>ipa-cp-value-list-</b>
               <b>size </b>is the maximum number of values and types it stores
               per one formal parameter of a function.

           <b>ipa-cp-eval-threshold</b>
               IPA-CP calculates its own score of cloning profitability
               heuristics and performs those cloning opportunities with
               scores that exceed <b>ipa-cp-eval-threshold</b>.

           <b>ipa-cp-recursion-penalty</b>
               Percentage penalty the recursive functions will receive
               when they are evaluated for cloning.

           <b>ipa-cp-single-call-penalty</b>
               Percentage penalty functions containing a single call to
               another function will receive when they are evaluated for
               cloning.

           <b>ipa-max-agg-items</b>
               IPA-CP is also capable to propagate a number of scalar
               values passed in an aggregate. <b>ipa-max-agg-items </b>controls
               the maximum number of such values per one parameter.

           <b>ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus</b>
               When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would
               make the number of iterations of a loop known, it adds a
               bonus of <b>ipa-cp-loop-hint-bonus </b>to the profitability
               score of the candidate.

           <b>ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus</b>
               When IPA-CP determines that a cloning candidate would
               make the index of an array access known, it adds a bonus
               of <b>ipa-cp-array-index-hint-bonus </b>to the profitability
               score of the candidate.

           <b>ipa-max-aa-steps</b>
               During its analysis of function bodies, IPA-CP employs
               alias analysis in order to track values pointed to by
               function parameters.  In order not spend too much time
               analyzing huge functions, it gives up and consider all
               memory clobbered after examining <b>ipa-max-aa-steps</b>

               small programs into too many partitions.

           <b>lto-max-partition</b>
               Size of max partition for WHOPR (in estimated

               implementation and is the more likely to prevent
               instructions from being reordered.  Algorithm 2 was
               designed to be a compromise between the relatively
               conservative approach taken by algorithm 1 and the rather
               aggressive approach taken by the default scheduler.  It
               relies more heavily on having a regular register file and

               determining their validity prior to issuing diagnostics.

   <b>Program Instrumentation Options</b>
       GCC supports a number of command-line options that control adding
       run-time instrumentation to the code it normally generates.  For
       example, one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling
       statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage
       analysis, or profile-guided optimizations.  Another class of
       program instrumentation is adding run-time checking to detect
       programming errors like invalid pointer dereferences or out-of-
       bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately hostile attacks
       such as stack smashing or C++ vtable hijacking.  There is also a
       general hook which can be used to implement other forms of
       tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or program
       analysis purposes.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>-pg </b>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for
           the analysis program <b>prof </b>(for <b>-p</b>) or <b>gprof </b>(for <b>-pg</b>).  You
           must use this option when compiling the source files you want
           data about, and you must also use it when linking.

           You can use the function attribute "no_instrument_function"
           to suppress profiling of individual functions when compiling
           with these options.

       <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>
           Add code so that program flow <i>arcs</i> are instrumented.  During
           execution the program records how many times each branch and
           call is executed and how many times it is taken or returns.
           On targets that support constructors with priority support,
           profiling properly handles constructors, destructors and C++
           constructors (and destructors) of classes which are used as a
           type of a global variable.

           When the compiled program exits it saves this data to a file
           called <i>auxname.gcda</i> for each source file.  The data may be
           used for profile-directed optimizations
           (<b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>), or for test coverage analysis
           (<b>-ftest-coverage</b>).  Each object file's <i>auxname</i> is generated
           from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and
           it is not the final executable, otherwise it is the basename
           of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
           (e.g. <i>foo.gcda</i> for input file <i>dir/foo.c</i>, or <i>dir/foo.gcda</i> for
           output file specified as <b>-o dir/foo.o</b>).

       <b>--coverage</b>
           This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for
           coverage analysis.  The option is a synonym for
           <b>-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage </b>(when compiling) and <b>-lgcov</b>
           (when linking).  See the documentation for those options for
           more details.

           *   Compile the source files with <b>-fprofile-arcs </b>plus
               optimization and code generation options.  For test
               coverage analysis, use the additional <b>-ftest-coverage</b>
               option.  You do not need to profile every source file in
               a program.

           *   Compile the source files additionally with
               <b>-fprofile-abs-path </b>to create absolute path names in the
               <i>.gcno</i> files.  This allows <b>gcov </b>to find the correct
               sources in projects where compilations occur with
               different working directories.

           *   Link your object files with <b>-lgcov </b>or <b>-fprofile-arcs </b>(the
               latter implies the former).

           *   Run the program on a representative workload to generate
               the arc profile information.  This may be repeated any
               number of times.  You can run concurrent instances of
               your program, and provided that the file system supports
               locking, the data files will be correctly updated.
               Unless a strict ISO C dialect option is in effect, "fork"
               calls are detected and correctly handled without double
               counting.

           *   For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source
               files again with the same optimization and code
               generation options plus <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>.

           *   For test coverage analysis, use <b>gcov </b>to produce human
               readable information from the <i>.gcno</i> and <i>.gcda</i> files.
               Refer to the <b>gcov </b>documentation for further information.

           With <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, for each function of your program GCC
           creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for
           the graph.  Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have
           to be instrumented: the compiler adds code to count the
           number of times that these arcs are executed.  When an arc is
           the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
           instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a
           new basic block must be created to hold the instrumentation
           code.

       <b>-ftest-coverage</b>
           Produce a notes file that the <b>gcov </b>code-coverage utility can
           use to show program coverage.  Each source file's note file
           is called <i>auxname.gcno</i>.  Refer to the <b>-fprofile-arcs </b>option
           above for a description of <i>auxname</i> and instructions on how to
           generate test coverage data.  Coverage data matches the
           source files more closely if you do not optimize.

       <b>-fprofile-abs-path</b>
           Automatically convert relative source file names to absolute
           path names in the <i>.gcno</i> files.  This allows <b>gcov </b>to find the
           correct sources in projects where compilations occur with
           different working directories.

       <b>-fprofile-dir=</b><i>path</i>
           Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to
           <i>path</i>.  This option affects only the profile data generated by
           <b>-fprofile-generate</b>, <b>-ftest-coverage</b>, <b>-fprofile-arcs </b>and used
           by <b>-fprofile-use </b>and <b>-fbranch-probabilities </b>and its related
           options.  Both absolute and relative paths can be used.  By
           default, GCC uses the current directory as <i>path</i>, thus the
           profile data file appears in the same directory as the object
           file.  In order to prevent the file name clashing, if the
           object file name is not an absolute path, we mangle the
           absolute path of the <i>sourcename.gcda</i> file and use it as the
           file name of a <i>.gcda</i> file.

           When an executable is run in a massive parallel environment,
           it is recommended to save profile to different folders.  That
           can be done with variables in <i>path</i> that are exported during
           run-time:

           <b>%p  </b>process ID.

           <b>%q{VAR}</b>
               value of environment variable <i>VAR</i>

       <b>-fprofile-generate</b>
       <b>-fprofile-generate=</b><i>path</i>
           Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to
           produce profile useful for later recompilation with profile
           feedback based optimization.  You must use <b>-fprofile-generate</b>
           both when compiling and when linking your program.

           The following options are enabled: <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>,
           <b>-fprofile-values</b>, <b>-finline-functions</b>, and <b>-fipa-bit-cp</b>.

           If <i>path</i> is specified, GCC looks at the <i>path</i> to find the
           profile feedback data files. See <b>-fprofile-dir</b>.

           To optimize the program based on the collected profile
           information, use <b>-fprofile-use</b>.

       <b>-fprofile-update=</b><i>method</i>
           Alter the update method for an application instrumented for
           profile feedback based optimization.  The <i>method</i> argument
           should be one of <b>single</b>, <b>atomic </b>or <b>prefer-atomic</b>.  The first
           one is useful for single-threaded applications, while the
           second one prevents profile corruption by emitting thread-
           safe code.

           <b>Warning: </b>When an application does not properly join all
           threads (or creates an detached thread), a profile file can
           be still corrupted.

           Using <b>prefer-atomic </b>would be transformed either to <b>atomic</b>,
           when supported by a target, or to <b>single </b>otherwise.  The GCC
           driver automatically selects <b>prefer-atomic </b>when <b>-pthread </b>is
           present in the command line.

       <b>-fprofile-filter-files=</b><i>regex</i>
           Instrument only functions from files where names match any
           regular expression (separated by a semi-colon).

           For example, <b>-fprofile-filter-files=main.c;module.*.c </b>will
           instrument only <i>main.c</i> and all C files starting with
           'module'.

       <b>-fprofile-exclude-files=</b><i>regex</i>
           Instrument only functions from files where names do not match
           all the regular expressions (separated by a semi-colon).

           For example, <b>-fprofile-exclude-files=/usr/* </b>will prevent
           instrumentation of all files that are located in <i>/usr/</i>
           folder.

       <b>-fsanitize=address</b>
           Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector.
           Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect out-of-
           bounds and use-after-free bugs.  The option enables
           <b>-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope</b>.  See
           &lt;<b><a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer</a> </b>&gt;
           for more details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced
           using the <b>ASAN_OPTIONS </b>environment variable.  When set to
           "help=1", the available options are shown at startup of the
           instrumented program.  See
           &lt;<b><a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags</a> </b>&gt;
           for a list of supported options.  The option cannot be
           combined with <b>-fsanitize=thread</b>.

       <b>-fsanitize=kernel-address</b>
           Enable AddressSanitizer for Linux kernel.  See
           &lt;<b><a href="https://github.com/google/kasan/wiki">https://github.com/google/kasan/wiki</a> </b>&gt; for more details.

       <b>-fsanitize=pointer-compare</b>
           Instrument comparison operation (&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=) with pointer
           operands.  The option must be combined with either
           <b>-fsanitize=kernel-address </b>or <b>-fsanitize=address </b>The option
           cannot be combined with <b>-fsanitize=thread</b>.  Note: By default
           the check is disabled at run time.  To enable it, add
           "detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=2" to the environment variable
           <b>ASAN_OPTIONS</b>. Using "detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=1" detects
           invalid operation only when both pointers are non-null.

       <b>-fsanitize=pointer-subtract</b>
           Instrument subtraction with pointer operands.  The option
           must be combined with either <b>-fsanitize=kernel-address </b>or
           <b>-fsanitize=address </b>The option cannot be combined with
           <b>-fsanitize=thread</b>.  Note: By default the check is disabled at
           run time.  To enable it, add "detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=2"
           to the environment variable <b>ASAN_OPTIONS</b>. Using
           "detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=1" detects invalid operation
           only when both pointers are non-null.

       <b>-fsanitize=thread</b>
           Enable ThreadSanitizer, a fast data race detector.  Memory
           access instructions are instrumented to detect data race
           bugs.  See
           &lt;<b><a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer</a> </b>&gt;
           for more details. The run-time behavior can be influenced
           using the <b>TSAN_OPTIONS </b>environment variable; see
           &lt;<b><a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags</a> </b>&gt;
           for a list of supported options.  The option cannot be
           combined with <b>-fsanitize=address</b>, <b>-fsanitize=leak</b>.

           Note that sanitized atomic builtins cannot throw exceptions
           when operating on invalid memory addresses with non-call
           exceptions (<b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>).

       <b>-fsanitize=leak</b>
           Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector.  This option
           only matters for linking of executables and the executable is
           linked against a library that overrides "malloc" and other
           allocator functions.  See
           &lt;<b><a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer">https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer</a> </b>&gt;
           for more details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced
           using the <b>LSAN_OPTIONS </b>environment variable.  The option
           cannot be combined with <b>-fsanitize=thread</b>.

       <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b>
           Enable UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, a fast undefined behavior
           detector.  Various computations are instrumented to detect
           undefined behavior at runtime.  See
           &lt;<b><a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html</a> </b>&gt;
           for more details.   The run-time behavior can be influenced
           using the <b>UBSAN_OPTIONS </b>environment variable.  Current
           suboptions are:

           <b>-fsanitize=shift</b>
               This option enables checking that the result of a shift
               operation is not undefined.  Note that what exactly is
               considered undefined differs slightly between C and C++,
               as well as between ISO C90 and C99, etc.  This option has
               two suboptions, <b>-fsanitize=shift-base </b>and
               <b>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</b>.

           <b>-fsanitize=shift-exponent</b>
               This option enables checking that the second argument of
               a shift operation is not negative and is smaller than the
               precision of the promoted first argument.

           <b>-fsanitize=shift-base</b>
               If the second argument of a shift operation is within
               range, check that the result of a shift operation is not
               undefined.  Note that what exactly is considered
               undefined differs slightly between C and C++, as well as
               between ISO C90 and C99, etc.

           <b>-fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero</b>
               Detect integer division by zero as well as "INT_MIN / -1"
               division.

           <b>-fsanitize=unreachable</b>
               With this option, the compiler turns the
               "__builtin_unreachable" call into a diagnostics message
               call instead.  When reaching the "__builtin_unreachable"
               call, the behavior is undefined.

           <b>-fsanitize=vla-bound</b>
               This option instructs the compiler to check that the size
               of a variable length array is positive.

           <b>-fsanitize=null</b>
               This option enables pointer checking.  Particularly, the
               application built with this option turned on will issue
               an error message when it tries to dereference a NULL
               pointer, or if a reference (possibly an rvalue reference)
               is bound to a NULL pointer, or if a method is invoked on
               an object pointed by a NULL pointer.

           <b>-fsanitize=return</b>
               This option enables return statement checking.  Programs
               built with this option turned on will issue an error
               message when the end of a non-void function is reached
               without actually returning a value.  This option works in
               C++ only.

           <b>-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow</b>
               This option enables signed integer overflow checking.  We
               check that the result of "+", "*", and both unary and
               binary "-" does not overflow in the signed arithmetics.
               Note, integer promotion rules must be taken into account.
               That is, the following is not an overflow:

                       signed char a = SCHAR_MAX;
                       a++;

           <b>-fsanitize=bounds</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of array bounds.
               Various out of bounds accesses are detected.  Flexible
               array members, flexible array member-like arrays, and
               initializers of variables with static storage are not
               instrumented.

           <b>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</b>
               This option enables strict instrumentation of array
               bounds.  Most out of bounds accesses are detected,
               including flexible array members and flexible array
               member-like arrays.  Initializers of variables with
               static storage are not instrumented.

           <b>-fsanitize=alignment</b>
               This option enables checking of alignment of pointers
               when they are dereferenced, or when a reference is bound
               to insufficiently aligned target, or when a method or
               constructor is invoked on insufficiently aligned object.

           <b>-fsanitize=object-size</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of memory references
               using the "__builtin_object_size" function.  Various out
               of bounds pointer accesses are detected.

           <b>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</b>
               Detect floating-point division by zero.  Unlike other
               similar options, <b>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero </b>is not
               enabled by <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b>, since floating-point
               division by zero can be a legitimate way of obtaining
               infinities and NaNs.

           <b>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</b>
               This option enables floating-point type to integer
               conversion checking.  We check that the result of the
               conversion does not overflow.  Unlike other similar
               options, <b>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow </b>is not enabled by
               <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b>.  This option does not work well
               with "FE_INVALID" exceptions enabled.

           <b>-fsanitize=nonnull-attribute</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of calls, checking
               whether null values are not passed to arguments marked as
               requiring a non-null value by the "nonnull" function
               attribute.

           <b>-fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of return statements
               in functions marked with "returns_nonnull" function
               attribute, to detect returning of null values from such
               functions.

           <b>-fsanitize=bool</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of loads from bool.
               If a value other than 0/1 is loaded, a run-time error is
               issued.

           <b>-fsanitize=enum</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of loads from an enum
               type.  If a value outside the range of values for the
               enum type is loaded, a run-time error is issued.

           <b>-fsanitize=vptr</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of C++ member
               function calls, member accesses and some conversions
               between pointers to base and derived classes, to verify
               the referenced object has the correct dynamic type.

           <b>-fsanitize=pointer-overflow</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of pointer
               arithmetics.  If the pointer arithmetics overflows, a
               run-time error is issued.

           <b>-fsanitize=builtin</b>
               This option enables instrumentation of arguments to
               selected builtin functions.  If an invalid value is
               passed to such arguments, a run-time error is issued.
               E.g. passing 0 as the argument to "__builtin_ctz" or
               "__builtin_clz" invokes undefined behavior and is
               diagnosed by this option.

           While <b>-ftrapv </b>causes traps for signed overflows to be
           emitted, <b>-fsanitize=undefined </b>gives a diagnostic message.
           This currently works only for the C family of languages.

       <b>-fno-sanitize=all</b>
           This option disables all previously enabled sanitizers.
           <b>-fsanitize=all </b>is not allowed, as some sanitizers cannot be
           used together.

       <b>-fasan-shadow-offset=</b><i>number</i>
           This option forces GCC to use custom shadow offset in
           AddressSanitizer checks.  It is useful for experimenting with
           different shadow memory layouts in Kernel AddressSanitizer.

       <b>-fsanitize-sections=</b><i>s1</i><b>,</b><i>s2</i><b>,...</b>
           Sanitize global variables in selected user-defined sections.
           <i>si</i> may contain wildcards.

       <b>-fsanitize-recover</b>[<b>=</b><i>opts</i>]
           <b>-fsanitize-recover= </b>controls error recovery mode for
           sanitizers mentioned in comma-separated list of <i>opts</i>.
           Enabling this option for a sanitizer component causes it to
           attempt to continue running the program as if no error
           happened.  This means multiple runtime errors can be reported
           in a single program run, and the exit code of the program may
           indicate success even when errors have been reported.  The
           <b>-fno-sanitize-recover= </b>option can be used to alter this
           behavior: only the first detected error is reported and
           program then exits with a non-zero exit code.

           Currently this feature only works for <b>-fsanitize=undefined</b>
           (and its suboptions except for <b>-fsanitize=unreachable </b>and
           <b>-fsanitize=return</b>), <b>-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow</b>,
           <b>-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero</b>, <b>-fsanitize=bounds-strict</b>,
           <b>-fsanitize=kernel-address </b>and <b>-fsanitize=address</b>.  For these
           sanitizers error recovery is turned on by default, except
           <b>-fsanitize=address</b>, for which this feature is experimental.
           <b>-fsanitize-recover=all </b>and <b>-fno-sanitize-recover=all </b>is also
           accepted, the former enables recovery for all sanitizers that
           support it, the latter disables recovery for all sanitizers
           that support it.

           Even if a recovery mode is turned on the compiler side, it
           needs to be also enabled on the runtime library side,
           otherwise the failures are still fatal.  The runtime library
           defaults to "halt_on_error=0" for ThreadSanitizer and
           UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, while default value for
           AddressSanitizer is "halt_on_error=1". This can be overridden
           through setting the "halt_on_error" flag in the corresponding
           environment variable.

           Syntax without an explicit <i>opts</i> parameter is deprecated.  It
           is equivalent to specifying an <i>opts</i> list of:

                   undefined,float-cast-overflow,float-divide-by-zero,bounds-strict

       <b>-fsanitize-address-use-after-scope</b>
           Enable sanitization of local variables to detect use-after-
           scope bugs.  The option sets <b>-fstack-reuse </b>to <b>none</b>.

       <b>-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error</b>
           The <b>-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error </b>option instructs the
           compiler to report undefined behavior using "__builtin_trap"
           rather than a "libubsan" library routine.  The advantage of
           this is that the "libubsan" library is not needed and is not
           linked in, so this is usable even in freestanding
           environments.

       <b>-fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc</b>
           Enable coverage-guided fuzzing code instrumentation.  Inserts
           a call to "__sanitizer_cov_trace_pc" into every basic block.

       <b>-fsanitize-coverage=trace-cmp</b>
           Enable dataflow guided fuzzing code instrumentation.  Inserts
           a call to "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp1",
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp2", "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp4" or
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmp8" for integral comparison with
           both operands variable or "__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp1",
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp2",
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp4" or
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_const_cmp8" for integral comparison
           with one operand constant, "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmpf" or
           "__sanitizer_cov_trace_cmpd" for float or double comparisons
           and "__sanitizer_cov_trace_switch" for switch statements.

       <b>-fcf-protection=</b>[<b>full</b>|<b>branch</b>|<b>return</b>|<b>none</b>]
           Enable code instrumentation of control-flow transfers to
           increase program security by checking that target addresses
           of control-flow transfer instructions (such as indirect
           function call, function return, indirect jump) are valid.
           This prevents diverting the flow of control to an unexpected
           target.  This is intended to protect against such threats as
           Return-oriented Programming (ROP), and similarly
           call/jmp-oriented programming (COP/JOP).

           The value "branch" tells the compiler to implement checking
           of validity of control-flow transfer at the point of indirect
           branch instructions, i.e. call/jmp instructions.  The value
           "return" implements checking of validity at the point of
           returning from a function.  The value "full" is an alias for
           specifying both "branch" and "return". The value "none" turns
           off instrumentation.

           The macro "__CET__" is defined when <b>-fcf-protection </b>is used.
           The first bit of "__CET__" is set to 1 for the value "branch"
           and the second bit of "__CET__" is set to 1 for the "return".

           You can also use the "nocf_check" attribute to identify which
           functions and calls should be skipped from instrumentation.

           Currently the x86 GNU/Linux target provides an implementation
           based on Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET)
           which works for i686 processor or newer.

       <b>-fstack-protector</b>
           Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack
           smashing attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to
           functions with vulnerable objects.  This includes functions
           that call "alloca", and functions with buffers larger than 8
           bytes.  The guards are initialized when a function is entered
           and then checked when the function exits.  If a guard check
           fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.

       <b>-fstack-protector-all</b>
           Like <b>-fstack-protector </b>except that all functions are
           protected.

       <b>-fstack-protector-strong</b>
           Like <b>-fstack-protector </b>but includes additional functions to
           be protected --- those that have local array definitions, or
           have references to local frame addresses.

       <b>-fstack-protector-explicit</b>
           Like <b>-fstack-protector </b>but only protects those functions
           which have the "stack_protect" attribute.

       <b>-fstack-check</b>
           Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the
           boundary of the stack.  You should specify this flag if you
           are running in an environment with multiple threads, but you
           only rarely need to specify it in a single-threaded
           environment since stack overflow is automatically detected on
           nearly all systems if there is only one stack.

           Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be
           done; the operating system or the language runtime must do
           that.  The switch causes generation of code to ensure that
           they see the stack being extended.

           You can additionally specify a string parameter: <b>no </b>means no
           checking, <b>generic </b>means force the use of old-style checking,
           <b>specific </b>means use the best checking method and is equivalent
           to bare <b>-fstack-check</b>.

           Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no
           specific target support in the compiler but comes with the
           following drawbacks:

           1.  Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are
               always allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a
               fixed threshold.  Note this may change the semantics of
               some code.

           2.  Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions:
               when it is topped by a particular function, stack
               checking is not reliable and a warning is issued by the
               compiler.

           3.  Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation
               strategy and the generic implementation, code performance
               is hampered.

           Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback
           method for <b>specific </b>if no target support has been added in
           the compiler.

           <b>-fstack-check= </b>is designed for Ada's needs to detect infinite
           recursion and stack overflows.  <b>specific </b>is an excellent
           choice when compiling Ada code.  It is not generally
           sufficient to protect against stack-clash attacks.  To
           protect against those you want <b>-fstack-clash-protection</b>.

       <b>-fstack-clash-protection</b>
           Generate code to prevent stack clash style attacks.  When
           this option is enabled, the compiler will only allocate one
           page of stack space at a time and each page is accessed
           immediately after allocation.  Thus, it prevents allocations
           from jumping over any stack guard page provided by the
           operating system.

           Most targets do not fully support stack clash protection.
           However, on those targets <b>-fstack-clash-protection </b>will
           protect dynamic stack allocations.  <b>-fstack-clash-protection</b>
           may also provide limited protection for static stack
           allocations if the target supports <b>-fstack-check=specific</b>.

       <b>-fstack-limit-register=</b><i>reg</i>
       <b>-fstack-limit-symbol=</b><i>sym</i>
       <b>-fno-stack-limit</b>
           Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a
           certain value, either the value of a register or the address
           of a symbol.  If a larger stack is required, a signal is
           raised at run time.  For most targets, the signal is raised
           before the stack overruns the boundary, so it is possible to
           catch the signal without taking special precautions.

           For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address
           <b>0x80000000 </b>and grows downwards, you can use the flags
           <b>-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit </b>and
           <b>-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000 </b>to enforce a stack
           limit of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU
           linker.

           You can locally override stack limit checking by using the
           "no_stack_limit" function attribute.

       <b>-fsplit-stack</b>
           Generate code to automatically split the stack before it
           overflows.  The resulting program has a discontiguous stack
           which can only overflow if the program is unable to allocate
           any more memory.  This is most useful when running threaded
           programs, as it is no longer necessary to calculate a good
           stack size to use for each thread.  This is currently only
           implemented for the x86 targets running GNU/Linux.

           When code compiled with <b>-fsplit-stack </b>calls code compiled
           without <b>-fsplit-stack</b>, there may not be much stack space
           available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
           including library code, with <b>-fsplit-stack </b>is not an option,
           then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code
           compiled without <b>-fsplit-stack </b>always has a large stack.
           Support for this is implemented in the gold linker in GNU
           binutils release 2.21 and later.

       <b>-fvtable-verify=</b>[<b>std</b>|<b>preinit</b>|<b>none</b>]
           This option is only available when compiling C++ code.  It
           turns on (or off, if using <b>-fvtable-verify=none</b>) the security
           feature that verifies at run time, for every virtual call,
           that the vtable pointer through which the call is made is
           valid for the type of the object, and has not been corrupted
           or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable pointer is detected at
           run time, an error is reported and execution of the program
           is immediately halted.

           This option causes run-time data structures to be built at
           program startup, which are used for verifying the vtable
           pointers.  The options <b>std </b>and <b>preinit </b>control the timing of
           when these data structures are built.  In both cases the data
           structures are built before execution reaches "main".  Using
           <b>-fvtable-verify=std </b>causes the data structures to be built
           after shared libraries have been loaded and initialized.
           <b>-fvtable-verify=preinit </b>causes them to be built before shared
           libraries have been loaded and initialized.

           If this option appears multiple times in the command line
           with different values specified, <b>none </b>takes highest priority
           over both <b>std </b>and <b>preinit</b>; <b>preinit </b>takes priority over <b>std</b>.

       <b>-fvtv-debug</b>
           When used in conjunction with <b>-fvtable-verify=std </b>or
           <b>-fvtable-verify=preinit</b>, causes debug versions of the runtime
           functions for the vtable verification feature to be called.
           This flag also causes the compiler to log information about
           which vtable pointers it finds for each class.  This
           information is written to a file named <i>vtv_set_ptr_data.log</i>
           in the directory named by the environment variable
           <b>VTV_LOGS_DIR </b>if that is defined or the current working
           directory otherwise.

           Note:  This feature <i>appends</i> data to the log file. If you want
           a fresh log file, be sure to delete any existing one.

       <b>-fvtv-counts</b>
           This is a debugging flag.  When used in conjunction with
           <b>-fvtable-verify=std </b>or <b>-fvtable-verify=preinit</b>, this causes
           the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual
           calls it encounters and the number of verifications it
           inserts.  It also counts the number of calls to certain run-
           time library functions that it inserts and logs this
           information for each compilation unit.  The compiler writes
           this information to a file named <i>vtv_count_data.log</i> in the
           directory named by the environment variable <b>VTV_LOGS_DIR </b>if
           that is defined or the current working directory otherwise.
           It also counts the size of the vtable pointer sets for each
           class, and writes this information to <i>vtv_class_set_sizes.log</i>
           in the same directory.

           Note:  This feature <i>appends</i> data to the log files.  To get
           fresh log files, be sure to delete any existing ones.

       <b>-finstrument-functions</b>
           Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to
           functions.  Just after function entry and just before
           function exit, the following profiling functions are called
           with the address of the current function and its call site.
           (On some platforms, "__builtin_return_address" does not work
           beyond the current function, so the call site information may
           not be available to the profiling functions otherwise.)

                   void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                                  void *call_site);
                   void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                                  void *call_site);

           The first argument is the address of the start of the current
           function, which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.

           This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded
           inline in other functions.  The profiling calls indicate
           where, conceptually, the inline function is entered and
           exited.  This means that addressable versions of such
           functions must be available.  If all your uses of a function
           are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
           code size.  If you use "extern inline" in your C code, an
           addressable version of such functions must be provided.
           (This is normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and
           the optimizer always expands the functions inline, you might
           have gotten away without providing static copies.)

           A function may be given the attribute
           "no_instrument_function", in which case this instrumentation
           is not done.  This can be used, for example, for the
           profiling functions listed above, high-priority interrupt
           routines, and any functions from which the profiling
           functions cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers,
           if the profiling routines generate output or allocate
           memory).

       <b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=</b><i>file</i><b>,</b><i>file</i><b>,...</b>
           Set the list of functions that are excluded from
           instrumentation (see the description of
           <b>-finstrument-functions</b>).  If the file that contains a
           function definition matches with one of <i>file</i>, then that
           function is not instrumented.  The match is done on
           substrings: if the <i>file</i> parameter is a substring of the file
           name, it is considered to be a match.

           For example:

                   -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys

           excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
           contain <i>/bits/stl</i> or <i>include/sys</i>.

           If, for some reason, you want to include letter <b>, </b>in one of
           <i>sym</i>, write <b>,</b>. For example,
           <b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=',,tmp' </b>(note the
           single quote surrounding the option).

       <b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=</b><i>sym</i><b>,</b><i>sym</i><b>,...</b>
           This is similar to <b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</b>,
           but this option sets the list of function names to be
           excluded from instrumentation.  The function name to be
           matched is its user-visible name, such as "vector&lt;int&gt;
           blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)", not the internal mangled name
           (e.g., "_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE").  The match is done on
           substrings: if the <i>sym</i> parameter is a substring of the
           function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and
           C++ extended identifiers, the function name must be given in
           UTF-8, not using universal character names.

       <b>-fpatchable-function-entry=</b><i>N</i><b>[,</b><i>M</i><b>]</b>
           Generate <i>N</i> NOPs right at the beginning of each function, with
           the function entry point before the <i>M</i>th NOP.  If <i>M</i> is
           omitted, it defaults to 0 so the function entry points to the
           address just at the first NOP.  The NOP instructions reserve
           extra space which can be used to patch in any desired
           instrumentation at run time, provided that the code segment
           is writable.  The amount of space is controllable indirectly
           via the number of NOPs; the NOP instruction used corresponds
           to the instruction emitted by the internal GCC back-end
           interface "gen_nop".  This behavior is target-specific and
           may also depend on the architecture variant and/or other
           compilation options.

           For run-time identification, the starting addresses of these
           areas, which correspond to their respective function entries
           minus <i>M</i>, are additionally collected in the
           "__patchable_function_entries" section of the resulting
           binary.

           Note that the value of "__attribute__
           ((patchable_function_entry (N,M)))" takes precedence over
           command-line option <b>-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</b>.  This can
           be used to increase the area size or to remove it completely
           on a single function.  If "N=0", no pad location is recorded.

           The NOP instructions are inserted at---and maybe before,
           depending on <i>M</i>---the function entry address, even before the
           prologue.

   <b>Options Controlling the Preprocessor</b>
       These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C
       source file before actual compilation.

       If you use the <b>-E </b>option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
       Some of these options make sense only together with <b>-E </b>because
       they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
       compilation.

       In addition to the options listed here, there are a number of
       options to control search paths for include files documented in
       <b>Directory Options</b>.  Options to control preprocessor diagnostics
       are listed in <b>Warning Options</b>.

       <b>-D </b><i>name</i>
           Predefine <i>name</i> as a macro, with definition 1.

       <b>-D </b><i>name</i><b>=</b><i>definition</i>
           The contents of <i>definition</i> are tokenized and processed as if
           they appeared during translation phase three in a <b>#define</b>
           directive.  In particular, the definition is truncated by
           embedded newline characters.

           If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-
           like program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax
           to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in
           the shell syntax.

           If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command
           line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses
           before the equals sign (if any).  Parentheses are meaningful
           to most shells, so you should quote the option.  With <b>sh </b>and
           <b>csh</b>, <b>-D'</b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>args...</i><b>)=</b><i>definition</i><b>' </b>works.

           <b>-D </b>and <b>-U </b>options are processed in the order they are given
           on the command line.  All <b>-imacros </b><i>file</i> and <b>-include </b><i>file</i>
           options are processed after all <b>-D </b>and <b>-U </b>options.

       <b>-U </b><i>name</i>
           Cancel any previous definition of <i>name</i>, either built in or
           provided with a <b>-D </b>option.

       <b>-include </b><i>file</i>
           Process <i>file</i> as if "#include "file"" appeared as the first
           line of the primary source file.  However, the first
           directory searched for <i>file</i> is the preprocessor's working
           directory <i>instead of</i> the directory containing the main source
           file.  If not found there, it is searched for in the
           remainder of the "#include "..."" search chain as normal.

           If multiple <b>-include </b>options are given, the files are
           included in the order they appear on the command line.

       <b>-imacros </b><i>file</i>
           Exactly like <b>-include</b>, except that any output produced by
           scanning <i>file</i> is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain
           defined.  This allows you to acquire all the macros from a
           header without also processing its declarations.

           All files specified by <b>-imacros </b>are processed before all
           files specified by <b>-include</b>.

       <b>-undef</b>
           Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.
           The standard predefined macros remain defined.

       <b>-pthread</b>
           Define additional macros required for using the POSIX threads
           library.  You should use this option consistently for both
           compilation and linking.  This option is supported on
           GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on
           x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.

       <b>-M  </b>Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a
           rule suitable for <b>make </b>describing the dependencies of the
           main source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <b>make </b>rule
           containing the object file name for that source file, a
           colon, and the names of all the included files, including
           those coming from <b>-include </b>or <b>-imacros </b>command-line options.

           Unless specified explicitly (with <b>-MT </b>or <b>-MQ</b>), the object
           file name consists of the name of the source file with any
           suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading
           directory parts removed.  If there are many included files
           then the rule is split into several lines using <b>\</b>-newline.
           The rule has no commands.

           This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug
           output, such as <b>-dM</b>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with
           the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the
           dependency output file with <b>-MF</b>, or use an environment
           variable like <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>.  Debug output is still
           sent to the regular output stream as normal.

           Passing <b>-M </b>to the driver implies <b>-E</b>, and suppresses warnings
           with an implicit <b>-w</b>.

       <b>-MM </b>Like <b>-M </b>but do not mention header files that are found in
           system header directories, nor header files that are
           included, directly or indirectly, from such a header.

           This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double
           quotes in an <b>#include </b>directive does not in itself determine
           whether that header appears in <b>-MM </b>dependency output.

       <b>-MF </b><i>file</i>
           When used with <b>-M </b>or <b>-MM</b>, specifies a file to write the
           dependencies to.  If no <b>-MF </b>switch is given the preprocessor
           sends the rules to the same place it would send preprocessed
           output.

           When used with the driver options <b>-MD </b>or <b>-MMD</b>, <b>-MF </b>overrides
           the default dependency output file.

           If <i>file</i> is <i>-</i>, then the dependencies are written to <i>stdout</i>.

       <b>-MG </b>In conjunction with an option such as <b>-M </b>requesting
           dependency generation, <b>-MG </b>assumes missing header files are
           generated files and adds them to the dependency list without
           raising an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly
           from the "#include" directive without prepending any path.
           <b>-MG </b>also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header
           file renders this useless.

           This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

       <b>-MP </b>This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each
           dependency other than the main file, causing each to depend
           on nothing.  These dummy rules work around errors <b>make </b>gives
           if you remove header files without updating the <i>Makefile</i> to
           match.

           This is typical output:

                   test.o: test.c test.h

                   test.h:

       <b>-MT </b><i>target</i>
           Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency
           generation.  By default CPP takes the name of the main input
           file, deletes any directory components and any file suffix
           such as <b>.c</b>, and appends the platform's usual object suffix.
           The result is the target.

           An <b>-MT </b>option sets the target to be exactly the string you
           specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them
           as a single argument to <b>-MT</b>, or use multiple <b>-MT </b>options.

           For example, <b>-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o' </b>might give

                   $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

       <b>-MQ </b><i>target</i>
           Same as <b>-MT</b>, but it quotes any characters which are special
           to Make.  <b>-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o' </b>gives

                   $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c

           The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were
           given with <b>-MQ</b>.

       <b>-MD -MD </b>is equivalent to <b>-M -MF </b><i>file</i>, except that <b>-E </b>is not
           implied.  The driver determines <i>file</i> based on whether an <b>-o</b>
           option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its argument but
           with a suffix of <i>.d</i>, otherwise it takes the name of the input
           file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
           applies a <i>.d</i> suffix.

           If <b>-MD </b>is used in conjunction with <b>-E</b>, any <b>-o </b>switch is
           understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used
           without <b>-E</b>, each <b>-o </b>is understood to specify a target object
           file.

           Since <b>-E </b>is not implied, <b>-MD </b>can be used to generate a
           dependency output file as a side effect of the compilation
           process.

       <b>-MMD</b>
           Like <b>-MD </b>except mention only user header files, not system
           header files.

       <b>-fpreprocessed</b>
           Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already
           been preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro
           expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and
           processing of most directives.  The preprocessor still
           recognizes and removes comments, so that you can pass a file
           preprocessed with <b>-C </b>to the compiler without problems.  In
           this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than a
           tokenizer for the front ends.

           <b>-fpreprocessed </b>is implicit if the input file has one of the
           extensions <b>.i</b>, <b>.ii </b>or <b>.mi</b>.  These are the extensions that GCC
           uses for preprocessed files created by <b>-save-temps</b>.

       <b>-fdirectives-only</b>
           When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand
           macros.

           The option's behavior depends on the <b>-E </b>and <b>-fpreprocessed</b>
           options.

           With <b>-E</b>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of
           directives such as "#define", "#ifdef", and "#error".  Other
           preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
           conversion are not performed.  In addition, the <b>-dD </b>option is
           implicitly enabled.

           With <b>-fpreprocessed</b>, predefinition of command line and most
           builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as "__LINE__", which
           are contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This
           enables compilation of files previously preprocessed with "-E
           -fdirectives-only".

           With both <b>-E </b>and <b>-fpreprocessed</b>, the rules for <b>-fpreprocessed</b>
           take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of files
           previously preprocessed with "-E -fdirectives-only".

       <b>-fdollars-in-identifiers</b>
           Accept <b>$ </b>in identifiers.

       <b>-fextended-identifiers</b>
           Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option
           is enabled by default for C99 (and later C standard versions)
           and C++.

       <b>-fno-canonical-system-headers</b>
           When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with
           canonicalization.

       <b>-ftabstop=</b><i>width</i>
           Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the
           preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings or
           errors, even if tabs appear on the line.  If the value is
           less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is ignored.  The
           default is 8.

       <b>-ftrack-macro-expansion</b>[<b>=</b><i>level</i>]
           Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This
           allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about the current
           macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a
           macro expansion. Using this option makes the preprocessor and
           the compiler consume more memory. The <i>level</i> parameter can be
           used to choose the level of precision of token location
           tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if necessary.
           Value <b>0 </b>of <i>level</i> de-activates this option. Value <b>1 </b>tracks
           tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake of minimal
           memory overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the
           expansion of an argument of a function-like macro have the
           same location. Value <b>2 </b>tracks tokens locations completely.
           This value is the most memory hungry.  When this option is
           given no argument, the default parameter value is <b>2</b>.

           Note that "-ftrack-macro-expansion=2" is activated by
           default.

       <b>-fmacro-prefix-map=</b><i>old</i><b>=</b><i>new</i>
           When preprocessing files residing in directory <i>old</i>, expand
           the "__FILE__" and "__BASE_FILE__" macros as if the files
           resided in directory <i>new</i> instead.  This can be used to change
           an absolute path to a relative path by using <i>.</i> for <i>new</i> which
           can result in more reproducible builds that are location
           independent.  This option also affects "__builtin_FILE()"
           during compilation.  See also <b>-ffile-prefix-map</b>.

       <b>-fexec-charset=</b><i>charset</i>
           Set the execution character set, used for string and
           character constants.  The default is UTF-8.  <i>charset</i> can be
           any encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library
           routine.

       <b>-fwide-exec-charset=</b><i>charset</i>
           Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string
           and character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16,
           whichever corresponds to the width of "wchar_t".  As with
           <b>-fexec-charset</b>, <i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by the
           system's "iconv" library routine; however, you will have
           problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in "wchar_t".

       <b>-finput-charset=</b><i>charset</i>
           Set the input character set, used for translation from the
           character set of the input file to the source character set
           used by GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot
           get this information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.
           This can be overridden by either the locale or this command-
           line option.  Currently the command-line option takes
           precedence if there's a conflict.  <i>charset</i> can be any
           encoding supported by the system's "iconv" library routine.

       <b>-fpch-deps</b>
           When using precompiled headers, this flag causes the
           dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
           precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified, only
           the precompiled header are listed and not the files that were
           used to create it, because those files are not consulted when
           a precompiled header is used.

       <b>-fpch-preprocess</b>
           This option allows use of a precompiled header together with
           <b>-E</b>.  It inserts a special "#pragma", "#pragma GCC
           pch_preprocess "<i>filename""</i> in the output to mark the place
           where the precompiled header was found, and its <i>filename</i>.
           When <b>-fpreprocessed </b>is in use, GCC recognizes this "#pragma"
           and loads the PCH.

           This option is off by default, because the resulting
           preprocessed output is only really suitable as input to GCC.
           It is switched on by <b>-save-temps</b>.

           You should not write this "#pragma" in your own code, but it
           is safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is available in
           a different location.  The filename may be absolute or it may
           be relative to GCC's current directory.

       <b>-fworking-directory</b>
           Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output
           that let the compiler know the current working directory at
           the time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the
           preprocessor emits, after the initial linemarker, a second
           linemarker with the current working directory followed by two
           slashes.  GCC uses this directory, when it's present in the
           preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current
           working directory in some debugging information formats.
           This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is
           enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated form
           <b>-fno-working-directory</b>.  If the <b>-P </b>flag is present in the
           command line, this option has no effect, since no "#line"
           directives are emitted whatsoever.

       <b>-A </b><i>predicate</i><b>=</b><i>answer</i>
           Make an assertion with the predicate <i>predicate</i> and answer
           <i>answer</i>.  This form is preferred to the older form <b>-A</b>
           <i>predicate</i><b>(</b><i>answer</i><b>)</b>, which is still supported, because it does
           not use shell special characters.

       <b>-A -</b><i>predicate</i><b>=</b><i>answer</i>
           Cancel an assertion with the predicate <i>predicate</i> and answer
           <i>answer</i>.

       <b>-C  </b>Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to
           the output file, except for comments in processed directives,
           which are deleted along with the directive.

           You should be prepared for side effects when using <b>-C</b>; it
           causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their
           own right.  For example, comments appearing at the start of
           what would be a directive line have the effect of turning
           that line into an ordinary source line, since the first token
           on the line is no longer a <b>#</b>.

       <b>-CC </b>Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.
           This is like <b>-C</b>, except that comments contained within macros
           are also passed through to the output file where the macro is
           expanded.

           In addition to the side effects of the <b>-C </b>option, the <b>-CC</b>
           option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be
           converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
           of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder
           of the source line.

           The <b>-CC </b>option is generally used to support lint comments.

       <b>-P  </b>Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the
           preprocessor.  This might be useful when running the
           preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be
           sent to a program which might be confused by the linemarkers.

       <b>-traditional</b>
       <b>-traditional-cpp</b>
           Try to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors,
           as opposed to ISO C preprocessors.  See the GNU CPP manual
           for details.

           Note that GCC does not otherwise attempt to emulate a pre-
           standard C compiler, and these options are only supported
           with the <b>-E </b>switch, or when invoking CPP explicitly.

       <b>-trigraphs</b>
           Support ISO C trigraphs.  These are three-character
           sequences, all starting with <b>??</b>, that are defined by ISO C to
           stand for single characters.  For example, <b>??/ </b>stands for <b>\</b>,
           so <b>'??/n' </b>is a character constant for a newline.

           The nine trigraphs and their replacements are

                   Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??&lt;  ??&gt;  ??=  ??/  ??'  ??!  ??-
                   Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \    ^    |    ~

           By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in standard-conforming
           modes it converts them.  See the <b>-std </b>and <b>-ansi </b>options.

       <b>-remap</b>
           Enable special code to work around file systems which only
           permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.

       <b>-H  </b>Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
           normal activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in
           the <b>#include </b>stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also
           printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid
           precompiled header file is printed with <b>...x </b>and a valid one
           with <b>...! </b>.

       <b>-d</b><i>letters</i>
           Says to make debugging dumps during compilation as specified
           by <i>letters</i>.  The flags documented here are those relevant to
           the preprocessor.  Other <i>letters</i> are interpreted by the
           compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and
           so are silently ignored.  If you specify <i>letters</i> whose
           behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.

           <b>-dM </b>Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <b>#define</b>
               directives for all the macros defined during the
               execution of the preprocessor, including predefined
               macros.  This gives you a way of finding out what is
               predefined in your version of the preprocessor.  Assuming
               you have no file <i>foo.h</i>, the command

                       touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h

               shows all the predefined macros.

               If you use <b>-dM </b>without the <b>-E </b>option, <b>-dM </b>is interpreted
               as a synonym for <b>-fdump-rtl-mach</b>.

           <b>-dD </b>Like <b>-dM </b>except in two respects: it does <i>not</i> include the
               predefined macros, and it outputs <i>both</i> the <b>#define</b>
               directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds
               of output go to the standard output file.

           <b>-dN </b>Like <b>-dD</b>, but emit only the macro names, not their
               expansions.

           <b>-dI </b>Output <b>#include </b>directives in addition to the result of
               preprocessing.

           <b>-dU </b>Like <b>-dD </b>except that only macros that are expanded, or
               whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives,
               are output; the output is delayed until the use or test
               of the macro; and <b>#undef </b>directives are also output for
               macros tested but undefined at the time.

       <b>-fdebug-cpp</b>
           This option is only useful for debugging GCC.  When used from
           CPP or with <b>-E</b>, it dumps debugging information about location
           maps.  Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of
           the map its location belongs to.

           When used from GCC without <b>-E</b>, this option has no effect.

       <b>-Wp,</b><i>option</i>
           You can use <b>-Wp,</b><i>option</i> to bypass the compiler driver and pass
           <i>option</i> directly through to the preprocessor.  If <i>option</i>
           contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
           commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or
           interpreted by the compiler driver before being passed to the
           preprocessor, and <b>-Wp </b>forcibly bypasses this phase.  The
           preprocessor's direct interface is undocumented and subject
           to change, so whenever possible you should avoid using <b>-Wp</b>
           and let the driver handle the options instead.

       <b>-Xpreprocessor </b><i>option</i>
           Pass <i>option</i> as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use
           this to supply system-specific preprocessor options that GCC
           does not recognize.

           If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you
           must use <b>-Xpreprocessor </b>twice, once for the option and once
           for the argument.

       <b>-no-integrated-cpp</b>
           Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.
           By default, GCC performs preprocessing as an integrated part
           of input tokenization and parsing.  If this option is
           provided, the appropriate language front end (<b>cc1</b>, <b>cc1plus</b>,
           or <b>cc1obj </b>for C, C++, and Objective-C, respectively) is
           instead invoked twice, once for preprocessing only and once
           for actual compilation of the preprocessed input.  This
           option may be useful in conjunction with the <b>-B </b>or <b>-wrapper</b>
           options to specify an alternate preprocessor or perform
           additional processing of the program source between normal
           preprocessing and compilation.

   <b>Passing Options to the Assembler</b>
       You can pass options to the assembler.

       <b>-Wa,</b><i>option</i>
           Pass <i>option</i> as an option to the assembler.  If <i>option</i>
           contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
           commas.

       <b>-Xassembler </b><i>option</i>
           Pass <i>option</i> as an option to the assembler.  You can use this
           to supply system-specific assembler options that GCC does not
           recognize.

           If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you
           must use <b>-Xassembler </b>twice, once for the option and once for
           the argument.

   <b>Options for Linking</b>
       These options come into play when the compiler links object files
       into an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the
       compiler is not doing a link step.

       <i>object-file-name</i>
           A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix
           is considered to name an object file or library.  (Object
           files are distinguished from libraries by the linker
           according to the file contents.)  If linking is done, these
           object files are used as input to the linker.

       <b>-c</b>
       <b>-S</b>
       <b>-E  </b>If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run,
           and object file names should not be used as arguments.

       <b>-flinker-output=</b><i>type</i>
           This option controls the code generation of the link time
           optimizer.  By default the linker output is determined by the
           linker plugin automatically. For debugging the compiler and
           in the case of incremental linking to non-lto object file is
           desired, it may be useful to control the type manually.

           If <i>type</i> is <b>exec </b>the code generation is configured to produce
           static binary. In this case <b>-fpic </b>and <b>-fpie </b>are both
           disabled.

           If <i>type</i> is <b>dyn </b>the code generation is configured to produce
           shared library. In this case <b>-fpic </b>or <b>-fPIC </b>is preserved, but
           not enabled automatically.  This makes it possible to build
           shared libraries without position independent code on
           architectures this is possible, i.e. on x86.

           If <i>type</i> is <b>pie </b>the code generation is configured to produce
           <b>-fpie </b>executable. This result in similar optimizations as
           <b>exec </b>except that <b>-fpie </b>is not disabled if specified at
           compilation time.

           If <i>type</i> is <b>rel </b>the compiler assumes that incremental linking
           is done.  The sections containing intermediate code for link-
           time optimization are merged, pre-optimized, and output to
           the resulting object file. In addition, if <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b>
           is specified the binary code is produced for future non-lto
           linking. The object file produced by incremental linking will
           be smaller than a static library produced from the same
           object files.  At link-time the result of incremental linking
           will also load faster to compiler than a static library
           assuming that majority of objects in the library are used.

           Finally <b>nolto-rel </b>configure compiler to for incremental
           linking where code generation is forced, final binary is
           produced and the intermediate code for later link-time
           optimization is stripped. When multiple object files are
           linked together the resulting code will be optimized better
           than with link time optimizations disabled (for example, the
           cross-module inlining will happen), most of benefits of whole
           program optimizations are however lost.

           During the incremental link (by <b>-r</b>) the linker plugin will
           default to <b>rel</b>. With current interfaces to GNU Binutils it is
           however not possible to link incrementally LTO objects and
           non-LTO objects into a single mixed object file.  In the case
           any of object files in incremental link cannot be used for
           link-time optimization the linker plugin will output warning
           and use <b>nolto-rel</b>. To maintain the whole program optimization
           it is recommended to link such objects into static library
           instead. Alternatively it is possible to use H.J. Lu's
           binutils with support for mixed objects.

       <b>-fuse-ld=bfd</b>
           Use the <b>bfd </b>linker instead of the default linker.

       <b>-fuse-ld=gold</b>
           Use the <b>gold </b>linker instead of the default linker.

       <b>-fuse-ld=lld</b>
           Use the LLVM <b>lld </b>linker instead of the default linker.

       <b>-l</b><i>library</i>
       <b>-l </b><i>library</i>
           Search the library named <i>library</i> when linking.  (The second
           alternative with the library as a separate argument is only
           for POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)

           The <b>-l </b>option is passed directly to the linker by GCC.  Refer
           to your linker documentation for exact details.  The general
           description below applies to the GNU linker.

           The linker searches a standard list of directories for the
           library.  The directories searched include several standard
           system directories plus any that you specify with <b>-L</b>.

           Static libraries are archives of object files, and have file
           names like <i>liblibrary.a</i>.  Some targets also support shared
           libraries, which typically have names like <i>liblibrary.so</i>.  If
           both static and shared libraries are found, the linker gives
           preference to linking with the shared library unless the
           <b>-static </b>option is used.

           It makes a difference where in the command you write this
           option; the linker searches and processes libraries and
           object files in the order they are specified.  Thus, <b>foo.o</b>
           <b>-lz bar.o </b>searches library <b>z </b>after file <i>foo.o</i> but before
           <i>bar.o</i>.  If <i>bar.o</i> refers to functions in <b>z</b>, those functions
           may not be loaded.

       <b>-lobjc</b>
           You need this special case of the <b>-l </b>option in order to link
           an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.

       <b>-nostartfiles</b>
           Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
           The standard system libraries are used normally, unless
           <b>-nostdlib</b>, <b>-nolibc</b>, or <b>-nodefaultlibs </b>is used.

       <b>-nodefaultlibs</b>
           Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.  Only
           the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and
           options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
           <b>-static-libgcc </b>or <b>-shared-libgcc</b>, are ignored.  The standard
           startup files are used normally, unless <b>-nostartfiles </b>is
           used.

           The compiler may generate calls to "memcmp", "memset",
           "memcpy" and "memmove".  These entries are usually resolved
           by entries in libc.  These entry points should be supplied
           through some other mechanism when this option is specified.

       <b>-nolibc</b>
           Do not use the C library or system libraries tightly coupled
           with it when linking.  Still link with the startup files,
           <i>libgcc</i> or toolchain provided language support libraries such
           as <i>libgnat</i>, <i>libgfortran</i> or <i>libstdc++</i> unless options
           preventing their inclusion are used as well.  This typically
           removes <b>-lc </b>from the link command line, as well as system
           libraries that normally go with it and become meaningless
           when absence of a C library is assumed, for example <b>-lpthread</b>
           or <b>-lm </b>in some configurations.  This is intended for bare-
           board targets when there is indeed no C library available.

       <b>-nostdlib</b>
           Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries
           when linking.  No startup files and only the libraries you
           specify are passed to the linker, and options specifying
           linkage of the system libraries, such as <b>-static-libgcc </b>or
           <b>-shared-libgcc</b>, are ignored.

           The compiler may generate calls to "memcmp", "memset",
           "memcpy" and "memmove".  These entries are usually resolved
           by entries in libc.  These entry points should be supplied
           through some other mechanism when this option is specified.

           One of the standard libraries bypassed by <b>-nostdlib </b>and
           <b>-nodefaultlibs </b>is <i>libgcc.a</i>, a library of internal subroutines
           which GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular
           machines, or special needs for some languages.

           In most cases, you need <i>libgcc.a</i> even when you want to avoid
           other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify
           <b>-nostdlib </b>or <b>-nodefaultlibs </b>you should usually specify <b>-lgcc</b>
           as well.  This ensures that you have no unresolved references
           to internal GCC library subroutines.  (An example of such an
           internal subroutine is "__main", used to ensure C++
           constructors are called.)

       <b>-e </b><i>entry</i>
       <b>--entry=</b><i>entry</i>
           Specify that the program entry point is <i>entry</i>.  The argument
           is interpreted by the linker; the GNU linker accepts either a
           symbol name or an address.

       <b>-pie</b>
           Produce a dynamically linked position independent executable
           on targets that support it.  For predictable results, you
           must also specify the same set of options used for
           compilation (<b>-fpie</b>, <b>-fPIE</b>, or model suboptions) when you
           specify this linker option.

       <b>-no-pie</b>
           Don't produce a dynamically linked position independent
           executable.

       <b>-static-pie</b>
           Produce a static position independent executable on targets
           that support it.  A static position independent executable is
           similar to a static executable, but can be loaded at any
           address without a dynamic linker.  For predictable results,
           you must also specify the same set of options used for
           compilation (<b>-fpie</b>, <b>-fPIE</b>, or model suboptions) when you
           specify this linker option.

       <b>-pthread</b>
           Link with the POSIX threads library.  This option is
           supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives,
           and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.  On some targets
           this option also sets flags for the preprocessor, so it
           should be used consistently for both compilation and linking.

       <b>-r  </b>Produce a relocatable object as output.  This is also known
           as partial linking.

       <b>-rdynamic</b>
           Pass the flag <b>-export-dynamic </b>to the ELF linker, on targets
           that support it. This instructs the linker to add all
           symbols, not only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table.
           This option is needed for some uses of "dlopen" or to allow
           obtaining backtraces from within a program.

       <b>-s  </b>Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the
           executable.

       <b>-static</b>
           On systems that support dynamic linking, this overrides <b>-pie</b>
           and prevents linking with the shared libraries.  On other
           systems, this option has no effect.

       <b>-shared</b>
           Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other
           objects to form an executable.  Not all systems support this
           option.  For predictable results, you must also specify the
           same set of options used for compilation (<b>-fpic</b>, <b>-fPIC</b>, or
           model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.[1]

       <b>-shared-libgcc</b>
       <b>-static-libgcc</b>
           On systems that provide <i>libgcc</i> as a shared library, these
           options force the use of either the shared or static version,
           respectively.  If no shared version of <i>libgcc</i> was built when
           the compiler was configured, these options have no effect.

           There are several situations in which an application should
           use the shared <i>libgcc</i> instead of the static version.  The
           most common of these is when the application wishes to throw
           and catch exceptions across different shared libraries.  In
           that case, each of the libraries as well as the application
           itself should use the shared <i>libgcc</i>.

           Therefore, the G++ driver automatically adds <b>-shared-libgcc</b>
           whenever you build a shared library or a main executable,
           because C++ programs typically use exceptions, so this is the
           right thing to do.

           If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared
           libraries, you may find that they are not always linked with
           the shared <i>libgcc</i>.  If GCC finds, at its configuration time,
           that you have a non-GNU linker or a GNU linker that does not
           support option <b>--eh-frame-hdr</b>, it links the shared version of
           <i>libgcc</i> into shared libraries by default.  Otherwise, it takes
           advantage of the linker and optimizes away the linking with
           the shared version of <i>libgcc</i>, linking with the static version
           of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to propagate
           through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
           costs at library load time.

           However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw
           or catch exceptions, you must link it using the G++ driver,
           or using the option <b>-shared-libgcc</b>, such that it is linked
           with the shared <i>libgcc</i>.

       <b>-static-libasan</b>
           When the <b>-fsanitize=address </b>option is used to link a program,
           the GCC driver automatically links against <b>libasan</b>.  If
           <i>libasan</i> is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static</b>
           option is not used, then this links against the shared
           version of <i>libasan</i>.  The <b>-static-libasan </b>option directs the
           GCC driver to link <i>libasan</i> statically, without necessarily
           linking other libraries statically.

       <b>-static-libtsan</b>
           When the <b>-fsanitize=thread </b>option is used to link a program,
           the GCC driver automatically links against <b>libtsan</b>.  If
           <i>libtsan</i> is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static</b>
           option is not used, then this links against the shared
           version of <i>libtsan</i>.  The <b>-static-libtsan </b>option directs the
           GCC driver to link <i>libtsan</i> statically, without necessarily
           linking other libraries statically.

       <b>-static-liblsan</b>
           When the <b>-fsanitize=leak </b>option is used to link a program,
           the GCC driver automatically links against <b>liblsan</b>.  If
           <i>liblsan</i> is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static</b>
           option is not used, then this links against the shared
           version of <i>liblsan</i>.  The <b>-static-liblsan </b>option directs the
           GCC driver to link <i>liblsan</i> statically, without necessarily
           linking other libraries statically.

       <b>-static-libubsan</b>
           When the <b>-fsanitize=undefined </b>option is used to link a
           program, the GCC driver automatically links against <b>libubsan</b>.
           If <i>libubsan</i> is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static</b>
           option is not used, then this links against the shared
           version of <i>libubsan</i>.  The <b>-static-libubsan </b>option directs the
           GCC driver to link <i>libubsan</i> statically, without necessarily
           linking other libraries statically.

       <b>-static-libstdc++</b>
           When the <b>g++ </b>program is used to link a C++ program, it
           normally automatically links against <b>libstdc++</b>.  If <i>libstdc++</i>
           is available as a shared library, and the <b>-static </b>option is
           not used, then this links against the shared version of
           <i>libstdc++</i>.  That is normally fine.  However, it is sometimes
           useful to freeze the version of <i>libstdc++</i> used by the program
           without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
           <b>-static-libstdc++ </b>option directs the <b>g++ </b>driver to link
           <i>libstdc++</i> statically, without necessarily linking other
           libraries statically.

       <b>-symbolic</b>
           Bind references to global symbols when building a shared
           object.  Warn about any unresolved references (unless
           overridden by the link editor option <b>-Xlinker -z -Xlinker</b>
           <b>defs</b>).  Only a few systems support this option.

       <b>-T </b><i>script</i>
           Use <i>script</i> as the linker script.  This option is supported by
           most systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as
           bare-board targets without an operating system, the <b>-T </b>option
           may be required when linking to avoid references to undefined
           symbols.

       <b>-Xlinker </b><i>option</i>
           Pass <i>option</i> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
           supply system-specific linker options that GCC does not
           recognize.

           If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument,
           you must use <b>-Xlinker </b>twice, once for the option and once for
           the argument.  For example, to pass <b>-assert definitions</b>, you
           must write <b>-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</b>.  It does
           not work to write <b>-Xlinker "-assert definitions"</b>, because
           this passes the entire string as a single argument, which is
           not what the linker expects.

           When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to
           pass arguments to linker options using the <i>option</i><b>=</b><i>value</i>
           syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can
           specify <b>-Xlinker -Map=output.map </b>rather than <b>-Xlinker -Map</b>
           <b>-Xlinker output.map</b>.  Other linkers may not support this
           syntax for command-line options.

       <b>-Wl,</b><i>option</i>
           Pass <i>option</i> as an option to the linker.  If <i>option</i> contains
           commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You
           can use this syntax to pass an argument to the option.  For
           example, <b>-Wl,-Map,output.map </b>passes <b>-Map output.map </b>to the
           linker.  When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same
           effect with <b>-Wl,-Map=output.map</b>.

       <b>-u </b><i>symbol</i>
           Pretend the symbol <i>symbol</i> is undefined, to force linking of
           library modules to define it.  You can use <b>-u </b>multiple times
           with different symbols to force loading of additional library
           modules.

       <b>-z </b><i>keyword</i>
           <b>-z </b>is passed directly on to the linker along with the keyword
           <i>keyword</i>. See the section in the documentation of your linker
           for permitted values and their meanings.

   <b>Options for Directory Search</b>
       These options specify directories to search for header files, for
       libraries and for parts of the compiler:

       <b>-I </b><i>dir</i>
       <b>-iquote </b><i>dir</i>
       <b>-isystem </b><i>dir</i>
       <b>-idirafter </b><i>dir</i>
           Add the directory <i>dir</i> to the list of directories to be
           searched for header files during preprocessing.  If <i>dir</i>
           begins with <b>= </b>or $SYSROOT, then the <b>= </b>or $SYSROOT is replaced
           by the sysroot prefix; see <b>--sysroot </b>and <b>-isysroot</b>.

           Directories specified with <b>-iquote </b>apply only to the quote
           form of the directive, "#include "<i>file""</i>.  Directories
           specified with <b>-I</b>, <b>-isystem</b>, or <b>-idirafter </b>apply to lookup
           for both the "#include "<i>file""</i> and "#include &lt;<i>file&gt;"</i>
           directives.

           You can specify any number or combination of these options on
           the command line to search for header files in several
           directories.  The lookup order is as follows:

           1.  For the quote form of the include directive, the
               directory of the current file is searched first.

           2.  For the quote form of the include directive, the
               directories specified by <b>-iquote </b>options are searched in
               left-to-right order, as they appear on the command line.

           3.  Directories specified with <b>-I </b>options are scanned in
               left-to-right order.

           4.  Directories specified with <b>-isystem </b>options are scanned
               in left-to-right order.

           5.  Standard system directories are scanned.

           6.  Directories specified with <b>-idirafter </b>options are scanned
               in left-to-right order.

           You can use <b>-I </b>to override a system header file, substituting
           your own version, since these directories are searched before
           the standard system header file directories.  However, you
           should not use this option to add directories that contain
           vendor-supplied system header files; use <b>-isystem </b>for that.

           The <b>-isystem </b>and <b>-idirafter </b>options also mark the directory
           as a system directory, so that it gets the same special
           treatment that is applied to the standard system directories.

           If a standard system include directory, or a directory
           specified with <b>-isystem</b>, is also specified with <b>-I</b>, the <b>-I</b>
           option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
           system directory at its normal position in the system include
           chain.  This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy
           system headers and the ordering for the "#include_next"
           directive are not inadvertently changed.  If you really need
           to change the search order for system directories, use the
           <b>-nostdinc </b>and/or <b>-isystem </b>options.

       <b>-I- </b>Split the include path.  This option has been deprecated.
           Please use <b>-iquote </b>instead for <b>-I </b>directories before the <b>-I-</b>
           and remove the <b>-I- </b>option.

           Any directories specified with <b>-I </b>options before <b>-I- </b>are
           searched only for headers requested with "#include "<i>file""</i>;
           they are not searched for "#include &lt;<i>file&gt;"</i>.  If additional
           directories are specified with <b>-I </b>options after the <b>-I-</b>,
           those directories are searched for all <b>#include </b>directives.

           In addition, <b>-I- </b>inhibits the use of the directory of the
           current file directory as the first search directory for
           "#include "<i>file""</i>.  There is no way to override this effect
           of <b>-I-</b>.

       <b>-iprefix </b><i>prefix</i>
           Specify <i>prefix</i> as the prefix for subsequent <b>-iwithprefix</b>
           options.  If the prefix represents a directory, you should
           include the final <b>/</b>.

       <b>-iwithprefix </b><i>dir</i>
       <b>-iwithprefixbefore </b><i>dir</i>
           Append <i>dir</i> to the prefix specified previously with <b>-iprefix</b>,
           and add the resulting directory to the include search path.
           <b>-iwithprefixbefore </b>puts it in the same place <b>-I </b>would;
           <b>-iwithprefix </b>puts it where <b>-idirafter </b>would.

       <b>-isysroot </b><i>dir</i>
           This option is like the <b>--sysroot </b>option, but applies only to
           header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to
           both header files and libraries).  See the <b>--sysroot </b>option
           for more information.

       <b>-imultilib </b><i>dir</i>
           Use <i>dir</i> as a subdirectory of the directory containing target-
           specific C++ headers.

       <b>-nostdinc</b>
           Do not search the standard system directories for header
           files.  Only the directories explicitly specified with <b>-I</b>,
           <b>-iquote</b>, <b>-isystem</b>, and/or <b>-idirafter </b>options (and the
           directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.

       <b>-nostdinc++</b>
           Do not search for header files in the C++-specific standard
           directories, but do still search the other standard
           directories.  (This option is used when building the C++
           library.)

       <b>-iplugindir=</b><i>dir</i>
           Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed by
           <b>-fplugin=</b><i>name</i> instead of <b>-fplugin=</b><i>path</i><b>/</b><i>name</i><b>.so</b>.  This option
           is not meant to be used by the user, but only passed by the
           driver.

       <b>-L</b><i>dir</i>
           Add directory <i>dir</i> to the list of directories to be searched
           for <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-B</b><i>prefix</i>
           This option specifies where to find the executables,
           libraries, include files, and data files of the compiler
           itself.

           The compiler driver program runs one or more of the
           subprograms <b>cpp</b>, <b>cc1</b>, <b>as </b>and <b>ld</b>.  It tries <i>prefix</i> as a prefix
           for each program it tries to run, both with and without
           <i>machine</i><b>/</b><i>version</i><b>/ </b>for the corresponding target machine and
           compiler version.

           For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first
           tries the <b>-B </b>prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or
           if <b>-B </b>is not specified, the driver tries two standard
           prefixes, <i>/usr/lib/gcc/</i> and <i>/usr/local/lib/gcc/</i>.  If neither
           of those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified
           program name is searched for using the directories specified
           in your <b>PATH </b>environment variable.

           The compiler checks to see if the path provided by <b>-B </b>refers
           to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
           separator character at the end of the path.

           <b>-B </b>prefixes that effectively specify directory names also
           apply to libraries in the linker, because the compiler
           translates these options into <b>-L </b>options for the linker.
           They also apply to include files in the preprocessor, because
           the compiler translates these options into <b>-isystem </b>options
           for the preprocessor.  In this case, the compiler appends
           <b>include </b>to the prefix.

           The runtime support file <i>libgcc.a</i> can also be searched for
           using the <b>-B </b>prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there,
           the two standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.
           The file is left out of the link if it is not found by those
           means.

           Another way to specify a prefix much like the <b>-B </b>prefix is to
           use the environment variable <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.

           As a special kludge, if the path provided by <b>-B </b>is
           <i>[dir/]stageN/</i>, where <i>N</i> is a number in the range 0 to 9, then
           it is replaced by <i>[dir/]include</i>.  This is to help with boot-
           strapping the compiler.

       <b>-no-canonical-prefixes</b>
           Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to <b>/../</b>
           or <b>/./</b>, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
           prefix.

       <b>--sysroot=</b><i>dir</i>
           Use <i>dir</i> as the logical root directory for headers and
           libraries.  For example, if the compiler normally searches
           for headers in <i>/usr/include</i> and libraries in <i>/usr/lib</i>, it
           instead searches <i>dir/usr/include</i> and <i>dir/usr/lib</i>.

           If you use both this option and the <b>-isysroot </b>option, then
           the <b>--sysroot </b>option applies to libraries, but the <b>-isysroot</b>
           option applies to header files.

           The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the
           necessary support for this option.  If your linker does not
           support this option, the header file aspect of <b>--sysroot</b>
           still works, but the library aspect does not.

       <b>--no-sysroot-suffix</b>
           For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory
           specified with <b>--sysroot</b>, depending on the other options
           used, so that headers may for example be found in
           <i>dir/suffix/usr/include</i> instead of <i>dir/usr/include</i>.  This
           option disables the addition of such a suffix.

   <b>Options for Code Generation Conventions</b>
       These machine-independent options control the interface
       conventions used in code generation.

       Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative
       form of <b>-ffoo </b>is <b>-fno-foo</b>.  In the table below, only one of the
       forms is listed---the one that is not the default.  You can
       figure out the other form by either removing <b>no- </b>or adding it.

       <b>-fstack-reuse=</b><i>reuse-level</i>
           This option controls stack space reuse for user declared
           local/auto variables and compiler generated temporaries.
           <i>reuse_level</i> can be <b>all</b>, <b>named_vars</b>, or <b>none</b>. <b>all </b>enables
           stack reuse for all local variables and temporaries,
           <b>named_vars </b>enables the reuse only for user defined local
           variables with names, and <b>none </b>disables stack reuse
           completely. The default value is <b>all</b>. The option is needed
           when the program extends the lifetime of a scoped local
           variable or a compiler generated temporary beyond the end
           point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of a variable
           ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing
           compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other
           temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range does
           not overlap with it. Legacy code extending local lifetime is
           likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.

           For example,

                      int *p;
                      {
                        int local1;

                        p = &amp;local1;
                        local1 = 10;
                        ....
                      }
                      {
                         int local2;
                         local2 = 20;
                         ...
                      }

                      if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1
                        {

                        }

           Another example:

                      struct A
                      {
                          A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { }
                          int i;
                          int j;
                      };

                      A *ap;

                      void foo(const A&amp; ar)
                      {
                         ap = &amp;ar;
                      }

                      void bar()
                      {
                         foo(A(10)); // temp object's lifetime ends when foo returns

                         {
                           A a(20);
                           ....
                         }
                         ap-&gt;i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space
                                      // is reused with a. What is the value of ap-&gt;i?
                      }

           The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well
           defined by the C++ standard. When a lifetime of a temporary
           ends, and if the temporary lives in memory, the optimizing
           compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other
           temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range does
           not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies
           on the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries'
           stack space is not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can
           lead to runtime errors. This option is used to control the
           temporary stack reuse optimization.

       <b>-ftrapv</b>
           This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition,
           subtraction, multiplication operations.  The options <b>-ftrapv</b>
           and <b>-fwrapv </b>override each other, so using <b>-ftrapv -fwrapv </b>on
           the command-line results in <b>-fwrapv </b>being effective.  Note
           that only active options override, so using <b>-ftrapv -fwrapv</b>
           <b>-fno-wrapv </b>on the command-line results in <b>-ftrapv </b>being
           effective.

       <b>-fwrapv</b>
           This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed
           arithmetic overflow of addition, subtraction and
           multiplication wraps around using twos-complement
           representation.  This flag enables some optimizations and
           disables others.  The options <b>-ftrapv </b>and <b>-fwrapv </b>override
           each other, so using <b>-ftrapv -fwrapv </b>on the command-line
           results in <b>-fwrapv </b>being effective.  Note that only active
           options override, so using <b>-ftrapv -fwrapv -fno-wrapv </b>on the
           command-line results in <b>-ftrapv </b>being effective.

       <b>-fwrapv-pointer</b>
           This option instructs the compiler to assume that pointer
           arithmetic overflow on addition and subtraction wraps around
           using twos-complement representation.  This flag disables
           some optimizations which assume pointer overflow is invalid.

       <b>-fstrict-overflow</b>
           This option implies <b>-fno-wrapv -fno-wrapv-pointer </b>and when
           negated implies <b>-fwrapv -fwrapv-pointer</b>.

       <b>-fexceptions</b>
           Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to
           propagate exceptions.  For some targets, this implies GCC
           generates frame unwind information for all functions, which
           can produce significant data size overhead, although it does
           not affect execution.  If you do not specify this option, GCC
           enables it by default for languages like C++ that normally
           require exception handling, and disables it for languages
           like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may
           need to enable this option when compiling C code that needs
           to interoperate properly with exception handlers written in
           C++.  You may also wish to disable this option if you are
           compiling older C++ programs that don't use exception
           handling.

       <b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>
           Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw
           exceptions.  Note that this requires platform-specific
           runtime support that does not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it
           only allows <i>trapping</i> instructions to throw exceptions, i.e.
           memory references or floating-point instructions.  It does
           not allow exceptions to be thrown from arbitrary signal
           handlers such as "SIGALRM".

       <b>-fdelete-dead-exceptions</b>
           Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but
           don't otherwise contribute to the execution of the program
           can be optimized away.  This option is enabled by default for
           the Ada front end, as permitted by the Ada language
           specification.  Optimization passes that cause dead
           exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at
           different optimization levels.

       <b>-funwind-tables</b>
           Similar to <b>-fexceptions</b>, except that it just generates any
           needed static data, but does not affect the generated code in
           any other way.  You normally do not need to enable this
           option; instead, a language processor that needs this
           handling enables it on your behalf.

       <b>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</b>
           Generate unwind table in DWARF format, if supported by target
           machine.  The table is exact at each instruction boundary, so
           it can be used for stack unwinding from asynchronous events
           (such as debugger or garbage collector).

       <b>-fno-gnu-unique</b>
           On systems with recent GNU assembler and C library, the C++
           compiler uses the "STB_GNU_UNIQUE" binding to make sure that
           definitions of template static data members and static local
           variables in inline functions are unique even in the presence
           of "RTLD_LOCAL"; this is necessary to avoid problems with a
           library used by two different "RTLD_LOCAL" plugins depending
           on a definition in one of them and therefore disagreeing with
           the other one about the binding of the symbol.  But this
           causes "dlclose" to be ignored for affected DSOs; if your
           program relies on reinitialization of a DSO via "dlclose" and
           "dlopen", you can use <b>-fno-gnu-unique</b>.

       <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>
           Return "short" "struct" and "union" values in memory like
           longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is
           less efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing
           intercallability between GCC-compiled files and files
           compiled with other compilers, particularly the Portable C
           Compiler (pcc).

           The precise convention for returning structures in memory
           depends on the target configuration macros.

           Short structures and unions are those whose size and
           alignment match that of some integer type.

           <b>Warning: </b>code compiled with the <b>-fpcc-struct-return </b>switch is
           not binary compatible with code compiled with the
           <b>-freg-struct-return </b>switch.  Use it to conform to a non-
           default application binary interface.

       <b>-freg-struct-return</b>
           Return "struct" and "union" values in registers when
           possible.  This is more efficient for small structures than
           <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>.

           If you specify neither <b>-fpcc-struct-return </b>nor
           <b>-freg-struct-return</b>, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
           standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention,
           GCC defaults to <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>, except on targets where
           GCC is the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose
           the standard, and we chose the more efficient register return
           alternative.

           <b>Warning: </b>code compiled with the <b>-freg-struct-return </b>switch is
           not binary compatible with code compiled with the
           <b>-fpcc-struct-return </b>switch.  Use it to conform to a non-
           default application binary interface.

       <b>-fshort-enums</b>
           Allocate to an "enum" type only as many bytes as it needs for
           the declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the
           "enum" type is equivalent to the smallest integer type that
           has enough room.

           <b>Warning: </b>the <b>-fshort-enums </b>switch causes GCC to generate code
           that is not binary compatible with code generated without
           that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application
           binary interface.

       <b>-fshort-wchar</b>
           Override the underlying type for "wchar_t" to be "short
           unsigned int" instead of the default for the target.  This
           option is useful for building programs to run under WINE.

           <b>Warning: </b>the <b>-fshort-wchar </b>switch causes GCC to generate code
           that is not binary compatible with code generated without
           that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application
           binary interface.

       <b>-fno-common</b>
           In C code, this option controls the placement of global
           variables defined without an initializer, known as <i>tentative</i>
           <i>definitions</i> in the C standard.  Tentative definitions are
           distinct from declarations of a variable with the "extern"
           keyword, which do not allocate storage.

           Unix C compilers have traditionally allocated storage for
           uninitialized global variables in a common block.  This
           allows the linker to resolve all tentative definitions of the
           same variable in different compilation units to the same
           object, or to a non-tentative definition.  This is the
           behavior specified by <b>-fcommon</b>, and is the default for GCC on
           most targets.  On the other hand, this behavior is not
           required by ISO C, and on some targets may carry a speed or
           code size penalty on variable references.

           The <b>-fno-common </b>option specifies that the compiler should
           instead place uninitialized global variables in the BSS
           section of the object file.  This inhibits the merging of
           tentative definitions by the linker so you get a multiple-
           definition error if the same variable is defined in more than
           one compilation unit.  Compiling with <b>-fno-common </b>is useful
           on targets for which it provides better performance, or if
           you wish to verify that the program will work on other
           systems that always treat uninitialized variable definitions
           this way.

       <b>-fno-ident</b>
           Ignore the "#ident" directive.

       <b>-finhibit-size-directive</b>
           Don't output a ".size" assembler directive, or anything else
           that would cause trouble if the function is split in the
           middle, and the two halves are placed at locations far apart
           in memory.  This option is used when compiling <i>crtstuff.c</i>;
           you should not need to use it for anything else.

       <b>-fverbose-asm</b>
           Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly
           code to make it more readable.  This option is generally only
           of use to those who actually need to read the generated
           assembly code (perhaps while debugging the compiler itself).

           <b>-fno-verbose-asm</b>, the default, causes the extra information
           to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
           files.

           The added comments include:

           *   information on the compiler version and command-line
               options,

           *   the source code lines associated with the assembly
               instructions, in the form FILENAME:LINENUMBER:CONTENT OF
               LINE,

           *   hints on which high-level expressions correspond to the
               various assembly instruction operands.

           For example, given this C source file:

                   int test (int n)
                   {
                     int i;
                     int total = 0;

                     for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
                       total += i * i;

                     return total;
                   }

           compiling to (x86_64) assembly via <b>-S </b>and emitting the result
           direct to stdout via <b>-o -</b>

                   gcc -S test.c -fverbose-asm -Os -o -

           gives output similar to this:

           The comments are intended for humans rather than machines and
           hence the precise format of the comments is subject to
           change.

       <b>-frecord-gcc-switches</b>
           This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
           compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being
           created.  This switch is only implemented on some targets and
           the exact format of the recording is target and binary file
           format dependent, but it usually takes the form of a section
           containing ASCII text.  This switch is related to the
           <b>-fverbose-asm </b>switch, but that switch only records
           information in the assembler output file as comments, so it
           never reaches the object file.  See also
           <b>-grecord-gcc-switches </b>for another way of storing compiler
           options into the object file.

       <b>-fpic</b>
           Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in
           a shared library, if supported for the target machine.  Such
           code accesses all constant addresses through a global offset
           table (GOT).  The dynamic loader resolves the GOT entries
           when the program starts (the dynamic loader is not part of
           GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If the GOT size
           for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific maximum
           size, you get an error message from the linker indicating
           that <b>-fpic </b>does not work; in that case, recompile with <b>-fPIC</b>
           instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the SPARC, 28k on AArch64
           and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000.  The x86 has no such limit.)

           Position-independent code requires special support, and
           therefore works only on certain machines.  For the x86, GCC
           supports PIC for System V but not for the Sun 386i.  Code
           generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always position-independent.

           When this flag is set, the macros "__pic__" and "__PIC__" are
           defined to 1.

       <b>-fPIC</b>
           If supported for the target machine, emit position-
           independent code, suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding
           any limit on the size of the global offset table.  This
           option makes a difference on AArch64, m68k, PowerPC and
           SPARC.

           Position-independent code requires special support, and
           therefore works only on certain machines.

           When this flag is set, the macros "__pic__" and "__PIC__" are
           defined to 2.

       <b>-fpie</b>
       <b>-fPIE</b>
           These options are similar to <b>-fpic </b>and <b>-fPIC</b>, but the
           generated position-independent code can be only linked into
           executables.  Usually these options are used to compile code
           that will be linked using the <b>-pie </b>GCC option.

           <b>-fpie </b>and <b>-fPIE </b>both define the macros "__pie__" and
           "__PIE__".  The macros have the value 1 for <b>-fpie </b>and 2 for
           <b>-fPIE</b>.

       <b>-fno-plt</b>
           Do not use the PLT for external function calls in position-
           independent code.  Instead, load the callee address at call
           sites from the GOT and branch to it.  This leads to more
           efficient code by eliminating PLT stubs and exposing GOT
           loads to optimizations.  On architectures such as 32-bit x86
           where PLT stubs expect the GOT pointer in a specific
           register, this gives more register allocation freedom to the
           compiler.  Lazy binding requires use of the PLT; with
           <b>-fno-plt </b>all external symbols are resolved at load time.

           Alternatively, the function attribute "noplt" can be used to
           avoid calls through the PLT for specific external functions.

           In position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls
           to functions that are marked to not use the PLT to use the
           GOT instead.

       <b>-fno-jump-tables</b>
           Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it
           would be more efficient than other code generation
           strategies.  This option is of use in conjunction with <b>-fpic</b>
           or <b>-fPIC </b>for building code that forms part of a dynamic
           linker and cannot reference the address of a jump table.  On
           some targets, jump tables do not require a GOT and this
           option is not needed.

       <b>-ffixed-</b><i>reg</i>
           Treat the register named <i>reg</i> as a fixed register; generated
           code should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack
           pointer, frame pointer or in some other fixed role).

           <i>reg</i> must be the name of a register.  The register names
           accepted are machine-specific and are defined in the
           "REGISTER_NAMES" macro in the machine description macro file.

           This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies
           a three-way choice.

       <b>-fcall-used-</b><i>reg</i>
           Treat the register named <i>reg</i> as an allocable register that is
           clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for
           temporaries or variables that do not live across a call.
           Functions compiled this way do not save and restore the
           register <i>reg</i>.

           It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or
           stack pointer.  Use of this flag for other registers that
           have fixed pervasive roles in the machine's execution model
           produces disastrous results.

           This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies
           a three-way choice.

       <b>-fcall-saved-</b><i>reg</i>
           Treat the register named <i>reg</i> as an allocable register saved
           by functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or
           variables that live across a call.  Functions compiled this
           way save and restore the register <i>reg</i> if they use it.

           It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or
           stack pointer.  Use of this flag for other registers that
           have fixed pervasive roles in the machine's execution model
           produces disastrous results.

           A different sort of disaster results from the use of this
           flag for a register in which function values may be returned.

           This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies
           a three-way choice.

       <b>-fpack-struct[=</b><i>n</i><b>]</b>
           Without a value specified, pack all structure members
           together without holes.  When a value is specified (which
           must be a small power of two), pack structure members
           according to this value, representing the maximum alignment
           (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger
           than this are output potentially unaligned at the next
           fitting location.

           <b>Warning: </b>the <b>-fpack-struct </b>switch causes GCC to generate code
           that is not binary compatible with code generated without
           that switch.  Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
           Use it to conform to a non-default application binary
           interface.

       <b>-fleading-underscore</b>
           This option and its counterpart, <b>-fno-leading-underscore</b>,
           forcibly change the way C symbols are represented in the
           object file.  One use is to help link with legacy assembly
           code.

           <b>Warning: </b>the <b>-fleading-underscore </b>switch causes GCC to
           generate code that is not binary compatible with code
           generated without that switch.  Use it to conform to a non-
           default application binary interface.  Not all targets
           provide complete support for this switch.

       <b>-ftls-model=</b><i>model</i>
           Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.  The <i>model</i>
           argument should be one of <b>global-dynamic</b>, <b>local-dynamic</b>,
           <b>initial-exec </b>or <b>local-exec</b>.  Note that the choice is subject
           to optimization: the compiler may use a more efficient model
           for symbols not visible outside of the translation unit, or
           if <b>-fpic </b>is not given on the command line.

           The default without <b>-fpic </b>is <b>initial-exec</b>; with <b>-fpic </b>the
           default is <b>global-dynamic</b>.

       <b>-ftrampolines</b>
           For targets that normally need trampolines for nested
           functions, always generate them instead of using descriptors.
           Otherwise, for targets that do not need them, like for
           example HP-PA or IA-64, do nothing.

           A trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run
           time on the stack when the address of a nested function is
           taken, and is used to call the nested function indirectly.
           Therefore, it requires the stack to be made executable in
           order for the program to work properly.

           <b>-fno-trampolines </b>is enabled by default on a language by
           language basis to let the compiler avoid generating them, if
           it computes that this is safe, and replace them with
           descriptors.  Descriptors are made up of data only, but the
           generated code must be prepared to deal with them.  As of
           this writing, <b>-fno-trampolines </b>is enabled by default only for
           Ada.

           Moreover, code compiled with <b>-ftrampolines </b>and code compiled
           with <b>-fno-trampolines </b>are not binary compatible if nested
           functions are present.  This option must therefore be used on
           a program-wide basis and be manipulated with extreme care.

       <b>-fvisibility=</b>[<b>default</b>|<b>internal</b>|<b>hidden</b>|<b>protected</b>]
           Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified
           option---all symbols are marked with this unless overridden
           within the code.  Using this feature can very substantially
           improve linking and load times of shared object libraries,
           produce more optimized code, provide near-perfect API export
           and prevent symbol clashes.  It is <b>strongly </b>recommended that
           you use this in any shared objects you distribute.

           Despite the nomenclature, <b>default </b>always means public; i.e.,
           available to be linked against from outside the shared
           object.  <b>protected </b>and <b>internal </b>are pretty useless in real-
           world usage so the only other commonly used option is <b>hidden</b>.
           The default if <b>-fvisibility </b>isn't specified is <b>default</b>, i.e.,
           make every symbol public.

           A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF
           symbols have the correct visibility is given by "How To Write
           Shared Libraries" by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
           &lt;<b><a href="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/">https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/</a> </b>&gt;)---however a superior
           solution made possible by this option to marking things
           hidden when the default is public is to make the default
           hidden and mark things public.  This is the norm with DLLs on
           Windows and with <b>-fvisibility=hidden </b>and "__attribute__
           ((visibility("default")))" instead of "__declspec(dllexport)"
           you get almost identical semantics with identical syntax.
           This is a great boon to those working with cross-platform
           projects.

           For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may
           find "#pragma GCC visibility" of use.  This works by you
           enclosing the declarations you wish to set visibility for
           with (for example) "#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)" and
           "#pragma GCC visibility pop".  Bear in mind that symbol
           visibility should be viewed <b>as part of the API interface</b>
           <b>contract </b>and thus all new code should always specify
           visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
           only for use within the local DSO should <b>always </b>be marked
           explicitly as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection
           overheads---making this abundantly clear also aids
           readability and self-documentation of the code.  Note that
           due to ISO C++ specification requirements, "operator new" and
           "operator delete" must always be of default visibility.

           Be aware that headers from outside your project, in
           particular system headers and headers from any other library
           you use, may not be expecting to be compiled with visibility
           other than the default.  You may need to explicitly say
           "#pragma GCC visibility push(default)" before including any
           such headers.

           "extern" declarations are not affected by <b>-fvisibility</b>, so a
           lot of code can be recompiled with <b>-fvisibility=hidden </b>with
           no modifications.  However, this means that calls to "extern"
           functions with no explicit visibility use the PLT, so it is
           more effective to use "__attribute ((visibility))" and/or
           "#pragma GCC visibility" to tell the compiler which "extern"
           declarations should be treated as hidden.

           Note that <b>-fvisibility </b>does affect C++ vague linkage
           entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class
           that is be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with
           default visibility so that the <b>type_info </b>nodes are unified
           between the DSOs.

           An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to
           use them is at &lt;<b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a> </b>&gt;.

       <b>-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</b>
           This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields
           (or other structure fields, although the compiler usually
           honors those types anyway) should use a single access of the
           width of the field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if
           possible.  For example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral
           registers might require all such accesses to be 16 bits wide;
           with this flag you can declare all peripheral bit-fields as
           "unsigned short" (assuming short is 16 bits on these targets)
           to force GCC to use 16-bit accesses instead of, perhaps, a
           more efficient 32-bit access.

           If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most
           efficient instruction.  In the previous example, that might
           be a 32-bit load instruction, even though that accesses bytes
           that do not contain any portion of the bit-field, or memory-
           mapped registers unrelated to the one being updated.

           In some cases, such as when the "packed" attribute is applied
           to a structure field, it may not be possible to access the
           field with a single read or write that is correctly aligned
           for the target machine.  In this case GCC falls back to
           generating multiple accesses rather than code that will fault
           or truncate the result at run time.

           Note:  Due to restrictions of the C/C++11 memory model, write
           accesses are not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It
           is therefore recommended to define all bits of the field's
           type as bit-field members.

           The default value of this option is determined by the
           application binary interface for the target processor.

       <b>-fsync-libcalls</b>
           This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the
           "__sync" family of functions may be used to implement the
           C++11 "__atomic" family of functions.

           The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only
           useful form of the option is <b>-fno-sync-libcalls</b>.  This option
           is used in the implementation of the <i>libatomic</i> runtime
           library.

   <b>GCC Developer Options</b>
       This section describes command-line options that are primarily of
       interest to GCC developers, including options to support compiler
       testing and investigation of compiler bugs and compile-time
       performance problems.  This includes options that produce debug
       dumps at various points in the compilation; that print statistics
       such as memory use and execution time; and that print information
       about GCC's configuration, such as where it searches for
       libraries.  You should rarely need to use any of these options
       for ordinary compilation and linking tasks.

       Many developer options that cause GCC to dump output to a file
       take an optional <b>=</b><i>filename</i> suffix. You can specify <b>stdout </b>or <b>- </b>to
       dump to standard output, and <b>stderr </b>for standard error.

       If <b>=</b><i>filename</i> is omitted, a default dump file name is constructed
       by concatenating the base dump file name, a pass number, phase
       letter, and pass name.  The base dump file name is the name of
       output file produced by the compiler if explicitly specified and
       not an executable; otherwise it is the source file name.  The
       pass number is determined by the order passes are registered with
       the compiler's pass manager.  This is generally the same as the
       order of execution, but passes registered by plugins, target-
       specific passes, or passes that are otherwise registered late are
       numbered higher than the pass named <b>final</b>, even if they are
       executed earlier.  The phase letter is one of <b>i </b>(inter-procedural
       analysis), <b>l </b>(language-specific), <b>r </b>(RTL), or <b>t </b>(tree).  The
       files are created in the directory of the output file.

       <b>-d</b><i>letters</i>
       <b>-fdump-rtl-</b><i>pass</i>
       <b>-fdump-rtl-</b><i>pass</i><b>=</b><i>filename</i>
           Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times
           specified by <i>letters</i>.  This is used for debugging the RTL-
           based passes of the compiler.

           Some <b>-d</b><i>letters</i> switches have different meaning when <b>-E </b>is
           used for preprocessing.

           Debug dumps can be enabled with a <b>-fdump-rtl </b>switch or some
           <b>-d </b>option <i>letters</i>.  Here are the possible letters for use in
           <i>pass</i> and <i>letters</i>, and their meanings:

           <b>-fdump-rtl-dfinit</b>
           <b>-fdump-rtl-dfinish</b>
               These dumps are defined but always produce empty files.

           <b>-da</b>
           <b>-fdump-rtl-all</b>
               Produce all the dumps listed above.

           <b>-dA </b>Annotate the assembler output with miscellaneous
               debugging information.

           <b>-dD </b>Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing,
               in addition to normal output.

           <b>-dH </b>Produce a core dump whenever an error occurs.

               each instruction.  Also turns on <b>-dp </b>annotation.

           <b>-dx </b>Just generate RTL for a function instead of compiling it.
               Usually used with <b>-fdump-rtl-expand</b>.

       <b>-fdump-debug</b>
           Dump debugging information generated during the debug
           generation phase.

       <b>-fdump-earlydebug</b>
           Dump debugging information generated during the early debug
           generation phase.

       <b>-fdump-noaddr</b>
           When doing debugging dumps, suppress address output.  This
           makes it more feasible to use diff on debugging dumps for
           compiler invocations with different compiler binaries and/or
           different text / bss / data / heap / stack / dso start
           locations.

       <b>-freport-bug</b>
           Collect and dump debug information into a temporary file if
           an internal compiler error (ICE) occurs.

       <b>-fdump-unnumbered</b>
           When doing debugging dumps, suppress instruction numbers and
           address output.  This makes it more feasible to use diff on
           debugging dumps for compiler invocations with different
           options, in particular with and without <b>-g</b>.

       <b>-fdump-unnumbered-links</b>
           When doing debugging dumps (see <b>-d </b>option above), suppress
           instruction numbers for the links to the previous and next
           instructions in a sequence.

       <b>-fdump-ipa-</b><i>switch</i>
       <b>-fdump-ipa-</b><i>switch</i><b>-</b><i>options</i>
           Control the dumping at various stages of inter-procedural
           analysis language tree to a file.  The file name is generated
           by appending a switch specific suffix to the source file
           name, and the file is created in the same directory as the
           output file.  The following dumps are possible:

           <b>all </b>Enables all inter-procedural analysis dumps.

           <b>cgraph</b>
               Dumps information about call-graph optimization, unused
               function removal, and inlining decisions.

           <b>inline</b>
               Dump after function inlining.

           Additionally, the options <b>-optimized</b>, <b>-missed</b>, <b>-note</b>, and
           <b>-all </b>can be provided, with the same meaning as for
           <b>-fopt-info</b>, defaulting to <b>-optimized</b>.

           For example, <b>-fdump-ipa-inline-optimized-missed </b>will emit
           information on callsites that were inlined, along with
           callsites that were not inlined.

           By default, the dump will contain messages about successful
           optimizations (equivalent to <b>-optimized</b>) together with low-
           level details about the analysis.

       <b>-fdump-lang-all</b>
       <b>-fdump-lang-</b><i>switch</i>
       <b>-fdump-lang-</b><i>switch</i><b>-</b><i>options</i>
       <b>-fdump-lang-</b><i>switch</i><b>-</b><i>options</i><b>=</b><i>filename</i>
           Control the dumping of language-specific information.  The
           <i>options</i> and <i>filename</i> portions behave as described in the
           <b>-fdump-tree </b>option.  The following <i>switch</i> values are
           accepted:

           <b>all </b>Enable all language-specific dumps.

           <b>class</b>
               Dump class hierarchy information.  Virtual table
               information is emitted unless '<b>slim</b>' is specified.  This
               option is applicable to C++ only.

           <b>raw </b>Dump the raw internal tree data.  This option is
               applicable to C++ only.

       <b>-fdump-passes</b>
           Print on <i>stderr</i> the list of optimization passes that are
           turned on and off by the current command-line options.

       <b>-fdump-statistics-</b><i>option</i>
           Enable and control dumping of pass statistics in a separate
           file.  The file name is generated by appending a suffix
           ending in <b>.statistics </b>to the source file name, and the file
           is created in the same directory as the output file.  If the
           <b>-</b><i>option</i> form is used, <b>-stats </b>causes counters to be summed
           over the whole compilation unit while <b>-details </b>dumps every
           event as the passes generate them.  The default with no
           option is to sum counters for each function compiled.

       <b>-fdump-tree-all</b>
       <b>-fdump-tree-</b><i>switch</i>
       <b>-fdump-tree-</b><i>switch</i><b>-</b><i>options</i>
       <b>-fdump-tree-</b><i>switch</i><b>-</b><i>options</i><b>=</b><i>filename</i>
           Control the dumping at various stages of processing the
           intermediate language tree to a file.  If the <b>-</b><i>options</i> form
           is used, <i>options</i> is a list of <b>- </b>separated options which
           control the details of the dump.  Not all options are
           applicable to all dumps; those that are not meaningful are
           ignored.  The following options are available

           <b>address</b>
               Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not
               meaningful as it changes according to the environment and
               source file.  Its primary use is for tying up a dump file
               with a debug environment.

           <b>asmname</b>
               If "DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME" has been set for a given decl,
               use that in the dump instead of "DECL_NAME".  Its primary
               use is ease of use working backward from mangled names in
               the assembly file.

           <b>slim</b>
               When dumping front-end intermediate representations,
               inhibit dumping of members of a scope or body of a
               function merely because that scope has been reached.
               Only dump such items when they are directly reachable by
               some other path.

               When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option inhibits
               dumping the bodies of control structures.

               When dumping RTL, print the RTL in slim (condensed) form
               instead of the default LISP-like representation.

           <b>raw </b>Print a raw representation of the tree.  By default,
               trees are pretty-printed into a C-like representation.

           <b>details</b>
               Enable more detailed dumps (not honored by every dump
               option). Also include information from the optimization
               passes.

           <b>stats</b>
               Enable dumping various statistics about the pass (not
               honored by every dump option).

           <b>blocks</b>
               Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled in raw
               dumps).

           <b>graph</b>
               For each of the other indicated dump files
               (<b>-fdump-rtl-</b><i>pass</i>), dump a representation of the control
               flow graph suitable for viewing with GraphViz to
               <i>file.passid.pass.dot</i>.  Each function in the file is
               pretty-printed as a subgraph, so that GraphViz can render
               them all in a single plot.

               This option currently only works for RTL dumps, and the
               RTL is always dumped in slim form.

           <b>vops</b>
               Enable showing virtual operands for every statement.

           <b>lineno</b>
               Enable showing line numbers for statements.

           <b>uid </b>Enable showing the unique ID ("DECL_UID") for each
               variable.

           <b>verbose</b>
               Enable showing the tree dump for each statement.

           <b>eh  </b>Enable showing the EH region number holding each
               statement.

           <b>scev</b>
               Enable showing scalar evolution analysis details.

           <b>optimized</b>
               Enable showing optimization information (only available
               in certain passes).

           <b>missed</b>
               Enable showing missed optimization information (only
               available in certain passes).

           <b>note</b>
               Enable other detailed optimization information (only
               available in certain passes).

           <b>all </b>Turn on all options, except <b>raw</b>, <b>slim</b>, <b>verbose </b>and
               <b>lineno</b>.

           <b>optall</b>
               Turn on all optimization options, i.e., <b>optimized</b>,
               <b>missed</b>, and <b>note</b>.

           To determine what tree dumps are available or find the dump
           for a pass of interest follow the steps below.

           1.  Invoke GCC with <b>-fdump-passes </b>and in the <i>stderr</i> output
               look for a code that corresponds to the pass you are
               interested in.  For example, the codes "tree-evrp",
               "tree-vrp1", and "tree-vrp2" correspond to the three
               Value Range Propagation passes.  The number at the end
               distinguishes distinct invocations of the same pass.

           2.  To enable the creation of the dump file, append the pass
               code to the <b>-fdump- </b>option prefix and invoke GCC with it.
               For example, to enable the dump from the Early Value
               Range Propagation pass, invoke GCC with the
               <b>-fdump-tree-evrp </b>option.  Optionally, you may specify the
               name of the dump file.  If you don't specify one, GCC
               creates as described below.

           3.  Find the pass dump in a file whose name is composed of
               three components separated by a period: the name of the
               source file GCC was invoked to compile, a numeric suffix
               indicating the pass number followed by the letter <b>t </b>for
               tree passes (and the letter <b>r </b>for RTL passes), and
               finally the pass code.  For example, the Early VRP pass
               dump might be in a file named <i>myfile.c.038t.evrp</i> in the
               current working directory.  Note that the numeric codes
               are not stable and may change from one version of GCC to
               another.

       <b>-fopt-info</b>
       <b>-fopt-info-</b><i>options</i>
       <b>-fopt-info-</b><i>options</i><b>=</b><i>filename</i>
           Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes.
           If the <b>-</b><i>options</i> form is used, <i>options</i> is a list of <b>-</b>
           separated option keywords to select the dump details and
           optimizations.

           The <i>options</i> can be divided into three groups:

           1.  options describing what kinds of messages should be
               emitted,

           2.  options describing the verbosity of the dump, and

           3.  options describing which optimizations should be
               included.

           The options from each group can be freely mixed as they are
           non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts, the later
           options override the earlier options on the command line.

           The following options control which kinds of messages should
           be emitted:

           <b>optimized</b>
               Print information when an optimization is successfully
               applied. It is up to a pass to decide which information
               is relevant. For example, the vectorizer passes print the
               source location of loops which are successfully
               vectorized.

           <b>missed</b>
               Print information about missed optimizations. Individual
               passes control which information to include in the
               output.

           <b>note</b>
               Print verbose information about optimizations, such as
               certain transformations, more detailed messages about
               decisions etc.

           <b>all </b>Print detailed optimization information. This includes
               <b>optimized</b>, <b>missed</b>, and <b>note</b>.

           The following option controls the dump verbosity:

           <b>internals</b>
               By default, only "high-level" messages are emitted. This
               option enables additional, more detailed, messages, which
               are likely to only be of interest to GCC developers.

           One or more of the following option keywords can be used to
           describe a group of optimizations:

           <b>ipa </b>Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations.

           <b>loop</b>
               Enable dumps from all loop optimizations.

           <b>inline</b>
               Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations.

           <b>omp </b>Enable dumps from all OMP (Offloading and Multi
               Processing) optimizations.

           <b>vec </b>Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations.

           <b>optall</b>
               Enable dumps from all optimizations. This is a superset
               of the optimization groups listed above.

           If <i>options</i> is omitted, it defaults to <b>optimized-optall</b>, which
           means to dump messages about successful optimizations from
           all the passes, omitting messages that are treated as
           "internals".

           If the <i>filename</i> is provided, then the dumps from all the
           applicable optimizations are concatenated into the <i>filename</i>.
           Otherwise the dump is output onto <i>stderr</i>. Though multiple
           <b>-fopt-info </b>options are accepted, only one of them can include
           a <i>filename</i>. If other filenames are provided then all but the
           first such option are ignored.

           Note that the output <i>filename</i> is overwritten in case of
           multiple translation units. If a combined output from
           multiple translation units is desired, <i>stderr</i> should be used
           instead.

           In the following example, the optimization info is output to
           <i>stderr</i>:

                   gcc -O3 -fopt-info

           This example:

                   gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all

           outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
           <i>missed.all</i>, and this one:

                   gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed

           prints information about missed optimization opportunities
           from vectorization passes on <i>stderr</i>.  Note that
           <b>-fopt-info-vec-missed </b>is equivalent to <b>-fopt-info-missed-vec</b>.
           The order of the optimization group names and message types
           listed after <b>-fopt-info </b>does not matter.

           As another example,

                   gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt

           outputs information about missed optimizations as well as
           optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
           <i>inline.txt</i>.

           Finally, consider:

                   gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt

           Here the two output filenames <i>vec.miss</i> and <i>loop.opt</i> are in
           conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case,
           only the first option takes effect and the subsequent options
           are ignored. Thus only <i>vec.miss</i> is produced which contains
           dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

       <b>-fsave-optimization-record</b>
           Write a SRCFILE.opt-record.json.gz file detailing what
           optimizations were performed, for those optimizations that
           support <b>-fopt-info</b>.

           This option is experimental and the format of the data within
           the compressed JSON file is subject to change.

           It is roughly equivalent to a machine-readable version of
           <b>-fopt-info-all</b>, as a collection of messages with source file,
           line number and column number, with the following additional
           data for each message:

           *   the execution count of the code being optimized, along
               with metadata about whether this was from actual profile
               data, or just an estimate, allowing consumers to
               prioritize messages by code hotness,

           *   the function name of the code being optimized, where
               applicable,

           *   the "inlining chain" for the code being optimized, so
               that when a function is inlined into several different
               places (which might themselves be inlined), the reader
               can distinguish between the copies,

           *   objects identifying those parts of the message that refer
               to expressions, statements or symbol-table nodes, which
               of these categories they are, and, when available, their
               source code location,

           *   the GCC pass that emitted the message, and

           *   the location in GCC's own code from which the message was
               emitted

           Additionally, some messages are logically nested within other
           messages, reflecting implementation details of the
           optimization passes.

       <b>-fsched-verbose=</b><i>n</i>
           On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option
           controls the amount of debugging output the scheduler prints
           to the dump files.

           For <i>n</i> greater than zero, <b>-fsched-verbose </b>outputs the same
           information as <b>-fdump-rtl-sched1 </b>and <b>-fdump-rtl-sched2</b>.  For
           <i>n</i> greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
           detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For <i>n</i>
           greater than two, it includes RTL at abort point, control-
           flow and regions info.  And for <i>n</i> over four, <b>-fsched-verbose</b>
           also includes dependence info.

       <b>-fenable-</b><i>kind</i><b>-</b><i>pass</i>
       <b>-fdisable-</b><i>kind</i><b>-</b><i>pass</i><b>=</b><i>range-list</i>
           This is a set of options that are used to explicitly
           disable/enable optimization passes.  These options are
           intended for use for debugging GCC.  Compiler users should
           use regular options for enabling/disabling passes instead.

           <b>-fdisable-ipa-</b><i>pass</i>
               Disable IPA pass <i>pass</i>. <i>pass</i> is the pass name.  If the
               same pass is statically invoked in the compiler multiple
               times, the pass name should be appended with a sequential
               number starting from 1.

           <b>-fdisable-rtl-</b><i>pass</i>
           <b>-fdisable-rtl-</b><i>pass</i><b>=</b><i>range-list</i>
               Disable RTL pass <i>pass</i>.  <i>pass</i> is the pass name.  If the
               same pass is statically invoked in the compiler multiple
               times, the pass name should be appended with a sequential
               number starting from 1.  <i>range-list</i> is a comma-separated
               list of function ranges or assembler names.  Each range
               is a number pair separated by a colon.  The range is
               inclusive in both ends.  If the range is trivial, the
               number pair can be simplified as a single number.  If the
               function's call graph node's <i>uid</i> falls within one of the
               specified ranges, the <i>pass</i> is disabled for that function.
               The <i>uid</i> is shown in the function header of a dump file,
               and the pass names can be dumped by using option
               <b>-fdump-passes</b>.

           <b>-fdisable-tree-</b><i>pass</i>
           <b>-fdisable-tree-</b><i>pass</i><b>=</b><i>range-list</i>
               Disable tree pass <i>pass</i>.  See <b>-fdisable-rtl </b>for the
               description of option arguments.

           <b>-fenable-ipa-</b><i>pass</i>
               Enable IPA pass <i>pass</i>.  <i>pass</i> is the pass name.  If the
               same pass is statically invoked in the compiler multiple
               times, the pass name should be appended with a sequential
               number starting from 1.

           <b>-fenable-rtl-</b><i>pass</i>
           <b>-fenable-rtl-</b><i>pass</i><b>=</b><i>range-list</i>
               Enable RTL pass <i>pass</i>.  See <b>-fdisable-rtl </b>for option
               argument description and examples.

           <b>-fenable-tree-</b><i>pass</i>
           <b>-fenable-tree-</b><i>pass</i><b>=</b><i>range-list</i>
               Enable tree pass <i>pass</i>.  See <b>-fdisable-rtl </b>for the
               description of option arguments.

           Here are some examples showing uses of these options.

                   # disable ccp1 for all functions
                      -fdisable-tree-ccp1
                   # disable complete unroll for function whose cgraph node uid is 1
                      -fenable-tree-cunroll=1
                   # disable gcse2 for functions at the following ranges [1,1],
                   # [300,400], and [400,1000]
                   # disable gcse2 for functions foo and foo2
                      -fdisable-rtl-gcse2=foo,foo2
                   # disable early inlining
                      -fdisable-tree-einline
                   # disable ipa inlining
                      -fdisable-ipa-inline
                   # enable tree full unroll
                      -fenable-tree-unroll

       <b>-fchecking</b>
       <b>-fchecking=</b><i>n</i>
           Enable internal consistency checking.  The default depends on
           the compiler configuration.  <b>-fchecking=2 </b>enables further
           internal consistency checking that might affect code
           generation.

       <b>-frandom-seed=</b><i>string</i>
           This option provides a seed that GCC uses in place of random
           numbers in generating certain symbol names that have to be
           different in every compiled file.  It is also used to place
           unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files
           that produce them.  You can use the <b>-frandom-seed </b>option to
           produce reproducibly identical object files.

           The <i>string</i> can either be a number (decimal, octal or hex) or
           an arbitrary string (in which case it's converted to a number
           by computing CRC32).

           The <i>string</i> should be different for every file you compile.

       <b>-save-temps</b>
       <b>-save-temps=cwd</b>
           Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently;
           place them in the current directory and name them based on
           the source file.  Thus, compiling <i>foo.c</i> with <b>-c -save-temps</b>
           produces files <i>foo.i</i> and <i>foo.s</i>, as well as <i>foo.o</i>.  This
           creates a preprocessed <i>foo.i</i> output file even though the
           compiler now normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

           When used in combination with the <b>-x </b>command-line option,
           <b>-save-temps </b>is sensible enough to avoid over writing an input
           source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
           The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by
           renaming the source file before using <b>-save-temps</b>.

           If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different
           source files that share a common base name in different
           subdirectories or the same source file compiled for multiple
           output destinations, it is likely that the different parallel
           compilers will interfere with each other, and overwrite the
           temporary files.  For instance:

                   gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&amp;
                   gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&amp;

           may result in <i>foo.i</i> and <i>foo.o</i> being written to simultaneously
           by both compilers.

       <b>-save-temps=obj</b>
           Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently.
           If the <b>-o </b>option is used, the temporary files are based on
           the object file.  If the <b>-o </b>option is not used, the
           <b>-save-temps=obj </b>switch behaves like <b>-save-temps</b>.

           For example:

                   gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
                   gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o
                   gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar

           creates <i>foo.i</i>, <i>foo.s</i>, <i>dir/xbar.i</i>, <i>dir/xbar.s</i>, <i>dir2/yfoobar.i</i>,
           <i>dir2/yfoobar.s</i>, and <i>dir2/yfoobar.o</i>.

       <b>-time</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
           Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the
           compilation sequence.  For C source files, this is the
           compiler proper and assembler (plus the linker if linking is
           done).

           Without the specification of an output file, the output looks
           like this:

                   # cc1 0.12 0.01
                   # as 0.00 0.01

           The first number on each line is the "user time", that is
           time spent executing the program itself.  The second number
           is "system time", time spent executing operating system
           routines on behalf of the program.  Both numbers are in
           seconds.

           With the specification of an output file, the output is
           appended to the named file, and it looks like this:

                   0.12 0.01 cc1 &lt;options&gt;
                   0.00 0.01 as &lt;options&gt;

           The "user time" and the "system time" are moved before the
           program name, and the options passed to the program are
           displayed, so that one can later tell what file was being
           compiled, and with which options.

       <b>-fdump-final-insns</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
           Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to <i>file</i>.  If the
           optional argument is omitted (or if <i>file</i> is "."), the name of
           the dump file is determined by appending ".gkd" to the
           compilation output file name.

       <b>-fcompare-debug</b>[<b>=</b><i>opts</i>]
           If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a
           second time, adding <i>opts</i> and <b>-fcompare-debug-second </b>to the
           arguments passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final
           internal representation in both compilations, and print an
           error if they differ.

           If the equal sign is omitted, the default <b>-gtoggle </b>is used.

           The environment variable <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b>, if defined, non-
           empty and nonzero, implicitly enables <b>-fcompare-debug</b>.  If
           <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG </b>is defined to a string starting with a
           dash, then it is used for <i>opts</i>, otherwise the default
           <b>-gtoggle </b>is used.

           <b>-fcompare-debug=</b>, with the equal sign but without <i>opts</i>, is
           equivalent to <b>-fno-compare-debug</b>, which disables the dumping
           of the final representation and the second compilation,
           preventing even <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG </b>from taking effect.

           To verify full coverage during <b>-fcompare-debug </b>testing, set
           <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG </b>to say <b>-fcompare-debug-not-overridden</b>,
           which GCC rejects as an invalid option in any actual
           compilation (rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).
           To get just a warning, setting <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG </b>to
           <b>-w%n-fcompare-debug not overridden </b>will do.

       <b>-fcompare-debug-second</b>
           This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the
           second compilation requested by <b>-fcompare-debug</b>, along with
           options to silence warnings, and omitting other options that
           would cause the compiler to produce output to files or to
           standard output as a side effect.  Dump files and preserved
           temporary files are renamed so as to contain the ".gk"
           additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid
           overwriting those generated by the first.

           When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes
           the <i>first</i> compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful
           for little other than debugging the compiler proper.

       <b>-gtoggle</b>
           Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
           generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The
           position of this argument in the command line does not
           matter; it takes effect after all other options are
           processed, and it does so only once, no matter how many times
           it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
           <b>-fcompare-debug</b>.

       <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle</b>
           Toggle <b>-fvar-tracking-assignments</b>, in the same way that
           <b>-gtoggle </b>toggles <b>-g</b>.

       <b>-Q  </b>Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is
           compiled, and print some statistics about each pass when it
           finishes.

       <b>-ftime-report</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time
           consumed by each pass when it finishes.

       <b>-ftime-report-details</b>
           Record the time consumed by infrastructure parts separately
           for each pass.

       <b>-fira-verbose=</b><i>n</i>
           Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated
           register allocator.  The default value is 5.  If the value <i>n</i>
           is greater or equal to 10, the dump output is sent to stderr
           using the same format as <i>n</i> minus 10.

       <b>-flto-report</b>
           Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the
           link-time optimizer.  The contents of this report vary from
           version to version.  It is meant to be useful to GCC
           developers when processing object files in LTO mode (via
           <b>-flto</b>).

           Disabled by default.

       <b>-flto-report-wpa</b>
           Like <b>-flto-report</b>, but only print for the WPA phase of Link
           Time Optimization.

       <b>-fmem-report</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent
           memory allocation when it finishes.

       <b>-fmem-report-wpa</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent
           memory allocation for the WPA phase only.

       <b>-fpre-ipa-mem-report</b>
       <b>-fpost-ipa-mem-report</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent
           memory allocation before or after interprocedural
           optimization.

       <b>-fprofile-report</b>
           Makes the compiler print some statistics about consistency of
           the (estimated) profile and effect of individual passes.

       <b>-fstack-usage</b>
           Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the
           program, on a per-function basis.  The filename for the dump
           is made by appending <i>.su</i> to the <i>auxname</i>.  <i>auxname</i> is
           generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly
           specified and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the
           basename of the source file.  An entry is made up of three
           fields:

           *   The name of the function.

           *   A number of bytes.

           *   One or more qualifiers: "static", "dynamic", "bounded".

           The qualifier "static" means that the function manipulates
           the stack statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated
           for the frame on function entry and released on function
           exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made in the
           function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.

           The qualifier "dynamic" means that the function manipulates
           the stack dynamically: in addition to the static allocation
           described above, stack adjustments are made in the body of
           the function, for example to push/pop arguments around
           function calls.  If the qualifier "bounded" is also present,
           the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time
           and the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of
           stack used by the function.  If it is not present, the amount
           of these adjustments is not bounded at compile time and the
           second field only represents the bounded part.

       <b>-fstats</b>
           Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the
           compilation.  This option is supported only by the C++ front
           end, and the information is generally only useful to the G++
           development team.

       <b>-fdbg-cnt-list</b>
           Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug
           counters.

       <b>-fdbg-cnt=</b><i>counter-value-list</i>
           Set the internal debug counter lower and upper bound.
           <i>counter-value-list</i> is a comma-separated list of
           <i>name</i>:<i>lower_bound</i>:<i>upper_bound</i> tuples which sets the lower and
           the upper bound of each debug counter <i>name</i>.  The <i>lower_bound</i>
           is optional and is zero initialized if not set.  All debug
           counters have the initial upper bound of "UINT_MAX"; thus
           "dbg_cnt" returns true always unless the upper bound is set
           by this option.  For example, with
           <b>-fdbg-cnt=dce:2:4,tail_call:10</b>, "dbg_cnt(dce)" returns true
           only for third and fourth invocation.  For
           "dbg_cnt(tail_call)" true is returned for first 10
           invocations.

       <b>-print-file-name=</b><i>library</i>
           Print the full absolute name of the library file <i>library</i> that
           would be used when linking---and don't do anything else.
           With this option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it
           just prints the file name.

       <b>-print-multi-directory</b>
           Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib
           selected by any other switches present in the command line.
           This directory is supposed to exist in <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.

       <b>-print-multi-lib</b>
           Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler
           switches that enable them.  The directory name is separated
           from the switches by <b>;</b>, and each switch starts with an <b>@</b>
           instead of the <b>-</b>, without spaces between multiple switches.
           This is supposed to ease shell processing.

       <b>-print-multi-os-directory</b>
           Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multilib,
           relative to some <i>lib</i> subdirectory.  If OS libraries are
           present in the <i>lib</i> subdirectory and no multilibs are used,
           this is usually just <i>.</i>, if OS libraries are present in
           <i>libsuffix</i> sibling directories this prints e.g. <i>../lib64</i>,
           <i>../lib</i> or <i>../lib32</i>, or if OS libraries are present in
           <i>lib/subdir</i> subdirectories it prints e.g. <i>amd64</i>, <i>sparcv9</i> or
           <i>ev6</i>.

       <b>-print-multiarch</b>
           Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multiarch,
           relative to some <i>lib</i> subdirectory.

       <b>-print-prog-name=</b><i>program</i>
           Like <b>-print-file-name</b>, but searches for a program such as
           <b>cpp</b>.

       <b>-print-libgcc-file-name</b>
           Same as <b>-print-file-name=libgcc.a</b>.

           This is useful when you use <b>-nostdlib </b>or <b>-nodefaultlibs </b>but
           you do want to link with <i>libgcc.a</i>.  You can do:

                   gcc -nostdlib &lt;files&gt;... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

       <b>-print-search-dirs</b>
           Print the name of the configured installation directory and a
           list of program and library directories <b>gcc </b>searches---and
           don't do anything else.

           This is useful when <b>gcc </b>prints the error message <b>installation</b>
           <b>problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory</b>.  To
           resolve this you either need to put <i>cpp0</i> and the other
           compiler components where <b>gcc </b>expects to find them, or you
           can set the environment variable <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX </b>to the
           directory where you installed them.  Don't forget the
           trailing <b>/</b>.

       <b>-print-sysroot</b>
           Print the target sysroot directory that is used during
           compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at
           configure time or using the <b>--sysroot </b>option, possibly with
           an extra suffix that depends on compilation options.  If no
           target sysroot is specified, the option prints nothing.

       <b>-print-sysroot-headers-suffix</b>
           Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching
           for headers, or give an error if the compiler is not
           configured with such a suffix---and don't do anything else.

       <b>-dumpmachine</b>
           Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
           <b>i686-pc-linux-gnu</b>)---and don't do anything else.

       <b>-dumpversion</b>
           Print the compiler version (for example, 3.0, 6.3.0 or
           7)---and don't do anything else.  This is the compiler
           version used in filesystem paths and specs. Depending on how
           the compiler has been configured it can be just a single
           number (major version), two numbers separated by a dot (major
           and minor version) or three numbers separated by dots (major,
           minor and patchlevel version).

       <b>-dumpfullversion</b>
           Print the full compiler version---and don't do anything else.
           The output is always three numbers separated by dots, major,
           minor and patchlevel version.

       <b>-dumpspecs</b>
           Print the compiler's built-in specs---and don't do anything
           else.  (This is used when GCC itself is being built.)

   <b>Machine-Dependent Options</b>
       Each target machine supported by GCC can have its own
       options---for example, to allow you to compile for a particular
       processor variant or ABI, or to control optimizations specific to
       that machine.  By convention, the names of machine-specific
       options start with <b>-m</b>.

       Some configurations of the compiler also support additional
       target-specific options, usually for compatibility with other
       compilers on the same platform.

       <i>AArch64 Options</i>

       These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:

       <b>-mabi=</b><i>name</i>
           Generate code for the specified data model.  Permissible
           values are <b>ilp32 </b>for SysV-like data model where int, long int
           and pointers are 32 bits, and <b>lp64 </b>for SysV-like data model
           where int is 32 bits, but long int and pointers are 64 bits.

           The default depends on the specific target configuration.
           Note that the LP64 and ILP32 ABIs are not link-compatible;
           you must compile your entire program with the same ABI, and
           link with a compatible set of libraries.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate big-endian code.  This is the default when GCC is
           configured for an <b>aarch64_be-*-* </b>target.

       <b>-mgeneral-regs-only</b>
           Generate code which uses only the general-purpose registers.
           This will prevent the compiler from using floating-point and
           Advanced SIMD registers but will not impose any restrictions
           on the assembler.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate little-endian code.  This is the default when GCC is
           configured for an <b>aarch64-*-* </b>but not an <b>aarch64_be-*-*</b>
           target.

       <b>-mcmodel=tiny</b>
           Generate code for the tiny code model.  The program and its
           statically defined symbols must be within 1MB of each other.
           Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

       <b>-mcmodel=small</b>
           Generate code for the small code model.  The program and its
           statically defined symbols must be within 4GB of each other.
           Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.  This is
           the default code model.

       <b>-mcmodel=large</b>
           Generate code for the large code model.  This makes no
           assumptions about addresses and sizes of sections.  Programs
           can be statically linked only.

       <b>-mstrict-align</b>
       <b>-mno-strict-align</b>
           Avoid or allow generating memory accesses that may not be
           aligned on a natural object boundary as described in the
           architecture specification.

       <b>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
       <b>-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
           Omit or keep the frame pointer in leaf functions.  The former
           behavior is the default.

       <b>-mstack-protector-guard=</b><i>guard</i>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><i>reg</i>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><i>offset</i>
           Generate stack protection code using canary at <i>guard</i>.
           Supported locations are <b>global </b>for a global canary or <b>sysreg</b>
           for a canary in an appropriate system register.

           With the latter choice the options
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><i>reg</i> and
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><i>offset</i> furthermore specify
           which system register to use as base register for reading the
           canary, and from what offset from that base register. There
           is no default register or offset as this is entirely for use
           within the Linux kernel.

       <b>-mstack-protector-guard=</b><i>guard</i>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><i>reg</i>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><i>offset</i>
           Generate stack protection code using canary at <i>guard</i>.
           Supported locations are <b>global </b>for a global canary or <b>sysreg</b>
           for a canary in an appropriate system register.

           With the latter choice the options
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><i>reg</i> and
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><i>offset</i> furthermore specify
           which system register to use as base register for reading the
           canary, and from what offset from that base register. There
           is no default register or offset as this is entirely for use
           within the Linux kernel.

       <b>-mtls-dialect=desc</b>
           Use TLS descriptors as the thread-local storage mechanism for
           dynamic accesses of TLS variables.  This is the default.

       <b>-mtls-dialect=traditional</b>
           Use traditional TLS as the thread-local storage mechanism for
           dynamic accesses of TLS variables.

       <b>-mtls-size=</b><i>size</i>
           Specify bit size of immediate TLS offsets.  Valid values are
           12, 24, 32, 48.  This option requires binutils 2.26 or newer.

       <b>-mfix-cortex-a53-835769</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769</b>
           Enable or disable the workaround for the ARM Cortex-A53
           erratum number 835769.  This involves inserting a NOP
           instruction between memory instructions and 64-bit integer
           multiply-accumulate instructions.

       <b>-mfix-cortex-a53-843419</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-843419</b>
           Enable or disable the workaround for the ARM Cortex-A53
           erratum number 843419.  This erratum workaround is made at
           link time and this will only pass the corresponding flag to
           the linker.

       <b>-mlow-precision-recip-sqrt</b>
       <b>-mno-low-precision-recip-sqrt</b>
           Enable or disable the reciprocal square root approximation.
           This option only has an effect if <b>-ffast-math </b>or
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>is used as well.  Enabling this
           reduces precision of reciprocal square root results to about
           16 bits for single precision and to 32 bits for double
           precision.

       <b>-mlow-precision-sqrt</b>
       <b>-mno-low-precision-sqrt</b>
           Enable or disable the square root approximation.  This option
           only has an effect if <b>-ffast-math </b>or
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>is used as well.  Enabling this
           reduces precision of square root results to about 16 bits for
           single precision and to 32 bits for double precision.  If
           enabled, it implies <b>-mlow-precision-recip-sqrt</b>.

       <b>-mlow-precision-div</b>
       <b>-mno-low-precision-div</b>
           Enable or disable the division approximation.  This option
           only has an effect if <b>-ffast-math </b>or
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>is used as well.  Enabling this
           reduces precision of division results to about 16 bits for
           single precision and to 32 bits for double precision.

       <b>-mtrack-speculation</b>
       <b>-mno-track-speculation</b>
           Enable or disable generation of additional code to track
           speculative execution through conditional branches.  The
           tracking state can then be used by the compiler when
           expanding calls to "__builtin_speculation_safe_copy" to
           permit a more efficient code sequence to be generated.

       <b>-moutline-atomics</b>
       <b>-mno-outline-atomics</b>
           Enable or disable calls to out-of-line helpers to implement
           atomic operations.  These helpers will, at runtime, determine
           if the LSE instructions from ARMv8.1-A can be used; if not,
           they will use the load/store-exclusive instructions that are
           present in the base ARMv8.0 ISA.

           This option is only applicable when compiling for the base
           ARMv8.0 instruction set.  If using a later revision, e.g.
           <b>-march=armv8.1-a </b>or <b>-march=armv8-a+lse</b>, the ARMv8.1-Atomics
           instructions will be used directly.  The same applies when
           using <b>-mcpu= </b>when the selected cpu supports the <b>lse </b>feature.

       <b>-march=</b><i>name</i>
           Specify the name of the target architecture and, optionally,
           one or more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
           <b>-march=</b><i>arch</i>{<b>+</b>[<b>no</b>]<i>feature</i>}*.

           The permissible values for <i>arch</i> are <b>armv8-a</b>, <b>armv8.1-a</b>,
           <b>armv8.2-a</b>, <b>armv8.3-a</b>, <b>armv8.4-a</b>, <b>armv8.5-a </b>or <i>native</i>.

           The value <b>armv8.5-a </b>implies <b>armv8.4-a </b>and enables compiler
           support for the ARMv8.5-A architecture extensions.

           The value <b>armv8.4-a </b>implies <b>armv8.3-a </b>and enables compiler
           support for the ARMv8.4-A architecture extensions.

           The value <b>armv8.3-a </b>implies <b>armv8.2-a </b>and enables compiler
           support for the ARMv8.3-A architecture extensions.

           The value <b>armv8.2-a </b>implies <b>armv8.1-a </b>and enables compiler
           support for the ARMv8.2-A architecture extensions.

           The value <b>armv8.1-a </b>implies <b>armv8-a </b>and enables compiler
           support for the ARMv8.1-A architecture extension.  In
           particular, it enables the <b>+crc</b>, <b>+lse</b>, and <b>+rdma </b>features.

           The value <b>native </b>is available on native AArch64 GNU/Linux and
           causes the compiler to pick the architecture of the host
           system.  This option has no effect if the compiler is unable
           to recognize the architecture of the host system,

           The permissible values for <i>feature</i> are listed in the sub-
           section on <b>aarch64-feature-modifiers,,-march and -mcpu</b>
           <b>Feature Modifiers</b>.  Where conflicting feature modifiers are
           specified, the right-most feature is used.

           GCC uses <i>name</i> to determine what kind of instructions it can
           emit when generating assembly code.  If <b>-march </b>is specified
           without either of <b>-mtune </b>or <b>-mcpu </b>also being specified, the
           code is tuned to perform well across a range of target
           processors implementing the target architecture.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>name</i>
           Specify the name of the target processor for which GCC should
           tune the performance of the code.  Permissible values for
           this option are: <b>generic</b>, <b>cortex-a35</b>, <b>cortex-a53</b>, <b>cortex-a55</b>,
           <b>cortex-a57</b>, <b>cortex-a72</b>, <b>cortex-a73</b>, <b>cortex-a75</b>, <b>cortex-a76</b>,
           <b>ares</b>, <b>exynos-m1</b>, <b>emag</b>, <b>falkor</b>, <b>neoverse-e1</b>, <b>neoverse-n1</b>,
           <b>neoverse-n2</b>, <b>neoverse-v1</b>, <b>neoverse-512tvb</b>, <b>qdf24xx</b>, <b>saphira</b>,
           <b>phecda</b>, <b>xgene1</b>, <b>vulcan</b>, <b>octeontx</b>, <b>octeontx81</b>,  <b>octeontx83</b>,
           <b>a64fx</b>, <b>thunderx</b>, <b>thunderxt88</b>, <b>thunderxt88p1</b>, <b>thunderxt81</b>,
           <b>tsv110</b>, <b>thunderxt83</b>, <b>thunderx2t99</b>, <b>zeus</b>,
           <b>cortex-a57.cortex-a53</b>, <b>cortex-a72.cortex-a53</b>,
           <b>cortex-a73.cortex-a35</b>, <b>cortex-a73.cortex-a53</b>,
           <b>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</b>, <b>cortex-a76.cortex-a55 native</b>.

           The values <b>cortex-a57.cortex-a53</b>, <b>cortex-a72.cortex-a53</b>,
           <b>cortex-a73.cortex-a35</b>, <b>cortex-a73.cortex-a53</b>,
           <b>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</b>, <b>cortex-a76.cortex-a55 </b>specify that GCC
           should tune for a big.LITTLE system.

           The value <b>neoverse-512tvb </b>specifies that GCC should tune for
           Neoverse cores that (a) implement SVE and (b) have a total
           vector bandwidth of 512 bits per cycle.  In other words, the
           option tells GCC to tune for Neoverse cores that can execute
           4 128-bit Advanced SIMD arithmetic instructions a cycle and
           that can execute an equivalent number of SVE arithmetic
           instructions per cycle (2 for 256-bit SVE, 4 for 128-bit
           SVE).  This is more general than tuning for a specific core
           like Neoverse V1 but is more specific than the default tuning
           described below.

           Additionally on native AArch64 GNU/Linux systems the value
           <b>native </b>tunes performance to the host system.  This option has
           no effect if the compiler is unable to recognize the
           processor of the host system.

           Where none of <b>-mtune=</b>, <b>-mcpu= </b>or <b>-march= </b>are specified, the
           code is tuned to perform well across a range of target
           processors.

           This option cannot be suffixed by feature modifiers.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>name</i>
           Specify the name of the target processor, optionally suffixed
           by one or more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
           <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu</i>{<b>+</b>[<b>no</b>]<i>feature</i>}*, where the permissible values for
           <i>cpu</i> are the same as those available for <b>-mtune</b>.  The
           permissible values for <i>feature</i> are documented in the sub-
           section on <b>aarch64-feature-modifiers,,-march and -mcpu</b>
           <b>Feature Modifiers</b>.  Where conflicting feature modifiers are
           specified, the right-most feature is used.

           GCC uses <i>name</i> to determine what kind of instructions it can
           emit when generating assembly code (as if by <b>-march</b>) and to
           determine the target processor for which to tune for
           performance (as if by <b>-mtune</b>).  Where this option is used in
           conjunction with <b>-march </b>or <b>-mtune</b>, those options take
           precedence over the appropriate part of this option.

           <b>-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb </b>is special in that it does not refer to
           a specific core, but instead refers to all Neoverse cores
           that (a) implement SVE and (b) have a total vector bandwidth
           of 512 bits a cycle.  Unless overridden by <b>-march</b>,
           <b>-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb </b>generates code that can run on a
           Neoverse V1 core, since Neoverse V1 is the first Neoverse
           core with these properties.  Unless overridden by <b>-mtune</b>,
           <b>-mcpu=neoverse-512tvb </b>tunes code in the same way as for
           <b>-mtune=neoverse-512tvb</b>.

       <b>-moverride=</b><i>string</i>
           Override tuning decisions made by the back-end in response to
           a <b>-mtune= </b>switch.  The syntax, semantics, and accepted values
           for <i>string</i> in this option are not guaranteed to be consistent
           across releases.

           This option is only intended to be useful when developing
           GCC.

       <b>-mverbose-cost-dump</b>
           Enable verbose cost model dumping in the debug dump files.
           This option is provided for use in debugging the compiler.

       <b>-mpc-relative-literal-loads</b>
       <b>-mno-pc-relative-literal-loads</b>
           Enable or disable PC-relative literal loads.  With this
           option literal pools are accessed using a single instruction
           and emitted after each function.  This limits the maximum
           size of functions to 1MB.  This is enabled by default for
           <b>-mcmodel=tiny</b>.

       <b>-msign-return-address=</b><i>scope</i>
           Select the function scope on which return address signing
           will be applied.  Permissible values are <b>none</b>, which disables
           return address signing, <b>non-leaf</b>, which enables pointer
           signing for functions which are not leaf functions, and <b>all</b>,
           which enables pointer signing for all functions.  The default
           value is <b>none</b>. This option has been deprecated by
           -mbranch-protection.

       <b>-mbranch-protection=</b><i>none</i><b>|</b><i>standard</i><b>|</b><i>pac-ret</i><b>[+</b><i>leaf</i><b>]|</b><i>bti</i>
           Select the branch protection features to use.  <b>none </b>is the
           default and turns off all types of branch protection.
           <b>standard </b>turns on all types of branch protection features.
           If a feature has additional tuning options, then <b>standard</b>
           sets it to its standard level.  <b>pac-ret[+</b><i>leaf</i><b>] </b>turns on
           return address signing to its standard level: signing
           functions that save the return address to memory (non-leaf
           functions will practically always do this) using the a-key.
           The optional argument <b>leaf </b>can be used to extend the signing
           to include leaf functions.  <b>bti </b>turns on branch target
           identification mechanism.

       <b>-mharden-sls=</b><i>opts</i>
           Enable compiler hardening against straight line speculation
           (SLS).  <i>opts</i> is a comma-separated list of the following
           options:

           <b>retbr</b>
           <b>blr</b>

           In addition, <b>-mharden-sls=all </b>enables all SLS hardening while
           <b>-mharden-sls=none </b>disables all SLS hardening.

       <b>-msve-vector-bits=</b><i>bits</i>
           Specify the number of bits in an SVE vector register.  This
           option only has an effect when SVE is enabled.

           GCC supports two forms of SVE code generation: "vector-length
           agnostic" output that works with any size of vector register
           and "vector-length specific" output that allows GCC to make
           assumptions about the vector length when it is useful for
           optimization reasons.  The possible values of <b>bits </b>are:
           <b>scalable</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>256</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>1024 </b>and <b>2048</b>.  Specifying <b>scalable</b>
           selects vector-length agnostic output.  At present
           <b>-msve-vector-bits=128 </b>also generates vector-length agnostic
           output.  All other values generate vector-length specific
           code.  The behavior of these values may change in future
           releases and no value except <b>scalable </b>should be relied on for
           producing code that is portable across different hardware SVE
           vector lengths.

           The default is <b>-msve-vector-bits=scalable</b>, which produces
           vector-length agnostic code.

       <b>-march </b>and <b>-mcpu </b>Feature Modifiers

       Feature modifiers used with <b>-march </b>and <b>-mcpu </b>can be any of the
       following and their inverses <b>no</b><i>feature</i>:

       <b>crc </b>Enable CRC extension.  This is on by default for
           <b>-march=armv8.1-a</b>.

       <b>crypto</b>
           Enable Crypto extension.  This also enables Advanced SIMD and
           floating-point instructions.

       <b>fp  </b>Enable floating-point instructions.  This is on by default
           for all possible values for options <b>-march </b>and <b>-mcpu</b>.

       <b>simd</b>
           Enable Advanced SIMD instructions.  This also enables
           floating-point instructions.  This is on by default for all
           possible values for options <b>-march </b>and <b>-mcpu</b>.

       <b>sve </b>Enable Scalable Vector Extension instructions.  This also
           enables Advanced SIMD and floating-point instructions.

       <b>lse </b>Enable Large System Extension instructions.  This is on by
           default for <b>-march=armv8.1-a</b>.

       <b>rdma</b>
           Enable Round Double Multiply Accumulate instructions.  This
           is on by default for <b>-march=armv8.1-a</b>.

       <b>fp16</b>
           Enable FP16 extension.  This also enables floating-point
           instructions.

       <b>fp16fml</b>
           Enable FP16 fmla extension.  This also enables FP16
           extensions and floating-point instructions. This option is
           enabled by default for <b>-march=armv8.4-a</b>. Use of this option
           with architectures prior to Armv8.2-A is not supported.

       <b>rcpc</b>
           Enable the RcPc extension.  This does not change code
           generation from GCC, but is passed on to the assembler,
           enabling inline asm statements to use instructions from the
           RcPc extension.

       <b>dotprod</b>
           Enable the Dot Product extension.  This also enables Advanced
           SIMD instructions.

       <b>aes </b>Enable the Armv8-a aes and pmull crypto extension.  This also
           enables Advanced SIMD instructions.

       <b>sha2</b>
           Enable the Armv8-a sha2 crypto extension.  This also enables
           Advanced SIMD instructions.

       <b>sha3</b>
           Enable the sha512 and sha3 crypto extension.  This also
           enables Advanced SIMD instructions. Use of this option with
           architectures prior to Armv8.2-A is not supported.

       <b>sm4 </b>Enable the sm3 and sm4 crypto extension.  This also enables
           Advanced SIMD instructions.  Use of this option with
           architectures prior to Armv8.2-A is not supported.

       <b>profile</b>
           Enable the Statistical Profiling extension.  This option is
           only to enable the extension at the assembler level and does
           not affect code generation.

       <b>rng </b>Enable the Armv8.5-a Random Number instructions.  This option
           is only to enable the extension at the assembler level and
           does not affect code generation.

       <b>memtag</b>
           Enable the Armv8.5-a Memory Tagging Extensions.  This option
           is only to enable the extension at the assembler level and
           does not affect code generation.

       <b>sb  </b>Enable the Armv8-a Speculation Barrier instruction.  This
           option is only to enable the extension at the assembler level
           and does not affect code generation.  This option is enabled
           by default for <b>-march=armv8.5-a</b>.

       <b>ssbs</b>
           Enable the Armv8-a Speculative Store Bypass Safe instruction.
           This option is only to enable the extension at the assembler
           level and does not affect code generation.  This option is
           enabled by default for <b>-march=armv8.5-a</b>.

       <b>predres</b>
           Enable the Armv8-a Execution and Data Prediction Restriction
           instructions.  This option is only to enable the extension at
           the assembler level and does not affect code generation.
           This option is enabled by default for <b>-march=armv8.5-a</b>.

       Feature <b>crypto </b>implies <b>aes</b>, <b>sha2</b>, and <b>simd</b>, which implies <b>fp</b>.
       Conversely, <b>nofp </b>implies <b>nosimd</b>, which implies <b>nocrypto</b>, <b>noaes</b>
       and <b>nosha2</b>.

       <i>Adapteva Epiphany Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:

       <b>-mhalf-reg-file</b>
           Don't allocate any register in the range "r32"..."r63".  That
           allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these
           registers.

       <b>-mprefer-short-insn-regs</b>
           Preferentially allocate registers that allow short
           instruction generation.  This can result in increased
           instruction count, so this may either reduce or increase
           overall code size.

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><i>num</i>
           Set the cost of branches to roughly <i>num</i> "simple"
           instructions.  This cost is only a heuristic and is not
           guaranteed to produce consistent results across releases.

       <b>-mcmove</b>
           Enable the generation of conditional moves.

       <b>-mnops=</b><i>num</i>
           Emit <i>num</i> NOPs before every other generated instruction.

       <b>-mno-soft-cmpsf</b>
           For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an
           "fsub" instruction and test the flags.  This is faster than a
           software comparison, but can get incorrect results in the
           presence of NaNs, or when two different small numbers are
           compared such that their difference is calculated as zero.
           The default is <b>-msoft-cmpsf</b>, which uses slower, but IEEE-
           compliant, software comparisons.

       <b>-mstack-offset=</b><i>num</i>
           Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack
           pointer.  E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in
           the range "sp+0...sp+7" can be used by leaf functions without
           stack allocation.  Values other than <b>8 </b>or <b>16 </b>are untested and
           unlikely to work.  Note also that this option changes the
           ABI; compiling a program with a different stack offset than
           the libraries have been compiled with generally does not
           work.  This option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a
           different stack offset would give you better code, but to
           actually use a different stack offset to build working
           programs, it is recommended to configure the toolchain with
           the appropriate <b>--with-stack-offset=</b><i>num</i> option.

       <b>-mno-round-nearest</b>
           Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set
           to truncating.  The default is <b>-mround-nearest</b>.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
           If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls
           might be beyond the offset range of the "b" / "bl"
           instructions, and therefore load the function address into a
           register before performing a (otherwise direct) call.  This
           is the default.

       <b>-mshort-calls</b>
           If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct
           calls are in the range of the "b" / "bl" instructions, so use
           these instructions for direct calls.  The default is
           <b>-mlong-calls</b>.

       <b>-msmall16</b>
           Assume addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values.
           This does not apply to function addresses for which
           <b>-mlong-calls </b>semantics are in effect.

       <b>-mfp-mode=</b><i>mode</i>
           Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.  This
           determines the floating-point mode that is provided and
           expected at function call and return time.  Making this mode
           match the mode you predominantly need at function start can
           make your programs smaller and faster by avoiding unnecessary
           mode switches.

           <i>mode</i> can be set to one the following values:

           <b>caller</b>
               Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or
               restored when the function returns, and when it calls
               other functions.  This mode is useful for compiling
               libraries or other compilation units you might want to
               incorporate into different programs with different
               prevailing FPU modes, and the convenience of being able
               to use a single object file outweighs the size and speed
               overhead for any extra mode switching that might be
               needed, compared with what would be needed with a more
               specific choice of prevailing FPU mode.

           <b>truncate</b>
               This is the mode used for floating-point calculations
               with truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.
               That includes conversion from floating point to integer.

           <b>round-nearest</b>
               This is the mode used for floating-point calculations
               with round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.

           <b>int </b>This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in
               the FPU, e.g.  integer multiply, or integer multiply-and-
               accumulate.

           The default is <b>-mfp-mode=caller</b>

       <b>-mno-split-lohi</b>
       <b>-mno-postinc</b>
       <b>-mno-postmodify</b>
           Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting
           of 32-bit loads, generation of post-increment addresses, and
           generation of post-modify addresses.  The defaults are
           <b>msplit-lohi</b>, <b>-mpost-inc</b>, and <b>-mpost-modify</b>.

       <b>-mnovect-double</b>
           Change the preferred SIMD mode to SImode.  The default is
           <b>-mvect-double</b>, which uses DImode as preferred SIMD mode.

       <b>-max-vect-align=</b><i>num</i>
           The maximum alignment for SIMD vector mode types.  <i>num</i> may be
           4 or 8.  The default is 8.  Note that this is an ABI change,
           even though many library function interfaces are unaffected
           if they don't use SIMD vector modes in places that affect
           size and/or alignment of relevant types.

       <b>-msplit-vecmove-early</b>
           Split vector moves into single word moves before reload.  In
           theory this can give better register allocation, but so far
           the reverse seems to be generally the case.

       <b>-m1reg-</b><i>reg</i>
           Specify a register to hold the constant -1, which makes
           loading small negative constants and certain bitmasks faster.
           Allowable values for <i>reg</i> are <b>r43 </b>and <b>r63</b>, which specify use
           of that register as a fixed register, and <b>none</b>, which means
           that no register is used for this purpose.  The default is
           <b>-m1reg-none</b>.

       <i>AMD GCN Options</i>

       <b>-mstack-size=</b><i>bytes</i>
           Specify how many <i>bytes</i> of stack space will be requested for
           each GPU thread (wave-front).  Beware that there may be many
           threads and limited memory available.  The size of the stack
           allocation may also have an impact on run-time performance.
           The default is 32KB when using OpenACC or OpenMP, and 1MB
           otherwise.

       <b>-mirq-ctrl-saved=</b><i>register-range</i><b>, </b><i>blink</i><b>, </b><i>lp_count</i>
           Specifies general-purposes registers that the processor
           automatically saves/restores on interrupt entry and exit.
           <i>register-range</i> is specified as two registers separated by a
           dash.  The register range always starts with "r0", the upper
           limit is "fp" register.  <i>blink</i> and <i>lp_count</i> are optional.
           This option is only valid for ARC EM and ARC HS cores.

       <b>-mrgf-banked-regs=</b><i>number</i>
           Specifies the number of registers replicated in second
           register bank on entry to fast interrupt.  Fast interrupts
           are interrupts with the highest priority level P0.  These
           interrupts save only PC and STATUS32 registers to avoid
           memory transactions during interrupt entry and exit
           sequences.  Use this option when you are using fast

           for <i>width</i> are 8, 16, 20, 24, 28 and 32 bits.  The default
           width is fixed to 32 bits.  If the width is less than 32, the
           compiler does not attempt to transform loops in your program
           to use the zero-delay loop mechanism unless it is known that
           the "lp_count" register can hold the required loop-counter
           value.  Depending on the width specified, the compiler and
           run-time library might continue to use the loop mechanism for
           various needs.  This option defines macro "__ARC_LPC_WIDTH__"
           with the value of <i>width</i>.

       <b>-mrf16</b>
           This option instructs the compiler to generate code for a

       <b>-mmac-d16</b>
           Passed down to the assembler.  Also sets the preprocessor
           symbol "__Xxmac_d16".  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mmac-24</b>
           Passed down to the assembler.  Also sets the preprocessor
           symbol "__Xxmac_24".  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mrtsc</b>
           Passed down to the assembler to enable the 64-bit time-stamp
           counter extension instruction.  Also sets the preprocessor
           symbol "__Xrtsc".  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mswape</b>
           Passed down to the assembler to enable the swap byte ordering
           extension instruction.  Also sets the preprocessor symbol
           "__Xswape".

       <b>-mtelephony</b>
           Passed down to the assembler to enable dual- and single-
           operand instructions for telephony.  Also sets the
           preprocessor symbol "__Xtelephony".  This option is
           deprecated.

       <b>-mxy</b>
           Passed down to the assembler to enable the XY memory
           extension.  Also sets the preprocessor symbol "__Xxy".

       The following options control how the assembly code is annotated:

       <b>-misize</b>
           Annotate assembler instructions with estimated addresses.

       <b>-mannotate-align</b>
           Explain what alignment considerations lead to the decision to
           make an instruction short or long.

       The following options are passed through to the linker:

       <b>-marclinux</b>
           Passed through to the linker, to specify use of the
           "arclinux" emulation.  This option is enabled by default in
           tool chains built for "arc-linux-uclibc" and
           "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets when profiling is not requested.

       <b>-marclinux_prof</b>
           Passed through to the linker, to specify use of the
           "arclinux_prof" emulation.  This option is enabled by default
           in tool chains built for "arc-linux-uclibc" and
           "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets when profiling is requested.

       The following options control the semantics of generated code:

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
           Generate calls as register indirect calls, thus providing
           access to the full 32-bit address range.

       <b>-mmedium-calls</b>
           Don't use less than 25-bit addressing range for calls, which
           is the offset available for an unconditional branch-and-link
           instruction.  Conditional execution of function calls is
           suppressed, to allow use of the 25-bit range, rather than the
           21-bit range with conditional branch-and-link.  This is the
           default for tool chains built for "arc-linux-uclibc" and
           "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets.

       <b>-G </b><i>num</i>
           Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data
           section if that data is no bigger than <i>num</i> bytes.  The
           default value of <i>num</i> is 4 for any ARC configuration, or 8
           when we have double load/store operations.

       <b>-mno-sdata</b>
           Do not generate sdata references.  This is the default for
           tool chains built for "arc-linux-uclibc" and
           "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets.

       <b>-mvolatile-cache</b>
           Use ordinarily cached memory accesses for volatile
           references.  This is the default.

       <b>-mno-volatile-cache</b>
           Enable cache bypass for volatile references.

       The following options fine tune code generation:

       <b>-malign-call</b>
           Do alignment optimizations for call instructions.

       <b>-mauto-modify-reg</b>
           Enable the use of pre/post modify with register displacement.

       <b>-mbbit-peephole</b>
           Enable bbit peephole2.

       <b>-mno-brcc</b>
           This option disables a target-specific pass in <i>arc_reorg</i> to
           generate compare-and-branch ("br<i>cc"</i>) instructions.  It has no
           effect on generation of these instructions driven by the
           combiner pass.

       <b>-mcase-vector-pcrel</b>
           Use PC-relative switch case tables to enable case table
           shortening.  This is the default for <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-mcompact-casesi</b>
           Enable compact "casesi" pattern.  This is the default for
           <b>-Os</b>, and only available for ARCv1 cores.  This option is
           deprecated.

       <b>-mno-cond-exec</b>
           Disable the ARCompact-specific pass to generate conditional
           execution instructions.

           Due to delay slot scheduling and interactions between operand
           numbers, literal sizes, instruction lengths, and the support
           for conditional execution, the target-independent pass to
           generate conditional execution is often lacking, so the ARC
           port has kept a special pass around that tries to find more
           conditional execution generation opportunities after register
           allocation, branch shortening, and delay slot scheduling have
           been done.  This pass generally, but not always, improves
           performance and code size, at the cost of extra compilation
           time, which is why there is an option to switch it off.  If
           you have a problem with call instructions exceeding their
           allowable offset range because they are conditionalized, you
           should consider using <b>-mmedium-calls </b>instead.

       <b>-mearly-cbranchsi</b>
           Enable pre-reload use of the "cbranchsi" pattern.

       <b>-mexpand-adddi</b>
           Expand "adddi3" and "subdi3" at RTL generation time into
           "add.f", "adc" etc.  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mindexed-loads</b>
           Enable the use of indexed loads.  This can be problematic
           because some optimizers then assume that indexed stores
           exist, which is not the case.

       <b>-mlra</b>
           Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is still experimental
           for ARC, so by default the compiler uses standard reload
           (i.e. <b>-mno-lra</b>).

       <b>-mlra-priority-none</b>
           Don't indicate any priority for target registers.

       <b>-mlra-priority-compact</b>
           Indicate target register priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.

       <b>-mlra-priority-noncompact</b>
           Reduce target register priority for r0..r3 / r12..r15.

       <b>-mmillicode</b>
           When optimizing for size (using <b>-Os</b>), prologues and epilogues
           that have to save or restore a large number of registers are
           often shortened by using call to a special function in
           libgcc; this is referred to as a <i>millicode</i> call.  As these
           calls can pose performance issues, and/or cause linking
           issues when linking in a nonstandard way, this option is
           provided to turn on or off millicode call generation.

       <b>-mcode-density-frame</b>
           This option enable the compiler to emit "enter" and "leave"
           instructions.  These instructions are only valid for CPUs
           with code-density feature.

       <b>-mmixed-code</b>
           Tweak register allocation to help 16-bit instruction
           generation.  This generally has the effect of decreasing the
           average instruction size while increasing the instruction
           count.

       <b>-mq-class</b>
           Enable <b>q </b>instruction alternatives.  This is the default for
           <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-mRcq</b>
           Enable <b>Rcq </b>constraint handling.  Most short code generation
           depends on this.  This is the default.

       <b>-mRcw</b>
           Enable <b>Rcw </b>constraint handling.  Most ccfsm condexec mostly
           depends on this.  This is the default.

       <b>-msize-level=</b><i>level</i>
           Fine-tune size optimization with regards to instruction
           lengths and alignment.  The recognized values for <i>level</i> are:

           <b>0   </b>No size optimization.  This level is deprecated and
               treated like <b>1</b>.

           <b>1   </b>Short instructions are used opportunistically.

           <b>2   </b>In addition, alignment of loops and of code after
               barriers are dropped.

           <b>3   </b>In addition, optional data alignment is dropped, and the
               option <b>Os </b>is enabled.

           This defaults to <b>3 </b>when <b>-Os </b>is in effect.  Otherwise, the
           behavior when this is not set is equivalent to level <b>1</b>.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu</i>
           Set instruction scheduling parameters for <i>cpu</i>, overriding any
           implied by <b>-mcpu=</b>.

           Supported values for <i>cpu</i> are

           <b>ARC600</b>
               Tune for ARC600 CPU.

           <b>ARC601</b>
               Tune for ARC601 CPU.

           <b>ARC700</b>
               Tune for ARC700 CPU with standard multiplier block.

           <b>ARC700-xmac</b>
               Tune for ARC700 CPU with XMAC block.

           <b>ARC725D</b>
               Tune for ARC725D CPU.

           <b>ARC750D</b>
               Tune for ARC750D CPU.

       <b>-mmultcost=</b><i>num</i>
           Cost to assume for a multiply instruction, with <b>4 </b>being equal
           to a normal instruction.

       <b>-munalign-prob-threshold=</b><i>probability</i>
           Set probability threshold for unaligning branches.  When
           tuning for <b>ARC700 </b>and optimizing for speed, branches without
           filled delay slot are preferably emitted unaligned and long,
           unless profiling indicates that the probability for the
           branch to be taken is below <i>probability</i>.  The default is
           (REG_BR_PROB_BASE/2), i.e. 5000.

       The following options are maintained for backward compatibility,
       but are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

       <b>-margonaut</b>
           Obsolete FPX.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
       <b>-EB </b>Compile code for big-endian targets.  Use of these options is
           now deprecated.  Big-endian code is supported by configuring
           GCC to build "arceb-elf32" and "arceb-linux-uclibc" targets,
           for which big endian is the default.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
       <b>-EL </b>Compile code for little-endian targets.  Use of these options
           is now deprecated.  Little-endian code is supported by
           configuring GCC to build "arc-elf32" and "arc-linux-uclibc"
           targets, for which little endian is the default.

       <b>-mbarrel_shifter</b>

           respectively.

       <b>-multcost=</b><i>num</i>
           Replaced by <b>-mmultcost</b>.

       <i>ARM Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the ARM port:

       <b>-mabi=</b><i>name</i>
           Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are:
           <b>apcs-gnu</b>, <b>atpcs</b>, <b>aapcs</b>, <b>aapcs-linux </b>and <b>iwmmxt</b>.

       <b>-mapcs-frame</b>
           Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM
           Procedure Call Standard for all functions, even if this is
           not strictly necessary for correct execution of the code.
           Specifying <b>-fomit-frame-pointer </b>with this option causes the
           stack frames not to be generated for leaf functions.  The
           default is <b>-mno-apcs-frame</b>.  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mapcs</b>
           This is a synonym for <b>-mapcs-frame </b>and is deprecated.

       <b>-mthumb-interwork</b>
           Generate code that supports calling between the ARM and Thumb
           instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre-v5
           architectures, the two instruction sets cannot be reliably
           used inside one program.  The default is
           <b>-mno-thumb-interwork</b>, since slightly larger code is generated
           when <b>-mthumb-interwork </b>is specified.  In AAPCS configurations
           this option is meaningless.

       <b>-mno-sched-prolog</b>
           Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function
           prologue, or the merging of those instruction with the
           instructions in the function's body.  This means that all
           functions start with a recognizable set of instructions (or
           in fact one of a choice from a small set of different
           function prologues), and this information can be used to
           locate the start of functions inside an executable piece of
           code.  The default is <b>-msched-prolog</b>.

       <b>-mfloat-abi=</b><i>name</i>
           Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.  Permissible
           values are: <b>soft</b>, <b>softfp </b>and <b>hard</b>.

           Specifying <b>soft </b>causes GCC to generate output containing
           library calls for floating-point operations.  <b>softfp </b>allows
           the generation of code using hardware floating-point
           instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling
           conventions.  <b>hard </b>allows generation of floating-point
           instructions and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.

           The default depends on the specific target configuration.
           Note that the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-
           compatible; you must compile your entire program with the
           same ABI, and link with a compatible set of libraries.

       <b>-mgeneral-regs-only</b>
           Generate code which uses only the general-purpose registers.
           This will prevent the compiler from using floating-point and
           Advanced SIMD registers but will not impose any restrictions
           on the assembler.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.
           This is the default for all standard configurations.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the
           default is to compile code for a little-endian processor.

       <b>-mbe8</b>
       <b>-mbe32</b>
           When linking a big-endian image select between BE8 and BE32
           formats.  The option has no effect for little-endian images
           and is ignored.  The default is dependent on the selected
           target architecture.  For ARMv6 and later architectures the
           default is BE8, for older architectures the default is BE32.
           BE32 format has been deprecated by ARM.

       <b>-march=</b><i>name</i>[<b>+extension...</b>]
           This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC
           uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can
           emit when generating assembly code.  This option can be used
           in conjunction with or instead of the <b>-mcpu= </b>option.

           Permissible names are: <b>armv4t</b>, <b>armv5t</b>, <b>armv5te</b>, <b>armv6</b>,
           <b>armv6j</b>, <b>armv6k</b>, <b>armv6kz</b>, <b>armv6t2</b>, <b>armv6z</b>, <b>armv6zk</b>, <b>armv7</b>,
           <b>armv7-a</b>, <b>armv7ve</b>, <b>armv8-a</b>, <b>armv8.1-a</b>, <b>armv8.2-a</b>, <b>armv8.3-a</b>,
           <b>armv8.4-a</b>, <b>armv8.5-a</b>, <b>armv7-r</b>, <b>armv8-r</b>, <b>armv6-m</b>, <b>armv6s-m</b>,
           <b>armv7-m</b>, <b>armv7e-m</b>, <b>armv8-m.base</b>, <b>armv8-m.main</b>, <b>iwmmxt </b>and
           <b>iwmmxt2</b>.

           Additionally, the following architectures, which lack support
           for the Thumb execution state, are recognized but support is
           deprecated: <b>armv4</b>.

           Many of the architectures support extensions.  These can be
           added by appending <b>+</b><i>extension</i> to the architecture name.
           Extension options are processed in order and capabilities
           accumulate.  An extension will also enable any necessary base
           extensions upon which it depends.  For example, the <b>+crypto</b>
           extension will always enable the <b>+simd </b>extension.  The
           exception to the additive construction is for extensions that
           are prefixed with <b>+no...</b>: these extensions disable the
           specified option and any other extensions that may depend on
           the presence of that extension.

           For example, <b>-march=armv7-a+simd+nofp+vfpv4 </b>is equivalent to
           writing <b>-march=armv7-a+vfpv4 </b>since the <b>+simd </b>option is
           entirely disabled by the <b>+nofp </b>option that follows it.

           Most extension names are generically named, but have an
           effect that is dependent upon the architecture to which it is
           applied.  For example, the <b>+simd </b>option can be applied to
           both <b>armv7-a </b>and <b>armv8-a </b>architectures, but will enable the
           original ARMv7-A Advanced SIMD (Neon) extensions for <b>armv7-a</b>
           and the ARMv8-A variant for <b>armv8-a</b>.

           The table below lists the supported extensions for each
           architecture.  Architectures not mentioned do not support any
           extensions.

           <b>armv5te</b>
           <b>armv6</b>
           <b>armv6j</b>
           <b>armv6k</b>
           <b>armv6kz</b>
           <b>armv6t2</b>
           <b>armv6z</b>
           <b>armv6zk</b>
               <b>+fp </b>The VFPv2 floating-point instructions.  The extension
                   <b>+vfpv2 </b>can be used as an alias for this extension.

               <b>+nofp</b>
                   Disable the floating-point instructions.

           <b>armv7</b>
               The common subset of the ARMv7-A, ARMv7-R and ARMv7-M
               architectures.

               <b>+fp </b>The VFPv3 floating-point instructions, with 16
                   double-precision registers.  The extension <b>+vfpv3-d16</b>
                   can be used as an alias for this extension.  Note
                   that floating-point is not supported by the base
                   ARMv7-M architecture, but is compatible with both the
                   ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R architectures.

               <b>+nofp</b>
                   Disable the floating-point instructions.

           <b>armv7-a</b>
               <b>+mp </b>The multiprocessing extension.

               <b>+sec</b>

           current most popular processors, balancing between
           optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the range, and
           avoiding performance pitfalls of other CPUs.  The effects of
           this option may change in future GCC versions as CPU models
           come and go.

           <b>-mtune </b>permits the same extension options as <b>-mcpu</b>, but the
           extension options do not affect the tuning of the generated
           code.

           <b>-mtune=native </b>causes the compiler to auto-detect the CPU of
           the build computer.  At present, this feature is only
           supported on GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are
           recognized.  If the auto-detect is unsuccessful the option
           has no effect.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>name</i>[<b>+extension...</b>]
           This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC
           uses this name to derive the name of the target ARM
           architecture (as if specified by <b>-march</b>) and the ARM
           processor type for which to tune for performance (as if
           specified by <b>-mtune</b>).  Where this option is used in
           conjunction with <b>-march </b>or <b>-mtune</b>, those options take
           precedence over the appropriate part of this option.

           Many of the supported CPUs implement optional architectural
           extensions.  Where this is so the architectural extensions
           are normally enabled by default.  If implementations that
           lack the extension exist, then the extension syntax can be
           used to disable those extensions that have been omitted.  For
           floating-point and Advanced SIMD (Neon) instructions, the
           settings of the options <b>-mfloat-abi </b>and <b>-mfpu </b>must also be
           considered: floating-point and Advanced SIMD instructions
           will only be used if <b>-mfloat-abi </b>is not set to <b>soft</b>; and any
           setting of <b>-mfpu </b>other than <b>auto </b>will override the available
           floating-point and SIMD extension instructions.

           For example, <b>cortex-a9 </b>can be found in three major
           configurations: integer only, with just a floating-point unit
           or with floating-point and Advanced SIMD.  The default is to
           enable all the instructions, but the extensions <b>+nosimd </b>and
           <b>+nofp </b>can be used to disable just the SIMD or both the SIMD
           and floating-point instructions respectively.

           Permissible names for this option are the same as those for
           <b>-mtune</b>.

           The following extension options are common to the listed
           CPUs:

           <b>+nodsp</b>
               Disable the DSP instructions on <b>cortex-m33</b>.

           <b>+nofp</b>
               Disables the floating-point instructions on <b>arm9e</b>,
               <b>arm946e-s</b>, <b>arm966e-s</b>, <b>arm968e-s</b>, <b>arm10e</b>, <b>arm1020e</b>,
               <b>arm1022e</b>, <b>arm926ej-s</b>, <b>arm1026ej-s</b>, <b>cortex-r5</b>, <b>cortex-r7</b>,
               <b>cortex-r8</b>, <b>cortex-m4</b>, <b>cortex-m7 </b>and <b>cortex-m33</b>.  Disables
               the floating-point and SIMD instructions on
               <b>generic-armv7-a</b>, <b>cortex-a5</b>, <b>cortex-a7</b>, <b>cortex-a8</b>,
               <b>cortex-a9</b>, <b>cortex-a12</b>, <b>cortex-a15</b>, <b>cortex-a17</b>,
               <b>cortex-a15.cortex-a7</b>, <b>cortex-a17.cortex-a7</b>, <b>cortex-a32</b>,
               <b>cortex-a35</b>, <b>cortex-a53 </b>and <b>cortex-a55</b>.

           <b>+nofp.dp</b>
               Disables the double-precision component of the floating-
               point instructions on <b>cortex-r5</b>, <b>cortex-r7</b>, <b>cortex-r8</b>,
               <b>cortex-r52 </b>and <b>cortex-m7</b>.

           <b>+nosimd</b>
               Disables the SIMD (but not floating-point) instructions
               on <b>generic-armv7-a</b>, <b>cortex-a5</b>, <b>cortex-a7 </b>and <b>cortex-a9</b>.

           <b>+crypto</b>
               Enables the cryptographic instructions on <b>cortex-a32</b>,
               <b>cortex-a35</b>, <b>cortex-a53</b>, <b>cortex-a55</b>, <b>cortex-a57</b>,
               <b>cortex-a72</b>, <b>cortex-a73</b>, <b>cortex-a75</b>, <b>exynos-m1</b>, <b>xgene1</b>,
               <b>cortex-a57.cortex-a53</b>, <b>cortex-a72.cortex-a53</b>,
               <b>cortex-a73.cortex-a35</b>, <b>cortex-a73.cortex-a53 </b>and
               <b>cortex-a75.cortex-a55</b>.

           Additionally the <b>generic-armv7-a </b>pseudo target defaults to
           VFPv3 with 16 double-precision registers.  It supports the
           following extension options: <b>mp</b>, <b>sec</b>, <b>vfpv3-d16</b>, <b>vfpv3</b>,
           <b>vfpv3-d16-fp16</b>, <b>vfpv3-fp16</b>, <b>vfpv4-d16</b>, <b>vfpv4</b>, <b>neon</b>,
           <b>neon-vfpv3</b>, <b>neon-fp16</b>, <b>neon-vfpv4</b>.  The meanings are the same
           as for the extensions to <b>-march=armv7-a</b>.

           <b>-mcpu=generic-</b><i>arch</i> is also permissible, and is equivalent to
           <b>-march=</b><i>arch</i> <b>-mtune=generic-</b><i>arch</i>.  See <b>-mtune </b>for more
           information.

           <b>-mcpu=native </b>causes the compiler to auto-detect the CPU of
           the build computer.  At present, this feature is only
           supported on GNU/Linux, and not all architectures are
           recognized.  If the auto-detect is unsuccessful the option
           has no effect.

       <b>-mfpu=</b><i>name</i>
           This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware
           emulation) is available on the target.  Permissible names
           are: <b>auto</b>, <b>vfpv2</b>, <b>vfpv3</b>, <b>vfpv3-fp16</b>, <b>vfpv3-d16</b>,
           <b>vfpv3-d16-fp16</b>, <b>vfpv3xd</b>, <b>vfpv3xd-fp16</b>, <b>neon-vfpv3</b>, <b>neon-fp16</b>,
           <b>vfpv4</b>, <b>vfpv4-d16</b>, <b>fpv4-sp-d16</b>, <b>neon-vfpv4</b>, <b>fpv5-d16</b>,
           <b>fpv5-sp-d16</b>, <b>fp-armv8</b>, <b>neon-fp-armv8 </b>and
           <b>crypto-neon-fp-armv8</b>.  Note that <b>neon </b>is an alias for
           <b>neon-vfpv3 </b>and <b>vfp </b>is an alias for <b>vfpv2</b>.

           The setting <b>auto </b>is the default and is special.  It causes
           the compiler to select the floating-point and Advanced SIMD
           instructions based on the settings of <b>-mcpu </b>and <b>-march</b>.

           If the selected floating-point hardware includes the NEON
           extension (e.g. <b>-mfpu=neon</b>), note that floating-point
           operations are not generated by GCC's auto-vectorization pass
           unless <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>is also specified.  This
           is because NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE
           754 standard for floating-point arithmetic (in particular
           denormal values are treated as zero), so the use of NEON
           instructions may lead to a loss of precision.

           You can also set the fpu name at function level by using the
           "target("fpu=")" function attributes or pragmas.

       <b>-mfp16-format=</b><i>name</i>
           Specify the format of the "__fp16" half-precision floating-
           point type.  Permissible names are <b>none</b>, <b>ieee</b>, and
           <b>alternative</b>; the default is <b>none</b>, in which case the "__fp16"
           type is not defined.

       <b>-mstructure-size-boundary=</b><i>n</i>
           The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a
           multiple of the number of bits set by this option.
           Permissible values are 8, 32 and 64.  The default value
           varies for different toolchains.  For the COFF targeted
           toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only
           allowed if the underlying ABI supports it.

           Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient
           code, but can also increase the size of the program.
           Different values are potentially incompatible.  Code compiled
           with one value cannot necessarily expect to work with code or
           libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
           information using structures or unions.

           This option is deprecated.

       <b>-mabort-on-noreturn</b>
           Generate a call to the function "abort" at the end of a
           "noreturn" function.  It is executed if the function tries to
           return.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-long-calls</b>
           Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading
           the address of the function into a register and then
           performing a subroutine call on this register.  This switch
           is needed if the target function lies outside of the
           64-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based version of
           subroutine call instruction.

           Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are
           turned into long calls.  The heuristic is that static
           functions, functions that have the "short_call" attribute,
           functions that are inside the scope of a "#pragma
           no_long_calls" directive, and functions whose definitions
           have already been compiled within the current compilation
           unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to this
           rule are that weak function definitions, functions with the
           "long_call" attribute or the "section" attribute, and
           functions that are within the scope of a "#pragma long_calls"
           directive are always turned into long calls.

           This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
           <b>-mno-long-calls </b>restores the default behavior, as does
           placing the function calls within the scope of a "#pragma
           long_calls_off" directive.  Note these switches have no
           effect on how the compiler generates code to handle function
           calls via function pointers.

       <b>-msingle-pic-base</b>
           Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only,
           rather than loading it in the prologue for each function.
           The runtime system is responsible for initializing this
           register with an appropriate value before execution begins.

       <b>-mpic-register=</b><i>reg</i>
           Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing.  For
           standard PIC base case, the default is any suitable register
           determined by compiler.  For single PIC base case, the
           default is <b>R9 </b>if target is EABI based or stack-checking is
           enabled, otherwise the default is <b>R10</b>.

       <b>-mpic-data-is-text-relative</b>
           Assume that the displacement between the text and data
           segments is fixed at static link time.  This permits using
           PC-relative addressing operations to access data known to be
           in the data segment.  For non-VxWorks RTP targets, this
           option is enabled by default.  When disabled on such targets,
           it will enable <b>-msingle-pic-base </b>by default.

       <b>-mpoke-function-name</b>
           Write the name of each function into the text section,
           directly preceding the function prologue.  The generated code
           is similar to this:

                        t0
                            .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
                            .align
                        t1
                            .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
                        arm_poke_function_name
                            mov     ip, sp
                            stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
                            sub     fp, ip, #4

           When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value
           of "pc" stored at "fp + 0".  If the trace function then looks
           at location "pc - 12" and the top 8 bits are set, then we
           know that there is a function name embedded immediately
           preceding this location and has length "((pc[-3]) &amp;
           0xff000000)".

       <b>-mthumb</b>
       <b>-marm</b>
           Select between generating code that executes in ARM and Thumb
           states.  The default for most configurations is to generate
           code that executes in ARM state, but the default can be
           changed by configuring GCC with the <b>--with-mode=</b><i>state</i>
           configure option.

           You can also override the ARM and Thumb mode for each
           function by using the "target("thumb")" and "target("arm")"
           function attributes or pragmas.

       <b>-mflip-thumb</b>
           Switch ARM/Thumb modes on alternating functions.  This option
           is provided for regression testing of mixed Thumb/ARM code
           generation, and is not intended for ordinary use in compiling
           code.

       <b>-mtpcs-frame</b>
           Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb
           Procedure Call Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf
           function is one that does not call any other functions.)  The
           default is <b>-mno-tpcs-frame</b>.

       <b>-mtpcs-leaf-frame</b>
           Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb
           Procedure Call Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf
           function is one that does not call any other functions.)  The
           default is <b>-mno-apcs-leaf-frame</b>.

       <b>-mcallee-super-interworking</b>
           Gives all externally visible functions in the file being
           compiled an ARM instruction set header which switches to
           Thumb mode before executing the rest of the function.  This
           allows these functions to be called from non-interworking
           code.  This option is not valid in AAPCS configurations
           because interworking is enabled by default.

       <b>-mcaller-super-interworking</b>
           Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual
           functions) to execute correctly regardless of whether the
           target code has been compiled for interworking or not.  There
           is a small overhead in the cost of executing a function
           pointer if this option is enabled.  This option is not valid
           in AAPCS configurations because interworking is enabled by
           default.

       <b>-mtp=</b><i>name</i>
           Specify the access model for the thread local storage
           pointer.  The valid models are <b>soft</b>, which generates calls to
           "__aeabi_read_tp", <b>cp15</b>, which fetches the thread pointer
           from "cp15" directly (supported in the arm6k architecture),
           and <b>auto</b>, which uses the best available method for the
           selected processor.  The default setting is <b>auto</b>.

       <b>-mtls-dialect=</b><i>dialect</i>
           Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local
           storage.  Two <i>dialect</i>s are supported---<b>gnu </b>and <b>gnu2</b>.  The <b>gnu</b>
           dialect selects the original GNU scheme for supporting local
           and global dynamic TLS models.  The <b>gnu2 </b>dialect selects the
           GNU descriptor scheme, which provides better performance for
           shared libraries.  The GNU descriptor scheme is compatible
           with the original scheme, but does require new assembler,
           linker and library support.  Initial and local exec TLS
           models are unaffected by this option and always use the
           original scheme.

       <b>-mword-relocations</b>
           Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values (i.e.
           R_ARM_ABS32).  This is enabled by default on targets
           (uClinux, SymbianOS) where the runtime loader imposes this
           restriction, and when <b>-fpic </b>or <b>-fPIC </b>is specified. This
           option conflicts with <b>-mslow-flash-data</b>.

       <b>-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd</b>
           Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when "ldrd"
           instructions with overlapping destination and base registers
           are used.  This option avoids generating these instructions.
           This option is enabled by default when <b>-mcpu=cortex-m3 </b>is
           specified.

       <b>-munaligned-access</b>
       <b>-mno-unaligned-access</b>
           Enables (or disables) reading and writing of 16- and 32- bit
           values from addresses that are not 16- or 32- bit aligned.
           By default unaligned access is disabled for all pre-ARMv6,
           all ARMv6-M and for ARMv8-M Baseline architectures, and
           enabled for all other architectures.  If unaligned access is
           not enabled then words in packed data structures are accessed
           a byte at a time.

           The ARM attribute "Tag_CPU_unaligned_access" is set in the
           generated object file to either true or false, depending upon
           the setting of this option.  If unaligned access is enabled
           then the preprocessor symbol "__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED" is
           also defined.

       <b>-mneon-for-64bits</b>
           Enables using Neon to handle scalar 64-bits operations. This
           is disabled by default since the cost of moving data from
           core registers to Neon is high.

       <b>-mslow-flash-data</b>
           Assume loading data from flash is slower than fetching
           instruction.  Therefore literal load is minimized for better
           performance.  This option is only supported when compiling
           for ARMv7 M-profile and off by default. It conflicts with
           <b>-mword-relocations</b>.

       <b>-masm-syntax-unified</b>
           Assume inline assembler is using unified asm syntax.  The
           default is currently off which implies divided syntax.  This
           option has no impact on Thumb2. However, this may change in
           future releases of GCC.  Divided syntax should be considered
           deprecated.

       <b>-mrestrict-it</b>
           Restricts generation of IT blocks to conform to the rules of
           ARMv8-A.  IT blocks can only contain a single 16-bit
           instruction from a select set of instructions. This option is
           on by default for ARMv8-A Thumb mode.

       <b>-mprint-tune-info</b>
           Print CPU tuning information as comment in assembler file.
           This is an option used only for regression testing of the
           compiler and not intended for ordinary use in compiling code.
           This option is disabled by default.

       <b>-mverbose-cost-dump</b>
           Enable verbose cost model dumping in the debug dump files.
           This option is provided for use in debugging the compiler.

       <b>-mpure-code</b>
           Do not allow constant data to be placed in code sections.
           Additionally, when compiling for ELF object format give all
           text sections the ELF processor-specific section attribute
           "SHF_ARM_PURECODE".  This option is only available when
           generating non-pic code for M-profile targets.

       <b>-mcmse</b>
           Generate secure code as per the "ARMv8-M Security Extensions:

           "avr1"

       <b>-mabsdata</b>
           Assume that all data in static storage can be accessed by LDS
           / STS instructions.  This option has only an effect on
           reduced Tiny devices like ATtiny40.  See also the "absdata"
           <b>AVR Variable Attributes,variable attribute</b>.

       <b>-maccumulate-args</b>
           Accumulate outgoing function arguments and acquire/release
           the needed stack space for outgoing function arguments once
           in function prologue/epilogue.  Without this option, outgoing
           arguments are pushed before calling a function and popped
           afterwards.

           Popping the arguments after the function call can be
           expensive on AVR so that accumulating the stack space might
           lead to smaller executables because arguments need not be
           removed from the stack after such a function call.

           This option can lead to reduced code size for functions that
           perform several calls to functions that get their arguments
           on the stack like calls to printf-like functions.

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><i>cost</i>
           Set the branch costs for conditional branch instructions to
           <i>cost</i>.  Reasonable values for <i>cost</i> are small, non-negative
           integers. The default branch cost is 0.

       <b>-mcall-prologues</b>
           Functions prologues/epilogues are expanded as calls to
           appropriate subroutines.  Code size is smaller.

       <b>-mgas-isr-prologues</b>
           Interrupt service routines (ISRs) may use the "__gcc_isr"
           pseudo instruction supported by GNU Binutils.  If this option
           is on, the feature can still be disabled for individual ISRs
           by means of the <b>AVR Function Attributes,,"no_gccisr" </b>function
           attribute.  This feature is activated per default if
           optimization is on (but not with <b>-Og</b>, @pxref{Optimize
           Options}), and if GNU Binutils support PR21683
           ("https://sourceware.org/PR21683").

       <b>-mint8</b>
           Assume "int" to be 8-bit integer.  This affects the sizes of
           all types: a "char" is 1 byte, an "int" is 1 byte, a "long"
           is 2 bytes, and "long long" is 4 bytes.  Please note that
           this option does not conform to the C standards, but it
           results in smaller code size.

       <b>-mmain-is-OS_task</b>
           Do not save registers in "main".  The effect is the same like
           attaching attribute <b>AVR Function Attributes,,"OS_task" </b>to
           "main". It is activated per default if optimization is on.

       <b>-mn-flash=</b><i>num</i>
           Assume that the flash memory has a size of <i>num</i> times 64 KiB.

       <b>-mno-interrupts</b>
           Generated code is not compatible with hardware interrupts.
           Code size is smaller.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Try to replace "CALL" resp. "JMP" instruction by the shorter
           "RCALL" resp. "RJMP" instruction if applicable.  Setting
           <b>-mrelax </b>just adds the <b>--mlink-relax </b>option to the assembler's
           command line and the <b>--relax </b>option to the linker's command
           line.

           Jump relaxing is performed by the linker because jump offsets
           are not known before code is located. Therefore, the
           assembler code generated by the compiler is the same, but the
           instructions in the executable may differ from instructions
           in the assembler code.

           Relaxing must be turned on if linker stubs are needed, see
           the section on "EIND" and linker stubs below.

       <b>-mrmw</b>
           Assume that the device supports the Read-Modify-Write
           instructions "XCH", "LAC", "LAS" and "LAT".

       <b>-mshort-calls</b>
           Assume that "RJMP" and "RCALL" can target the whole program
           memory.

           This option is used internally for multilib selection.  It is
           not an optimization option, and you don't need to set it by
           hand.

       <b>-msp8</b>
           Treat the stack pointer register as an 8-bit register, i.e.
           assume the high byte of the stack pointer is zero.  In
           general, you don't need to set this option by hand.

           This option is used internally by the compiler to select and
           build multilibs for architectures "avr2" and "avr25".  These
           architectures mix devices with and without "SPH".  For any
           setting other than <b>-mmcu=avr2 </b>or <b>-mmcu=avr25 </b>the compiler
           driver adds or removes this option from the compiler proper's
           command line, because the compiler then knows if the device
           or architecture has an 8-bit stack pointer and thus no "SPH"
           register or not.

       <b>-mstrict-X</b>
           Use address register "X" in a way proposed by the hardware.
           This means that "X" is only used in indirect, post-increment
           or pre-decrement addressing.

           Without this option, the "X" register may be used in the same
           way as "Y" or "Z" which then is emulated by additional
           instructions.  For example, loading a value with "X+const"
           addressing with a small non-negative "const &lt; 64" to a
           register <i>Rn</i> is performed as

                   adiw r26, const   ; X += const
                   ld   &lt;Rn&gt;, X        ; &lt;Rn&gt; = *X
                   sbiw r26, const   ; X -= const

       <b>-mtiny-stack</b>
           Only change the lower 8 bits of the stack pointer.

       <b>-mfract-convert-truncate</b>
           Allow to use truncation instead of rounding towards zero for
           fractional fixed-point types.

       <b>-nodevicelib</b>
           Don't link against AVR-LibC's device specific library
           "lib&lt;mcu&gt;.a".

       <b>-nodevicespecs</b>
           Don't add <b>-specs=device-specs/specs-&lt;mcu&gt; </b>to the compiler
           driver's command line.  The user takes responsibility for
           supplying the sub-processes like compiler proper, assembler
           and linker with appropriate command line options.

       <b>-Waddr-space-convert</b>
           Warn about conversions between address spaces in the case
           where the resulting address space is not contained in the
           incoming address space.

       <b>-Wmisspelled-isr</b>
           Warn if the ISR is misspelled, i.e. without __vector prefix.
           Enabled by default.

       "EIND" and Devices with More Than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash

       Pointers in the implementation are 16 bits wide.  The address of
       a function or label is represented as word address so that
       indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the range
       of 64 Ki words.

       In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than
       128 Ki bytes of program memory space, there is a special function
       register called "EIND" that serves as most significant part of
       the target address when "EICALL" or "EIJMP" instructions are
       used.

       Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows
       by the compiler and are subject to some limitations:

       *   The compiler never sets "EIND".

       *   The compiler uses "EIND" implicitly in "EICALL"/"EIJMP"
           instructions or might read "EIND" directly in order to
           emulate an indirect call/jump by means of a "RET"
           instruction.

       *   The compiler assumes that "EIND" never changes during the
           startup code or during the application. In particular, "EIND"
           is not saved/restored in function or interrupt service
           routine prologue/epilogue.

       *   For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
           generates <i>stubs</i>. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
           <i>trampolines</i>. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a
           stub.  The stub contains a direct jump to the desired
           address.

       *   Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker
           generates the stubs correctly in all situations. See the
           compiler option <b>-mrelax </b>and the linker option <b>--relax</b>.  There
           are corner cases where the linker is supposed to generate
           stubs but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful
           error message.

       *   The default linker script is arranged for code with "EIND =
           0".  If code is supposed to work for a setup with "EIND !=
           0", a custom linker script has to be used in order to place
           the sections whose name start with ".trampolines" into the
           segment where "EIND" points to.

       *   The startup code from libgcc never sets "EIND".  Notice that
           startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC.
           For the impact of AVR-LibC on "EIND", see the AVR-
           LibC user manual ("http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/").

       *   It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up
           "EIND" early, for example by means of initialization code
           located in section ".init3". Such code runs prior to general
           startup code that initializes RAM and calls constructors, but
           after the bit of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets "EIND"
           to the segment where the vector table is located.

                   #include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;

                   static void
                   __attribute__((section(".init3"),naked,used,no_instrument_function))
                   init3_set_eind (void)
                   {
                     __asm volatile ("ldi r24,pm_hh8(__trampolines_start)\n\t"
                                     "out %i0,r24" :: "n" (&amp;EIND) : "r24","memory");
                   }

           The "__trampolines_start" symbol is defined in the linker
           script.

       *   Stubs are generated automatically by the linker if the
           following two conditions are met:

           -&lt;The address of a label is taken by means of the "gs"
           modifier&gt;
               (short for <i>generate stubs</i>) like so:

                       LDI r24, lo8(gs(&lt;func&gt;))
                       LDI r25, hi8(gs(&lt;func&gt;))

           -&lt;The final location of that label is in a code segment&gt;
               <i>outside</i> the segment where the stubs are located.

       *   The compiler emits such "gs" modifiers for code labels in the
           following situations:

           -&lt;Taking address of a function or code label.&gt;
           -&lt;Computed goto.&gt;
           -&lt;If prologue-save function is used, see <b>-mcall-prologues</b>&gt;
               command-line option.

           -&lt;Switch/case dispatch tables. If you do not want such
           dispatch&gt;
               tables you can specify the <b>-fno-jump-tables </b>command-line
               option.

           -&lt;C and C++ constructors/destructors called during
           startup/shutdown.&gt;
           -&lt;If the tools hit a "gs()" modifier explained above.&gt;
       *   Jumping to non-symbolic addresses like so is <i>not</i> supported:

                   int main (void)
                   {
                       /* Call function at word address 0x2 */
                       return ((int(*)(void)) 0x2)();
                   }

           Instead, a stub has to be set up, i.e. the function has to be
           called through a symbol ("func_4" in the example):

                   int main (void)
                   {
                       extern int func_4 (void);

                       /* Call function at byte address 0x4 */
                       return func_4();
                   }

           and the application be linked with <b>-Wl,--defsym,func_4=0x4</b>.
           Alternatively, "func_4" can be defined in the linker script.

       Handling of the "RAMPD", "RAMPX", "RAMPY" and "RAMPZ" Special
       Function Registers

       Some AVR devices support memories larger than the 64 KiB range
       that can be accessed with 16-bit pointers.  To access memory
       locations outside this 64 KiB range, the content of a "RAMP"
       register is used as high part of the address: The "X", "Y", "Z"
       address register is concatenated with the "RAMPX", "RAMPY",
       "RAMPZ" special function register, respectively, to get a wide
       address. Similarly, "RAMPD" is used together with direct
       addressing.

       *   The startup code initializes the "RAMP" special function
           registers with zero.

       *   If a <b>AVR Named Address Spaces,named address space </b>other than
           generic or "__flash" is used, then "RAMPZ" is set as needed
           before the operation.

       *   If the device supports RAM larger than 64 KiB and the
           compiler needs to change "RAMPZ" to accomplish an operation,
           "RAMPZ" is reset to zero after the operation.

       *   If the device comes with a specific "RAMP" register, the ISR
           prologue/epilogue saves/restores that SFR and initializes it
           with zero in case the ISR code might (implicitly) use it.

       *   RAM larger than 64 KiB is not supported by GCC for AVR
           targets.  If you use inline assembler to read from locations
           outside the 16-bit address range and change one of the "RAMP"
           registers, you must reset it to zero after the access.

       AVR Built-in Macros

       GCC defines several built-in macros so that the user code can
       test for the presence or absence of features.  Almost any of the
       following built-in macros are deduced from device capabilities
       and thus triggered by the <b>-mmcu= </b>command-line option.

       For even more AVR-specific built-in macros see <b>AVR Named Address</b>
       <b>Spaces </b>and <b>AVR Built-in Functions</b>.

       "__AVR_ARCH__"
           Build-in macro that resolves to a decimal number that
           identifies the architecture and depends on the <b>-mmcu=</b><i>mcu</i>
           option.  Possible values are:

           2, 25, 3, 31, 35, 4, 5, 51, 6

           for <i>mcu</i>="avr2", "avr25", "avr3", "avr31", "avr35", "avr4",
           "avr5", "avr51", "avr6",

           respectively and

           100, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107

           for <i>mcu</i>="avrtiny", "avrxmega2", "avrxmega3", "avrxmega4",
           "avrxmega5", "avrxmega6", "avrxmega7", respectively.  If <i>mcu</i>
           specifies a device, this built-in macro is set accordingly.
           For example, with <b>-mmcu=atmega8 </b>the macro is defined to 4.

       "__AVR_<i>Device</i>__"
           Setting <b>-mmcu=</b><i>device</i> defines this built-in macro which
           reflects the device's name. For example, <b>-mmcu=atmega8</b>
           defines the built-in macro "__AVR_ATmega8__",
           <b>-mmcu=attiny261a </b>defines "__AVR_ATtiny261A__", etc.

           The built-in macros' names follow the scheme "__AVR_<i>Device__"</i>
           where <i>Device</i> is the device name as from the AVR user manual.
           The difference between <i>Device</i> in the built-in macro and
           <i>device</i> in <b>-mmcu=</b><i>device</i> is that the latter is always
           lowercase.

           If <i>device</i> is not a device but only a core architecture like
           <b>avr51</b>, this macro is not defined.

       "__AVR_DEVICE_NAME__"
           Setting <b>-mmcu=</b><i>device</i> defines this built-in macro to the
           device's name. For example, with <b>-mmcu=atmega8 </b>the macro is
           defined to "atmega8".

           If <i>device</i> is not a device but only a core architecture like
           <b>avr51</b>, this macro is not defined.

       "__AVR_XMEGA__"
           The device / architecture belongs to the XMEGA family of
           devices.

       "__AVR_HAVE_ELPM__"
           The device has the "ELPM" instruction.

       "__AVR_HAVE_ELPMX__"
           The device has the "ELPM R<i>n,Z"</i> and "ELPM R<i>n,Z+"</i> instructions.

       "__AVR_HAVE_MOVW__"
           The device has the "MOVW" instruction to perform 16-bit
           register-register moves.

       "__AVR_HAVE_LPMX__"
           The device has the "LPM R<i>n,Z"</i> and "LPM R<i>n,Z+"</i> instructions.

       "__AVR_HAVE_MUL__"
           The device has a hardware multiplier.

       "__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__"
           The device has the "JMP" and "CALL" instructions.  This is
           the case for devices with more than 8 KiB of program memory.

       "__AVR_HAVE_EIJMP_EICALL__"
       "__AVR_3_BYTE_PC__"
           The device has the "EIJMP" and "EICALL" instructions.  This
           is the case for devices with more than 128 KiB of program
           memory.  This also means that the program counter (PC) is 3
           bytes wide.

       "__AVR_2_BYTE_PC__"
           The program counter (PC) is 2 bytes wide. This is the case
           for devices with up to 128 KiB of program memory.

       "__AVR_HAVE_8BIT_SP__"
       "__AVR_HAVE_16BIT_SP__"
           The stack pointer (SP) register is treated as 8-bit
           respectively 16-bit register by the compiler.  The definition
           of these macros is affected by <b>-mtiny-stack</b>.

       "__AVR_HAVE_SPH__"
       "__AVR_SP8__"
           The device has the SPH (high part of stack pointer) special
           function register or has an 8-bit stack pointer,
           respectively.  The definition of these macros is affected by
           <b>-mmcu= </b>and in the cases of <b>-mmcu=avr2 </b>and <b>-mmcu=avr25 </b>also by
           <b>-msp8</b>.

       "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPD__"
       "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPX__"
       "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPY__"
       "__AVR_HAVE_RAMPZ__"
           The device has the "RAMPD", "RAMPX", "RAMPY", "RAMPZ" special
           function register, respectively.

       "__NO_INTERRUPTS__"
           This macro reflects the <b>-mno-interrupts </b>command-line option.

       "__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP__"
       "__AVR_ERRATA_SKIP_JMP_CALL__"
           Some AVR devices (AT90S8515, ATmega103) must not skip 32-bit
           instructions because of a hardware erratum.  Skip
           instructions are "SBRS", "SBRC", "SBIS", "SBIC" and "CPSE".
           The second macro is only defined if "__AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__"
           is also set.

       "__AVR_ISA_RMW__"
           The device has Read-Modify-Write instructions (XCH, LAC, LAS
           and LAT).

       "__AVR_SFR_OFFSET__=<i>offset</i>"
           Instructions that can address I/O special function registers
           directly like "IN", "OUT", "SBI", etc. may use a different
           address as if addressed by an instruction to access RAM like
           "LD" or "STS". This offset depends on the device architecture
           and has to be subtracted from the RAM address in order to get
           the respective I/O address.

       "__AVR_SHORT_CALLS__"
           The <b>-mshort-calls </b>command line option is set.

       "__AVR_PM_BASE_ADDRESS__=<i>addr</i>"
           Some devices support reading from flash memory by means of
           "LD*" instructions.  The flash memory is seen in the data
           address space at an offset of "__AVR_PM_BASE_ADDRESS__".  If
           this macro is not defined, this feature is not available.  If
           defined, the address space is linear and there is no need to
           put ".rodata" into RAM.  This is handled by the default
           linker description file, and is currently available for
           "avrtiny" and "avrxmega3".  Even more convenient, there is no
           need to use address spaces like "__flash" or features like
           attribute "progmem" and "pgm_read_*".

       "__WITH_AVRLIBC__"
           The compiler is configured to be used together with AVR-Libc.
           See the <b>--with-avrlibc </b>configure option.

       <i>Blackfin Options</i>

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu</i>[<b>-</b><i>sirevision</i>]
           Specifies the name of the target Blackfin processor.
           Currently, <i>cpu</i> can be one of <b>bf512</b>, <b>bf514</b>, <b>bf516</b>, <b>bf518</b>,
           <b>bf522</b>, <b>bf523</b>, <b>bf524</b>, <b>bf525</b>, <b>bf526</b>, <b>bf527</b>, <b>bf531</b>, <b>bf532</b>,
           <b>bf533</b>, <b>bf534</b>, <b>bf536</b>, <b>bf537</b>, <b>bf538</b>, <b>bf539</b>, <b>bf542</b>, <b>bf544</b>,
           <b>bf547</b>, <b>bf548</b>, <b>bf549</b>, <b>bf542m</b>, <b>bf544m</b>, <b>bf547m</b>, <b>bf548m</b>, <b>bf549m</b>,
           <b>bf561</b>, <b>bf592</b>.

           The optional <i>sirevision</i> specifies the silicon revision of the
           target Blackfin processor.  Any workarounds available for the
           targeted silicon revision are enabled.  If <i>sirevision</i> is
           <b>none</b>, no workarounds are enabled.  If <i>sirevision</i> is <b>any</b>, all
           workarounds for the targeted processor are enabled.  The
           "__SILICON_REVISION__" macro is defined to two hexadecimal
           digits representing the major and minor numbers in the
           silicon revision.  If <i>sirevision</i> is <b>none</b>, the
           "__SILICON_REVISION__" is not defined.  If <i>sirevision</i> is <b>any</b>,
           the "__SILICON_REVISION__" is defined to be 0xffff.  If this
           optional <i>sirevision</i> is not used, GCC assumes the latest known
           silicon revision of the targeted Blackfin processor.

           GCC defines a preprocessor macro for the specified <i>cpu</i>.  For
           the <b>bfin-elf </b>toolchain, this option causes the hardware BSP
           provided by libgloss to be linked in if <b>-msim </b>is not given.

           Without this option, <b>bf532 </b>is used as the processor by
           default.

           Note that support for <b>bf561 </b>is incomplete.  For <b>bf561</b>, only
           the preprocessor macro is defined.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.
           This causes the simulator BSP provided by libgloss to be
           linked in.  This option has effect only for <b>bfin-elf</b>
           toolchain.  Certain other options, such as
           <b>-mid-shared-library </b>and <b>-mfdpic</b>, imply <b>-msim</b>.

       <b>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
           Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf
           functions.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
           restore frame pointers and makes an extra register available
           in leaf functions.

       <b>-mspecld-anomaly</b>
           When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code
           does not contain speculative loads after jump instructions.
           If this option is used, "__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS" is
           defined.

       <b>-mno-specld-anomaly</b>
           Don't generate extra code to prevent speculative loads from
           occurring.

       <b>-mcsync-anomaly</b>
           When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code
           does not contain CSYNC or SSYNC instructions too soon after
           conditional branches.  If this option is used,
           "__WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS" is defined.

       <b>-mno-csync-anomaly</b>
           Don't generate extra code to prevent CSYNC or SSYNC
           instructions from occurring too soon after a conditional
           branch.

       <b>-mlow64k</b>
           When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the
           knowledge that the entire program fits into the low 64k of
           memory.

       <b>-mno-low64k</b>
           Assume that the program is arbitrarily large.  This is the
           default.

       <b>-mstack-check-l1</b>
           Do stack checking using information placed into L1 scratchpad
           memory by the uClinux kernel.

       <b>-mid-shared-library</b>
           Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library
           ID method.  This allows for execute in place and shared
           libraries in an environment without virtual memory
           management.  This option implies <b>-fPIC</b>.  With a <b>bfin-elf</b>
           target, this option implies <b>-msim</b>.

       <b>-mno-id-shared-library</b>
           Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries
           are being used.  This is the default.

       <b>-mleaf-id-shared-library</b>
           Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library
           ID method, but assumes that this library or executable won't
           link against any other ID shared libraries.  That allows the
           compiler to use faster code for jumps and calls.

       <b>-mno-leaf-id-shared-library</b>
           Do not assume that the code being compiled won't link against
           any ID shared libraries.  Slower code is generated for jump
           and call insns.

       <b>-mshared-library-id=n</b>
           Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared
           library being compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates
           more compact code; specifying other values forces the
           allocation of that number to the current library but is no
           more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.

       <b>-msep-data</b>
           Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a
           different area of memory from the text segment.  This allows
           for execute in place in an environment without virtual memory
           management by eliminating relocations against the text
           section.

       <b>-mno-sep-data</b>
           Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the
           text segment.  This is the default.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-long-calls</b>
           Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading
           the address of the function into a register and then
           performing a subroutine call on this register.  This switch
           is needed if the target function lies outside of the 24-bit
           addressing range of the offset-based version of subroutine
           call instruction.

           This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
           <b>-mno-long-calls </b>restores the default behavior.  Note these
           switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to
           handle function calls via function pointers.

       <b>-mfast-fp</b>
           Link with the fast floating-point library. This library
           relaxes some of the IEEE floating-point standard's rules for
           checking inputs against Not-a-Number (NAN), in the interest
           of performance.

       <b>-minline-plt</b>
           Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions
           that are not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without
           <b>-mfdpic</b>.

       <b>-mmulticore</b>
           Build a standalone application for multicore Blackfin
           processors.  This option causes proper start files and link
           scripts supporting multicore to be used, and defines the
           macro "__BFIN_MULTICORE".  It can only be used with
           <b>-mcpu=bf561</b>[<b>-</b><i>sirevision</i>].

           This option can be used with <b>-mcorea </b>or <b>-mcoreb</b>, which
           selects the one-application-per-core programming model.
           Without <b>-mcorea </b>or <b>-mcoreb</b>, the single-application/dual-core
           programming model is used. In this model, the main function
           of Core B should be named as "coreb_main".

           If this option is not used, the single-core application
           programming model is used.

       <b>-mcorea</b>
           Build a standalone application for Core A of BF561 when using
           the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper start
           files and link scripts are used to support Core A, and the
           macro "__BFIN_COREA" is defined.  This option can only be
           used in conjunction with <b>-mmulticore</b>.

       <b>-mcoreb</b>
           Build a standalone application for Core B of BF561 when using
           the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper start
           files and link scripts are used to support Core B, and the
           macro "__BFIN_COREB" is defined. When this option is used,
           "coreb_main" should be used instead of "main".  This option
           can only be used in conjunction with <b>-mmulticore</b>.

       <b>-msdram</b>
           Build a standalone application for SDRAM. Proper start files
           and link scripts are used to put the application into SDRAM,
           and the macro "__BFIN_SDRAM" is defined.  The loader should
           initialize SDRAM before loading the application.

       <b>-micplb</b>
           Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at run time.  This has an
           effect on certain anomaly workarounds.  For Linux targets,
           the default is to assume ICPLBs are enabled; for standalone
           applications the default is off.

       <i>C6X Options</i>

       <b>-march=</b><i>name</i>
           This specifies the name of the target architecture.  GCC uses
           this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit
           when generating assembly code.  Permissible names are: <b>c62x</b>,
           <b>c64x</b>, <b>c64x+</b>, <b>c67x</b>, <b>c67x+</b>, <b>c674x</b>.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a big-endian target.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code for a little-endian target.  This is the
           default.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the
           simulator.

       <b>-msdata=default</b>
           Put small global and static data in the ".neardata" section,
           which is pointed to by register "B14".  Put small
           uninitialized global and static data in the ".bss" section,
           which is adjacent to the ".neardata" section.  Put small
           read-only data into the ".rodata" section.  The corresponding
           sections used for large pieces of data are ".fardata", ".far"
           and ".const".

       <b>-msdata=all</b>
           Put all data, not just small objects, into the sections
           reserved for small data, and use addressing relative to the
           "B14" register to access them.

       <b>-msdata=none</b>
           Make no use of the sections reserved for small data, and use
           absolute addresses to access all data.  Put all initialized
           global and static data in the ".fardata" section, and all
           uninitialized data in the ".far" section.  Put all constant
           data into the ".const" section.

       <i>CRIS Options</i>

       These options are defined specifically for the CRIS ports.

       <b>-march=</b><i>architecture-type</i>
       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>architecture-type</i>
           Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices
           for <i>architecture-type</i> are <b>v3</b>, <b>v8 </b>and <b>v10 </b>for respectively
           ETRAX 4, ETRAX 100, and ETRAX 100 LX.  Default is <b>v0 </b>except
           for cris-axis-linux-gnu, where the default is <b>v10</b>.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>architecture-type</i>
           Tune to <i>architecture-type</i> everything applicable about the
           generated code, except for the ABI and the set of available
           instructions.  The choices for <i>architecture-type</i> are the same
           as for <b>-march=</b><i>architecture-type</i>.

       <b>-mmax-stack-frame=</b><i>n</i>
           Warn when the stack frame of a function exceeds <i>n</i> bytes.

       <b>-metrax4</b>
       <b>-metrax100</b>
           The options <b>-metrax4 </b>and <b>-metrax100 </b>are synonyms for
           <b>-march=v3 </b>and <b>-march=v8 </b>respectively.

       <b>-mmul-bug-workaround</b>
       <b>-mno-mul-bug-workaround</b>
           Work around a bug in the "muls" and "mulu" instructions for
           CPU models where it applies.  This option is active by
           default.

       <b>-mpdebug</b>
           Enable CRIS-specific verbose debug-related information in the
           assembly code.  This option also has the effect of turning
           off the <b>#NO_APP </b>formatted-code indicator to the assembler at
           the beginning of the assembly file.

       <b>-mcc-init</b>
           Do not use condition-code results from previous instruction;
           always emit compare and test instructions before use of
           condition codes.

       <b>-mno-side-effects</b>
           Do not emit instructions with side effects in addressing
           modes other than post-increment.

       <b>-mstack-align</b>
       <b>-mno-stack-align</b>
       <b>-mdata-align</b>
       <b>-mno-data-align</b>
       <b>-mconst-align</b>
       <b>-mno-const-align</b>
           These options (<b>no- </b>options) arrange (eliminate arrangements)
           for the stack frame, individual data and constants to be
           aligned for the maximum single data access size for the
           chosen CPU model.  The default is to arrange for 32-bit
           alignment.  ABI details such as structure layout are not
           affected by these options.

       <b>-m32-bit</b>
       <b>-m16-bit</b>
       <b>-m8-bit</b>
           Similar to the stack- data- and const-align options above,
           these options arrange for stack frame, writable data and
           constants to all be 32-bit, 16-bit or 8-bit aligned.  The
           default is 32-bit alignment.

       <b>-mno-prologue-epilogue</b>
       <b>-mprologue-epilogue</b>
           With <b>-mno-prologue-epilogue</b>, the normal function prologue and
           epilogue which set up the stack frame are omitted and no
           return instructions or return sequences are generated in the
           code.  Use this option only together with visual inspection
           of the compiled code: no warnings or errors are generated
           when call-saved registers must be saved, or storage for local
           variables needs to be allocated.

       <b>-mno-gotplt</b>
       <b>-mgotplt</b>
           With <b>-fpic </b>and <b>-fPIC</b>, don't generate (do generate)
           instruction sequences that load addresses for functions from
           the PLT part of the GOT rather than (traditional on other
           architectures) calls to the PLT.  The default is <b>-mgotplt</b>.

       <b>-melf</b>
           Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-elf
           and cris-axis-linux-gnu targets.

       <b>-mlinux</b>
           Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-linux-
           gnu target.

       <b>-sim</b>
           This option, recognized for the cris-axis-elf, arranges to
           link with input-output functions from a simulator library.
           Code, initialized data and zero-initialized data are
           allocated consecutively.

       <b>-sim2</b>
           Like <b>-sim</b>, but pass linker options to locate initialized data
           at 0x40000000 and zero-initialized data at 0x80000000.

       <i>CR16 Options</i>

       These options are defined specifically for the CR16 ports.

       <b>-mmac</b>
           Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions. Disabled
           by default.

       <b>-mcr16cplus</b>
       <b>-mcr16c</b>
           Generate code for CR16C or CR16C+ architecture. CR16C+
           architecture is default.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Links the library libsim.a which is in compatible with
           simulator. Applicable to ELF compiler only.

       <b>-mint32</b>
           Choose integer type as 32-bit wide.

       <b>-mbit-ops</b>
           Generates "sbit"/"cbit" instructions for bit manipulations.

       <b>-mdata-model=</b><i>model</i>
           Choose a data model. The choices for <i>model</i> are <b>near</b>, <b>far </b>or
           <b>medium</b>. <b>medium </b>is default.  However, <b>far </b>is not valid with
           <b>-mcr16c</b>, as the CR16C architecture does not support the far
           data model.

       <i>C-SKY Options</i>

       GCC supports these options when compiling for C-SKY V2
       processors.

       <b>-march=</b><i>arch</i>
           Specify the C-SKY target architecture.  Valid values for <i>arch</i>
           are: <b>ck801</b>, <b>ck802</b>, <b>ck803</b>, <b>ck807</b>, and <b>ck810</b>.  The default is
           <b>ck810</b>.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu</i>

           <b>ck810ftv</b>.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
       <b>-EB</b>
       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
       <b>-EL </b>Select big- or little-endian code.  The default is little-
           endian.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Select hardware or software floating-point implementations.
           The default is soft float.

       <b>-mdouble-float</b>
       <b>-mno-double-float</b>
           When <b>-mhard-float </b>is in effect, enable generation of double-
           precision float instructions.  This is the default except
           when compiling for CK803.

       <b>-mfdivdu</b>
       <b>-mno-fdivdu</b>
           When <b>-mhard-float </b>is in effect, enable generation of
           "frecipd", "fsqrtd", and "fdivd" instructions.  This is the
           default except when compiling for CK803.

       <b>-mfpu=</b><i>fpu</i>
           Select the floating-point processor.  This option can only be
           used with <b>-mhard-float</b>.  Values for <i>fpu</i> are <b>fpv2_sf</b>
           (equivalent to <b>-mno-double-float -mno-fdivdu</b>), <b>fpv2</b>
           (<b>-mdouble-float -mno-divdu</b>), and <b>fpv2_divd </b>(<b>-mdouble-float</b>
           <b>-mdivdu</b>).

       <b>-melrw</b>
       <b>-mno-elrw</b>
           Enable the extended "lrw" instruction.  This option defaults
           to on for CK801 and off otherwise.

       <b>-mistack</b>
       <b>-mno-istack</b>
           Enable interrupt stack instructions; the default is off.

           The <b>-mistack </b>option is required to handle the "interrupt" and
           "isr" function attributes.

       <b>-mmp</b>
           Enable multiprocessor instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-mcp</b>
           Enable coprocessor instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-mcache</b>
           Enable coprocessor instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-msecurity</b>
           Enable C-SKY security instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-mtrust</b>
           Enable C-SKY trust instructions; the default is off.

       <b>-mdsp</b>
       <b>-medsp</b>
       <b>-mvdsp</b>
           Enable C-SKY DSP, Enhanced DSP, or Vector DSP instructions,
           respectively.  All of these options default to off.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-div</b>
           Generate divide instructions.  Default is off.

       <b>-msmart</b>
       <b>-mno-smart</b>
           Generate code for Smart Mode, using only registers numbered
           0-7 to allow use of 16-bit instructions.  This option is
           ignored for CK801 where this is the required behavior, and it
           defaults to on for CK802.  For other targets, the default is
           off.

       <b>-mhigh-registers</b>
       <b>-mno-high-registers</b>
           Generate code using the high registers numbered 16-31.  This
           option is not supported on CK801, CK802, or CK803, and is
           enabled by default for other processors.

       <b>-manchor</b>
       <b>-mno-anchor</b>
           Generate code using global anchor symbol addresses.

       <b>-mpushpop</b>
       <b>-mno-pushpop</b>
           Generate code using "push" and "pop" instructions.  This
           option defaults to on.

       <b>-mstm</b>
       <b>-mno-multiple-stld</b>
       <b>-mno-stm</b>
           Generate code using "stm" and "ldm" instructions.  This
           option isn't supported on CK801 but is enabled by default on
           other processors.

       <b>-mconstpool</b>
       <b>-mno-constpool</b>
           Create constant pools in the compiler instead of deferring it
           to the assembler.  This option is the default and required
           for correct code generation on CK801 and CK802, and is
           optional on other processors.

       <b>-mstack-size</b>
       <b>-mno-stack-size</b>
           Emit ".stack_size" directives for each function in the
           assembly output.  This option defaults to off.

       <b>-mccrt</b>
       <b>-mno-ccrt</b>
           Generate code for the C-SKY compiler runtime instead of
           libgcc.  This option defaults to off.

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the branch costs to roughly "n" instructions.  The
           default is 1.

       <b>-msched-prolog</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-prolog</b>
           Permit scheduling of function prologue and epilogue
           sequences.  Using this option can result in code that is not
           compliant with the C-SKY V2 ABI prologue requirements and
           that cannot be debugged or backtraced.  It is disabled by
           default.

       <i>Darwin Options</i>

       These options are defined for all architectures running the
       Darwin operating system.

       FSF GCC on Darwin does not create "fat" object files; it creates
       an object file for the single architecture that GCC was built to
       target.  Apple's GCC on Darwin does create "fat" files if
       multiple <b>-arch </b>options are used; it does so by running the
       compiler or linker multiple times and joining the results
       together with <i>lipo</i>.

       The subtype of the file created (like <b>ppc7400 </b>or <b>ppc970 </b>or <b>i686</b>)
       is determined by the flags that specify the ISA that GCC is
       targeting, like <b>-mcpu </b>or <b>-march</b>.  The <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b>
       option can be used to override this.

       The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an
       ISA mismatch.  The assembler, <i>as</i>, only permits instructions to be
       used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
       so you cannot put 64-bit instructions in a <b>ppc750 </b>object file.
       The linker for shared libraries, <i>/usr/bin/libtool</i>, fails and
       prints an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
       restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to
       put a <b>ppc970 </b>object file in a <b>ppc7400 </b>library).  The linker for
       executables, <b>ld</b>, quietly gives the executable the most
       restrictive subtype of any of its input files.

       <b>-F</b><i>dir</i>
           Add the framework directory <i>dir</i> to the head of the list of
           directories to be searched for header files.  These
           directories are interleaved with those specified by <b>-I</b>
           options and are scanned in a left-to-right order.

           A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.
           A framework is a directory with a <i>Headers</i> and/or
           <i>PrivateHeaders</i> directory contained directly in it that ends
           in <i>.framework</i>.  The name of a framework is the name of this
           directory excluding the <i>.framework</i>.  Headers associated with
           the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
           <i>Headers</i> being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
           directory that is in a framework's <i>Frameworks</i> directory.
           Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header
           of a framework that contains the subframework, or in a
           sibling subframework header.  Two subframeworks are siblings
           if they occur in the same framework.  A subframework should
           not have the same name as a framework; a warning is issued if
           this is violated.  Currently a subframework cannot have
           subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism may be extended
           to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found in
           <i>/System/Library/Frameworks</i> and <i>/Library/Frameworks</i>.  An
           example include looks like "#include &lt;Framework/header.h&gt;",
           where <i>Framework</i> denotes the name of the framework and
           <i>header.h</i> is found in the <i>PrivateHeaders</i> or <i>Headers</i> directory.

       <b>-iframework</b><i>dir</i>
           Like <b>-F </b>except the directory is a treated as a system
           directory.  The main difference between this <b>-iframework </b>and
           <b>-F </b>is that with <b>-iframework </b>the compiler does not warn about
           constructs contained within header files found via <i>dir</i>.  This
           option is valid only for the C family of languages.

       <b>-gused</b>
           Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For
           stabs debugging format, this enables
           <b>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</b>.  This is by default ON.

       <b>-gfull</b>
           Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.

       <b>-mmacosx-version-min=</b><i>version</i>
           The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run
           on is <i>version</i>.  Typical values of <i>version</i> include 10.1, 10.2,
           and 10.3.9.

           If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by
           default, then the default for this option is the system
           version on which the compiler is running, otherwise the
           default is to make choices that are compatible with as many
           systems and code bases as possible.

       <b>-mkernel</b>
           Enable kernel development mode.  The <b>-mkernel </b>option sets
           <b>-static</b>, <b>-fno-common</b>, <b>-fno-use-cxa-atexit</b>, <b>-fno-exceptions</b>,
           <b>-fno-non-call-exceptions</b>, <b>-fapple-kext</b>, <b>-fno-weak </b>and
           <b>-fno-rtti </b>where applicable.  This mode also sets
           <b>-mno-altivec</b>, <b>-msoft-float</b>, <b>-fno-builtin </b>and <b>-mlong-branch</b>
           for PowerPC targets.

       <b>-mone-byte-bool</b>
           Override the defaults for "bool" so that "sizeof(bool)==1".
           By default "sizeof(bool)" is 4 when compiling for
           Darwin/PowerPC and 1 when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
           option has no effect on x86.

           <b>Warning: </b>The <b>-mone-byte-bool </b>switch causes GCC to generate
           code that is not binary compatible with code generated
           without that switch.  Using this switch may require
           recompiling all other modules in a program, including system
           libraries.  Use this switch to conform to a non-default data
           model.

       <b>-mfix-and-continue</b>

           Causes the output file to be marked such that the dynamic
           linker will bind all undefined references when the file is
           loaded or launched.

       <b>-bundle</b>
           Produce a Mach-o bundle format file.  See man <i>ld</i>(1) for more
           information.

       <b>-bundle_loader </b><i>executable</i>
           This option specifies the <i>executable</i> that will load the build
           output file being linked.  See man <i>ld</i>(1) for more
           information.

       <b>-dynamiclib</b>
           When passed this option, GCC produces a dynamic library
           instead of an executable when linking, using the Darwin
           <i>libtool</i> command.

       <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b>
           This causes GCC's output file to have the <b>ALL </b>subtype,

       <i>DEC Alpha Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:

       <b>-mno-soft-float</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
           floating-point operations.  When <b>-msoft-float </b>is specified,
           functions in <i>libgcc.a</i> are used to perform floating-point
           operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that
           emulate the floating-point operations, or compiled in such a
           way as to call such emulations routines, these routines issue
           floating-point operations.   If you are compiling for an
           Alpha without floating-point operations, you must ensure that
           the library is built so as not to call them.

           Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point
           operations are required to have floating-point registers.

       <b>-mfp-reg</b>
       <b>-mno-fp-regs</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
           register set.  <b>-mno-fp-regs </b>implies <b>-msoft-float</b>.  If the
           floating-point register set is not used, floating-point
           operands are passed in integer registers as if they were
           integers and floating-point results are passed in $0 instead
           of $f0.  This is a non-standard calling sequence, so any
           function with a floating-point argument or return value
           called by code compiled with <b>-mno-fp-regs </b>must also be
           compiled with that option.

           A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does
           not use, and hence need not save and restore, any floating-
           point registers.

       <b>-mieee</b>
           The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware
           optimized for maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant
           with the IEEE floating-point standard.  However, for full
           compliance, software assistance is required.  This option
           generates code fully IEEE-compliant code <i>except</i> that the
           <i>inexact-flag</i> is not maintained (see below).  If this option
           is turned on, the preprocessor macro "_IEEE_FP" is defined
           during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but
           is able to correctly support denormalized numbers and
           exceptional IEEE values such as not-a-number and plus/minus
           infinity.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
           <b>-ieee_with_no_inexact</b>.

       <b>-mieee-with-inexact</b>
           This is like <b>-mieee </b>except the generated code also maintains
           the IEEE <i>inexact-flag</i>.  Turning on this option causes the
           generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  In
           addition to "_IEEE_FP", "_IEEE_FP_EXACT" is defined as a
           preprocessor macro.  On some Alpha implementations the
           resulting code may execute significantly slower than the code
           generated by default.  Since there is very little code that
           depends on the <i>inexact-flag</i>, you should normally not specify
           this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
           <b>-ieee_with_inexact</b>.

       <b>-mfp-trap-mode=</b><i>trap-mode</i>
           This option controls what floating-point related traps are
           enabled.  Other Alpha compilers call this option <b>-fptm </b><i>trap-</i>
           <i>mode</i>.  The trap mode can be set to one of four values:

           <b>n   </b>This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps
               that are enabled are the ones that cannot be disabled in
               software (e.g., division by zero trap).

           <b>u   </b>In addition to the traps enabled by <b>n</b>, underflow traps
               are enabled as well.

           <b>su  </b>Like <b>u</b>, but the instructions are marked to be safe for
               software completion (see Alpha architecture manual for
               details).

           <b>sui </b>Like <b>su</b>, but inexact traps are enabled as well.

       <b>-mfp-rounding-mode=</b><i>rounding-mode</i>
           Selects the IEEE rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call
           this option <b>-fprm </b><i>rounding-mode</i>.  The <i>rounding-mode</i> can be
           one of:

           <b>n   </b>Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are
               rounded towards the nearest machine number or towards the
               even machine number in case of a tie.

           <b>m   </b>Round towards minus infinity.

           <b>c   </b>Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are
               rounded towards zero.

           <b>d   </b>Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point
               control register (<i>fpcr</i>, see Alpha architecture reference
               manual) controls the rounding mode in effect.  The C
               library initializes this register for rounding towards
               plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
               <i>fpcr</i>, <b>d </b>corresponds to round towards plus infinity.

       <b>-mtrap-precision=</b><i>trap-precision</i>
           In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are
           imprecise.  This means without software assistance it is
           impossible to recover from a floating trap and program
           execution normally needs to be terminated.  GCC can generate
           code that can assist operating system trap handlers in
           determining the exact location that caused a floating-point
           trap.  Depending on the requirements of an application,
           different levels of precisions can be selected:

           <b>p   </b>Program precision.  This option is the default and means
               a trap handler can only identify which program caused a
               floating-point exception.

           <b>f   </b>Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the
               function that caused a floating-point exception.

           <b>i   </b>Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine
               the exact instruction that caused a floating-point
               exception.

           Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
           <b>-scope_safe </b>and <b>-resumption_safe</b>.

       <b>-mieee-conformant</b>
           This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You
           must not use this option unless you also specify
           <b>-mtrap-precision=i </b>and either <b>-mfp-trap-mode=su </b>or
           <b>-mfp-trap-mode=sui</b>.  Its only effect is to emit the line
           <b>.eflag 48 </b>in the function prologue of the generated assembly
           file.

       <b>-mbuild-constants</b>
           Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to see
           if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
           instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a
           literal and generates code to load it from the data segment
           at run time.

           Use this option to require GCC to construct <i>all</i> integer
           constants using code, even if it takes more instructions (the
           maximum is six).

           You typically use this option to build a shared library
           dynamic loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate
           itself in memory before it can find the variables and
           constants in its own data segment.

       <b>-mbwx</b>
       <b>-mno-bwx</b>
       <b>-mcix</b>
       <b>-mno-cix</b>
       <b>-mfix</b>
       <b>-mno-fix</b>
       <b>-mmax</b>
       <b>-mno-max</b>
           Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional
           BWX, CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets.  The default is to
           use the instruction sets supported by the CPU type specified
           via <b>-mcpu= </b>option or that of the CPU on which GCC was built
           if none is specified.

       <b>-mfloat-vax</b>
       <b>-mfloat-ieee</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) VAX F and G floating-
           point arithmetic instead of IEEE single and double precision.

       <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b>
       <b>-mno-explicit-relocs</b>
           Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol
           relocations except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros
           does not allow optimal instruction scheduling.  GNU binutils
           as of version 2.12 supports a new syntax that allows the
           compiler to explicitly mark which relocations should apply to
           which instructions.  This option is mostly useful for
           debugging, as GCC detects the capabilities of the assembler
           when it is built and sets the default accordingly.

       <b>-msmall-data</b>
       <b>-mlarge-data</b>
           When <b>-mexplicit-relocs </b>is in effect, static data is accessed
           via <i>gp-relative</i> relocations.  When <b>-msmall-data </b>is used,
           objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a <i>small data</i>
           <i>area</i> (the ".sdata" and ".sbss" sections) and are accessed via
           16-bit relocations off of the $gp register.  This limits the
           size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables
           to be directly accessed via a single instruction.

           The default is <b>-mlarge-data</b>.  With this option the data area
           is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more
           than 2GB of data must use "malloc" or "mmap" to allocate the
           data in the heap instead of in the program's data segment.

           When generating code for shared libraries, <b>-fpic </b>implies
           <b>-msmall-data </b>and <b>-fPIC </b>implies <b>-mlarge-data</b>.

       <b>-msmall-text</b>
       <b>-mlarge-text</b>
           When <b>-msmall-text </b>is used, the compiler assumes that the code
           of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is
           thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When <b>-msmall-data</b>
           is used, the compiler can assume that all local symbols share
           the same $gp value, and thus reduce the number of
           instructions required for a function call from 4 to 1.

           The default is <b>-mlarge-text</b>.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
           Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters
           for machine type <i>cpu_type</i>.  You can specify either the <b>EV</b>
           style name or the corresponding chip number.  GCC supports
           scheduling parameters for the EV4, EV5 and EV6 family of
           processors and chooses the default values for the instruction
           set from the processor you specify.  If you do not specify a
           processor type, GCC defaults to the processor on which the
           compiler was built.

           Supported values for <i>cpu_type</i> are

           <b>ev4</b>
           <b>ev45</b>
           <b>21064</b>
               Schedules as an EV4 and has no instruction set
               extensions.

               Schedules as an EV5 and has no instruction set
               extensions.

           <b>ev56</b>
           <b>21164a</b>
               Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX extension.

           <b>pca56</b>
           <b>21164pc</b>
           <b>21164PC</b>
               Schedules as an EV5 and supports the BWX and MAX
               extensions.

           <b>ev6</b>
           <b>21264</b>
               Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, FIX, and MAX
               extensions.

           <b>ev67</b>
           <b>21264a</b>
               Schedules as an EV6 and supports the BWX, CIX, FIX, and
               MAX extensions.

           Native toolchains also support the value <b>native</b>, which
           selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
           <b>-mcpu=native </b>has no effect if GCC does not recognize the
           processor.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
           Set only the instruction scheduling parameters for machine
           type <i>cpu_type</i>.  The instruction set is not changed.

           Native toolchains also support the value <b>native</b>, which
           selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
           <b>-mtune=native </b>has no effect if GCC does not recognize the
           processor.

       <b>-mmemory-latency=</b><i>time</i>
           Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical
           memory references as seen by the application.  This number is
           highly dependent on the memory access patterns used by the
           application and the size of the external cache on the
           machine.

           Valid options for <i>time</i> are

           <i>number</i>
               A decimal number representing clock cycles.

           <b>L1</b>
           <b>L2</b>
           <b>L3</b>
           <b>main</b>
               The compiler contains estimates of the number of clock
               cycles for "typical" EV4 &amp; EV5 hardware for the Level 1,
               2 &amp; 3 caches (also called Dcache, Scache, and Bcache), as
               well as to main memory.  Note that L3 is only valid for
               EV5.

       <i>FR30 Options</i>

       These options are defined specifically for the FR30 port.

       <b>-msmall-model</b>
           Use the small address space model.  This can produce smaller
           code, but it does assume that all symbolic values and
           addresses fit into a 20-bit range.

       <b>-mno-lsim</b>
           Assume that runtime support has been provided and so there is
           no need to include the simulator library (<i>libsim.a</i>) on the
           linker command line.

       <i>FT32 Options</i>

       These options are defined specifically for the FT32 port.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.
           This causes an alternate runtime startup and library to be
           linked.  You must not use this option when generating
           programs that will run on real hardware; you must provide
           your own runtime library for whatever I/O functions are
           needed.

       <b>-mlra</b>
           Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is still experimental
           for FT32, so by default the compiler uses standard reload.

       <b>-mnodiv</b>
           Do not use div and mod instructions.

       <b>-mft32b</b>
           Enable use of the extended instructions of the FT32B
           processor.

       <b>-mcompress</b>
           Compress all code using the Ft32B code compression scheme.

       <b>-mnopm</b>
           Do not generate code that reads program memory.

       <i>FRV Options</i>

       <b>-mgpr-32</b>
           Only use the first 32 general-purpose registers.

       <b>-mgpr-64</b>
           Use all 64 general-purpose registers.

       <b>-mfpr-32</b>
           Use only the first 32 floating-point registers.

       <b>-mfpr-64</b>
           Use all 64 floating-point registers.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Use hardware instructions for floating-point operations.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Use library routines for floating-point operations.

       <b>-malloc-cc</b>
           Dynamically allocate condition code registers.

       <b>-mfixed-cc</b>
           Do not try to dynamically allocate condition code registers,
           only use "icc0" and "fcc0".

       <b>-mdword</b>
           Change ABI to use double word insns.

       <b>-mno-dword</b>
           Do not use double word instructions.

       <b>-mdouble</b>
           Use floating-point double instructions.

       <b>-mno-double</b>
           Do not use floating-point double instructions.

       <b>-mmedia</b>
           Use media instructions.

       <b>-mno-media</b>
           Do not use media instructions.

       <b>-mmuladd</b>
           Use multiply and add/subtract instructions.

       <b>-mno-muladd</b>
           Do not use multiply and add/subtract instructions.

       <b>-mfdpic</b>
           Select the FDPIC ABI, which uses function descriptors to
           represent pointers to functions.  Without any PIC/PIE-related
           options, it implies <b>-fPIE</b>.  With <b>-fpic </b>or <b>-fpie</b>, it assumes
           GOT entries and small data are within a 12-bit range from the
           GOT base address; with <b>-fPIC </b>or <b>-fPIE</b>, GOT offsets are
           computed with 32 bits.  With a <b>bfin-elf </b>target, this option
           implies <b>-msim</b>.

       <b>-minline-plt</b>
           Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions
           that are not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without
           <b>-mfdpic</b>.  It's enabled by default if optimizing for speed and
           compiling for shared libraries (i.e., <b>-fPIC </b>or <b>-fpic</b>), or
           when an optimization option such as <b>-O3 </b>or above is present
           in the command line.

       <b>-mTLS</b>
           Assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-local code.

       <b>-mtls</b>
           Do not assume a large TLS segment when generating thread-
           local code.

       <b>-mgprel-ro</b>
           Enable the use of "GPREL" relocations in the FDPIC ABI for
           data that is known to be in read-only sections.  It's enabled
           by default, except for <b>-fpic </b>or <b>-fpie</b>: even though it may
           help make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1
           instruction for 4.  With <b>-fPIC </b>or <b>-fPIE</b>, it trades 3
           instructions for 4, one of which may be shared by multiple
           symbols, and it avoids the need for a GOT entry for the
           referenced symbol, so it's more likely to be a win.  If it is
           not, <b>-mno-gprel-ro </b>can be used to disable it.

       <b>-multilib-library-pic</b>
           Link with the (library, not FD) pic libraries.  It's implied
           by <b>-mlibrary-pic</b>, as well as by <b>-fPIC </b>and <b>-fpic </b>without
           <b>-mfdpic</b>.  You should never have to use it explicitly.

       <b>-mlinked-fp</b>
           Follow the EABI requirement of always creating a frame
           pointer whenever a stack frame is allocated.  This option is
           enabled by default and can be disabled with <b>-mno-linked-fp</b>.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
           Use indirect addressing to call functions outside the current
           compilation unit.  This allows the functions to be placed
           anywhere within the 32-bit address space.

       <b>-malign-labels</b>
           Try to align labels to an 8-byte boundary by inserting NOPs
           into the previous packet.  This option only has an effect
           when VLIW packing is enabled.  It doesn't create new packets;
           it merely adds NOPs to existing ones.

       <b>-mlibrary-pic</b>
           Generate position-independent EABI code.

       <b>-macc-4</b>
           Use only the first four media accumulator registers.

       <b>-macc-8</b>
           Use all eight media accumulator registers.

       <b>-mpack</b>
           Pack VLIW instructions.

       <b>-mno-pack</b>
           Do not pack VLIW instructions.

       <b>-mno-eflags</b>
           Do not mark ABI switches in e_flags.

       <b>-mcond-move</b>
           Enable the use of conditional-move instructions (default).

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mno-cond-move</b>
           Disable the use of conditional-move instructions.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mscc</b>
           Enable the use of conditional set instructions (default).

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mno-scc</b>
           Disable the use of conditional set instructions.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mcond-exec</b>
           Enable the use of conditional execution (default).

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mno-cond-exec</b>
           Disable the use of conditional execution.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mvliw-branch</b>
           Run a pass to pack branches into VLIW instructions (default).

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mno-vliw-branch</b>
           Do not run a pass to pack branches into VLIW instructions.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mmulti-cond-exec</b>
           Enable optimization of "&amp;&amp;" and "||" in conditional execution
           (default).

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mno-multi-cond-exec</b>
           Disable optimization of "&amp;&amp;" and "||" in conditional
           execution.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mnested-cond-exec</b>
           Enable nested conditional execution optimizations (default).

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-mno-nested-cond-exec</b>
           Disable nested conditional execution optimizations.

           This switch is mainly for debugging the compiler and will
           likely be removed in a future version.

       <b>-moptimize-membar</b>
           This switch removes redundant "membar" instructions from the
           compiler-generated code.  It is enabled by default.

       <b>-mno-optimize-membar</b>
           This switch disables the automatic removal of redundant
           "membar" instructions from the generated code.

       <b>-mtomcat-stats</b>
           Cause gas to print out tomcat statistics.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu</i>
           Select the processor type for which to generate code.
           Possible values are <b>frv</b>, <b>fr550</b>, <b>tomcat</b>, <b>fr500</b>, <b>fr450</b>, <b>fr405</b>,
           <b>fr400</b>, <b>fr300 </b>and <b>simple</b>.

       <i>GNU/Linux Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for GNU/Linux targets:

       <b>-mglibc</b>
           Use the GNU C library.  This is the default except on
           <b>*-*-linux-*uclibc*</b>, <b>*-*-linux-*musl* </b>and <b>*-*-linux-*android*</b>
           targets.

       <b>-muclibc</b>
           Use uClibc C library.  This is the default on
           <b>*-*-linux-*uclibc* </b>targets.

       <b>-mmusl</b>
           Use the musl C library.  This is the default on
           <b>*-*-linux-*musl* </b>targets.

       <b>-mbionic</b>
           Use Bionic C library.  This is the default on
           <b>*-*-linux-*android* </b>targets.

       <b>-mandroid</b>
           Compile code compatible with Android platform.  This is the
           default on <b>*-*-linux-*android* </b>targets.

           When compiling, this option enables <b>-mbionic</b>, <b>-fPIC</b>,
           <b>-fno-exceptions </b>and <b>-fno-rtti </b>by default.  When linking, this
           option makes the GCC driver pass Android-specific options to
           the linker.  Finally, this option causes the preprocessor
           macro "__ANDROID__" to be defined.

       <b>-tno-android-cc</b>
           Disable compilation effects of <b>-mandroid</b>, i.e., do not enable
           <b>-mbionic</b>, <b>-fPIC</b>, <b>-fno-exceptions </b>and <b>-fno-rtti </b>by default.

       <b>-tno-android-ld</b>
           Disable linking effects of <b>-mandroid</b>, i.e., pass standard
           Linux linking options to the linker.

       <i>H8/300 Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the H8/300 implementations:

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Shorten some address references at link time, when possible;
           uses the linker option <b>-relax</b>.

       <b>-mh </b>Generate code for the H8/300H.

       <b>-ms </b>Generate code for the H8S.

       <b>-mn </b>Generate code for the H8S and H8/300H in the normal mode.
           This switch must be used either with <b>-mh </b>or <b>-ms</b>.

       <b>-ms2600</b>
           Generate code for the H8S/2600.  This switch must be used
           with <b>-ms</b>.

       <b>-mexr</b>
           Extended registers are stored on stack before execution of
           function with monitor attribute. Default option is <b>-mexr</b>.
           This option is valid only for H8S targets.

       <b>-mno-exr</b>
           Extended registers are not stored on stack before execution
           of function with monitor attribute. Default option is
           <b>-mno-exr</b>.  This option is valid only for H8S targets.

       <b>-mint32</b>
           Make "int" data 32 bits by default.

       <b>-malign-300</b>
           On the H8/300H and H8S, use the same alignment rules as for
           the H8/300.  The default for the H8/300H and H8S is to align
           longs and floats on 4-byte boundaries.  <b>-malign-300 </b>causes
           them to be aligned on 2-byte boundaries.  This option has no
           effect on the H8/300.

       <i>HPPA Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the HPPA family of computers:

       <b>-march=</b><i>architecture-type</i>
           Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices
           for <i>architecture-type</i> are <b>1.0 </b>for PA 1.0, <b>1.1 </b>for PA 1.1, and
           <b>2.0 </b>for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to <i>/usr/lib/sched.models</i> on
           an HP-UX system to determine the proper architecture option
           for your machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered
           architectures runs on higher numbered architectures, but not
           the other way around.

       <b>-mpa-risc-1-0</b>
       <b>-mpa-risc-1-1</b>
       <b>-mpa-risc-2-0</b>
           Synonyms for <b>-march=1.0</b>, <b>-march=1.1</b>, and <b>-march=2.0</b>
           respectively.

       <b>-mcaller-copies</b>
           The caller copies function arguments passed by hidden
           reference.  This option should be used with care as it is not
           compatible with the default 32-bit runtime.  However, only
           aggregates larger than eight bytes are passed by hidden
           reference and the option provides better compatibility with
           OpenMP.

       <b>-mjump-in-delay</b>
           This option is ignored and provided for compatibility
           purposes only.

       <b>-mdisable-fpregs</b>
           Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any
           manner.  This is necessary for compiling kernels that perform
           lazy context switching of floating-point registers.  If you
           use this option and attempt to perform floating-point
           operations, the compiler aborts.

       <b>-mdisable-indexing</b>
           Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This
           avoids some rather obscure problems when compiling MIG
           generated code under MACH.

       <b>-mno-space-regs</b>
           Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.
           This allows GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use
           unscaled index address modes.

           Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.

       <b>-mfast-indirect-calls</b>
           Generate code that assumes calls never cross space
           boundaries.  This allows GCC to emit code that performs
           faster indirect calls.

           This option does not work in the presence of shared libraries
           or nested functions.

       <b>-mfixed-range=</b><i>register-range</i>
           Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
           registers.  A fixed register is one that the register
           allocator cannot use.  This is useful when compiling kernel
           code.  A register range is specified as two registers
           separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
           specified separated by a comma.

       <b>-mlong-load-store</b>
           Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes
           required by the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the
           <b>+k </b>option to the HP compilers.

       <b>-mportable-runtime</b>
           Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF
           systems.

       <b>-mgas</b>
           Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.

       <b>-mschedule=</b><i>cpu-type</i>
           Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine
           type <i>cpu-type</i>.  The choices for <i>cpu-type</i> are <b>700 7100</b>,
           <b>7100LC</b>, <b>7200</b>, <b>7300 </b>and <b>8000</b>.  Refer to <i>/usr/lib/sched.models</i>
           on an HP-UX system to determine the proper scheduling option
           for your machine.  The default scheduling is <b>8000</b>.

       <b>-mlinker-opt</b>
           Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this
           makes symbolic debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug
           in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9 linkers in which they give bogus
           error messages when linking some programs.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
           <b>Warning: </b>the requisite libraries are not available for all
           HPPA targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual
           C compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
           cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to
           provide suitable library functions for cross-compilation.

           <b>-msoft-float </b>changes the calling convention in the output
           file; therefore, it is only useful if you compile <i>all</i> of a
           program with this option.  In particular, you need to compile
           <i>libgcc.a</i>, the library that comes with GCC, with <b>-msoft-float</b>
           in order for this to work.

       <b>-msio</b>
           Generate the predefine, "_SIO", for server IO.  The default
           is <b>-mwsio</b>.  This generates the predefines, "__hp9000s700",
           "__hp9000s700__" and "_WSIO", for workstation IO.  These
           options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.

       <b>-mgnu-ld</b>
           Use options specific to GNU <b>ld</b>.  This passes <b>-shared </b>to <b>ld</b>
           when building a shared library.  It is the default when GCC
           is configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker.
           This option does not affect which <b>ld </b>is called; it only
           changes what parameters are passed to that <b>ld</b>.  The <b>ld </b>that
           is called is determined by the <b>--with-ld </b>configure option,
           GCC's program search path, and finally by the user's <b>PATH</b>.
           The linker used by GCC can be printed using <b>which `gcc</b>
           <b>-print-prog-name=ld`</b>.  This option is only available on the
           64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with <b>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</b>.

       <b>-mhp-ld</b>
           Use options specific to HP <b>ld</b>.  This passes <b>-b </b>to <b>ld </b>when
           building a shared library and passes <b>+Accept TypeMismatch </b>to
           <b>ld </b>on all links.  It is the default when GCC is configured,
           explicitly or implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option
           does not affect which <b>ld </b>is called; it only changes what
           parameters are passed to that <b>ld</b>.  The <b>ld </b>that is called is
           determined by the <b>--with-ld </b>configure option, GCC's program
           search path, and finally by the user's <b>PATH</b>.  The linker used
           by GCC can be printed using <b>which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</b>.
           This option is only available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e.
           configured with <b>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</b>.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
           Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures
           that a call is always able to reach linker generated stubs.
           The default is to generate long calls only when the distance
           from the call site to the beginning of the function or
           translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a predefined
           limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
           normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively
           for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always
           limited at 240,000 bytes.

           Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when
           using the <b>-ffunction-sections </b>option, or when using the <b>-mgas</b>
           and <b>-mno-portable-runtime </b>options together under HP-UX with
           the SOM linker.

           It is normally not desirable to use this option as it
           degrades performance.  However, it may be useful in large
           applications, particularly when partial linking is used to
           build the application.

           The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of
           the assembler and linker, and the type of code being
           generated.  The impact on systems that support long absolute
           calls, and long pic symbol-difference or pc-relative calls
           should be relatively small.  However, an indirect call is
           used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code and it is quite long.

       <b>-munix=</b><i>unix-std</i>
           Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the
           specified UNIX standard.  The choices for <i>unix-std</i> are <b>93</b>, <b>95</b>
           and <b>98</b>.  <b>93 </b>is supported on all HP-UX versions.  <b>95 </b>is
           available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  <b>98 </b>is available on HP-UX
           11.11 and later.  The default values are <b>93 </b>for HP-UX 10.00,
           <b>95 </b>for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and <b>98 </b>for HP-UX 11.11
           and later.

           <b>-munix=93 </b>provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4.
           <b>-munix=95 </b>provides additional predefines for "XOPEN_UNIX" and
           "_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED", and the startfile <i>unix95.o</i>.
           <b>-munix=98 </b>provides additional predefines for "_XOPEN_UNIX",
           "_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED", "_INCLUDE__STDC_A1_SOURCE" and
           "_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500", and the startfile <i>unix98.o</i>.

           It is <i>important</i> to note that this option changes the
           interfaces for various library routines.  It also affects the
           operational behavior of the C library.  Thus, <i>extreme</i> care is
           needed in using this option.

           Library code that is intended to operate with more than one
           UNIX standard must test, set and restore the variable
           "__xpg4_extended_mask" as appropriate.  Most GNU software
           doesn't provide this capability.

       <b>-nolibdld</b>
           Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl
           when the <b>-static </b>option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.

       <b>-static</b>
           The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a
           dependency on libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of
           libdld.sl.  Thus, when the <b>-static </b>option is specified,
           special link options are needed to resolve this dependency.

           On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary
           options to link with libdld.sl when the <b>-static </b>option is
           specified.  This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.
           On the 64-bit port, the linkers generate dynamic binaries by
           default in any case.  The <b>-nolibdld </b>option can be used to
           prevent the GCC driver from adding these link options.

       <b>-threads</b>
           Add support for multithreading with the <i>dce thread</i> library
           under HP-UX.  This option sets flags for both the
           preprocessor and linker.

       <i>IA-64 Options</i>

       These are the <b>-m </b>options defined for the Intel IA-64
       architecture.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a big-endian target.  This is the default
           for HP-UX.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code for a little-endian target.  This is the
           default for AIX5 and GNU/Linux.

       <b>-mgnu-as</b>
       <b>-mno-gnu-as</b>
           Generate (or don't) code for the GNU assembler.  This is the
           default.

       <b>-mgnu-ld</b>
       <b>-mno-gnu-ld</b>
           Generate (or don't) code for the GNU linker.  This is the
           default.

       <b>-mno-pic</b>
           Generate code that does not use a global pointer register.
           The result is not position independent code, and violates the
           IA-64 ABI.

       <b>-mvolatile-asm-stop</b>
       <b>-mno-volatile-asm-stop</b>
           Generate (or don't) a stop bit immediately before and after
           volatile asm statements.

       <b>-mregister-names</b>
       <b>-mno-register-names</b>
           Generate (or don't) <b>in</b>, <b>loc</b>, and <b>out </b>register names for the
           stacked registers.  This may make assembler output more
           readable.

       <b>-mno-sdata</b>
       <b>-msdata</b>
           Disable (or enable) optimizations that use the small data
           section.  This may be useful for working around optimizer
           bugs.

       <b>-mconstant-gp</b>
           Generate code that uses a single constant global pointer
           value.  This is useful when compiling kernel code.

       <b>-mauto-pic</b>
           Generate code that is self-relocatable.  This implies
           <b>-mconstant-gp</b>.  This is useful when compiling firmware code.

       <b>-minline-float-divide-min-latency</b>
           Generate code for inline divides of floating-point values
           using the minimum latency algorithm.

       <b>-minline-float-divide-max-throughput</b>
           Generate code for inline divides of floating-point values
           using the maximum throughput algorithm.

       <b>-mno-inline-float-divide</b>
           Do not generate inline code for divides of floating-point
           values.

       <b>-minline-int-divide-min-latency</b>
           Generate code for inline divides of integer values using the
           minimum latency algorithm.

       <b>-minline-int-divide-max-throughput</b>
           Generate code for inline divides of integer values using the
           maximum throughput algorithm.

       <b>-mno-inline-int-divide</b>
           Do not generate inline code for divides of integer values.

       <b>-minline-sqrt-min-latency</b>
           Generate code for inline square roots using the minimum
           latency algorithm.

       <b>-minline-sqrt-max-throughput</b>
           Generate code for inline square roots using the maximum
           throughput algorithm.

       <b>-mno-inline-sqrt</b>
           Do not generate inline code for "sqrt".

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Do (don't) generate code that uses the fused multiply/add or
           multiply/subtract instructions.  The default is to use these
           instructions.

       <b>-mno-dwarf2-asm</b>
       <b>-mdwarf2-asm</b>
           Don't (or do) generate assembler code for the DWARF line
           number debugging info.  This may be useful when not using the
           GNU assembler.

       <b>-mearly-stop-bits</b>
       <b>-mno-early-stop-bits</b>
           Allow stop bits to be placed earlier than immediately
           preceding the instruction that triggered the stop bit.  This
           can improve instruction scheduling, but does not always do
           so.

       <b>-mfixed-range=</b><i>register-range</i>
           Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
           registers.  A fixed register is one that the register
           allocator cannot use.  This is useful when compiling kernel
           code.  A register range is specified as two registers
           separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
           specified separated by a comma.

       <b>-mtls-size=</b><i>tls-size</i>
           Specify bit size of immediate TLS offsets.  Valid values are
           14, 22, and 64.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu-type</i>
           Tune the instruction scheduling for a particular CPU, Valid
           values are <b>itanium</b>, <b>itanium1</b>, <b>merced</b>, <b>itanium2</b>, and <b>mckinley</b>.

       <b>-milp32</b>
       <b>-mlp64</b>
           Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
           environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.  The
           64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer
           to 64 bits.  These are HP-UX specific flags.

       <b>-mno-sched-br-data-spec</b>
       <b>-msched-br-data-spec</b>
           (Dis/En)able data speculative scheduling before reload.  This
           results in generation of "ld.a" instructions and the
           corresponding check instructions ("ld.c" / "chk.a").  The
           default setting is disabled.

       <b>-msched-ar-data-spec</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-ar-data-spec</b>
           (En/Dis)able data speculative scheduling after reload.  This
           results in generation of "ld.a" instructions and the
           corresponding check instructions ("ld.c" / "chk.a").  The
           default setting is enabled.

       <b>-mno-sched-control-spec</b>
       <b>-msched-control-spec</b>
           (Dis/En)able control speculative scheduling.  This feature is
           available only during region scheduling (i.e. before reload).
           This results in generation of the "ld.s" instructions and the
           corresponding check instructions "chk.s".  The default
           setting is disabled.

       <b>-msched-br-in-data-spec</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-br-in-data-spec</b>
           (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that
           are dependent on the data speculative loads before reload.
           This is effective only with <b>-msched-br-data-spec </b>enabled.
           The default setting is enabled.

       <b>-msched-ar-in-data-spec</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-ar-in-data-spec</b>
           (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that
           are dependent on the data speculative loads after reload.
           This is effective only with <b>-msched-ar-data-spec </b>enabled.
           The default setting is enabled.

       <b>-msched-in-control-spec</b>
       <b>-mno-sched-in-control-spec</b>
           (En/Dis)able speculative scheduling of the instructions that
           are dependent on the control speculative loads.  This is
           effective only with <b>-msched-control-spec </b>enabled.  The
           default setting is enabled.

       <b>-mno-sched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns</b>
       <b>-msched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns</b>
           If enabled, data-speculative instructions are chosen for
           schedule only if there are no other choices at the moment.
           This makes the use of the data speculation much more
           conservative.  The default setting is disabled.

       <b>-mno-sched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns</b>
       <b>-msched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns</b>
           If enabled, control-speculative instructions are chosen for
           schedule only if there are no other choices at the moment.
           This makes the use of the control speculation much more
           conservative.  The default setting is disabled.

       <b>-mno-sched-count-spec-in-critical-path</b>
       <b>-msched-count-spec-in-critical-path</b>
           If enabled, speculative dependencies are considered during
           computation of the instructions priorities.  This makes the
           use of the speculation a bit more conservative.  The default
           setting is disabled.

       <b>-msched-spec-ldc</b>
           Use a simple data speculation check.  This option is on by
           default.

       <b>-msched-control-spec-ldc</b>
           Use a simple check for control speculation.  This option is
           on by default.

       <b>-msched-stop-bits-after-every-cycle</b>
           Place a stop bit after every cycle when scheduling.  This
           option is on by default.

       <b>-msched-fp-mem-deps-zero-cost</b>
           Assume that floating-point stores and loads are not likely to
           cause a conflict when placed into the same instruction group.
           This option is disabled by default.

       <b>-msel-sched-dont-check-control-spec</b>
           Generate checks for control speculation in selective
           scheduling.  This flag is disabled by default.

       <b>-msched-max-memory-insns=</b><i>max-insns</i>
           Limit on the number of memory insns per instruction group,
           giving lower priority to subsequent memory insns attempting
           to schedule in the same instruction group. Frequently useful
           to prevent cache bank conflicts.  The default value is 1.

       <b>-msched-max-memory-insns-hard-limit</b>
           Makes the limit specified by <b>msched-max-memory-insns </b>a hard
           limit, disallowing more than that number in an instruction
           group.  Otherwise, the limit is "soft", meaning that non-
           memory operations are preferred when the limit is reached,
           but memory operations may still be scheduled.

       <i>LM32 Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the LatticeMico32 architecture:

       <b>-mbarrel-shift-enabled</b>
           Enable barrel-shift instructions.

       <b>-mdivide-enabled</b>
           Enable divide and modulus instructions.

       <b>-mmultiply-enabled</b>
           Enable multiply instructions.

       <b>-msign-extend-enabled</b>
           Enable sign extend instructions.

       <b>-muser-enabled</b>
           Enable user-defined instructions.

       <i>M32C Options</i>

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>name</i>
           Select the CPU for which code is generated.  <i>name</i> may be one
           of <b>r8c </b>for the R8C/Tiny series, <b>m16c </b>for the M16C (up to /60)
           series, <b>m32cm </b>for the M16C/80 series, or <b>m32c </b>for the M32C/80
           series.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.
           This causes an alternate runtime library to be linked in
           which supports, for example, file I/O.  You must not use this
           option when generating programs that will run on real
           hardware; you must provide your own runtime library for
           whatever I/O functions are needed.

       <b>-memregs=</b><i>number</i>
           Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC
           uses during code generation.  These pseudo-registers are used
           like real registers, so there is a tradeoff between GCC's
           ability to fit the code into available registers, and the
           performance penalty of using memory instead of registers.
           Note that all modules in a program must be compiled with the
           same value for this option.  Because of that, you must not
           use this option with GCC's default runtime libraries.

       <i>M32R/D Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for Renesas M32R/D architectures:

       <b>-m32r2</b>
           Generate code for the M32R/2.

       <b>-m32rx</b>
           Generate code for the M32R/X.

       <b>-m32r</b>
           Generate code for the M32R.  This is the default.

       <b>-mmodel=small</b>
           Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that
           their addresses can be loaded with the "ld24" instruction),
           and assume all subroutines are reachable with the "bl"
           instruction.  This is the default.

           The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
           "model" attribute.

       <b>-mmodel=medium</b>
           Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space
           (the compiler generates "seth/add3" instructions to load
           their addresses), and assume all subroutines are reachable
           with the "bl" instruction.

       <b>-mmodel=large</b>
           Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space
           (the compiler generates "seth/add3" instructions to load
           their addresses), and assume subroutines may not be reachable
           with the "bl" instruction (the compiler generates the much
           slower "seth/add3/jl" instruction sequence).

       <b>-msdata=none</b>
           Disable use of the small data area.  Variables are put into
           one of ".data", ".bss", or ".rodata" (unless the "section"
           attribute has been specified).  This is the default.

           The small data area consists of sections ".sdata" and
           ".sbss".  Objects may be explicitly put in the small data
           area with the "section" attribute using one of these
           sections.

       <b>-msdata=sdata</b>
           Put small global and static data in the small data area, but
           do not generate special code to reference them.

       <b>-msdata=use</b>
           Put small global and static data in the small data area, and
           generate special instructions to reference them.

       <b>-G </b><i>num</i>
           Put global and static objects less than or equal to <i>num</i> bytes
           into the small data or BSS sections instead of the normal
           data or BSS sections.  The default value of <i>num</i> is 8.  The
           <b>-msdata </b>option must be set to one of <b>sdata </b>or <b>use </b>for this
           option to have any effect.

           All modules should be compiled with the same <b>-G </b><i>num</i> value.
           Compiling with different values of <i>num</i> may or may not work;
           if it doesn't the linker gives an error message---incorrect
           code is not generated.

       <b>-mdebug</b>
           Makes the M32R-specific code in the compiler display some
           statistics that might help in debugging programs.

       <b>-malign-loops</b>
           Align all loops to a 32-byte boundary.

       <b>-mno-align-loops</b>
           Do not enforce a 32-byte alignment for loops.  This is the
           default.

       <b>-missue-rate=</b><i>number</i>
           Issue <i>number</i> instructions per cycle.  <i>number</i> can only be 1 or
           2.

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><i>number</i>
           <i>number</i> can only be 1 or 2.  If it is 1 then branches are
           preferred over conditional code, if it is 2, then the
           opposite applies.

       <b>-mflush-trap=</b><i>number</i>
           Specifies the trap number to use to flush the cache.  The
           default is 12.  Valid numbers are between 0 and 15 inclusive.

       <b>-mno-flush-trap</b>
           Specifies that the cache cannot be flushed by using a trap.

       <b>-mflush-func=</b><i>name</i>
           Specifies the name of the operating system function to call
           to flush the cache.  The default is <b>_flush_cache</b>, but a
           function call is only used if a trap is not available.

       <b>-mno-flush-func</b>
           Indicates that there is no OS function for flushing the
           cache.

       <i>M680x0 Options</i>

       These are the <b>-m </b>options defined for M680x0 and ColdFire
       processors.  The default settings depend on which architecture
       was selected when the compiler was configured; the defaults for
       the most common choices are given below.

       <b>-march=</b><i>arch</i>
           Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire instruction
           set architecture.  Permissible values of <i>arch</i> for M680x0
           architectures are: <b>68000</b>, <b>68010</b>, <b>68020</b>, <b>68030</b>, <b>68040</b>, <b>68060</b>
           and <b>cpu32</b>.  ColdFire architectures are selected according to
           Freescale's ISA classification and the permissible values
           are: <b>isaa</b>, <b>isaaplus</b>, <b>isab </b>and <b>isac</b>.

           GCC defines a macro "__mcf<i>arch__"</i> whenever it is generating
           code for a ColdFire target.  The <i>arch</i> in this macro is one of
           the <b>-march </b>arguments given above.

           When used together, <b>-march </b>and <b>-mtune </b>select code that runs
           on a family of similar processors but that is optimized for a
           particular microarchitecture.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu</i>
           Generate code for a specific M680x0 or ColdFire processor.
           The M680x0 <i>cpu</i>s are: <b>68000</b>, <b>68010</b>, <b>68020</b>, <b>68030</b>, <b>68040</b>,
           <b>68060</b>, <b>68302</b>, <b>68332 </b>and <b>cpu32</b>.  The ColdFire <i>cpu</i>s are given
           by the table below, which also classifies the CPUs into
           families:

           Family : <b>-mcpu </b>arguments
           <b>51 </b>: <b>51 51ac 51ag 51cn 51em 51je 51jf 51jg 51jm 51mm 51qe</b>

           <b>5206 </b>: <b>5202 5204 5206</b>
           <b>5206e </b>: <b>5206e</b>
           <b>5208 </b>: <b>5207 5208</b>
           <b>5211a </b>: <b>5210a 5211a</b>
           <b>5213 </b>: <b>5211 5212 5213</b>
           <b>5216 </b>: <b>5214 5216</b>
           <b>52235 </b>: <b>52230 52231 52232 52233 52234 52235</b>
           <b>5225 </b>: <b>5224 5225</b>
           <b>52259 </b>: <b>52252 52254 52255 52256 52258 52259</b>

           <b>5272 </b>: <b>5272</b>
           <b>5275 </b>: <b>5274 5275</b>
           <b>5282 </b>: <b>5280 5281 5282 528x</b>
           <b>53017 </b>: <b>53011 53012 53013 53014 53015 53016 53017</b>
           <b>5307 </b>: <b>5307</b>
           <b>5329 </b>: <b>5327 5328 5329 532x</b>
           <b>5373 </b>: <b>5372 5373 537x</b>
           <b>5407 </b>: <b>5407</b>
           <b>5475 </b>: <b>5470 5471 5472 5473 5474 5475 547x 5480 5481 5482 5483</b>
           <b>5484 5485</b>

           <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu</i> overrides <b>-march=</b><i>arch</i> if <i>arch</i> is compatible with
           <i>cpu</i>.  Other combinations of <b>-mcpu </b>and <b>-march </b>are rejected.

           GCC defines the macro "__mcf_cpu_<i>cpu"</i> when ColdFire target
           <i>cpu</i> is selected.  It also defines "__mcf_family_<i>family"</i>,
           where the value of <i>family</i> is given by the table above.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>tune</i>
           Tune the code for a particular microarchitecture within the
           constraints set by <b>-march </b>and <b>-mcpu</b>.  The M680x0
           microarchitectures are: <b>68000</b>, <b>68010</b>, <b>68020</b>, <b>68030</b>, <b>68040</b>,
           <b>68060 </b>and <b>cpu32</b>.  The ColdFire microarchitectures are: <b>cfv1</b>,
           <b>cfv2</b>, <b>cfv3</b>, <b>cfv4 </b>and <b>cfv4e</b>.

           You can also use <b>-mtune=68020-40 </b>for code that needs to run
           relatively well on 68020, 68030 and 68040 targets.
           <b>-mtune=68020-60 </b>is similar but includes 68060 targets as
           well.  These two options select the same tuning decisions as
           <b>-m68020-40 </b>and <b>-m68020-60 </b>respectively.

           GCC defines the macros "__mc<i>arch"</i> and "__mc<i>arch__"</i> when
           tuning for 680x0 architecture <i>arch</i>.  It also defines "mc<i>arch"</i>
           unless either <b>-ansi </b>or a non-GNU <b>-std </b>option is used.  If GCC
           is tuning for a range of architectures, as selected by
           <b>-mtune=68020-40 </b>or <b>-mtune=68020-60</b>, it defines the macros for
           every architecture in the range.

           GCC also defines the macro "__m<i>uarch__"</i> when tuning for
           ColdFire microarchitecture <i>uarch</i>, where <i>uarch</i> is one of the
           arguments given above.

       <b>-m68000</b>
       <b>-mc68000</b>
           Generate output for a 68000.  This is the default when the
           compiler is configured for 68000-based systems.  It is
           equivalent to <b>-march=68000</b>.

           Use this option for microcontrollers with a 68000 or EC000
           core, including the 68008, 68302, 68306, 68307, 68322, 68328
           and 68356.

       <b>-m68010</b>
           Generate output for a 68010.  This is the default when the
           compiler is configured for 68010-based systems.  It is
           equivalent to <b>-march=68010</b>.

       <b>-m68020</b>
       <b>-mc68020</b>
           Generate output for a 68020.  This is the default when the
           compiler is configured for 68020-based systems.  It is
           equivalent to <b>-march=68020</b>.

       <b>-m68030</b>
           Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default when the
           compiler is configured for 68030-based systems.  It is
           equivalent to <b>-march=68030</b>.

       <b>-m68040</b>
           Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the
           compiler is configured for 68040-based systems.  It is
           equivalent to <b>-march=68040</b>.

           This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions that
           have to be emulated by software on the 68040.  Use this
           option if your 68040 does not have code to emulate those
           instructions.

       <b>-m68060</b>
           Generate output for a 68060.  This is the default when the
           compiler is configured for 68060-based systems.  It is
           equivalent to <b>-march=68060</b>.

           This option inhibits the use of 68020 and 68881/68882
           instructions that have to be emulated by software on the
           68060.  Use this option if your 68060 does not have code to
           emulate those instructions.

       <b>-mcpu32</b>
           Generate output for a CPU32.  This is the default when the
           compiler is configured for CPU32-based systems.  It is
           equivalent to <b>-march=cpu32</b>.

           Use this option for microcontrollers with a CPU32 or CPU32+
           core, including the 68330, 68331, 68332, 68333, 68334, 68336,
           68340, 68341, 68349 and 68360.

       <b>-m5200</b>
           Generate output for a 520X ColdFire CPU.  This is the default
           when the compiler is configured for 520X-based systems.  It
           is equivalent to <b>-mcpu=5206</b>, and is now deprecated in favor
           of that option.

           Use this option for microcontroller with a 5200 core,
           including the MCF5202, MCF5203, MCF5204 and MCF5206.

       <b>-m5206e</b>
           Generate output for a 5206e ColdFire CPU.  The option is now
           deprecated in favor of the equivalent <b>-mcpu=5206e</b>.

       <b>-m528x</b>
           Generate output for a member of the ColdFire 528X family.
           The option is now deprecated in favor of the equivalent
           <b>-mcpu=528x</b>.

       <b>-m5307</b>
           Generate output for a ColdFire 5307 CPU.  The option is now
           deprecated in favor of the equivalent <b>-mcpu=5307</b>.

       <b>-m5407</b>
           Generate output for a ColdFire 5407 CPU.  The option is now
           deprecated in favor of the equivalent <b>-mcpu=5407</b>.

       <b>-mcfv4e</b>
           Generate output for a ColdFire V4e family CPU (e.g.
           547x/548x).  This includes use of hardware floating-point
           instructions.  The option is equivalent to <b>-mcpu=547x</b>, and is
           now deprecated in favor of that option.

       <b>-m68020-40</b>
           Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new
           instructions.  This results in code that can run relatively
           efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.
           The generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are
           emulated on the 68040.

           The option is equivalent to <b>-march=68020 -mtune=68020-40</b>.

       <b>-m68020-60</b>
           Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new
           instructions.  This results in code that can run relatively
           efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.
           The generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are
           emulated on the 68060.

           The option is equivalent to <b>-march=68020 -mtune=68020-60</b>.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
       <b>-m68881</b>
           Generate floating-point instructions.  This is the default
           for 68020 and above, and for ColdFire devices that have an
           FPU.  It defines the macro "__HAVE_68881__" on M680x0 targets
           and "__mcffpu__" on ColdFire targets.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Do not generate floating-point instructions; use library
           calls instead.  This is the default for 68000, 68010, and
           68832 targets.  It is also the default for ColdFire devices
           that have no FPU.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-div</b>
           Generate (do not generate) ColdFire hardware divide and
           remainder instructions.  If <b>-march </b>is used without <b>-mcpu</b>, the
           default is "on" for ColdFire architectures and "off" for
           M680x0 architectures.  Otherwise, the default is taken from
           the target CPU (either the default CPU, or the one specified
           by <b>-mcpu</b>).  For example, the default is "off" for <b>-mcpu=5206</b>
           and "on" for <b>-mcpu=5206e</b>.

           GCC defines the macro "__mcfhwdiv__" when this option is
           enabled.

       <b>-mshort</b>
           Consider type "int" to be 16 bits wide, like "short int".
           Additionally, parameters passed on the stack are also aligned
           to a 16-bit boundary even on targets whose API mandates
           promotion to 32-bit.

       <b>-mno-short</b>
           Do not consider type "int" to be 16 bits wide.  This is the
           default.

       <b>-mnobitfield</b>
       <b>-mno-bitfield</b>
           Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The <b>-m68000</b>, <b>-mcpu32</b>
           and <b>-m5200 </b>options imply <b>-mnobitfield</b>.

       <b>-mbitfield</b>
           Do use the bit-field instructions.  The <b>-m68020 </b>option
           implies <b>-mbitfield</b>.  This is the default if you use a
           configuration designed for a 68020.

       <b>-mrtd</b>
           Use a different function-calling convention, in which
           functions that take a fixed number of arguments return with
           the "rtd" instruction, which pops their arguments while
           returning.  This saves one instruction in the caller since
           there is no need to pop the arguments there.

           This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
           used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
           libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

           Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions
           that take variable numbers of arguments (including "printf");
           otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those
           functions.

           In addition, seriously incorrect code results if you call a
           function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments
           are harmlessly ignored.)

           The "rtd" instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020,
           68030, 68040, 68060 and CPU32 processors, but not by the
           68000 or 5200.

           The default is <b>-mno-rtd</b>.

       <b>-malign-int</b>
       <b>-mno-align-int</b>
           Control whether GCC aligns "int", "long", "long long",
           "float", "double", and "long double" variables on a 32-bit
           boundary (<b>-malign-int</b>) or a 16-bit boundary (<b>-mno-align-int</b>).
           Aligning variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that
           runs somewhat faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the
           expense of more memory.

           <b>Warning: </b>if you use the <b>-malign-int </b>switch, GCC aligns
           structures containing the above types differently than most
           published application binary interface specifications for the
           m68k.

       <b>-mpcrel</b>
           Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000 directly,
           instead of using a global offset table.  At present, this
           option implies <b>-fpic</b>, allowing at most a 16-bit offset for
           pc-relative addressing.  <b>-fPIC </b>is not presently supported
           with <b>-mpcrel</b>, though this could be supported for 68020 and
           higher processors.

       <b>-mno-strict-align</b>
       <b>-mstrict-align</b>
           Do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references are
           handled by the system.

       <b>-msep-data</b>
           Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a
           different area of memory from the text segment.  This allows
           for execute-in-place in an environment without virtual memory
           management.  This option implies <b>-fPIC</b>.

       <b>-mno-sep-data</b>
           Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the
           text segment.  This is the default.

       <b>-mid-shared-library</b>
           Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library
           ID method.  This allows for execute-in-place and shared
           libraries in an environment without virtual memory
           management.  This option implies <b>-fPIC</b>.

       <b>-mno-id-shared-library</b>
           Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries
           are being used.  This is the default.

       <b>-mshared-library-id=n</b>
           Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared
           library being compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates
           more compact code; specifying other values forces the
           allocation of that number to the current library, but is no
           more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.

       <b>-mxgot</b>
       <b>-mno-xgot</b>
           When generating position-independent code for ColdFire,
           generate code that works if the GOT has more than 8192
           entries.  This code is larger and slower than code generated
           without this option.  On M680x0 processors, this option is
           not needed; <b>-fPIC </b>suffices.

           GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from
           the GOT.  While this is relatively efficient, it only works
           if the GOT is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes
           the linker to report an error such as:

                   relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar

           If this happens, you should recompile your code with <b>-mxgot</b>.
           It should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code
           generated with <b>-mxgot </b>is less efficient, since it takes 4
           instructions to fetch the value of a global symbol.

           Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the GNU
           linker, can create multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries.  If
           you have such a linker, you should only need to use <b>-mxgot</b>
           when compiling a single object file that accesses more than
           8192 GOT entries.  Very few do.

           These options have no effect unless GCC is generating
           position-independent code.

       <b>-mlong-jump-table-offsets</b>
           Use 32-bit offsets in "switch" tables.  The default is to use
           16-bit offsets.

       <i>MCore Options</i>

       These are the <b>-m </b>options defined for the Motorola M*Core
       processors.

       <b>-mhardlit</b>
       <b>-mno-hardlit</b>
           Inline constants into the code stream if it can be done in
           two instructions or less.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-div</b>
           Use the divide instruction.  (Enabled by default).

       <b>-mrelax-immediate</b>
       <b>-mno-relax-immediate</b>
           Allow arbitrary-sized immediates in bit operations.

       <b>-mwide-bitfields</b>

       <b>-mno-lsim</b>
           Assume that runtime support has been provided and so omit the
           simulator library (<i>libsim.a)</i> from the linker command line.

       <b>-mstack-increment=</b><i>size</i>
           Set the maximum amount for a single stack increment
           operation.  Large values can increase the speed of programs
           that contain functions that need a large amount of stack
           space, but they can also trigger a segmentation fault if the
           stack is extended too much.  The default value is 0x1000.

       <i>MeP Options</i>

       <b>-mabsdiff</b>
           Enables the "abs" instruction, which is the absolute
           difference between two registers.

       <b>-mall-opts</b>
           Enables all the optional instructions---average, multiply,
           divide, bit operations, leading zero, absolute difference,
           min/max, clip, and saturation.

       <b>-maverage</b>
           Enables the "ave" instruction, which computes the average of
           two registers.

       <b>-mbased=</b><i>n</i>
           Variables of size <i>n</i> bytes or smaller are placed in the
           ".based" section by default.  Based variables use the $tp
           register as a base register, and there is a 128-byte limit to
           the ".based" section.

       <b>-mbitops</b>
           Enables the bit operation instructions---bit test ("btstm"),
           set ("bsetm"), clear ("bclrm"), invert ("bnotm"), and test-
           and-set ("tas").

       <b>-mc=</b><i>name</i>
           Selects which section constant data is placed in.  <i>name</i> may
           be <b>tiny</b>, <b>near</b>, or <b>far</b>.

       <b>-mclip</b>
           Enables the "clip" instruction.  Note that <b>-mclip </b>is not
           useful unless you also provide <b>-mminmax</b>.

       <b>-mconfig=</b><i>name</i>
           Selects one of the built-in core configurations.  Each MeP
           chip has one or more modules in it; each module has a core
           CPU and a variety of coprocessors, optional instructions, and
           peripherals.  The "MeP-Integrator" tool, not part of GCC,
           provides these configurations through this option; using this
           option is the same as using all the corresponding command-
           line options.  The default configuration is <b>default</b>.

       <b>-mcop</b>
           Enables the coprocessor instructions.  By default, this is a
           32-bit coprocessor.  Note that the coprocessor is normally
           enabled via the <b>-mconfig= </b>option.

       <b>-mcop32</b>
           Enables the 32-bit coprocessor's instructions.

       <b>-mcop64</b>
           Enables the 64-bit coprocessor's instructions.

       <b>-mivc2</b>
           Enables IVC2 scheduling.  IVC2 is a 64-bit VLIW coprocessor.

       <b>-mdc</b>
           Causes constant variables to be placed in the ".near"
           section.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
           Enables the "div" and "divu" instructions.

       <b>-meb</b>
           Generate big-endian code.

       <b>-mel</b>
           Generate little-endian code.

       <b>-mio-volatile</b>
           Tells the compiler that any variable marked with the "io"
           attribute is to be considered volatile.

       <b>-ml </b>Causes variables to be assigned to the ".far" section by
           default.

       <b>-mleadz</b>
           Enables the "leadz" (leading zero) instruction.

       <b>-mm </b>Causes variables to be assigned to the ".near" section by
           default.

       <b>-mminmax</b>
           Enables the "min" and "max" instructions.

       <b>-mmult</b>
           Enables the multiplication and multiply-accumulate
           instructions.

       <b>-mno-opts</b>
           Disables all the optional instructions enabled by <b>-mall-opts</b>.

       <b>-mrepeat</b>
           Enables the "repeat" and "erepeat" instructions, used for
           low-overhead looping.

       <b>-ms </b>Causes all variables to default to the ".tiny" section.  Note
           that there is a 65536-byte limit to this section.  Accesses
           to these variables use the %gp base register.

       <b>-msatur</b>
           Enables the saturation instructions.  Note that the compiler
           does not currently generate these itself, but this option is
           included for compatibility with other tools, like "as".

       <b>-msdram</b>
           Link the SDRAM-based runtime instead of the default ROM-based
           runtime.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Link the simulator run-time libraries.

       <b>-msimnovec</b>
           Link the simulator runtime libraries, excluding built-in
           support for reset and exception vectors and tables.

       <b>-mtf</b>
           Causes all functions to default to the ".far" section.
           Without this option, functions default to the ".near"
           section.

       <b>-mtiny=</b><i>n</i>
           Variables that are <i>n</i> bytes or smaller are allocated to the
           ".tiny" section.  These variables use the $gp base register.
           The default for this option is 4, but note that there's a
           65536-byte limit to the ".tiny" section.

       <i>MicroBlaze Options</i>

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Use software emulation for floating point (default).

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Use hardware floating-point instructions.

       <b>-mmemcpy</b>
           Do not optimize block moves, use "memcpy".

       <b>-mno-clearbss</b>
           This option is deprecated.  Use <b>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</b>
           instead.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu-type</i>
           Use features of, and schedule code for, the given CPU.
           Supported values are in the format <b>v</b><i>X</i><b>.</b><i>YY</i><b>.</b><i>Z</i>, where <i>X</i> is a
           major version, <i>YY</i> is the minor version, and <i>Z</i> is
           compatibility code.  Example values are <b>v3.00.a</b>, <b>v4.00.b</b>,
           <b>v5.00.a</b>, <b>v5.00.b</b>, <b>v6.00.a</b>.

       <b>-mxl-soft-mul</b>
           Use software multiply emulation (default).

       <b>-mxl-soft-div</b>
           Use software emulation for divides (default).

       <b>-mxl-barrel-shift</b>
           Use the hardware barrel shifter.

       <b>-mxl-pattern-compare</b>
           Use pattern compare instructions.

       <b>-msmall-divides</b>
           Use table lookup optimization for small signed integer
           divisions.

       <b>-mxl-stack-check</b>
           This option is deprecated.  Use <b>-fstack-check </b>instead.

       <b>-mxl-gp-opt</b>
           Use GP-relative ".sdata"/".sbss" sections.

       <b>-mxl-multiply-high</b>
           Use multiply high instructions for high part of 32x32
           multiply.

       <b>-mxl-float-convert</b>
           Use hardware floating-point conversion instructions.

       <b>-mxl-float-sqrt</b>
           Use hardware floating-point square root instruction.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code for a big-endian target.

       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code for a little-endian target.

       <b>-mxl-reorder</b>
           Use reorder instructions (swap and byte reversed load/store).

       <b>-mxl-mode-</b><i>app-model</i>
           Select application model <i>app-model</i>.  Valid models are

           <b>executable</b>
               normal executable (default), uses startup code <i>crt0.o</i>.

           <b>-mpic-data-is-text-relative</b>
               Assume that the displacement between the text and data
               segments is fixed at static link time.  This allows data
               to be referenced by offset from start of text address
               instead of GOT since PC-relative addressing is not
               supported.

           <b>xmdstub</b>
               for use with Xilinx Microprocessor Debugger (XMD) based
               software intrusive debug agent called xmdstub. This uses
               startup file <i>crt1.o</i> and sets the start address of the
               program to 0x800.

           <b>bootstrap</b>
               for applications that are loaded using a bootloader.
               This model uses startup file <i>crt2.o</i> which does not
               contain a processor reset vector handler. This is
               suitable for transferring control on a processor reset to
               the bootloader rather than the application.

           <b>novectors</b>
               for applications that do not require any of the
               MicroBlaze vectors. This option may be useful for
               applications running within a monitoring application.
               This model uses <i>crt3.o</i> as a startup file.

           Option <b>-xl-mode-</b><i>app-model</i> is a deprecated alias for
           <b>-mxl-mode-</b><i>app-model</i>.

       <i>MIPS Options</i>

       <b>-EB </b>Generate big-endian code.

       <b>-EL </b>Generate little-endian code.  This is the default for
           <b>mips*el-*-* </b>configurations.

       <b>-march=</b><i>arch</i>
           Generate code that runs on <i>arch</i>, which can be the name of a
           generic MIPS ISA, or the name of a particular processor.  The
           ISA names are: <b>mips1</b>, <b>mips2</b>, <b>mips3</b>, <b>mips4</b>, <b>mips32</b>, <b>mips32r2</b>,
           <b>mips32r3</b>, <b>mips32r5</b>, <b>mips32r6</b>, <b>mips64</b>, <b>mips64r2</b>, <b>mips64r3</b>,
           <b>mips64r5 </b>and <b>mips64r6</b>.  The processor names are: <b>4kc</b>, <b>4km</b>,

           <b>rm9000</b>, <b>r10000</b>, <b>r12000</b>, <b>r14000</b>, <b>r16000</b>, <b>sb1</b>, <b>sr71000</b>, <b>vr4100</b>,
           <b>vr4111</b>, <b>vr4120</b>, <b>vr4130</b>, <b>vr4300</b>, <b>vr5000</b>, <b>vr5400</b>, <b>vr5500</b>, <b>xlr</b>
           and <b>xlp</b>.  The special value <b>from-abi </b>selects the most
           compatible architecture for the selected ABI (that is, <b>mips1</b>
           for 32-bit ABIs and <b>mips3 </b>for 64-bit ABIs).

           The native Linux/GNU toolchain also supports the value
           <b>native</b>, which selects the best architecture option for the
           host processor.  <b>-march=native </b>has no effect if GCC does not
           recognize the processor.

           In processor names, a final <b>000 </b>can be abbreviated as <b>k </b>(for
           example, <b>-march=r2k</b>).  Prefixes are optional, and <b>vr </b>may be
           written <b>r</b>.

           Names of the form <i>n</i><b>f2_1 </b>refer to processors with FPUs clocked
           at half the rate of the core, names of the form <i>n</i><b>f1_1 </b>refer
           to processors with FPUs clocked at the same rate as the core,
           and names of the form <i>n</i><b>f3_2 </b>refer to processors with FPUs
           clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.  For
           compatibility reasons, <i>n</i><b>f </b>is accepted as a synonym for <i>n</i><b>f2_1</b>
           while <i>n</i><b>x </b>and <i>b</i><b>fx </b>are accepted as synonyms for <i>n</i><b>f1_1</b>.

           GCC defines two macros based on the value of this option.
           The first is "_MIPS_ARCH", which gives the name of target
           architecture, as a string.  The second has the form
           "_MIPS_ARCH_<i>foo"</i>, where <i>foo</i> is the capitalized value of
           "_MIPS_ARCH".  For example, <b>-march=r2000 </b>sets "_MIPS_ARCH" to
           "r2000" and defines the macro "_MIPS_ARCH_R2000".

           Note that the "_MIPS_ARCH" macro uses the processor names
           given above.  In other words, it has the full prefix and does
           not abbreviate <b>000 </b>as <b>k</b>.  In the case of <b>from-abi</b>, the macro
           names the resolved architecture (either "mips1" or "mips3").
           It names the default architecture when no <b>-march </b>option is
           given.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>arch</i>
           Optimize for <i>arch</i>.  Among other things, this option controls
           the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of
           arithmetic operations.  The list of <i>arch</i> values is the same
           as for <b>-march</b>.

           When this option is not used, GCC optimizes for the processor
           specified by <b>-march</b>.  By using <b>-march </b>and <b>-mtune </b>together, it
           is possible to generate code that runs on a family of
           processors, but optimize the code for one particular member
           of that family.

           <b>-mtune </b>defines the macros "_MIPS_TUNE" and "_MIPS_TUNE_<i>foo"</i>,
           which work in the same way as the <b>-march </b>ones described
           above.

       <b>-mips1</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips1</b>.

       <b>-mips2</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips2</b>.

       <b>-mips64</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips64</b>.

       <b>-mips64r6</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-march=mips64r6</b>.

       <b>-mips16</b>
       <b>-mno-mips16</b>
           Generate (do not generate) MIPS16 code.  If GCC is targeting
           a MIPS32 or MIPS64 architecture, it makes use of the MIPS16e
           ASE.

           MIPS16 code generation can also be controlled on a per-
           function basis by means of "mips16" and "nomips16"
           attributes.

       <b>-mflip-mips16</b>
           Generate MIPS16 code on alternating functions.  This option
           is provided for regression testing of mixed MIPS16/non-MIPS16
           code generation, and is not intended for ordinary use in
           compiling user code.

       <b>-minterlink-compressed</b>
       <b>-mno-interlink-compressed</b>
           Require (do not require) that code using the standard
           (uncompressed) MIPS ISA be link-compatible with MIPS16 and
           microMIPS code, and vice versa.

           For example, code using the standard ISA encoding cannot jump
           directly to MIPS16 or microMIPS code; it must either use a
           call or an indirect jump.  <b>-minterlink-compressed </b>therefore
           disables direct jumps unless GCC knows that the target of the
           jump is not compressed.

       <b>-minterlink-mips16</b>
       <b>-mno-interlink-mips16</b>
           Aliases of <b>-minterlink-compressed </b>and
           <b>-mno-interlink-compressed</b>.  These options predate the
           microMIPS ASE and are retained for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-mabi=32</b>
       <b>-mabi=o64</b>
       <b>-mabi=n32</b>
       <b>-mabi=64</b>
       <b>-mabi=eabi</b>
           Generate code for the given ABI.

           Note that the EABI has a 32-bit and a 64-bit variant.  GCC
           normally generates 64-bit code when you select a 64-bit
           architecture, but you can use <b>-mgp32 </b>to get 32-bit code
           instead.

           For information about the O64 ABI, see
           &lt;<b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html</a> </b>&gt;.

           GCC supports a variant of the o32 ABI in which floating-point
           registers are 64 rather than 32 bits wide.  You can select
           this combination with <b>-mabi=32 -mfp64</b>.  This ABI relies on
           the "mthc1" and "mfhc1" instructions and is therefore only
           supported for MIPS32R2, MIPS32R3 and MIPS32R5 processors.

           The register assignments for arguments and return values
           remain the same, but each scalar value is passed in a single
           64-bit register rather than a pair of 32-bit registers.  For
           example, scalar floating-point values are returned in <b>$f0</b>
           only, not a <b>$f0</b>/<b>$f1 </b>pair.  The set of call-saved registers
           also remains the same in that the even-numbered double-
           precision registers are saved.

           Two additional variants of the o32 ABI are supported to
           enable a transition from 32-bit to 64-bit registers.  These
           are FPXX (<b>-mfpxx</b>) and FP64A (<b>-mfp64 -mno-odd-spreg</b>).  The
           FPXX extension mandates that all code must execute correctly
           when run using 32-bit or 64-bit registers.  The code can be
           interlinked with either FP32 or FP64, but not both.  The
           FP64A extension is similar to the FP64 extension but forbids
           the use of odd-numbered single-precision registers.  This can
           be used in conjunction with the "FRE" mode of FPUs in
           MIPS32R5 processors and allows both FP32 and FP64A code to
           interlink and run in the same process without changing FPU
           modes.

       <b>-mabicalls</b>
       <b>-mno-abicalls</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code that is suitable for
           SVR4-style dynamic objects.  <b>-mabicalls </b>is the default for
           SVR4-based systems.

       <b>-mshared</b>
       <b>-mno-shared</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code that is fully position-
           independent, and that can therefore be linked into shared
           libraries.  This option only affects <b>-mabicalls</b>.

           All <b>-mabicalls </b>code has traditionally been position-
           independent, regardless of options like <b>-fPIC </b>and <b>-fpic</b>.
           However, as an extension, the GNU toolchain allows
           executables to use absolute accesses for locally-binding
           symbols.  It can also use shorter GP initialization sequences
           and generate direct calls to locally-defined functions.  This
           mode is selected by <b>-mno-shared</b>.

           <b>-mno-shared </b>depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates
           objects that can only be linked by the GNU linker.  However,
           the option does not affect the ABI of the final executable;
           it only affects the ABI of relocatable objects.  Using
           <b>-mno-shared </b>generally makes executables both smaller and
           quicker.

           <b>-mshared </b>is the default.

       <b>-mplt</b>
       <b>-mno-plt</b>
           Assume (do not assume) that the static and dynamic linkers
           support PLTs and copy relocations.  This option only affects
           <b>-mno-shared -mabicalls</b>.  For the n64 ABI, this option has no
           effect without <b>-msym32</b>.

           You can make <b>-mplt </b>the default by configuring GCC with
           <b>--with-mips-plt</b>.  The default is <b>-mno-plt </b>otherwise.

       <b>-mxgot</b>
       <b>-mno-xgot</b>
           Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the
           global offset table.

           GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from
           the GOT.  While this is relatively efficient, it only works
           if the GOT is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes
           the linker to report an error such as:

                   relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar

           If this happens, you should recompile your code with <b>-mxgot</b>.
           This works with very large GOTs, although the code is also
           less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch
           the value of a global symbol.

           Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have
           such a linker, you should only need to use <b>-mxgot </b>when a
           single object file accesses more than 64k's worth of GOT
           entries.  Very few do.

           These options have no effect unless GCC is generating
           position independent code.

       <b>-mgp32</b>
           Assume that general-purpose registers are 32 bits wide.

       <b>-mgp64</b>
           Assume that general-purpose registers are 64 bits wide.

       <b>-mfp32</b>
           Assume that floating-point registers are 32 bits wide.

       <b>-mfp64</b>
           Assume that floating-point registers are 64 bits wide.

       <b>-mfpxx</b>
           Do not assume the width of floating-point registers.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Use floating-point coprocessor instructions.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Do not use floating-point coprocessor instructions.
           Implement floating-point calculations using library calls
           instead.

       <b>-mno-float</b>
           Equivalent to <b>-msoft-float</b>, but additionally asserts that the
           program being compiled does not perform any floating-point
           operations.  This option is presently supported only by some
           bare-metal MIPS configurations, where it may select a special
           set of libraries that lack all floating-point support
           (including, for example, the floating-point "printf"
           formats).  If code compiled with <b>-mno-float </b>accidentally
           contains floating-point operations, it is likely to suffer a
           link-time or run-time failure.

       <b>-msingle-float</b>
           Assume that the floating-point coprocessor only supports
           single-precision operations.

       <b>-mdouble-float</b>
           Assume that the floating-point coprocessor supports double-
           precision operations.  This is the default.

       <b>-modd-spreg</b>
       <b>-mno-odd-spreg</b>
           Enable the use of odd-numbered single-precision floating-
           point registers for the o32 ABI.  This is the default for
           processors that are known to support these registers.  When
           using the o32 FPXX ABI, <b>-mno-odd-spreg </b>is set by default.

       <b>-mabs=2008</b>
       <b>-mabs=legacy</b>
           These options control the treatment of the special not-a-
           number (NaN) IEEE 754 floating-point data with the "abs.<i>fmt"</i>
           and "neg.<i>fmt"</i> machine instructions.

           By default or when <b>-mabs=legacy </b>is used the legacy treatment
           is selected.  In this case these instructions are considered
           arithmetic and avoided where correct operation is required
           and the input operand might be a NaN.  A longer sequence of
           instructions that manipulate the sign bit of floating-point
           datum manually is used instead unless the <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>
           option has also been specified.

           The <b>-mabs=2008 </b>option selects the IEEE 754-2008 treatment.
           In this case these instructions are considered non-arithmetic
           and therefore operating correctly in all cases, including in
           particular where the input operand is a NaN.  These
           instructions are therefore always used for the respective
           operations.

       <b>-mnan=2008</b>
       <b>-mnan=legacy</b>
           These options control the encoding of the special not-a-
           number (NaN) IEEE 754 floating-point data.

           The <b>-mnan=legacy </b>option selects the legacy encoding.  In this
           case quiet NaNs (qNaNs) are denoted by the first bit of their
           trailing significand field being 0, whereas signaling NaNs
           (sNaNs) are denoted by the first bit of their trailing
           significand field being 1.

           The <b>-mnan=2008 </b>option selects the IEEE 754-2008 encoding.  In
           this case qNaNs are denoted by the first bit of their
           trailing significand field being 1, whereas sNaNs are denoted
           by the first bit of their trailing significand field being 0.

           The default is <b>-mnan=legacy </b>unless GCC has been configured
           with <b>--with-nan=2008</b>.

       <b>-mllsc</b>
       <b>-mno-llsc</b>
           Use (do not use) <b>ll</b>, <b>sc</b>, and <b>sync </b>instructions to implement
           atomic memory built-in functions.  When neither option is
           specified, GCC uses the instructions if the target
           architecture supports them.

           <b>-mllsc </b>is useful if the runtime environment can emulate the
           instructions and <b>-mno-llsc </b>can be useful when compiling for
           nonstandard ISAs.  You can make either option the default by
           configuring GCC with <b>--with-llsc </b>and <b>--without-llsc</b>
           respectively.  <b>--with-llsc </b>is the default for some
           configurations; see the installation documentation for
           details.

       <b>-mdsp</b>
       <b>-mno-dsp</b>
           Use (do not use) revision 1 of the MIPS DSP ASE.
             This option defines the preprocessor macro "__mips_dsp".
           It also defines "__mips_dsp_rev" to 1.

       <b>-mdspr2</b>
       <b>-mno-dspr2</b>
           Use (do not use) revision 2 of the MIPS DSP ASE.
             This option defines the preprocessor macros "__mips_dsp"
           and "__mips_dspr2".  It also defines "__mips_dsp_rev" to 2.

       <b>-msmartmips</b>
       <b>-mno-smartmips</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS SmartMIPS ASE.

       <b>-mpaired-single</b>
       <b>-mno-paired-single</b>
           Use (do not use) paired-single floating-point instructions.
             This option requires hardware floating-point support to be
           enabled.

       <b>-mdmx</b>
       <b>-mno-mdmx</b>
           Use (do not use) MIPS Digital Media Extension instructions.
           This option can only be used when generating 64-bit code and
           requires hardware floating-point support to be enabled.

       <b>-mips3d</b>
       <b>-mno-mips3d</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS-3D ASE.  The option <b>-mips3d </b>implies
           <b>-mpaired-single</b>.

       <b>-mmicromips</b>
       <b>-mno-micromips</b>
           Generate (do not generate) microMIPS code.

           MicroMIPS code generation can also be controlled on a per-
           function basis by means of "micromips" and "nomicromips"
           attributes.

       <b>-mmt</b>
       <b>-mno-mt</b>
           Use (do not use) MT Multithreading instructions.

       <b>-mmcu</b>
       <b>-mno-mcu</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS MCU ASE instructions.

       <b>-meva</b>
       <b>-mno-eva</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Enhanced Virtual Addressing
           instructions.

       <b>-mvirt</b>
       <b>-mno-virt</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Virtualization (VZ) instructions.

       <b>-mxpa</b>
       <b>-mno-xpa</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS eXtended Physical Address (XPA)
           instructions.

       <b>-mcrc</b>
       <b>-mno-crc</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
           instructions.

       <b>-mginv</b>
       <b>-mno-ginv</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Global INValidate (GINV)
           instructions.

       <b>-mloongson-mmi</b>
       <b>-mno-loongson-mmi</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Loongson MultiMedia extensions
           Instructions (MMI).

       <b>-mloongson-ext</b>
       <b>-mno-loongson-ext</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Loongson EXTensions (EXT)
           instructions.

       <b>-mloongson-ext2</b>
       <b>-mno-loongson-ext2</b>
           Use (do not use) the MIPS Loongson EXTensions r2 (EXT2)
           instructions.

       <b>-mlong64</b>
           Force "long" types to be 64 bits wide.  See <b>-mlong32 </b>for an
           explanation of the default and the way that the pointer size
           is determined.

       <b>-mlong32</b>
           Force "long", "int", and pointer types to be 32 bits wide.

           The default size of "int"s, "long"s and pointers depends on
           the ABI.  All the supported ABIs use 32-bit "int"s.  The n64
           ABI uses 64-bit "long"s, as does the 64-bit EABI; the others
           use 32-bit "long"s.  Pointers are the same size as "long"s,
           or the same size as integer registers, whichever is smaller.

       <b>-msym32</b>
       <b>-mno-sym32</b>
           Assume (do not assume) that all symbols have 32-bit values,
           regardless of the selected ABI.  This option is useful in
           combination with <b>-mabi=64 </b>and <b>-mno-abicalls </b>because it allows
           GCC to generate shorter and faster references to symbolic
           addresses.

       <b>-G </b><i>num</i>
           Put definitions of externally-visible data in a small data
           section if that data is no bigger than <i>num</i> bytes.  GCC can
           then generate more efficient accesses to the data; see
           <b>-mgpopt </b>for details.

           The default <b>-G </b>option depends on the configuration.

       <b>-mlocal-sdata</b>
       <b>-mno-local-sdata</b>
           Extend (do not extend) the <b>-G </b>behavior to local data too,
           such as to static variables in C.  <b>-mlocal-sdata </b>is the
           default for all configurations.

           If the linker complains that an application is using too much
           small data, you might want to try rebuilding the less
           performance-critical parts with <b>-mno-local-sdata</b>.  You might
           also want to build large libraries with <b>-mno-local-sdata</b>, so
           that the libraries leave more room for the main program.

       <b>-mextern-sdata</b>
       <b>-mno-extern-sdata</b>
           Assume (do not assume) that externally-defined data is in a
           small data section if the size of that data is within the <b>-G</b>
           limit.  <b>-mextern-sdata </b>is the default for all configurations.

           If you compile a module <i>Mod</i> with <b>-mextern-sdata -G </b><i>num</i>
           <b>-mgpopt</b>, and <i>Mod</i> references a variable <i>Var</i> that is no bigger
           than <i>num</i> bytes, you must make sure that <i>Var</i> is placed in a
           small data section.  If <i>Var</i> is defined by another module, you
           must either compile that module with a high-enough <b>-G </b>setting
           or attach a "section" attribute to <i>Var</i>'s definition.  If <i>Var</i>
           is common, you must link the application with a high-enough
           <b>-G </b>setting.

           The easiest way of satisfying these restrictions is to
           compile and link every module with the same <b>-G </b>option.
           However, you may wish to build a library that supports
           several different small data limits.  You can do this by
           compiling the library with the highest supported <b>-G </b>setting
           and additionally using <b>-mno-extern-sdata </b>to stop the library
           from making assumptions about externally-defined data.

       <b>-mgpopt</b>
       <b>-mno-gpopt</b>
           Use (do not use) GP-relative accesses for symbols that are
           known to be in a small data section; see <b>-G</b>, <b>-mlocal-sdata</b>
           and <b>-mextern-sdata</b>.  <b>-mgpopt </b>is the default for all
           configurations.

           <b>-mno-gpopt </b>is useful for cases where the $gp register might
           not hold the value of "_gp".  For example, if the code is
           part of a library that might be used in a boot monitor,
           programs that call boot monitor routines pass an unknown
           value in $gp.  (In such situations, the boot monitor itself
           is usually compiled with <b>-G0</b>.)

           <b>-mno-gpopt </b>implies <b>-mno-local-sdata </b>and <b>-mno-extern-sdata</b>.

       <b>-membedded-data</b>
       <b>-mno-embedded-data</b>
           Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if
           possible, then next in the small data section if possible,
           otherwise in data.  This gives slightly slower code than the
           default, but reduces the amount of RAM required when
           executing, and thus may be preferred for some embedded
           systems.

       <b>-muninit-const-in-rodata</b>
       <b>-mno-uninit-const-in-rodata</b>
           Put uninitialized "const" variables in the read-only data
           section.  This option is only meaningful in conjunction with
           <b>-membedded-data</b>.

       <b>-mcode-readable=</b><i>setting</i>
           Specify whether GCC may generate code that reads from
           executable sections.  There are three possible settings:

           <b>-mcode-readable=yes</b>
               Instructions may freely access executable sections.  This
               is the default setting.

           <b>-mcode-readable=pcrel</b>
               MIPS16 PC-relative load instructions can access
               executable sections, but other instructions must not do
               so.  This option is useful on 4KSc and 4KSd processors
               when the code TLBs have the Read Inhibit bit set.  It is
               also useful on processors that can be configured to have
               a dual instruction/data SRAM interface and that, like the
               M4K, automatically redirect PC-relative loads to the
               instruction RAM.

           <b>-mcode-readable=no</b>
               Instructions must not access executable sections.  This
               option can be useful on targets that are configured to
               have a dual instruction/data SRAM interface but that
               (unlike the M4K) do not automatically redirect PC-
               relative loads to the instruction RAM.

       <b>-msplit-addresses</b>
       <b>-mno-split-addresses</b>
           Enable (disable) use of the "%hi()" and "%lo()" assembler
           relocation operators.  This option has been superseded by
           <b>-mexplicit-relocs </b>but is retained for backwards
           compatibility.

       <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b>
       <b>-mno-explicit-relocs</b>
           Use (do not use) assembler relocation operators when dealing
           with symbolic addresses.  The alternative, selected by
           <b>-mno-explicit-relocs</b>, is to use assembler macros instead.

           <b>-mexplicit-relocs </b>is the default if GCC was configured to use
           an assembler that supports relocation operators.

       <b>-mcheck-zero-division</b>
       <b>-mno-check-zero-division</b>
           Trap (do not trap) on integer division by zero.

           The default is <b>-mcheck-zero-division</b>.

       <b>-mdivide-traps</b>
       <b>-mdivide-breaks</b>
           MIPS systems check for division by zero by generating either
           a conditional trap or a break instruction.  Using traps
           results in smaller code, but is only supported on MIPS II and
           later.  Also, some versions of the Linux kernel have a bug
           that prevents trap from generating the proper signal
           ("SIGFPE").  Use <b>-mdivide-traps </b>to allow conditional traps on
           architectures that support them and <b>-mdivide-breaks </b>to force
           the use of breaks.

           The default is usually <b>-mdivide-traps</b>, but this can be
           overridden at configure time using <b>--with-divide=breaks</b>.
           Divide-by-zero checks can be completely disabled using
           <b>-mno-check-zero-division</b>.

       <b>-mload-store-pairs</b>
       <b>-mno-load-store-pairs</b>
           Enable (disable) an optimization that pairs consecutive load
           or store instructions to enable load/store bonding.  This
           option is enabled by default but only takes effect when the
           selected architecture is known to support bonding.

       <b>-mmemcpy</b>
       <b>-mno-memcpy</b>
           Force (do not force) the use of "memcpy" for non-trivial
           block moves.  The default is <b>-mno-memcpy</b>, which allows GCC to
           inline most constant-sized copies.

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-long-calls</b>
           Disable (do not disable) use of the "jal" instruction.
           Calling functions using "jal" is more efficient but requires
           the caller and callee to be in the same 256 megabyte segment.

           This option has no effect on abicalls code.  The default is
           <b>-mno-long-calls</b>.

       <b>-mmad</b>
       <b>-mno-mad</b>
           Enable (disable) use of the "mad", "madu" and "mul"
           instructions, as provided by the R4650 ISA.

       <b>-mimadd</b>
       <b>-mno-imadd</b>
           Enable (disable) use of the "madd" and "msub" integer
           instructions.  The default is <b>-mimadd </b>on architectures that
           support "madd" and "msub" except for the 74k architecture
           where it was found to generate slower code.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Enable (disable) use of the floating-point multiply-
           accumulate instructions, when they are available.  The
           default is <b>-mfused-madd</b>.

           On the R8000 CPU when multiply-accumulate instructions are
           used, the intermediate product is calculated to infinite
           precision and is not subject to the FCSR Flush to Zero bit.
           This may be undesirable in some circumstances.  On other
           processors the result is numerically identical to the
           equivalent computation using separate multiply, add, subtract
           and negate instructions.

       <b>-nocpp</b>
           Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor over user
           assembler files (with a <b>.s </b>suffix) when assembling them.

       <b>-mfix-24k</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-24k</b>
           Work around the 24K E48 (lost data on stores during refill)
           errata.  The workarounds are implemented by the assembler
           rather than by GCC.

       <b>-mfix-r4000</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-r4000</b>
           Work around certain R4000 CPU errata:

           -   A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect
               result if executed immediately after starting an integer
               division.

           -   A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect
               result if executed while an integer multiplication is in
               progress.

           -   An integer division may give an incorrect result if
               started in a delay slot of a taken branch or a jump.

       <b>-mfix-r4400</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-r4400</b>
           Work around certain R4400 CPU errata:

           -   A double-word or a variable shift may give an incorrect
               result if executed immediately after starting an integer
               division.

       <b>-mfix-r10000</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-r10000</b>
           Work around certain R10000 errata:

           -   "ll"/"sc" sequences may not behave atomically on
               revisions prior to 3.0.  They may deadlock on revisions
               2.6 and earlier.

           This option can only be used if the target architecture
           supports branch-likely instructions.  <b>-mfix-r10000 </b>is the
           default when <b>-march=r10000 </b>is used; <b>-mno-fix-r10000 </b>is the
           default otherwise.

       <b>-mfix-r5900</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-r5900</b>
           Do not attempt to schedule the preceding instruction into the
           delay slot of a branch instruction placed at the end of a
           short loop of six instructions or fewer and always schedule a
           "nop" instruction there instead.  The short loop bug under
           certain conditions causes loops to execute only once or
           twice, due to a hardware bug in the R5900 chip.  The
           workaround is implemented by the assembler rather than by
           GCC.

       <b>-mfix-rm7000</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-rm7000</b>
           Work around the RM7000 "dmult"/"dmultu" errata.  The
           workarounds are implemented by the assembler rather than by
           GCC.

       <b>-mfix-vr4120</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-vr4120</b>
           Work around certain VR4120 errata:

           -   "dmultu" does not always produce the correct result.

           -   "div" and "ddiv" do not always produce the correct result
               if one of the operands is negative.

           The workarounds for the division errata rely on special
           functions in <i>libgcc.a</i>.  At present, these functions are only
           provided by the "mips64vr*-elf" configurations.

           Other VR4120 errata require a NOP to be inserted between
           certain pairs of instructions.  These errata are handled by
           the assembler, not by GCC itself.

       <b>-mfix-vr4130</b>
           Work around the VR4130 "mflo"/"mfhi" errata.  The workarounds
           are implemented by the assembler rather than by GCC, although
           GCC avoids using "mflo" and "mfhi" if the VR4130 "macc",
           "macchi", "dmacc" and "dmacchi" instructions are available
           instead.

       <b>-mfix-sb1</b>
       <b>-mno-fix-sb1</b>
           Work around certain SB-1 CPU core errata.  (This flag
           currently works around the SB-1 revision 2 "F1" and "F2"
           floating-point errata.)

       <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=</b><i>setting</i>
           Specify whether GCC should insert cache barriers to avoid the
           side effects of speculation on R10K processors.

           In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the
           outcome of a conditional branch and speculatively executes
           instructions from the "taken" branch.  It later aborts these
           instructions if the predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on
           the R10K, even aborted instructions can have side effects.

           This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the
           system, kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-
           executed store may load the target memory into cache and mark
           the cache line as dirty, even if the store itself is later
           aborted.  If a DMA operation writes to the same area of
           memory before the "dirty" line is flushed, the cached data
           overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K processor manual
           for a full description, including other potential problems.

           One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before
           every memory access that might be speculatively executed and
           that might have side effects even if aborted.
           <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=</b><i>setting</i> controls GCC's implementation of
           this workaround.  It assumes that aborted accesses to any
           byte in the following regions does not have side effects:

           1.  the memory occupied by the current function's stack
               frame;

           2.  the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;

           3.  the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-
               constant address.

           It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
           accesses to these regions are indeed safe.

           If the input program contains a function declaration such as:

                   void foo (void);

           then the implementation of "foo" must allow "j foo" and "jal
           foo" to be executed speculatively.  GCC honors this
           restriction for functions it compiles itself.  It expects
           non-GCC functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do
           the same.

           The option has three forms:

           <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store</b>
               Insert a cache barrier before a load or store that might
               be speculatively executed and that might have side
               effects even if aborted.

           <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=store</b>
               Insert a cache barrier before a store that might be
               speculatively executed and that might have side effects
               even if aborted.

           <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=none</b>
               Disable the insertion of cache barriers.  This is the
               default setting.

       <b>-mflush-func=</b><i>func</i>
       <b>-mno-flush-func</b>
           Specifies the function to call to flush the I and D caches,
           or to not call any such function.  If called, the function
           must take the same arguments as the common "_flush_func",
           that is, the address of the memory range for which the cache
           is being flushed, the size of the memory range, and the
           number 3 (to flush both caches).  The default depends on the
           target GCC was configured for, but commonly is either
           "_flush_func" or "__cpu_flush".

       <b>mbranch-cost=</b><i>num</i>
           Set the cost of branches to roughly <i>num</i> "simple"
           instructions.  This cost is only a heuristic and is not
           guaranteed to produce consistent results across releases.  A
           zero cost redundantly selects the default, which is based on
           the <b>-mtune </b>setting.

       <b>-mbranch-likely</b>
       <b>-mno-branch-likely</b>
           Enable or disable use of Branch Likely instructions,
           regardless of the default for the selected architecture.  By
           default, Branch Likely instructions may be generated if they
           are supported by the selected architecture.  An exception is
           for the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures and processors that
           implement those architectures; for those, Branch Likely
           instructions are not be generated by default because the
           MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures specifically deprecate their
           use.

       <b>-mcompact-branches=never</b>
       <b>-mcompact-branches=optimal</b>
       <b>-mcompact-branches=always</b>
           These options control which form of branches will be
           generated.  The default is <b>-mcompact-branches=optimal</b>.

           The <b>-mcompact-branches=never </b>option ensures that compact
           branch instructions will never be generated.

           The <b>-mcompact-branches=always </b>option ensures that a compact
           branch instruction will be generated if available.  If a
           compact branch instruction is not available, a delay slot
           form of the branch will be used instead.

           This option is supported from MIPS Release 6 onwards.

           The <b>-mcompact-branches=optimal </b>option will cause a delay slot
           branch to be used if one is available in the current ISA and
           the delay slot is successfully filled.  If the delay slot is
           not filled, a compact branch will be chosen if one is
           available.

       <b>-mfp-exceptions</b>
       <b>-mno-fp-exceptions</b>
           Specifies whether FP exceptions are enabled.  This affects
           how FP instructions are scheduled for some processors.  The
           default is that FP exceptions are enabled.

           For instance, on the SB-1, if FP exceptions are disabled, and
           we are emitting 64-bit code, then we can use both FP pipes.
           Otherwise, we can only use one FP pipe.

       <b>-mvr4130-align</b>
       <b>-mno-vr4130-align</b>
           The VR4130 pipeline is two-way superscalar, but can only
           issue two instructions together if the first one is 8-byte
           aligned.  When this option is enabled, GCC aligns pairs of
           instructions that it thinks should execute in parallel.

           This option only has an effect when optimizing for the
           VR4130.  It normally makes code faster, but at the expense of
           making it bigger.  It is enabled by default at optimization
           level <b>-O3</b>.

       <b>-msynci</b>
       <b>-mno-synci</b>
           Enable (disable) generation of "synci" instructions on
           architectures that support it.  The "synci" instructions (if
           enabled) are generated when "__builtin___clear_cache" is
           compiled.

           This option defaults to <b>-mno-synci</b>, but the default can be
           overridden by configuring GCC with <b>--with-synci</b>.

           When compiling code for single processor systems, it is
           generally safe to use "synci".  However, on many multi-core
           (SMP) systems, it does not invalidate the instruction caches
           on all cores and may lead to undefined behavior.

       <b>-mrelax-pic-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-relax-pic-calls</b>
           Try to turn PIC calls that are normally dispatched via
           register $25 into direct calls.  This is only possible if the
           linker can resolve the destination at link time and if the
           destination is within range for a direct call.

           <b>-mrelax-pic-calls </b>is the default if GCC was configured to use
           an assembler and a linker that support the ".reloc" assembly
           directive and <b>-mexplicit-relocs </b>is in effect.  With
           <b>-mno-explicit-relocs</b>, this optimization can be performed by
           the assembler and the linker alone without help from the
           compiler.

       <b>-mmcount-ra-address</b>
       <b>-mno-mcount-ra-address</b>
           Emit (do not emit) code that allows "_mcount" to modify the
           calling function's return address.  When enabled, this option
           extends the usual "_mcount" interface with a new <i>ra-address</i>
           parameter, which has type "intptr_t *" and is passed in
           register $12.  "_mcount" can then modify the return address
           by doing both of the following:

           *   Returning the new address in register $31.

           *   Storing the new address in "*<i>ra-address"</i>, if <i>ra-address</i>
               is nonnull.

           The default is <b>-mno-mcount-ra-address</b>.

       <b>-mframe-header-opt</b>
       <b>-mno-frame-header-opt</b>
           Enable (disable) frame header optimization in the o32 ABI.
           When using the o32 ABI, calling functions will allocate 16
           bytes on the stack for the called function to write out
           register arguments.  When enabled, this optimization will
           suppress the allocation of the frame header if it can be
           determined that it is unused.

           This optimization is off by default at all optimization
           levels.

       <b>-mlxc1-sxc1</b>
       <b>-mno-lxc1-sxc1</b>
           When applicable, enable (disable) the generation of "lwxc1",
           "swxc1", "ldxc1", "sdxc1" instructions.  Enabled by default.

       <b>-mmadd4</b>
       <b>-mno-madd4</b>
           When applicable, enable (disable) the generation of 4-operand
           "madd.s", "madd.d" and related instructions.  Enabled by
           default.

       <i>MMIX Options</i>

       These options are defined for the MMIX:

       <b>-mlibfuncs</b>
       <b>-mno-libfuncs</b>
           Specify that intrinsic library functions are being compiled,
           passing all values in registers, no matter the size.

       <b>-mepsilon</b>
       <b>-mno-epsilon</b>
           Generate floating-point comparison instructions that compare
           with respect to the "rE" epsilon register.

       <b>-mabi=mmixware</b>
       <b>-mabi=gnu</b>
           Generate code that passes function parameters and return
           values that (in the called function) are seen as registers $0
           and up, as opposed to the GNU ABI which uses global registers
           $231 and up.

       <b>-mzero-extend</b>
       <b>-mno-zero-extend</b>
           When reading data from memory in sizes shorter than 64 bits,
           use (do not use) zero-extending load instructions by default,
           rather than sign-extending ones.

       <b>-mknuthdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-knuthdiv</b>
           Make the result of a division yielding a remainder have the
           same sign as the divisor.  With the default, <b>-mno-knuthdiv</b>,
           the sign of the remainder follows the sign of the dividend.
           Both methods are arithmetically valid, the latter being
           almost exclusively used.

       <b>-mtoplevel-symbols</b>
       <b>-mno-toplevel-symbols</b>
           Prepend (do not prepend) a <b>: </b>to all global symbols, so the
           assembly code can be used with the "PREFIX" assembly
           directive.

       <b>-melf</b>
           Generate an executable in the ELF format, rather than the
           default <b>mmo </b>format used by the <b>mmix </b>simulator.

       <b>-mbranch-predict</b>
       <b>-mno-branch-predict</b>
           Use (do not use) the probable-branch instructions, when
           static branch prediction indicates a probable branch.

       <b>-mbase-addresses</b>
       <b>-mno-base-addresses</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code that uses <i>base addresses</i>.
           Using a base address automatically generates a request
           (handled by the assembler and the linker) for a constant to
           be set up in a global register.  The register is used for one
           or more base address requests within the range 0 to 255 from
           the value held in the register.  The generally leads to short
           and fast code, but the number of different data items that
           can be addressed is limited.  This means that a program that
           uses lots of static data may require <b>-mno-base-addresses</b>.

       <b>-msingle-exit</b>
       <b>-mno-single-exit</b>
           Force (do not force) generated code to have a single exit
           point in each function.

       <i>MN10300 Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for Matsushita MN10300
       architectures:

       <b>-mmult-bug</b>
           Generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions for
           the MN10300 processors.  This is the default.

       <b>-mno-mult-bug</b>
           Do not generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply
           instructions for the MN10300 processors.

       <b>-mam33</b>
           Generate code using features specific to the AM33 processor.

       <b>-mno-am33</b>
           Do not generate code using features specific to the AM33
           processor.  This is the default.

       <b>-mam33-2</b>
           Generate code using features specific to the AM33/2.0
           processor.

       <b>-mam34</b>
           Generate code using features specific to the AM34 processor.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu-type</i>
           Use the timing characteristics of the indicated CPU type when
           scheduling instructions.  This does not change the targeted
           processor type.  The CPU type must be one of <b>mn10300</b>, <b>am33</b>,
           <b>am33-2 </b>or <b>am34</b>.

       <b>-mreturn-pointer-on-d0</b>
           When generating a function that returns a pointer, return the
           pointer in both "a0" and "d0".  Otherwise, the pointer is
           returned only in "a0", and attempts to call such functions
           without a prototype result in errors.  Note that this option
           is on by default; use <b>-mno-return-pointer-on-d0 </b>to disable
           it.

       <b>-mno-crt0</b>
           Do not link in the C run-time initialization object file.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Indicate to the linker that it should perform a relaxation
           optimization pass to shorten branches, calls and absolute
           memory addresses.  This option only has an effect when used
           on the command line for the final link step.

           This option makes symbolic debugging impossible.

       <b>-mliw</b>
           Allow the compiler to generate <i>Long Instruction Word</i>
           instructions if the target is the <b>AM33 </b>or later.  This is the
           default.  This option defines the preprocessor macro
           "__LIW__".

       <b>-mno-liw</b>
           Do not allow the compiler to generate <i>Long Instruction Word</i>
           instructions.  This option defines the preprocessor macro
           "__NO_LIW__".

       <b>-msetlb</b>
           Allow the compiler to generate the <i>SETLB</i> and <i>Lcc</i> instructions
           if the target is the <b>AM33 </b>or later.  This is the default.
           This option defines the preprocessor macro "__SETLB__".

       <b>-mno-setlb</b>
           Do not allow the compiler to generate <i>SETLB</i> or <i>Lcc</i>
           instructions.  This option defines the preprocessor macro
           "__NO_SETLB__".

       <i>Moxie Options</i>

       <b>-meb</b>
           Generate big-endian code.  This is the default for <b>moxie-*-*</b>
           configurations.

       <b>-mel</b>
           Generate little-endian code.

       <b>-mmul.x</b>
           Generate mul.x and umul.x instructions.  This is the default
           for <b>moxiebox-*-* </b>configurations.

       <b>-mno-crt0</b>
           Do not link in the C run-time initialization object file.

       <i>MSP430 Options</i>

       These options are defined for the MSP430:

       <b>-masm-hex</b>
           Force assembly output to always use hex constants.  Normally
           such constants are signed decimals, but this option is
           available for testsuite and/or aesthetic purposes.

       <b>-mmcu=</b>
           Select the MCU to target.  This is used to create a C
           preprocessor symbol based upon the MCU name, converted to
           upper case and pre- and post-fixed with <b>__</b>.  This in turn is
           used by the <i>msp430.h</i> header file to select an MCU-specific
           supplementary header file.

           The option also sets the ISA to use.  If the MCU name is one
           that is known to only support the 430 ISA then that is
           selected, otherwise the 430X ISA is selected.  A generic MCU
           name of <b>msp430 </b>can also be used to select the 430 ISA.
           Similarly the generic <b>msp430x </b>MCU name selects the 430X ISA.

           In addition an MCU-specific linker script is added to the
           linker command line.  The script's name is the name of the
           MCU with <i>.ld</i> appended.  Thus specifying <b>-mmcu=xxx </b>on the <b>gcc</b>
           command line defines the C preprocessor symbol "__XXX__" and
           cause the linker to search for a script called <i>xxx.ld</i>.

           This option is also passed on to the assembler.

       <b>-mwarn-mcu</b>
       <b>-mno-warn-mcu</b>
           This option enables or disables warnings about conflicts
           between the MCU name specified by the <b>-mmcu </b>option and the
           ISA set by the <b>-mcpu </b>option and/or the hardware multiply
           support set by the <b>-mhwmult </b>option.  It also toggles warnings
           about unrecognized MCU names.  This option is on by default.

       <b>-mcpu=</b>
           Specifies the ISA to use.  Accepted values are <b>msp430</b>,
           <b>msp430x </b>and <b>msp430xv2</b>.  This option is deprecated.  The
           <b>-mmcu= </b>option should be used to select the ISA.

       <b>-msim</b>
           Link to the simulator runtime libraries and linker script.
           Overrides any scripts that would be selected by the <b>-mmcu=</b>
           option.

       <b>-mlarge</b>
           Use large-model addressing (20-bit pointers, 32-bit
           "size_t").

       <b>-msmall</b>
           Use small-model addressing (16-bit pointers, 16-bit
           "size_t").

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           This option is passed to the assembler and linker, and allows
           the linker to perform certain optimizations that cannot be
           done until the final link.

       <b>mhwmult=</b>
           Describes the type of hardware multiply supported by the
           target.  Accepted values are <b>none </b>for no hardware multiply,
           <b>16bit </b>for the original 16-bit-only multiply supported by
           early MCUs.  <b>32bit </b>for the 16/32-bit multiply supported by
           later MCUs and <b>f5series </b>for the 16/32-bit multiply supported
           by F5-series MCUs.  A value of <b>auto </b>can also be given.  This
           tells GCC to deduce the hardware multiply support based upon
           the MCU name provided by the <b>-mmcu </b>option.  If no <b>-mmcu</b>
           option is specified or if the MCU name is not recognized then
           no hardware multiply support is assumed.  "auto" is the
           default setting.

           Hardware multiplies are normally performed by calling a
           library routine.  This saves space in the generated code.
           When compiling at <b>-O3 </b>or higher however the hardware
           multiplier is invoked inline.  This makes for bigger, but
           faster code.

           The hardware multiply routines disable interrupts whilst
           running and restore the previous interrupt state when they
           finish.  This makes them safe to use inside interrupt
           handlers as well as in normal code.

       <b>-minrt</b>
           Enable the use of a minimum runtime environment - no static
           initializers or constructors.  This is intended for memory-
           constrained devices.  The compiler includes special symbols
           in some objects that tell the linker and runtime which code
           fragments are required.

       <b>-mcode-region=</b>
       <b>-mdata-region=</b>
           These options tell the compiler where to place functions and
           data that do not have one of the "lower", "upper", "either"
           or "section" attributes.  Possible values are "lower",
           "upper", "either" or "any".  The first three behave like the
           corresponding attribute.  The fourth possible value - "any" -
           is the default.  It leaves placement entirely up to the
           linker script and how it assigns the standard sections
           (".text", ".data", etc) to the memory regions.

       <b>-msilicon-errata=</b>
           This option passes on a request to assembler to enable the
           fixes for the named silicon errata.

       <b>-msilicon-errata-warn=</b>
           This option passes on a request to the assembler to enable
           warning messages when a silicon errata might need to be
           applied.

       <i>NDS32 Options</i>

       These options are defined for NDS32 implementations:

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           Generate code in big-endian mode.

       <b>-misr-vector-size=</b><i>num</i>
           Specify the size of each interrupt vector, which must be 4 or
           16.

       <b>-mcache-block-size=</b><i>num</i>
           Specify the size of each cache block, which must be a power
           of 2 between 4 and 512.

       <b>-march=</b><i>arch</i>
           Specify the name of the target architecture.

       <b>-mcmodel=</b><i>code-model</i>
           Set the code model to one of

           <b>small</b>
               All the data and read-only data segments must be within
               512KB addressing space.  The text segment must be within
               16MB addressing space.

           <b>medium</b>
               The data segment must be within 512KB while the read-only
               data segment can be within 4GB addressing space.  The
               text segment should be still within 16MB addressing
               space.

           Enable constructor/destructor feature.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Guide linker to relax instructions.

       <i>Nios II Options</i>

       These are the options defined for the Altera Nios II processor.

       <b>-G </b><i>num</i>
           Put global and static objects less than or equal to <i>num</i> bytes
           into the small data or BSS sections instead of the normal
           data or BSS sections.  The default value of <i>num</i> is 8.

       <b>-mgpopt=</b><i>option</i>
       <b>-mgpopt</b>
       <b>-mno-gpopt</b>
           Generate (do not generate) GP-relative accesses.  The
           following <i>option</i> names are recognized:

           <b>none</b>
               Do not generate GP-relative accesses.

           <b>local</b>
               Generate GP-relative accesses for small data objects that
               are not external, weak, or uninitialized common symbols.
               Also use GP-relative addressing for objects that have
               been explicitly placed in a small data section via a
               "section" attribute.

           <b>global</b>
               As for <b>local</b>, but also generate GP-relative accesses for
               small data objects that are external, weak, or common.
               If you use this option, you must ensure that all parts of
               your program (including libraries) are compiled with the
               same <b>-G </b>setting.

           <b>data</b>
               Generate GP-relative accesses for all data objects in the
               program.  If you use this option, the entire data and BSS
               segments of your program must fit in 64K of memory and
               you must use an appropriate linker script to allocate
               them within the addressable range of the global pointer.

           <b>all </b>Generate GP-relative addresses for function pointers as
               well as data pointers.  If you use this option, the
               entire text, data, and BSS segments of your program must
               fit in 64K of memory and you must use an appropriate
               linker script to allocate them within the addressable
               range of the global pointer.

           <b>-mgpopt </b>is equivalent to <b>-mgpopt=local</b>, and <b>-mno-gpopt </b>is
           equivalent to <b>-mgpopt=none</b>.

           The default is <b>-mgpopt </b>except when <b>-fpic </b>or <b>-fPIC </b>is
           specified to generate position-independent code.  Note that
           the Nios II ABI does not permit GP-relative accesses from
           shared libraries.

           You may need to specify <b>-mno-gpopt </b>explicitly when building
           programs that include large amounts of small data, including
           large GOT data sections.  In this case, the 16-bit offset for
           GP-relative addressing may not be large enough to allow
           access to the entire small data section.

       <b>-mgprel-sec=</b><i>regexp</i>
           This option specifies additional section names that can be
           accessed via GP-relative addressing.  It is most useful in
           conjunction with "section" attributes on variable
           declarations and a custom linker script.  The <i>regexp</i> is a
           POSIX Extended Regular Expression.

           This option does not affect the behavior of the <b>-G </b>option,
           and the specified sections are in addition to the standard
           ".sdata" and ".sbss" small-data sections that are recognized
           by <b>-mgpopt</b>.

       <b>-mr0rel-sec=</b><i>regexp</i>
           This option specifies names of sections that can be accessed
           via a 16-bit offset from "r0"; that is, in the low 32K or
           high 32K of the 32-bit address space.  It is most useful in
           conjunction with "section" attributes on variable
           declarations and a custom linker script.  The <i>regexp</i> is a
           POSIX Extended Regular Expression.

           In contrast to the use of GP-relative addressing for small
           data, zero-based addressing is never generated by default and
           there are no conventional section names used in standard
           linker scripts for sections in the low or high areas of
           memory.

       <b>-mel</b>
       <b>-meb</b>
           Generate little-endian (default) or big-endian (experimental)
           code, respectively.

       <b>-march=</b><i>arch</i>
           This specifies the name of the target Nios II architecture.
           GCC uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it
           can emit when generating assembly code.  Permissible names
           are: <b>r1</b>, <b>r2</b>.

           The preprocessor macro "__nios2_arch__" is available to
           programs, with value 1 or 2, indicating the targeted ISA
           level.

       <b>-mbypass-cache</b>
       <b>-mno-bypass-cache</b>
           Force all load and store instructions to always bypass cache
           by using I/O variants of the instructions. The default is not
           to bypass the cache.

       <b>-mno-cache-volatile</b>
       <b>-mcache-volatile</b>
           Volatile memory access bypass the cache using the I/O
           variants of the load and store instructions. The default is
           not to bypass the cache.

       <b>-mno-fast-sw-div</b>
       <b>-mfast-sw-div</b>
           Do not use table-based fast divide for small numbers. The
           default is to use the fast divide at <b>-O3 </b>and above.

       <b>-mno-hw-mul</b>
       <b>-mhw-mul</b>
       <b>-mno-hw-mulx</b>
       <b>-mhw-mulx</b>
       <b>-mno-hw-div</b>
       <b>-mhw-div</b>
           Enable or disable emitting "mul", "mulx" and "div" family of
           instructions by the compiler. The default is to emit "mul"
           and not emit "div" and "mulx".

       <b>-mbmx</b>
       <b>-mno-bmx</b>
       <b>-mcdx</b>
       <b>-mno-cdx</b>
           Enable or disable generation of Nios II R2 BMX (bit
           manipulation) and CDX (code density) instructions.  Enabling
           these instructions also requires <b>-march=r2</b>.  Since these
           instructions are optional extensions to the R2 architecture,
           the default is not to emit them.

       <b>-mcustom-</b><i>insn</i><b>=</b><i>N</i>
       <b>-mno-custom-</b><i>insn</i>
           Each <b>-mcustom-</b><i>insn</i><b>=</b><i>N</i> option enables use of a custom
           instruction with encoding <i>N</i> when generating code that uses
           <i>insn</i>.  For example, <b>-mcustom-fadds=253 </b>generates custom
           instruction 253 for single-precision floating-point add
           operations instead of the default behavior of using a library
           call.

           The following values of <i>insn</i> are supported.  Except as
           otherwise noted, floating-point operations are expected to be
           implemented with normal IEEE 754 semantics and correspond
           directly to the C operators or the equivalent GCC built-in
           functions.

           Single-precision floating point:

           <b>fadds</b>, <b>fsubs</b>, <b>fdivs</b>, <b>fmuls</b>
               Binary arithmetic operations.

           <b>fnegs</b>
               Unary negation.

           <b>fabss</b>
               Unary absolute value.

               Comparison operations.

           <b>fmins</b>, <b>fmaxs</b>
               Floating-point minimum and maximum.  These instructions
               are only generated if <b>-ffinite-math-only </b>is specified.

           <b>fsqrts</b>
               Unary square root operation.

           <b>fcoss</b>, <b>fsins</b>, <b>ftans</b>, <b>fatans</b>, <b>fexps</b>, <b>flogs</b>
               Floating-point trigonometric and exponential functions.
               These instructions are only generated if
               <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>is also specified.

           Double-precision floating point:

           <b>faddd</b>, <b>fsubd</b>, <b>fdivd</b>, <b>fmuld</b>
               Binary arithmetic operations.

           <b>fnegd</b>
               Unary negation.

           <b>fabsd</b>
               Unary absolute value.

           <b>fcmpeqd</b>, <b>fcmpged</b>, <b>fcmpgtd</b>, <b>fcmpled</b>, <b>fcmpltd</b>, <b>fcmpned</b>
               Comparison operations.

           <b>fmind</b>, <b>fmaxd</b>
               Double-precision minimum and maximum.  These instructions
               are only generated if <b>-ffinite-math-only </b>is specified.

           <b>fsqrtd</b>
               Unary square root operation.

           <b>fcosd</b>, <b>fsind</b>, <b>ftand</b>, <b>fatand</b>, <b>fexpd</b>, <b>flogd</b>
               Double-precision trigonometric and exponential functions.
               These instructions are only generated if
               <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>is also specified.

           Conversions:

           <b>fextsd</b>
               Conversion from single precision to double precision.

           <b>ftruncds</b>
               Conversion from double precision to single precision.

           <b>fixsi</b>, <b>fixsu</b>, <b>fixdi</b>, <b>fixdu</b>
               Conversion from floating point to signed or unsigned
               integer types, with truncation towards zero.

           <b>round</b>
               Conversion from single-precision floating point to signed
               integer, rounding to the nearest integer and ties away
               from zero.  This corresponds to the "__builtin_lroundf"
               function when <b>-fno-math-errno </b>is used.

           <b>floatis</b>, <b>floatus</b>, <b>floatid</b>, <b>floatud</b>
               Conversion from signed or unsigned integer types to
               floating-point types.

           In addition, all of the following transfer instructions for
           internal registers X and Y must be provided to use any of the
           double-precision floating-point instructions.  Custom
           instructions taking two double-precision source operands
           expect the first operand in the 64-bit register X.  The other
           operand (or only operand of a unary operation) is given to
           the custom arithmetic instruction with the least significant
           half in source register <i>src1</i> and the most significant half in
           <i>src2</i>.  A custom instruction that returns a double-precision
           result returns the most significant 32 bits in the
           destination register and the other half in 32-bit register Y.
           GCC automatically generates the necessary code sequences to
           write register X and/or read register Y when double-precision
           floating-point instructions are used.

           <b>fwrx</b>
               Write <i>src1</i> into the least significant half of X and <i>src2</i>
               into the most significant half of X.

           <b>fwry</b>
               Write <i>src1</i> into Y.

           <b>frdxhi</b>, <b>frdxlo</b>
               Read the most or least (respectively) significant half of
               X and store it in <i>dest</i>.

           <b>frdy</b>
               Read the value of Y and store it into <i>dest</i>.

           Note that you can gain more local control over generation of
           Nios II custom instructions by using the
           "target("custom-<i>insn=N")"</i> and "target("no-custom-<i>insn")"</i>
           function attributes or pragmas.

       <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=</b><i>name</i>
           This option enables a predefined, named set of custom
           instruction encodings (see <b>-mcustom-</b><i>insn</i> above).  Currently,
           the following sets are defined:

           <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=60-1 </b>is equivalent to: <b>-mcustom-fmuls=252</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fadds=253 -mcustom-fsubs=254</b>
           <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b>

           <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=60-2 </b>is equivalent to: <b>-mcustom-fmuls=252</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fadds=253 -mcustom-fsubs=254 -mcustom-fdivs=255</b>
           <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b>

           <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=72-3 </b>is equivalent to: <b>-mcustom-floatus=243</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fixsi=244 -mcustom-floatis=245 -mcustom-fcmpgts=246</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fcmples=249 -mcustom-fcmpeqs=250</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fcmpnes=251 -mcustom-fmuls=252 -mcustom-fadds=253</b>
           <b>-mcustom-fsubs=254 -mcustom-fdivs=255</b>
           <b>-fsingle-precision-constant</b>

           Custom instruction assignments given by individual
           <b>-mcustom-</b><i>insn</i><b>= </b>options override those given by
           <b>-mcustom-fpu-cfg=</b>, regardless of the order of the options on
           the command line.

           Note that you can gain more local control over selection of a
           FPU configuration by using the
           "target("custom-fpu-cfg=<i>name")"</i> function attribute or pragma.

       These additional <b>-m </b>options are available for the Altera Nios II
       ELF (bare-metal) target:

       <b>-mhal</b>
           Link with HAL BSP.  This suppresses linking with the GCC-
           provided C runtime startup and termination code, and is
           typically used in conjunction with <b>-msys-crt0= </b>to specify the
           location of the alternate startup code provided by the HAL
           BSP.

       <b>-msmallc</b>
           Link with a limited version of the C library, <b>-lsmallc</b>,
           rather than Newlib.

       <b>-msys-crt0=</b><i>startfile</i>
           <i>startfile</i> is the file name of the startfile (crt0) to use
           when linking.  This option is only useful in conjunction with
           <b>-mhal</b>.

       <b>-msys-lib=</b><i>systemlib</i>
           <i>systemlib</i> is the library name of the library that provides
           low-level system calls required by the C library, e.g. "read"
           and "write".  This option is typically used to link with a
           library provided by a HAL BSP.

       <i>Nvidia PTX Options</i>

       These options are defined for Nvidia PTX:

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
           Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit ABI.

       <b>-misa=</b><i>ISA-string</i>
           Generate code for given the specified PTX ISA (e.g. <b>sm_35</b>).
           ISA strings must be lower-case.  Valid ISA strings include
           <b>sm_30 </b>and <b>sm_35</b>.  The default ISA is sm_30.

       <b>-mmainkernel</b>
           Link in code for a __main kernel.  This is for stand-alone
           instead of offloading execution.

       <b>-moptimize</b>
           Apply partitioned execution optimizations.  This is the
           default when any level of optimization is selected.

       <b>-msoft-stack</b>
           Generate code that does not use ".local" memory directly for
           stack storage. Instead, a per-warp stack pointer is
           maintained explicitly. This enables variable-length stack
           allocation (with variable-length arrays or "alloca"), and
           when global memory is used for underlying storage, makes it
           possible to access automatic variables from other threads, or
           with atomic instructions. This code generation variant is
           used for OpenMP offloading, but the option is exposed on its
           own for the purpose of testing the compiler; to generate code
           suitable for linking into programs using OpenMP offloading,
           use option <b>-mgomp</b>.

       <b>-muniform-simt</b>
           Switch to code generation variant that allows to execute all
           threads in each warp, while maintaining memory state and side
           effects as if only one thread in each warp was active outside
           of OpenMP SIMD regions.  All atomic operations and calls to
           runtime (malloc, free, vprintf) are conditionally executed
           (iff current lane index equals the master lane index), and
           the register being assigned is copied via a shuffle
           instruction from the master lane.  Outside of SIMD regions
           lane 0 is the master; inside, each thread sees itself as the
           master.  Shared memory array "int __nvptx_uni[]" stores all-
           zeros or all-ones bitmasks for each warp, indicating current
           mode (0 outside of SIMD regions).  Each thread can bitwise-
           and the bitmask at position "tid.y" with current lane index
           to compute the master lane index.

       <b>-mgomp</b>
           Generate code for use in OpenMP offloading: enables
           <b>-msoft-stack </b>and <b>-muniform-simt </b>options, and selects
           corresponding multilib variant.

       <i>OpenRISC Options</i>

       These options are defined for OpenRISC:

       <b>-mboard=</b><i>name</i>
           Configure a board specific runtime.  This will be passed to
           the linker for newlib board library linking.  The default is
           "or1ksim".

       <b>-mnewlib</b>
           For compatibility, it's always newlib for elf now.

       <b>-mhard-div</b>
           Generate code for hardware which supports divide
           instructions.  This is the default.

       <b>-mhard-mul</b>
           Generate code for hardware which supports multiply
           instructions.  This is the default.

       <b>-mcmov</b>
           Generate code for hardware which supports the conditional
           move ("l.cmov") instruction.

       <b>-mror</b>
           Generate code for hardware which supports rotate right
           instructions.

       <b>-msext</b>
           Generate code for hardware which supports sign-extension
           instructions.

       <b>-msfimm</b>
           Generate code for hardware which supports set flag immediate
           ("l.sf*i") instructions.

       <b>-mshftimm</b>
           Generate code for hardware which supports shift immediate
           related instructions (i.e. "l.srai", "l.srli", "l.slli",
           "1.rori").  Note, to enable generation of the "l.rori"
           instruction the <b>-mror </b>flag must also be specified.

       <b>-msoft-div</b>
           Generate code for hardware which requires divide instruction
           emulation.

       <b>-msoft-mul</b>
           Generate code for hardware which requires multiply
           instruction emulation.

       <i>PDP-11 Options</i>

       These options are defined for the PDP-11:

       <b>-mfpu</b>
           Use hardware FPP floating point.  This is the default.  (FIS
           floating point on the PDP-11/40 is not supported.)  Implies
           -m45.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Do not use hardware floating point.

       <b>-mac0</b>
           Return floating-point results in ac0 (fr0 in Unix assembler
           syntax).

       <b>-mno-ac0</b>
           Return floating-point results in memory.  This is the
           default.

       <b>-m40</b>
           Generate code for a PDP-11/40.  Implies -msoft-float
           -mno-split.

       <b>-m45</b>
           Generate code for a PDP-11/45.  This is the default.

       <b>-m10</b>
           Generate code for a PDP-11/10.  Implies -msoft-float
           -mno-split.

       <b>-mint16</b>
       <b>-mno-int32</b>
           Use 16-bit "int".  This is the default.

       <b>-mint32</b>
       <b>-mno-int16</b>
           Use 32-bit "int".

       <b>-msplit</b>
           Target has split instruction and data space.  Implies -m45.

       <b>-munix-asm</b>
           Use Unix assembler syntax.

       <b>-mdec-asm</b>
           Use DEC assembler syntax.

       <b>-mgnu-asm</b>
           Use GNU assembler syntax.  This is the default.

       <b>-mlra</b>
           Use the new LRA register allocator.  By default, the old
           "reload" allocator is used.

       <i>picoChip Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for picoChip implementations:

       <b>-mae=</b><i>ae_type</i>
           Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction
           scheduling parameters for array element type <i>ae_type</i>.
           Supported values for <i>ae_type</i> are <b>ANY</b>, <b>MUL</b>, and <b>MAC</b>.

           <b>-mae=ANY </b>selects a completely generic AE type.  Code
           generated with this option runs on any of the other AE types.
           The code is not as efficient as it would be if compiled for a
           specific AE type, and some types of operation (e.g.,
           multiplication) do not work properly on all types of AE.

           <b>-mae=MUL </b>selects a MUL AE type.  This is the most useful AE
           type for compiled code, and is the default.

           <b>-mae=MAC </b>selects a DSP-style MAC AE.  Code compiled with this
           option may suffer from poor performance of byte (char)
           manipulation, since the DSP AE does not provide hardware
           support for byte load/stores.

       <b>-msymbol-as-address</b>
           Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an
           address in a load/store instruction, without first loading it
           into a register.  Typically, the use of this option generates
           larger programs, which run faster than when the option isn't
           used.  However, the results vary from program to program, so
           it is left as a user option, rather than being permanently
           enabled.

       <b>-mno-inefficient-warnings</b>
           Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.
           These warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling
           code that performs byte-level memory operations on the MAC AE
           type.  The MAC AE has no hardware support for byte-level
           memory operations, so all byte load/stores must be
           synthesized from word load/store operations.  This is
           inefficient and a warning is generated to indicate that you
           should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to
           target an AE type that has the necessary hardware support.
           This option disables these warnings.

       <i>PowerPC Options</i>

       These are listed under

       <i>RISC-V Options</i>

       These command-line options are defined for RISC-V targets:

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><i>n</i>
           Set the cost of branches to roughly <i>n</i> instructions.

       <b>-mplt</b>
       <b>-mno-plt</b>
           When generating PIC code, do or don't allow the use of PLTs.
           Ignored for non-PIC.  The default is <b>-mplt</b>.

       <b>-mabi=</b><i>ABI-string</i>
           Specify integer and floating-point calling convention.  <i>ABI-</i>
           <i>string</i> contains two parts: the size of integer types and the
           registers used for floating-point types.  For example
           <b>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64d </b>means that <b>long </b>and pointers are
           64-bit (implicitly defining <b>int </b>to be 32-bit), and that
           floating-point values up to 64 bits wide are passed in F
           registers.  Contrast this with <b>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64f</b>,
           which still allows the compiler to generate code that uses
           the F and D extensions but only allows floating-point values
           up to 32 bits long to be passed in registers; or
           <b>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64</b>, in which no floating-point
           arguments will be passed in registers.

           The default for this argument is system dependent, users who
           want a specific calling convention should specify one
           explicitly.  The valid calling conventions are: <b>ilp32</b>,
           <b>ilp32f</b>, <b>ilp32d</b>, <b>lp64</b>, <b>lp64f</b>, and <b>lp64d</b>.  Some calling
           conventions are impossible to implement on some ISAs: for
           example, <b>-march=rv32if -mabi=ilp32d </b>is invalid because the
           ABI requires 64-bit values be passed in F registers, but F
           registers are only 32 bits wide.  There is also the <b>ilp32e</b>
           ABI that can only be used with the <b>rv32e </b>architecture.  This
           ABI is not well specified at present, and is subject to
           change.

       <b>-mfdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-fdiv</b>
           Do or don't use hardware floating-point divide and square
           root instructions.  This requires the F or D extensions for
           floating-point registers.  The default is to use them if the
           specified architecture has these instructions.

       <b>-mdiv</b>
       <b>-mno-div</b>
           Do or don't use hardware instructions for integer division.
           This requires the M extension.  The default is to use them if
           the specified architecture has these instructions.

       <b>-march=</b><i>ISA-string</i>
           Generate code for given RISC-V ISA (e.g. <b>rv64im</b>).  ISA
           strings must be lower-case.  Examples include <b>rv64i</b>, <b>rv32g</b>,
           <b>rv32e</b>, and <b>rv32imaf</b>.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>processor-string</i>
           Optimize the output for the given processor, specified by
           microarchitecture name.  Permissible values for this option
           are: <b>rocket</b>, <b>sifive-3-series</b>, <b>sifive-5-series</b>,
           <b>sifive-7-series</b>, and <b>size</b>.

           When <b>-mtune= </b>is not specified, the default is <b>rocket</b>.

           The <b>size </b>choice is not intended for use by end-users.  This
           is used when <b>-Os </b>is specified.  It overrides the instruction
           cost info provided by <b>-mtune=</b>, but does not override the
           pipeline info.  This helps reduce code size while still
           giving good performance.

       <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</b><i>num</i>
           Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to
           <i>num</i> byte boundary.  If <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary </b>is not
           specified, the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128-bits).

           <b>Warning: </b>If you use this switch, then you must build all
           modules with the same value, including any libraries.  This
           includes the system libraries and startup modules.

       <b>-msmall-data-limit=</b><i>n</i>
           Put global and static data smaller than <i>n</i> bytes into a
           special section (on some targets).

       <b>-msave-restore</b>
       <b>-mno-save-restore</b>
           Do or don't use smaller but slower prologue and epilogue code
           that uses library function calls.  The default is to use fast
           inline prologues and epilogues.

       <b>-mstrict-align</b>
       <b>-mno-strict-align</b>
           Do not or do generate unaligned memory accesses.  The default
           is set depending on whether the processor we are optimizing
           for supports fast unaligned access or not.

       <b>-mcmodel=medlow</b>
           Generate code for the medium-low code model. The program and
           its statically defined symbols must lie within a single 2 GiB
           address range and must lie between absolute addresses -2 GiB
           and +2 GiB. Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.
           This is the default code model.

       <b>-mcmodel=medany</b>
           Generate code for the medium-any code model. The program and
           its statically defined symbols must be within any single 2
           GiB address range. Programs can be statically or dynamically
           linked.

       <b>-mexplicit-relocs</b>
       <b>-mno-exlicit-relocs</b>
           Use or do not use assembler relocation operators when dealing
           with symbolic addresses.  The alternative is to use assembler
           macros instead, which may limit optimization.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
       <b>-mno-relax</b>
           Take advantage of linker relaxations to reduce the number of
           instructions required to materialize symbol addresses. The
           default is to take advantage of linker relaxations.

       <b>-memit-attribute</b>
       <b>-mno-emit-attribute</b>
           Emit (do not emit) RISC-V attribute to record extra
           information into ELF objects.  This feature requires at least
           binutils 2.32.

       <i>RL78 Options</i>

       <b>-msim</b>
           Links in additional target libraries to support operation
           within a simulator.

       <b>-mmul=none</b>
       <b>-mmul=g10</b>
       <b>-mmul=g13</b>
       <b>-mmul=g14</b>
       <b>-mmul=rl78</b>
           Specifies the type of hardware multiplication and division
           support to be used.  The simplest is "none", which uses
           software for both multiplication and division.  This is the
           default.  The "g13" value is for the hardware multiply/divide
           peripheral found on the RL78/G13 (S2 core) targets.  The
           "g14" value selects the use of the multiplication and
           division instructions supported by the RL78/G14 (S3 core)
           parts.  The value "rl78" is an alias for "g14" and the value
           "mg10" is an alias for "none".

           In addition a C preprocessor macro is defined, based upon the
           setting of this option.  Possible values are:
           "__RL78_MUL_NONE__", "__RL78_MUL_G13__" or
           "__RL78_MUL_G14__".

       <b>-mcpu=g10</b>
       <b>-mcpu=g13</b>
       <b>-mcpu=g14</b>
       <b>-mcpu=rl78</b>
           Specifies the RL78 core to target.  The default is the G14
           core, also known as an S3 core or just RL78.  The G13 or S2
           core does not have multiply or divide instructions, instead
           it uses a hardware peripheral for these operations.  The G10
           or S1 core does not have register banks, so it uses a
           different calling convention.

           If this option is set it also selects the type of hardware
           multiply support to use, unless this is overridden by an
           explicit <b>-mmul=none </b>option on the command line.  Thus
           specifying <b>-mcpu=g13 </b>enables the use of the G13 hardware
           multiply peripheral and specifying <b>-mcpu=g10 </b>disables the use
           of hardware multiplications altogether.

           Note, although the RL78/G14 core is the default target,
           specifying <b>-mcpu=g14 </b>or <b>-mcpu=rl78 </b>on the command line does
           change the behavior of the toolchain since it also enables
           G14 hardware multiply support.  If these options are not
           specified on the command line then software multiplication
           routines will be used even though the code targets the RL78
           core.  This is for backwards compatibility with older
           toolchains which did not have hardware multiply and divide
           support.

           In addition a C preprocessor macro is defined, based upon the
           setting of this option.  Possible values are: "__RL78_G10__",
           "__RL78_G13__" or "__RL78_G14__".

       <b>-mg10</b>
       <b>-mg13</b>
       <b>-mg14</b>
       <b>-mrl78</b>
           These are aliases for the corresponding <b>-mcpu= </b>option.  They
           are provided for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-mallregs</b>
           Allow the compiler to use all of the available registers.  By
           default registers "r24..r31" are reserved for use in
           interrupt handlers.  With this option enabled these registers
           can be used in ordinary functions as well.

       <b>-m64bit-doubles</b>
       <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>
           Make the "double" data type be 64 bits (<b>-m64bit-doubles</b>) or
           32 bits (<b>-m32bit-doubles</b>) in size.  The default is
           <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>.

       <b>-msave-mduc-in-interrupts</b>
       <b>-mno-save-mduc-in-interrupts</b>
           Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve
           the MDUC registers.  This is only necessary if normal code
           might use the MDUC registers, for example because it performs
           multiplication and division operations.  The default is to
           ignore the MDUC registers as this makes the interrupt
           handlers faster.  The target option -mg13 needs to be passed
           for this to work as this feature is only available on the G13
           target (S2 core).  The MDUC registers will only be saved if
           the interrupt handler performs a multiplication or division
           operation or it calls another function.

       <i>IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:

       <b>-mpowerpc-gpopt</b>
       <b>-mno-powerpc-gpopt</b>
       <b>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</b>
       <b>-mno-powerpc-gfxopt</b>

       <b>-mno-cmpb</b>
       <b>-mmfpgpr</b>
       <b>-mno-mfpgpr</b>
       <b>-mhard-dfp</b>
       <b>-mno-hard-dfp</b>
           You use these options to specify which instructions are
           available on the processor you are using.  The default value
           of these options is determined when configuring GCC.
           Specifying the <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i> overrides the specification of
           these options.  We recommend you use the <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
           option rather than the options listed above.

           Specifying <b>-mpowerpc-gpopt </b>allows GCC to use the optional
           PowerPC architecture instructions in the General Purpose
           group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
           <b>-mpowerpc-gfxopt </b>allows GCC to use the optional PowerPC
           architecture instructions in the Graphics group, including
           floating-point select.

           The <b>-mmfcrf </b>option allows GCC to generate the move from
           condition register field instruction implemented on the
           POWER4 processor and other processors that support the
           PowerPC V2.01 architecture.  The <b>-mpopcntb </b>option allows GCC
           to generate the popcount and double-precision FP reciprocal
           estimate instruction implemented on the POWER5 processor and
           other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02 architecture.
           The <b>-mpopcntd </b>option allows GCC to generate the popcount
           instruction implemented on the POWER7 processor and other
           processors that support the PowerPC V2.06 architecture.  The
           <b>-mfprnd </b>option allows GCC to generate the FP round to integer
           instructions implemented on the POWER5+ processor and other
           processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.  The
           <b>-mcmpb </b>option allows GCC to generate the compare bytes
           instruction implemented on the POWER6 processor and other
           processors that support the PowerPC V2.05 architecture.  The
           <b>-mmfpgpr </b>option allows GCC to generate the FP move to/from
           general-purpose register instructions implemented on the
           POWER6X processor and other processors that support the
           extended PowerPC V2.05 architecture.  The <b>-mhard-dfp </b>option
           allows GCC to generate the decimal floating-point
           instructions implemented on some POWER processors.

           The <b>-mpowerpc64 </b>option allows GCC to generate the additional
           64-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64
           architecture and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword
           quantities.  GCC defaults to <b>-mno-powerpc64</b>.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
           Set architecture type, register usage, and instruction
           scheduling parameters for machine type <i>cpu_type</i>.  Supported
           values for <i>cpu_type</i> are <b>401</b>, <b>403</b>, <b>405</b>, <b>405fp</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>440fp</b>,
           <b>464</b>, <b>464fp</b>, <b>476</b>, <b>476fp</b>, <b>505</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>602</b>, <b>603</b>, <b>603e</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>604e</b>,
           <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, <b>740</b>, <b>7400</b>, <b>7450</b>, <b>750</b>, <b>801</b>, <b>821</b>, <b>823</b>, <b>860</b>, <b>970</b>,
           <b>8540</b>, <b>a2</b>, <b>e300c2</b>, <b>e300c3</b>, <b>e500mc</b>, <b>e500mc64</b>, <b>e5500</b>, <b>e6500</b>,
           <b>ec603e</b>, <b>G3</b>, <b>G4</b>, <b>G5</b>, <b>titan</b>, <b>power3</b>, <b>power4</b>, <b>power5</b>, <b>power5+</b>,
           <b>power6</b>, <b>power6x</b>, <b>power7</b>, <b>power8</b>, <b>power9</b>, <b>powerpc</b>, <b>powerpc64</b>,
           <b>powerpc64le</b>, <b>rs64</b>, and <b>native</b>.

           <b>-mcpu=powerpc</b>, <b>-mcpu=powerpc64</b>, and <b>-mcpu=powerpc64le </b>specify
           pure 32-bit PowerPC (either endian), 64-bit big endian
           PowerPC and 64-bit little endian PowerPC architecture machine
           types, with an appropriate, generic processor model assumed
           for scheduling purposes.

           Specifying <b>native </b>as cpu type detects and selects the
           architecture option that corresponds to the host processor of
           the system performing the compilation.  <b>-mcpu=native </b>has no
           effect if GCC does not recognize the processor.

           The other options specify a specific processor.  Code
           generated under those options runs best on that processor,
           and may not run at all on others.

           The <b>-mcpu </b>options automatically enable or disable the
           following options:

           <b>-maltivec  -mfprnd  -mhard-float  -mmfcrf  -mmultiple</b>
           <b>-mpopcntb  -mpopcntd  -mpowerpc64 -mpowerpc-gpopt</b>
           <b>-mpowerpc-gfxopt -mmulhw  -mdlmzb  -mmfpgpr  -mvsx -mcrypto</b>
           <b>-mhtm  -mpower8-fusion  -mpower8-vector -mquad-memory</b>
           <b>-mquad-memory-atomic  -mfloat128  -mfloat128-hardware</b>

           The particular options set for any particular CPU varies
           between compiler versions, depending on what setting seems to
           produce optimal code for that CPU; it doesn't necessarily
           reflect the actual hardware's capabilities.  If you wish to
           set an individual option to a particular value, you may
           specify it after the <b>-mcpu </b>option, like <b>-mcpu=970</b>
           <b>-mno-altivec</b>.

           On AIX, the <b>-maltivec </b>and <b>-mpowerpc64 </b>options are not enabled
           or disabled by the <b>-mcpu </b>option at present because AIX does
           not have full support for these options.  You may still
           enable or disable them individually if you're sure it'll work
           in your environment.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
           Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
           <i>cpu_type</i>, but do not set the architecture type or register
           usage, as <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i> does.  The same values for <i>cpu_type</i>
           are used for <b>-mtune </b>as for <b>-mcpu</b>.  If both are specified, the
           code generated uses the architecture and registers set by
           <b>-mcpu</b>, but the scheduling parameters set by <b>-mtune</b>.

       <b>-mcmodel=small</b>
           Generate PowerPC64 code for the small model: The TOC is
           limited to 64k.

       <b>-mcmodel=medium</b>
           Generate PowerPC64 code for the medium model: The TOC and
           other static data may be up to a total of 4G in size.  This
           is the default for 64-bit Linux.

       <b>-mcmodel=large</b>
           Generate PowerPC64 code for the large model: The TOC may be
           up to 4G in size.  Other data and code is only limited by the
           64-bit address space.

       <b>-maltivec</b>
       <b>-mno-altivec</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) AltiVec instructions,
           and also enable the use of built-in functions that allow more
           direct access to the AltiVec instruction set.  You may also
           need to set <b>-mabi=altivec </b>to adjust the current ABI with
           AltiVec ABI enhancements.

           When <b>-maltivec </b>is used, the element order for AltiVec
           intrinsics such as "vec_splat", "vec_extract", and
           "vec_insert" match array element order corresponding to the
           endianness of the target.  That is, element zero identifies
           the leftmost element in a vector register when targeting a
           big-endian platform, and identifies the rightmost element in
           a vector register when targeting a little-endian platform.

       <b>-mvrsave</b>
       <b>-mno-vrsave</b>
           Generate VRSAVE instructions when generating AltiVec code.

       <b>-msecure-plt</b>
           Generate code that allows <b>ld </b>and <b>ld.so </b>to build executables
           and shared libraries with non-executable ".plt" and ".got"
           sections.  This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI option.

       <b>-mbss-plt</b>
           Generate code that uses a BSS ".plt" section that <b>ld.so </b>fills
           in, and requires ".plt" and ".got" sections that are both
           writable and executable.  This is a PowerPC 32-bit SYSV ABI
           option.

       <b>-misel</b>
       <b>-mno-isel</b>
           This switch enables or disables the generation of ISEL
           instructions.

       <b>-mvsx</b>
       <b>-mno-vsx</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) vector/scalar (VSX)
           instructions, and also enable the use of built-in functions
           that allow more direct access to the VSX instruction set.

       <b>-mcrypto</b>
       <b>-mno-crypto</b>
           Enable the use (disable) of the built-in functions that allow
           direct access to the cryptographic instructions that were
           added in version 2.07 of the PowerPC ISA.

       <b>-mhtm</b>
       <b>-mno-htm</b>
           Enable (disable) the use of the built-in functions that allow
           direct access to the Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM)
           instructions that were added in version 2.07 of the PowerPC
           ISA.

       <b>-mpower8-fusion</b>
       <b>-mno-power8-fusion</b>
           Generate code that keeps (does not keeps) some integer
           operations adjacent so that the instructions can be fused
           together on power8 and later processors.

       <b>-mpower8-vector</b>
       <b>-mno-power8-vector</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the vector and scalar
           instructions that were added in version 2.07 of the PowerPC
           ISA.  Also enable the use of built-in functions that allow
           more direct access to the vector instructions.

       <b>-mquad-memory</b>
       <b>-mno-quad-memory</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the non-atomic quad
           word memory instructions.  The <b>-mquad-memory </b>option requires
           use of 64-bit mode.

       <b>-mquad-memory-atomic</b>
       <b>-mno-quad-memory-atomic</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the atomic quad word
           memory instructions.  The <b>-mquad-memory-atomic </b>option
           requires use of 64-bit mode.

       <b>-mfloat128</b>
       <b>-mno-float128</b>
           Enable/disable the <i>__float128</i> keyword for IEEE 128-bit
           floating point and use either software emulation for IEEE
           128-bit floating point or hardware instructions.

           The VSX instruction set (<b>-mvsx</b>, <b>-mcpu=power7</b>, <b>-mcpu=power8</b>),
           or <b>-mcpu=power9 </b>must be enabled to use the IEEE 128-bit
           floating point support.  The IEEE 128-bit floating point
           support only works on PowerPC Linux systems.

           The default for <b>-mfloat128 </b>is enabled on PowerPC Linux
           systems using the VSX instruction set, and disabled on other
           systems.

           If you use the ISA 3.0 instruction set (<b>-mpower9-vector </b>or
           <b>-mcpu=power9</b>) on a 64-bit system, the IEEE 128-bit floating
           point support will also enable the generation of ISA 3.0 IEEE
           128-bit floating point instructions.  Otherwise, if you do
           not specify to generate ISA 3.0 instructions or you are
           targeting a 32-bit big endian system, IEEE 128-bit floating
           point will be done with software emulation.

       <b>-mfloat128-hardware</b>
       <b>-mno-float128-hardware</b>
           Enable/disable using ISA 3.0 hardware instructions to support
           the <i>__float128</i> data type.

           The default for <b>-mfloat128-hardware </b>is enabled on PowerPC
           Linux systems using the ISA 3.0 instruction set, and disabled
           on other systems.

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
           Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin and
           SVR4 targets (including GNU/Linux).  The 32-bit environment
           sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and generates code that
           runs on any PowerPC variant.  The 64-bit environment sets int
           to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits, and generates
           code for PowerPC64, as for <b>-mpowerpc64</b>.

       <b>-mfull-toc</b>
       <b>-mno-fp-in-toc</b>
       <b>-mno-sum-in-toc</b>
       <b>-mminimal-toc</b>
           Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is
           created for every executable file.  The <b>-mfull-toc </b>option is
           selected by default.  In that case, GCC allocates at least
           one TOC entry for each unique non-automatic variable
           reference in your program.  GCC also places floating-point
           constants in the TOC.  However, only 16,384 entries are
           available in the TOC.

           If you receive a linker error message that saying you have
           overflowed the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount
           of TOC space used with the <b>-mno-fp-in-toc </b>and <b>-mno-sum-in-toc</b>
           options.  <b>-mno-fp-in-toc </b>prevents GCC from putting floating-
           point constants in the TOC and <b>-mno-sum-in-toc </b>forces GCC to
           generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a
           constant at run time instead of putting that sum into the
           TOC.  You may specify one or both of these options.  Each
           causes GCC to produce very slightly slower and larger code at
           the expense of conserving TOC space.

           If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you
           specify both of these options, specify <b>-mminimal-toc </b>instead.
           This option causes GCC to make only one TOC entry for every
           file.  When you specify this option, GCC produces code that
           is slower and larger but which uses extremely little TOC
           space.  You may wish to use this option only on files that
           contain less frequently-executed code.

       <b>-maix64</b>
       <b>-maix32</b>
           Enable 64-bit AIX ABI and calling convention: 64-bit
           pointers, 64-bit "long" type, and the infrastructure needed
           to support them.  Specifying <b>-maix64 </b>implies <b>-mpowerpc64</b>,
           while <b>-maix32 </b>disables the 64-bit ABI and implies
           <b>-mno-powerpc64</b>.  GCC defaults to <b>-maix32</b>.

       <b>-mxl-compat</b>
       <b>-mno-xl-compat</b>
           Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XL compiler
           semantics when using AIX-compatible ABI.  Pass floating-point
           arguments to prototyped functions beyond the register save
           area (RSA) on the stack in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not
           assume that most significant double in 128-bit long double
           value is properly rounded when comparing values and
           converting to double.  Use XL symbol names for long double
           support routines.

           The AIX calling convention was extended but not initially
           documented to handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of calling a
           function that takes the address of its arguments with fewer
           arguments than declared.  IBM XL compilers access floating-
           point arguments that do not fit in the RSA from the stack
           when a subroutine is compiled without optimization.  Because
           always storing floating-point arguments on the stack is
           inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by
           default and only is necessary when calling subroutines
           compiled by IBM XL compilers without optimization.

       <b>-mpe</b>
           Support <i>IBM RS/6000 SP Parallel Environment</i> (PE).  Link an
           application written to use message passing with special
           startup code to enable the application to run.  The system
           must have PE installed in the standard location
           (<i>/usr/lpp/ppe.poe/</i>), or the <i>specs</i> file must be overridden
           with the <b>-specs= </b>option to specify the appropriate directory
           location.  The Parallel Environment does not support threads,
           so the <b>-mpe </b>option and the <b>-pthread </b>option are incompatible.

       <b>-malign-natural</b>
       <b>-malign-power</b>
           On AIX, 32-bit Darwin, and 64-bit PowerPC GNU/Linux, the
           option <b>-malign-natural </b>overrides the ABI-defined alignment of
           larger types, such as floating-point doubles, on their
           natural size-based boundary.  The option <b>-malign-power</b>
           instructs GCC to follow the ABI-specified alignment rules.
           GCC defaults to the standard alignment defined in the ABI.

           On 64-bit Darwin, natural alignment is the default, and
           <b>-malign-power </b>is not supported.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate code that does not use (uses) the floating-point
           register set.  Software floating-point emulation is provided
           if you use the <b>-msoft-float </b>option, and pass the option to
           GCC when linking.

       <b>-mmultiple</b>
       <b>-mno-multiple</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the load multiple word
           instructions and the store multiple word instructions.  These
           instructions are generated by default on POWER systems, and
           not generated on PowerPC systems.  Do not use <b>-mmultiple </b>on
           little-endian PowerPC systems, since those instructions do
           not work when the processor is in little-endian mode.  The
           exceptions are PPC740 and PPC750 which permit these
           instructions in little-endian mode.

       <b>-mupdate</b>
       <b>-mno-update</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store
           instructions that update the base register to the address of
           the calculated memory location.  These instructions are
           generated by default.  If you use <b>-mno-update</b>, there is a
           small window between the time that the stack pointer is
           updated and the address of the previous frame is stored,
           which means code that walks the stack frame across interrupts
           or signals may get corrupted data.

       <b>-mavoid-indexed-addresses</b>
       <b>-mno-avoid-indexed-addresses</b>
           Generate code that tries to avoid (not avoid) the use of
           indexed load or store instructions. These instructions can
           incur a performance penalty on Power6 processors in certain
           situations, such as when stepping through large arrays that
           cross a 16M boundary.  This option is enabled by default when
           targeting Power6 and disabled otherwise.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
           multiply and accumulate instructions.  These instructions are
           generated by default if hardware floating point is used.  The
           machine-dependent <b>-mfused-madd </b>option is now mapped to the
           machine-independent <b>-ffp-contract=fast </b>option, and
           <b>-mno-fused-madd </b>is mapped to <b>-ffp-contract=off</b>.

       <b>-mmulhw</b>
       <b>-mno-mulhw</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the half-word multiply
           and multiply-accumulate instructions on the IBM 405, 440, 464
           and 476 processors.  These instructions are generated by
           default when targeting those processors.

       <b>-mdlmzb</b>
       <b>-mno-dlmzb</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the string-search
           <b>dlmzb </b>instruction on the IBM 405, 440, 464 and 476
           processors.  This instruction is generated by default when
           targeting those processors.

       <b>-mno-bit-align</b>
       <b>-mbit-align</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) force
           structures and unions that contain bit-fields to be aligned
           to the base type of the bit-field.

           For example, by default a structure containing nothing but 8
           "unsigned" bit-fields of length 1 is aligned to a 4-byte
           boundary and has a size of 4 bytes.  By using <b>-mno-bit-align</b>,
           the structure is aligned to a 1-byte boundary and is 1 byte
           in size.

       <b>-mno-strict-align</b>
       <b>-mstrict-align</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume
           that unaligned memory references are handled by the system.

       <b>-mrelocatable</b>
       <b>-mno-relocatable</b>
           Generate code that allows (does not allow) a static
           executable to be relocated to a different address at run
           time.  A simple embedded PowerPC system loader should
           relocate the entire contents of ".got2" and 4-byte locations
           listed in the ".fixup" section, a table of 32-bit addresses
           generated by this option.  For this to work, all objects
           linked together must be compiled with <b>-mrelocatable </b>or
           <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b>.  <b>-mrelocatable </b>code aligns the stack to an
           8-byte boundary.

       <b>-mrelocatable-lib</b>
       <b>-mno-relocatable-lib</b>
           Like <b>-mrelocatable</b>, <b>-mrelocatable-lib </b>generates a ".fixup"
           section to allow static executables to be relocated at run
           time, but <b>-mrelocatable-lib </b>does not use the smaller stack
           alignment of <b>-mrelocatable</b>.  Objects compiled with
           <b>-mrelocatable-lib </b>may be linked with objects compiled with
           any combination of the <b>-mrelocatable </b>options.

       <b>-mno-toc</b>
       <b>-mtoc</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do not (do) assume
           that register 2 contains a pointer to a global area pointing
           to the addresses used in the program.

       <b>-mlittle</b>
       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for
           the processor in little-endian mode.  The <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           option is the same as <b>-mlittle</b>.

       <b>-mbig</b>
       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code for
           the processor in big-endian mode.  The <b>-mbig-endian </b>option is
           the same as <b>-mbig</b>.

       <b>-mdynamic-no-pic</b>
           On Darwin and Mac OS X systems, compile code so that it is
           not relocatable, but that its external references are
           relocatable.  The resulting code is suitable for
           applications, but not shared libraries.

       <b>-msingle-pic-base</b>
           Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only,
           rather than loading it in the prologue for each function.
           The runtime system is responsible for initializing this
           register with an appropriate value before execution begins.

       <b>-mprioritize-restricted-insns=</b><i>priority</i>
           This option controls the priority that is assigned to
           dispatch-slot restricted instructions during the second
           scheduling pass.  The argument <i>priority</i> takes the value <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>,
           or <b>2 </b>to assign no, highest, or second-highest (respectively)
           priority to dispatch-slot restricted instructions.

       <b>-msched-costly-dep=</b><i>dependence_type</i>
           This option controls which dependences are considered costly
           by the target during instruction scheduling.  The argument
           <i>dependence_type</i> takes one of the following values:

           <b>no  </b>No dependence is costly.

           <b>all </b>All dependences are costly.

           <b>true_store_to_load</b>
               A true dependence from store to load is costly.

           <b>store_to_load</b>
               Any dependence from store to load is costly.

           <i>number</i>
               Any dependence for which the latency is greater than or
               equal to <i>number</i> is costly.

       <b>-minsert-sched-nops=</b><i>scheme</i>
           This option controls which NOP insertion scheme is used
           during the second scheduling pass.  The argument <i>scheme</i> takes
           one of the following values:

           <b>no  </b>Don't insert NOPs.

           <b>pad </b>Pad with NOPs any dispatch group that has vacant issue
               slots, according to the scheduler's grouping.

           <b>regroup_exact</b>
               Insert NOPs to force costly dependent insns into separate
               groups.  Insert exactly as many NOPs as needed to force
               an insn to a new group, according to the estimated
               processor grouping.

           <i>number</i>
               Insert NOPs to force costly dependent insns into separate
               groups.  Insert <i>number</i> NOPs to force an insn to a new
               group.

       <b>-mcall-sysv</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems compile code using

       <b>-msvr4-struct-return</b>
           Return structures smaller than 8 bytes in registers (as

       <b>-mabi=ibmlongdouble</b>
           Change the current ABI to use IBM extended-precision long
           double.  This is not likely to work if your system defaults
           to using IEEE extended-precision long double.  If you change
           the long double type from IEEE extended-precision, the
           compiler will issue a warning unless you use the <b>-Wno-psabi</b>
           option.  Requires <b>-mlong-double-128 </b>to be enabled.

       <b>-mabi=ieeelongdouble</b>
           Change the current ABI to use IEEE extended-precision long
           double.  This is not likely to work if your system defaults

       <b>-mabi=elfv1</b>
           Change the current ABI to use the ELFv1 ABI.  This is the
           default ABI for big-endian PowerPC 64-bit Linux.  Overriding
           the default ABI requires special system support and is likely
           to fail in spectacular ways.

       <b>-mabi=elfv2</b>
           Change the current ABI to use the ELFv2 ABI.  This is the

       <b>-mprototype</b>
       <b>-mno-prototype</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems assume that all
           calls to variable argument functions are properly prototyped.
           Otherwise, the compiler must insert an instruction before
           every non-prototyped call to set or clear bit 6 of the
           condition code register ("CR") to indicate whether floating-
           point values are passed in the floating-point registers in
           case the function takes variable arguments.  With
           <b>-mprototype</b>, only calls to prototyped variable argument
           functions set or clear the bit.

       <b>-msim</b>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, assume that the startup module
           is called <i>sim-crt0.o</i> and that the standard C libraries are
           <i>libsim.a</i> and <i>libc.a</i>.  This is the default for

           to the Embedded Applications Binary Interface (EABI), which
           is a set of modifications to the System V.4 specifications.
           Selecting <b>-meabi </b>means that the stack is aligned to an 8-byte
           boundary, a function "__eabi" is called from "main" to set up
           the EABI environment, and the <b>-msdata </b>option can use both
           "r2" and "r13" to point to two separate small data areas.
           Selecting <b>-mno-eabi </b>means that the stack is aligned to a
           16-byte boundary, no EABI initialization function is called
           from "main", and the <b>-msdata </b>option only uses "r13" to point
           to a single small data area.  The <b>-meabi </b>option is on by

           On embedded PowerPC systems, put all initialized global and
           static data in the ".data" section, and all uninitialized
           data in the ".bss" section.

       <b>-mreadonly-in-sdata</b>
           Put read-only objects in the ".sdata" section as well.  This
           is the default.

       <b>-mblock-move-inline-limit=</b><i>num</i>
           Inline all block moves (such as calls to "memcpy" or
           structure copies) less than or equal to <i>num</i> bytes.  The
           minimum value for <i>num</i> is 32 bytes on 32-bit targets and 64
           bytes on 64-bit targets.  The default value is target-
           specific.

       <b>-mblock-compare-inline-limit=</b><i>num</i>
           Generate non-looping inline code for all block compares (such
           as calls to "memcmp" or structure compares) less than or
           equal to <i>num</i> bytes. If <i>num</i> is 0, all inline expansion (non-
           loop and loop) of block compare is disabled. The default
           value is target-specific.

       <b>-mblock-compare-inline-loop-limit=</b><i>num</i>
           Generate an inline expansion using loop code for all block
           compares that are less than or equal to <i>num</i> bytes, but
           greater than the limit for non-loop inline block compare
           expansion. If the block length is not constant, at most <i>num</i>
           bytes will be compared before "memcmp" is called to compare
           the remainder of the block. The default value is target-
           specific.

       <b>-mstring-compare-inline-limit=</b><i>num</i>
           Compare at most <i>num</i> string bytes with inline code.  If the
           difference or end of string is not found at the end of the
           inline compare a call to "strcmp" or "strncmp" will take care
           of the rest of the comparison. The default is 64 bytes.

       <b>-G </b><i>num</i>
           On embedded PowerPC systems, put global and static items less
           than or equal to <i>num</i> bytes into the small data or BSS
           sections instead of the normal data or BSS section.  By
           default, <i>num</i> is 8.  The <b>-G </b><i>num</i> switch is also passed to the
           linker.  All modules should be compiled with the same <b>-G </b><i>num</i>
           value.

       <b>-mregnames</b>
       <b>-mno-regnames</b>
           On System V.4 and embedded PowerPC systems do (do not) emit
           register names in the assembly language output using symbolic
           forms.

       <b>-mlongcall</b>
       <b>-mno-longcall</b>
           By default assume that all calls are far away so that a
           longer and more expensive calling sequence is required.  This
           is required for calls farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432
           bytes) from the current location.  A short call is generated
           if the compiler knows the call cannot be that far away.  This
           setting can be overridden by the "shortcall" function
           attribute, or by "#pragma longcall(0)".

           Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and
           generating glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long
           calls are unnecessary and generate slower code.  As of this
           writing, the AIX linker can do this, as can the GNU linker
           for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature to the GNU
           linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.

           On PowerPC64 ELFv2 and 32-bit PowerPC systems with newer GNU
           linkers, GCC can generate long calls using an inline PLT call
           sequence (see <b>-mpltseq</b>).  PowerPC with <b>-mbss-plt </b>and
           PowerPC64 ELFv1 (big-endian) do not support inline PLT calls.

           On Darwin/PPC systems, "#pragma longcall" generates "jbsr
           callee, L42", plus a <i>branch island</i> (glue code).  The two
           target addresses represent the callee and the branch island.
           The Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and generates
           a "bl callee" if the PPC "bl" instruction reaches the callee
           directly; otherwise, the linker generates "bl L42" to call
           the branch island.  The branch island is appended to the body
           of the calling function; it computes the full 32-bit address
           of the callee and jumps to it.

           On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler
           emit to the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker
           decides whether to use or discard it.

           In the future, GCC may ignore all longcall specifications
           when the linker is known to generate glue.

       <b>-mpltseq</b>
       <b>-mno-pltseq</b>
           Implement (do not implement) -fno-plt and long calls using an
           inline PLT call sequence that supports lazy linking and long
           calls to functions in dlopen'd shared libraries.  Inline PLT
           calls are only supported on PowerPC64 ELFv2 and 32-bit
           PowerPC systems with newer GNU linkers, and are enabled by
           default if the support is detected when configuring GCC, and,
           in the case of 32-bit PowerPC, if GCC is configured with
           <b>--enable-secureplt</b>.  <b>-mpltseq </b>code and <b>-mbss-plt </b>32-bit
           PowerPC relocatable objects may not be linked together.

       <b>-mtls-markers</b>
       <b>-mno-tls-markers</b>
           Mark (do not mark) calls to "__tls_get_addr" with a
           relocation specifying the function argument.  The relocation
           allows the linker to reliably associate function call with
           argument setup instructions for TLS optimization, which in
           turn allows GCC to better schedule the sequence.

       <b>-mrecip</b>
       <b>-mno-recip</b>
           This option enables use of the reciprocal estimate and
           reciprocal square root estimate instructions with additional
           Newton-Raphson steps to increase precision instead of doing a
           divide or square root and divide for floating-point
           arguments.  You should use the <b>-ffast-math </b>option when using
           <b>-mrecip </b>(or at least <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>,
           <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>, <b>-freciprocal-math </b>and
           <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>).  Note that while the throughput of the
           sequence is generally higher than the throughput of the non-
           reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be
           decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals
           0.99999994) for reciprocal square roots.

       <b>-mrecip=</b><i>opt</i>
           This option controls which reciprocal estimate instructions
           may be used.  <i>opt</i> is a comma-separated list of options, which
           may be preceded by a "!" to invert the option:

           <b>all </b>Enable all estimate instructions.

           <b>default</b>
               Enable the default instructions, equivalent to <b>-mrecip</b>.

           <b>none</b>
               Disable all estimate instructions, equivalent to
               <b>-mno-recip</b>.

           <b>div </b>Enable the reciprocal approximation instructions for both
               single and double precision.

           <b>divf</b>
               Enable the single-precision reciprocal approximation
               instructions.

           <b>divd</b>
               Enable the double-precision reciprocal approximation
               instructions.

           <b>rsqrt</b>
               Enable the reciprocal square root approximation
               instructions for both single and double precision.

           <b>rsqrtf</b>
               Enable the single-precision reciprocal square root
               approximation instructions.

           <b>rsqrtd</b>
               Enable the double-precision reciprocal square root
               approximation instructions.

           So, for example, <b>-mrecip=all,!rsqrtd </b>enables all of the
           reciprocal estimate instructions, except for the "FRSQRTE",
           "XSRSQRTEDP", and "XVRSQRTEDP" instructions which handle the
           double-precision reciprocal square root calculations.

       <b>-mrecip-precision</b>
       <b>-mno-recip-precision</b>
           Assume (do not assume) that the reciprocal estimate
           instructions provide higher-precision estimates than is
           mandated by the PowerPC ABI.  Selecting <b>-mcpu=power6</b>,
           <b>-mcpu=power7 </b>or <b>-mcpu=power8 </b>automatically selects
           <b>-mrecip-precision</b>.  The double-precision square root estimate
           instructions are not generated by default on low-precision
           machines, since they do not provide an estimate that
           converges after three steps.

       <b>-mveclibabi=</b><i>type</i>
           Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics
           using an external library.  The only type supported at
           present is <b>mass</b>, which specifies to use IBM's Mathematical
           Acceleration Subsystem (MASS) libraries for vectorizing
           intrinsics using external libraries.  GCC currently emits
           calls to "acosd2", "acosf4", "acoshd2", "acoshf4", "asind2",
           "asinf4", "asinhd2", "asinhf4", "atan2d2", "atan2f4",
           "atand2", "atanf4", "atanhd2", "atanhf4", "cbrtd2", "cbrtf4",
           "cosd2", "cosf4", "coshd2", "coshf4", "erfcd2", "erfcf4",
           "erfd2", "erff4", "exp2d2", "exp2f4", "expd2", "expf4",
           "expm1d2", "expm1f4", "hypotd2", "hypotf4", "lgammad2",
           "lgammaf4", "log10d2", "log10f4", "log1pd2", "log1pf4",
           "log2d2", "log2f4", "logd2", "logf4", "powd2", "powf4",
           "sind2", "sinf4", "sinhd2", "sinhf4", "sqrtd2", "sqrtf4",
           "tand2", "tanf4", "tanhd2", and "tanhf4" when generating code
           for power7.  Both <b>-ftree-vectorize </b>and
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>must also be enabled.  The MASS
           libraries must be specified at link time.

       <b>-mfriz</b>
       <b>-mno-friz</b>
           Generate (do not generate) the "friz" instruction when the
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>option is used to optimize
           rounding of floating-point values to 64-bit integer and back
           to floating point.  The "friz" instruction does not return
           the same value if the floating-point number is too large to
           fit in an integer.

       <b>-mpointers-to-nested-functions</b>
       <b>-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code to load up the static chain
           register ("r11") when calling through a pointer on AIX and
           64-bit Linux systems where a function pointer points to a
           3-word descriptor giving the function address, TOC value to
           be loaded in register "r2", and static chain value to be
           loaded in register "r11".  The <b>-mpointers-to-nested-functions</b>
           is on by default.  You cannot call through pointers to nested
           functions or pointers to functions compiled in other
           languages that use the static chain if you use
           <b>-mno-pointers-to-nested-functions</b>.

       <b>-msave-toc-indirect</b>
       <b>-mno-save-toc-indirect</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code to save the TOC value in the
           reserved stack location in the function prologue if the
           function calls through a pointer on AIX and 64-bit Linux
           systems.  If the TOC value is not saved in the prologue, it
           is saved just before the call through the pointer.  The
           <b>-mno-save-toc-indirect </b>option is the default.

       <b>-mcompat-align-parm</b>
       <b>-mno-compat-align-parm</b>
           Generate (do not generate) code to pass structure parameters
           with a maximum alignment of 64 bits, for compatibility with
           older versions of GCC.

           Older versions of GCC (prior to 4.9.0) incorrectly did not
           align a structure parameter on a 128-bit boundary when that
           structure contained a member requiring 128-bit alignment.
           This is corrected in more recent versions of GCC.  This
           option may be used to generate code that is compatible with
           functions compiled with older versions of GCC.

           The <b>-mno-compat-align-parm </b>option is the default.

       <b>-mstack-protector-guard=</b><i>guard</i>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><i>reg</i>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><i>offset</i>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-symbol=</b><i>symbol</i>
           Generate stack protection code using canary at <i>guard</i>.
           Supported locations are <b>global </b>for global canary or <b>tls </b>for
           per-thread canary in the TLS block (the default with GNU libc
           version 2.4 or later).

           With the latter choice the options
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><i>reg</i> and
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><i>offset</i> furthermore specify
           which register to use as base register for reading the
           canary, and from what offset from that base register. The
           default for those is as specified in the relevant ABI.
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-symbol=</b><i>symbol</i> overrides the offset
           with a symbol reference to a canary in the TLS block.

       <i>RX Options</i>

       These command-line options are defined for RX targets:

       <b>-m64bit-doubles</b>
       <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>
           Make the "double" data type be 64 bits (<b>-m64bit-doubles</b>) or
           32 bits (<b>-m32bit-doubles</b>) in size.  The default is
           <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>.  <i>Note</i> RX floating-point hardware only works
           on 32-bit values, which is why the default is
           <b>-m32bit-doubles</b>.

       <b>-fpu</b>
       <b>-nofpu</b>
           Enables (<b>-fpu</b>) or disables (<b>-nofpu</b>) the use of RX floating-
           point hardware.  The default is enabled for the RX600 series
           and disabled for the RX200 series.

           Floating-point instructions are only generated for 32-bit
           floating-point values, however, so the FPU hardware is not
           used for doubles if the <b>-m64bit-doubles </b>option is used.

           <i>Note</i> If the <b>-fpu </b>option is enabled then
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>is also enabled automatically.
           This is because the RX FPU instructions are themselves
           unsafe.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>name</i>
           Selects the type of RX CPU to be targeted.  Currently three
           types are supported, the generic <b>RX600 </b>and <b>RX200 </b>series
           hardware and the specific <b>RX610 </b>CPU.  The default is <b>RX600</b>.

           The only difference between <b>RX600 </b>and <b>RX610 </b>is that the <b>RX610</b>
           does not support the "MVTIPL" instruction.

           The <b>RX200 </b>series does not have a hardware floating-point unit
           and so <b>-nofpu </b>is enabled by default when this type is
           selected.

       <b>-mbig-endian-data</b>
       <b>-mlittle-endian-data</b>
           Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format.  The
           default is <b>-mlittle-endian-data</b>, i.e. to store data in the
           little-endian format.

       <b>-msmall-data-limit=</b><i>N</i>
           Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static
           variables which can be placed into the small data area.
           Using the small data area can lead to smaller and faster
           code, but the size of area is limited and it is up to the
           programmer to ensure that the area does not overflow.  Also
           when the small data area is used one of the RX's registers
           (usually "r13") is reserved for use pointing to this area, so
           it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This
           could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are
           pushed onto the stack instead of being held in this register.

           Note, common variables (variables that have not been
           initialized) and constants are not placed into the small data
           area as they are assigned to other sections in the output
           executable.

           The default value is zero, which disables this feature.
           Note, this feature is not enabled by default with higher
           optimization levels (<b>-O2 </b>etc) because of the potentially
           detrimental effects of reserving a register.  It is up to the
           programmer to experiment and discover whether this feature is
           of benefit to their program.  See the description of the
           <b>-mpid </b>option for a description of how the actual register to
           hold the small data area pointer is chosen.

       <b>-msim</b>
       <b>-mno-sim</b>
           Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the
           libgloss board-specific runtime.

       <b>-mas100-syntax</b>
       <b>-mno-as100-syntax</b>
           When generating assembler output use a syntax that is
           compatible with Renesas's AS100 assembler.  This syntax can
           also be handled by the GAS assembler, but it has some
           restrictions so it is not generated by default.

       <b>-mmax-constant-size=</b><i>N</i>
           Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can
           be used as an operand in a RX instruction.  Although the RX
           instruction set does allow constants of up to 4 bytes in
           length to be used in instructions, a longer value equates to
           a longer instruction.  Thus in some circumstances it can be
           beneficial to restrict the size of constants that are used in
           instructions.  Constants that are too big are instead placed
           into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.

           The value <i>N</i> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the
           default) or 4 means that constants of any size are allowed.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Enable linker relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process
           whereby the linker attempts to reduce the size of a program
           by finding shorter versions of various instructions.
           Disabled by default.

       <b>-mint-register=</b><i>N</i>
           Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt
           handler functions.  The value <i>N</i> can be between 0 and 4.  A
           value of 1 means that register "r13" is reserved for the
           exclusive use of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2
           reserves "r13" and "r12".  A value of 3 reserves "r13", "r12"
           and "r11", and a value of 4 reserves "r13" through "r10".  A
           value of 0, the default, does not reserve any registers.

       <b>-msave-acc-in-interrupts</b>
           Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve
           the accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal
           code might use the accumulator register, for example because
           it performs 64-bit multiplications.  The default is to ignore
           the accumulator as this makes the interrupt handlers faster.

       <b>-mpid</b>
       <b>-mno-pid</b>
           Enables the generation of position independent data.  When
           enabled any access to constant data is done via an offset
           from a base address held in a register.  This allows the
           location of constant data to be determined at run time
           without requiring the executable to be relocated, which is a
           benefit to embedded applications with tight memory
           constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by
           this option.

           Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually "r13",
           for the constant data base address.  This can result in
           slower and/or larger code, especially in complicated
           functions.

           The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base
           address depends upon whether the <b>-msmall-data-limit </b>and/or
           the <b>-mint-register </b>command-line options are enabled.
           Starting with register "r13" and proceeding downwards,
           registers are allocated first to satisfy the requirements of
           <b>-mint-register</b>, then <b>-mpid </b>and finally <b>-msmall-data-limit</b>.
           Thus it is possible for the small data area register to be
           "r8" if both <b>-mint-register=4 </b>and <b>-mpid </b>are specified on the
           command line.

           By default this feature is not enabled.  The default can be
           restored via the <b>-mno-pid </b>command-line option.

       <b>-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts</b>
       <b>-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts</b>
           Prevents GCC from issuing a warning message if it finds more
           than one fast interrupt handler when it is compiling a file.
           The default is to issue a warning for each extra fast
           interrupt handler found, as the RX only supports one such
           interrupt.

       <b>-mallow-string-insns</b>
       <b>-mno-allow-string-insns</b>
           Enables or disables the use of the string manipulation
           instructions "SMOVF", "SCMPU", "SMOVB", "SMOVU", "SUNTIL"
           "SWHILE" and also the "RMPA" instruction.  These instructions
           may prefetch data, which is not safe to do if accessing an
           I/O register.  (See section 12.2.7 of the RX62N Group User's
           Manual for more information).

           The default is to allow these instructions, but it is not
           possible for GCC to reliably detect all circumstances where a
           string instruction might be used to access an I/O register,
           so their use cannot be disabled automatically.  Instead it is
           reliant upon the programmer to use the
           <b>-mno-allow-string-insns </b>option if their program accesses I/O
           space.

           When the instructions are enabled GCC defines the C
           preprocessor symbol "__RX_ALLOW_STRING_INSNS__", otherwise it
           defines the symbol "__RX_DISALLOW_STRING_INSNS__".

       <b>-mjsr</b>
       <b>-mno-jsr</b>
           Use only (or not only) "JSR" instructions to access
           functions.  This option can be used when code size exceeds
           the range of "BSR" instructions.  Note that <b>-mno-jsr </b>does not
           mean to not use "JSR" but instead means that any type of
           branch may be used.

       <i>Note:</i> The generic GCC command-line option <b>-ffixed-</b><i>reg</i> has special
       significance to the RX port when used with the "interrupt"
       function attribute.  This attribute indicates a function intended
       to process fast interrupts.  GCC ensures that it only uses the
       registers "r10", "r11", "r12" and/or "r13" and only provided that
       the normal use of the corresponding registers have been
       restricted via the <b>-ffixed-</b><i>reg</i> or <b>-mint-register </b>command-line
       options.

       <i>S/390 and zSeries Options</i>

       These are the <b>-m </b>options defined for the S/390 and zSeries
       architecture.

       <b>-mhard-float</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions and
           registers for floating-point operations.  When <b>-msoft-float</b>
           is specified, functions in <i>libgcc.a</i> are used to perform
           floating-point operations.  When <b>-mhard-float </b>is specified,
           the compiler generates IEEE floating-point instructions.
           This is the default.

       <b>-mhard-dfp</b>
       <b>-mno-hard-dfp</b>
           Use (do not use) the hardware decimal-floating-point
           instructions for decimal-floating-point operations.  When
           <b>-mno-hard-dfp </b>is specified, functions in <i>libgcc.a</i> are used to
           perform decimal-floating-point operations.  When <b>-mhard-dfp</b>
           is specified, the compiler generates decimal-floating-point
           hardware instructions.  This is the default for <b>-march=z9-ec</b>
           or higher.

       <b>-mlong-double-64</b>
       <b>-mlong-double-128</b>
           These switches control the size of "long double" type. A size
           of 64 bits makes the "long double" type equivalent to the
           "double" type. This is the default.

       <b>-mbackchain</b>
       <b>-mno-backchain</b>
           Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as
           backchain pointer into the callee's stack frame.  A backchain
           may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not
           understand DWARF call frame information.  When
           <b>-mno-packed-stack </b>is in effect, the backchain pointer is
           stored at the bottom of the stack frame; when <b>-mpacked-stack</b>
           is in effect, the backchain is placed into the topmost word
           of the 96/160 byte register save area.

           In general, code compiled with <b>-mbackchain </b>is call-compatible
           with code compiled with <b>-mmo-backchain</b>; however, use of the
           backchain for debugging purposes usually requires that the
           whole binary is built with <b>-mbackchain</b>.  Note that the
           combination of <b>-mbackchain</b>, <b>-mpacked-stack </b>and <b>-mhard-float</b>
           is not supported.  In order to build a linux kernel use
           <b>-msoft-float</b>.

           The default is to not maintain the backchain.

       <b>-mpacked-stack</b>
       <b>-mno-packed-stack</b>
           Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When
           <b>-mno-packed-stack </b>is specified, the compiler uses the all
           fields of the 96/160 byte register save area only for their
           default purpose; unused fields still take up stack space.
           When <b>-mpacked-stack </b>is specified, register save slots are
           densely packed at the top of the register save area; unused
           space is reused for other purposes, allowing for more
           efficient use of the available stack space.  However, when
           <b>-mbackchain </b>is also in effect, the topmost word of the save
           area is always used to store the backchain, and the return
           address register is always saved two words below the
           backchain.

           As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code
           generated with <b>-mpacked-stack </b>is call-compatible with code
           generated with <b>-mno-packed-stack</b>.  Note that some non-FSF
           releases of GCC 2.95 for S/390 or zSeries generated code that
           uses the stack frame backchain at run time, not just for
           debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible with
           code compiled with <b>-mpacked-stack</b>.  Also, note that the
           combination of <b>-mbackchain</b>, <b>-mpacked-stack </b>and <b>-mhard-float</b>
           is not supported.  In order to build a linux kernel use
           <b>-msoft-float</b>.

           The default is to not use the packed stack layout.

       <b>-msmall-exec</b>
       <b>-mno-small-exec</b>
           Generate (or do not generate) code using the "bras"
           instruction to do subroutine calls.  This only works reliably
           if the total executable size does not exceed 64k.  The
           default is to use the "basr" instruction instead, which does
           not have this limitation.

       <b>-m64</b>
       <b>-m31</b>
           When <b>-m31 </b>is specified, generate code compliant to the
           GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI.  When <b>-m64 </b>is specified, generate
           code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI.  This allows
           GCC in particular to generate 64-bit instructions.  For the
           <b>s390 </b>targets, the default is <b>-m31</b>, while the <b>s390x </b>targets
           default to <b>-m64</b>.

       <b>-mzarch</b>
       <b>-mesa</b>
           When <b>-mzarch </b>is specified, generate code using the
           instructions available on z/Architecture.  When <b>-mesa </b>is
           specified, generate code using the instructions available on
           ESA/390.  Note that <b>-mesa </b>is not possible with <b>-m64</b>.  When
           generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI, the
           default is <b>-mesa</b>.  When generating code compliant to the
           GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI, the default is <b>-mzarch</b>.

       <b>-mhtm</b>
       <b>-mno-htm</b>
           The <b>-mhtm </b>option enables a set of builtins making use of
           instructions available with the transactional execution
           facility introduced with the IBM zEnterprise EC12 machine
           generation <b>S/390 System z Built-in Functions</b>.  <b>-mhtm </b>is
           enabled by default when using <b>-march=zEC12</b>.

       <b>-mvx</b>
       <b>-mno-vx</b>
           When <b>-mvx </b>is specified, generate code using the instructions
           available with the vector extension facility introduced with
           the IBM z13 machine generation.  This option changes the ABI
           for some vector type values with regard to alignment and
           calling conventions.  In case vector type values are being
           used in an ABI-relevant context a GAS <b>.gnu_attribute </b>command
           will be added to mark the resulting binary with the ABI used.
           <b>-mvx </b>is enabled by default when using <b>-march=z13</b>.

       <b>-mzvector</b>
       <b>-mno-zvector</b>
           The <b>-mzvector </b>option enables vector language extensions and
           builtins using instructions available with the vector
           extension facility introduced with the IBM z13 machine
           generation.  This option adds support for <b>vector </b>to be used
           as a keyword to define vector type variables and arguments.
           <b>vector </b>is only available when GNU extensions are enabled.  It
           will not be expanded when requesting strict standard
           compliance e.g. with <b>-std=c99</b>.  In addition to the GCC low-
           level builtins <b>-mzvector </b>enables a set of builtins added for
           compatibility with AltiVec-style implementations like Power
           and Cell.  In order to make use of these builtins the header
           file <i>vecintrin.h</i> needs to be included.  <b>-mzvector </b>is disabled
           by default.

       <b>-mmvcle</b>
       <b>-mno-mvcle</b>
           Generate (or do not generate) code using the "mvcle"
           instruction to perform block moves.  When <b>-mno-mvcle </b>is
           specified, use a "mvc" loop instead.  This is the default
           unless optimizing for size.

       <b>-mdebug</b>
       <b>-mno-debug</b>
           Print (or do not print) additional debug information when
           compiling.  The default is to not print debug information.

       <b>-march=</b><i>cpu-type</i>
           Generate code that runs on <i>cpu-type</i>, which is the name of a
           system representing a certain processor type.  Possible
           values for <i>cpu-type</i> are <b>z900</b>/<b>arch5</b>, <b>z990</b>/<b>arch6</b>, <b>z9-109</b>,
           <b>z9-ec</b>/<b>arch7</b>, <b>z10</b>/<b>arch8</b>, <b>z196</b>/<b>arch9</b>, <b>zEC12</b>, <b>z13</b>/<b>arch11</b>,
           <b>z14</b>/<b>arch12</b>, and <b>native</b>.

           The default is <b>-march=z900</b>.

           Specifying <b>native </b>as cpu type can be used to select the best
           architecture option for the host processor.  <b>-march=native</b>
           has no effect if GCC does not recognize the processor.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu-type</i>
           Tune to <i>cpu-type</i> everything applicable about the generated
           code, except for the ABI and the set of available
           instructions.  The list of <i>cpu-type</i> values is the same as for
           <b>-march</b>.  The default is the value used for <b>-march</b>.

       <b>-mtpf-trace</b>
       <b>-mno-tpf-trace</b>
           Generate code that adds (does not add) in TPF OS specific
           branches to trace routines in the operating system.  This
           option is off by default, even when compiling for the TPF OS.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
           multiply and accumulate instructions.  These instructions are
           generated by default if hardware floating point is used.

       <b>-mwarn-framesize=</b><i>framesize</i>
           Emit a warning if the current function exceeds the given
           frame size.  Because this is a compile-time check it doesn't
           need to be a real problem when the program runs.  It is
           intended to identify functions that most probably cause a
           stack overflow.  It is useful to be used in an environment
           with limited stack size e.g. the linux kernel.

       <b>-mwarn-dynamicstack</b>
           Emit a warning if the function calls "alloca" or uses
           dynamically-sized arrays.  This is generally a bad idea with
           a limited stack size.

       <b>-mstack-guard=</b><i>stack-guard</i>
       <b>-mstack-size=</b><i>stack-size</i>
           If these options are provided the S/390 back end emits
           additional instructions in the function prologue that trigger
           a trap if the stack size is <i>stack-guard</i> bytes above the
           <i>stack-size</i> (remember that the stack on S/390 grows downward).
           If the <i>stack-guard</i> option is omitted the smallest power of 2
           larger than the frame size of the compiled function is
           chosen.  These options are intended to be used to help
           debugging stack overflow problems.  The additionally emitted
           code causes only little overhead and hence can also be used
           in production-like systems without greater performance
           degradation.  The given values have to be exact powers of 2
           and <i>stack-size</i> has to be greater than <i>stack-guard</i> without
           exceeding 64k.  In order to be efficient the extra code makes
           the assumption that the stack starts at an address aligned to
           the value given by <i>stack-size</i>.  The <i>stack-guard</i> option can
           only be used in conjunction with <i>stack-size</i>.

       <b>-mhotpatch=</b><i>pre-halfwords</i><b>,</b><i>post-halfwords</i>
           If the hotpatch option is enabled, a "hot-patching" function
           prologue is generated for all functions in the compilation
           unit.  The funtion label is prepended with the given number
           of two-byte NOP instructions (<i>pre-halfwords</i>, maximum
           1000000).  After the label, 2 * <i>post-halfwords</i> bytes are
           appended, using the largest NOP like instructions the
           architecture allows (maximum 1000000).

           If both arguments are zero, hotpatching is disabled.

           This option can be overridden for individual functions with
           the "hotpatch" attribute.

       <i>Score Options</i>

       These options are defined for Score implementations:

       <b>-meb</b>
           Compile code for big-endian mode.  This is the default.

       <b>-mel</b>
           Compile code for little-endian mode.

       <b>-mnhwloop</b>
           Disable generation of "bcnz" instructions.

       <b>-muls</b>
           Enable generation of unaligned load and store instructions.

       <b>-mmac</b>
           Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions. Disabled
           by default.

       <b>-mscore5</b>
           Specify the SCORE5 as the target architecture.

       <b>-mscore5u</b>
           Specify the SCORE5U of the target architecture.

       <b>-mscore7</b>
           Specify the SCORE7 as the target architecture. This is the
           default.

       <b>-mscore7d</b>
           Specify the SCORE7D as the target architecture.

       <i>SH Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the SH implementations:

       <b>-m1 </b>Generate code for the SH1.

       <b>-m2 </b>Generate code for the SH2.

       <b>-m2e</b>
           Generate code for the SH2e.

           Generate code for the SH4al-dsp, or for a SH4a in such a way
           that the floating-point unit is not used.

       <b>-m4a-single-only</b>
           Generate code for the SH4a, in such a way that no double-
           precision floating-point operations are used.

       <b>-m4a-single</b>
           Generate code for the SH4a assuming the floating-point unit
           is in single-precision mode by default.

       <b>-m4a</b>
           Generate code for the SH4a.

       <b>-m4al</b>
           Same as <b>-m4a-nofpu</b>, except that it implicitly passes <b>-dsp </b>to
           the assembler.  GCC doesn't generate any DSP instructions at
           the moment.

       <b>-mb </b>Compile code for the processor in big-endian mode.

       <b>-ml </b>Compile code for the processor in little-endian mode.

       <b>-mdalign</b>
           Align doubles at 64-bit boundaries.  Note that this changes
           the calling conventions, and thus some functions from the
           standard C library do not work unless you recompile it first
           with <b>-mdalign</b>.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
           Shorten some address references at link time, when possible;
           uses the linker option <b>-relax</b>.

       <b>-mbigtable</b>
           Use 32-bit offsets in "switch" tables.  The default is to use
           16-bit offsets.

       <b>-mbitops</b>
           Enable the use of bit manipulation instructions on SH2A.

       <b>-mfmovd</b>
           Enable the use of the instruction "fmovd".  Check <b>-mdalign</b>
           for alignment constraints.

       <b>-mrenesas</b>
           Comply with the calling conventions defined by Renesas.

       <b>-mno-renesas</b>
           Comply with the calling conventions defined for GCC before
           the Renesas conventions were available.  This option is the
           default for all targets of the SH toolchain.

       <b>-mnomacsave</b>
           Mark the "MAC" register as call-clobbered, even if <b>-mrenesas</b>
           is given.

       <b>-mieee</b>
       <b>-mno-ieee</b>
           Control the IEEE compliance of floating-point comparisons,
           which affects the handling of cases where the result of a
           comparison is unordered.  By default <b>-mieee </b>is implicitly
           enabled.  If <b>-ffinite-math-only </b>is enabled <b>-mno-ieee </b>is
           implicitly set, which results in faster floating-point
           greater-equal and less-equal comparisons.  The implicit
           settings can be overridden by specifying either <b>-mieee </b>or
           <b>-mno-ieee</b>.

       <b>-minline-ic_invalidate</b>
           Inline code to invalidate instruction cache entries after
           setting up nested function trampolines.  This option has no
           effect if <b>-musermode </b>is in effect and the selected code
           generation option (e.g. <b>-m4</b>) does not allow the use of the
           "icbi" instruction.  If the selected code generation option
           does not allow the use of the "icbi" instruction, and
           <b>-musermode </b>is not in effect, the inlined code manipulates the
           instruction cache address array directly with an associative
           write.  This not only requires privileged mode at run time,
           but it also fails if the cache line had been mapped via the
           TLB and has become unmapped.

       <b>-misize</b>
           Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.

       <b>-mpadstruct</b>
           This option is deprecated.  It pads structures to multiple of
           4 bytes, which is incompatible with the SH ABI.

       <b>-matomic-model=</b><i>model</i>
           Sets the model of atomic operations and additional parameters
           as a comma separated list.  For details on the atomic built-
           in functions see <b>__atomic Builtins</b>.  The following models and
           parameters are supported:

           <b>none</b>
               Disable compiler generated atomic sequences and emit
               library calls for atomic operations.  This is the default
               if the target is not "sh*-*-linux*".

           <b>soft-gusa</b>
               Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic
               sequences for the atomic built-in functions.  The
               generated atomic sequences require additional support
               from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system
               and are only suitable for SH3* and SH4* single-core
               systems.  This option is enabled by default when the
               target is "sh*-*-linux*" and SH3* or SH4*.  When the
               target is SH4A, this option also partially utilizes the
               hardware atomic instructions "movli.l" and "movco.l" to
               create more efficient code, unless <b>strict </b>is specified.

           <b>soft-tcb</b>
               Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in
               the thread control block.  This is a variation of the
               gUSA sequences which can also be used on SH1* and SH2*
               targets.  The generated atomic sequences require
               additional support from the interrupt/exception handling
               code of the system and are only suitable for single-core
               systems.  When using this model, the <b>gbr-offset=</b>
               parameter has to be specified as well.

           <b>soft-imask</b>
               Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily
               disable interrupts by setting "SR.IMASK = 1111".  This
               model works only when the program runs in privileged mode
               and is only suitable for single-core systems.  Additional
               support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the
               system is not required.  This model is enabled by default
               when the target is "sh*-*-linux*" and SH1* or SH2*.

           <b>hard-llcs</b>
               Generate hardware atomic sequences using the "movli.l"
               and "movco.l" instructions only.  This is only available
               on SH4A and is suitable for multi-core systems.  Since
               the hardware instructions support only 32 bit atomic
               variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated
               with 32 bit accesses.  Code compiled with this option is
               also compatible with other software atomic model
               interrupt/exception handling systems if executed on an
               SH4A system.  Additional support from the
               interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not
               required for this model.

           <b>gbr-offset=</b>
               This parameter specifies the offset in bytes of the
               variable in the thread control block structure that
               should be used by the generated atomic sequences when the
               <b>soft-tcb </b>model has been selected.  For other models this
               parameter is ignored.  The specified value must be an
               integer multiple of four and in the range 0-1020.

           <b>strict</b>
               This parameter prevents mixed usage of multiple atomic
               models, even if they are compatible, and makes the
               compiler generate atomic sequences of the specified model
               only.

       <b>-mtas</b>
           Generate the "tas.b" opcode for "__atomic_test_and_set".
           Notice that depending on the particular hardware and software
           configuration this can degrade overall performance due to the
           operand cache line flushes that are implied by the "tas.b"
           instruction.  On multi-core SH4A processors the "tas.b"
           instruction must be used with caution since it can result in
           data corruption for certain cache configurations.

       <b>-mprefergot</b>
           When generating position-independent code, emit function
           calls using the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure
           Linkage Table.

       <b>-musermode</b>
       <b>-mno-usermode</b>
           Don't allow (allow) the compiler generating privileged mode
           code.  Specifying <b>-musermode </b>also implies
           <b>-mno-inline-ic_invalidate </b>if the inlined code would not work
           in user mode.  <b>-musermode </b>is the default when the target is
           "sh*-*-linux*".  If the target is SH1* or SH2* <b>-musermode </b>has
           no effect, since there is no user mode.

       <b>-multcost=</b><i>number</i>
           Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.

       <b>-mdiv=</b><i>strategy</i>
           Set the division strategy to be used for integer division
           operations.  <i>strategy</i> can be one of:

           <b>call-div1</b>
               Calls a library function that uses the single-step
               division instruction "div1" to perform the operation.
               Division by zero calculates an unspecified result and
               does not trap.  This is the default except for SH4, SH2A
               and SHcompact.

           <b>call-fp</b>
               Calls a library function that performs the operation in
               double precision floating point.  Division by zero causes
               a floating-point exception.  This is the default for
               SHcompact with FPU.  Specifying this for targets that do
               not have a double precision FPU defaults to "call-div1".

           <b>call-table</b>
               Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for
               small divisors and the "div1" instruction with case
               distinction for larger divisors.  Division by zero
               calculates an unspecified result and does not trap.  This
               is the default for SH4.  Specifying this for targets that
               do not have dynamic shift instructions defaults to
               "call-div1".

           When a division strategy has not been specified the default
           strategy is selected based on the current target.  For SH2A
           the default strategy is to use the "divs" and "divu"
           instructions instead of library function calls.

       <b>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</b>
           Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function
           prologue rather than around each call.  Generally beneficial
           for performance and size.  Also needed for unwinding to avoid
           changing the stack frame around conditional code.

       <b>-mdivsi3_libfunc=</b><i>name</i>
           Set the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed
           division to <i>name</i>.  This only affects the name used in the
           <b>call </b>division strategies, and the compiler still expects the
           same sets of input/output/clobbered registers as if this
           option were not present.

       <b>-mfixed-range=</b><i>register-range</i>
           Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
           registers.  A fixed register is one that the register
           allocator cannot use.  This is useful when compiling kernel
           code.  A register range is specified as two registers
           separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
           specified separated by a comma.

       <b>-mbranch-cost=</b><i>num</i>
           Assume <i>num</i> to be the cost for a branch instruction.  Higher
           numbers make the compiler try to generate more branch-free
           code if possible.  If not specified the value is selected
           depending on the processor type that is being compiled for.

       <b>-mzdcbranch</b>
       <b>-mno-zdcbranch</b>
           Assume (do not assume) that zero displacement conditional
           branch instructions "bt" and "bf" are fast.  If <b>-mzdcbranch</b>
           is specified, the compiler prefers zero displacement branch
           code sequences.  This is enabled by default when generating
           code for SH4 and SH4A.  It can be explicitly disabled by
           specifying <b>-mno-zdcbranch</b>.

       <b>-mcbranch-force-delay-slot</b>
           Force the usage of delay slots for conditional branches,
           which stuffs the delay slot with a "nop" if a suitable
           instruction cannot be found.  By default this option is
           disabled.  It can be enabled to work around hardware bugs as
           found in the original SH7055.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point
           multiply and accumulate instructions.  These instructions are
           generated by default if hardware floating point is used.  The
           machine-dependent <b>-mfused-madd </b>option is now mapped to the
           machine-independent <b>-ffp-contract=fast </b>option, and
           <b>-mno-fused-madd </b>is mapped to <b>-ffp-contract=off</b>.

       <b>-mfsca</b>
       <b>-mno-fsca</b>
           Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the "fsca" instruction
           for sine and cosine approximations.  The option <b>-mfsca </b>must
           be used in combination with <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b>.  It
           is enabled by default when generating code for SH4A.  Using
           <b>-mno-fsca </b>disables sine and cosine approximations even if
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>is in effect.

       <b>-mfsrra</b>
       <b>-mno-fsrra</b>
           Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the "fsrra"
           instruction for reciprocal square root approximations.  The
           option <b>-mfsrra </b>must be used in combination with
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>and <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>.  It is
           enabled by default when generating code for SH4A.  Using
           <b>-mno-fsrra </b>disables reciprocal square root approximations
           even if <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>and <b>-ffinite-math-only</b>
           are in effect.

       <b>-mpretend-cmove</b>
           Prefer zero-displacement conditional branches for conditional
           move instruction patterns.  This can result in faster code on
           the SH4 processor.

       <b>-mfdpic</b>
           Generate code using the FDPIC ABI.

       <i>Solaris 2 Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are supported on Solaris 2:

       <b>-mclear-hwcap</b>
           <b>-mclear-hwcap </b>tells the compiler to remove the hardware
           capabilities generated by the Solaris assembler.  This is
           only necessary when object files use ISA extensions not
           supported by the current machine, but check at runtime
           whether or not to use them.

       <b>-mimpure-text</b>
           <b>-mimpure-text</b>, used in addition to <b>-shared</b>, tells the
           compiler to not pass <b>-z text </b>to the linker when linking a
           shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-
           dependent code into a shared object.

           <b>-mimpure-text </b>suppresses the "relocations remain against
           allocatable but non-writable sections" linker error message.
           However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and
           the shared object is not actually shared across processes.
           Instead of using <b>-mimpure-text</b>, you should compile all source
           code with <b>-fpic </b>or <b>-fPIC</b>.

       These switches are supported in addition to the above on Solaris
       2:

       <b>-pthreads</b>
           This is a synonym for <b>-pthread</b>.

       <i>SPARC Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are supported on the SPARC:

       <b>-mno-app-regs</b>
       <b>-mapp-regs</b>
           Specify <b>-mapp-regs </b>to generate output using the global
           registers 2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for
           applications.  Like the global register 1, each global
           register 2 through 4 is then treated as an allocable register
           that is clobbered by function calls.  This is the default.

           To be fully SVR4 ABI-compliant at the cost of some
           performance loss, specify <b>-mno-app-regs</b>.  You should compile
           libraries and system software with this option.

       <b>-mflat</b>
       <b>-mno-flat</b>
           With <b>-mflat</b>, the compiler does not generate save/restore
           instructions and uses a "flat" or single register window
           model.  This model is compatible with the regular register
           window model.  The local registers and the input registers
           (0--5) are still treated as "call-saved" registers and are
           saved on the stack as needed.

           With <b>-mno-flat </b>(the default), the compiler generates
           save/restore instructions (except for leaf functions).  This
           is the normal operating mode.

       <b>-mfpu</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate output containing floating-point instructions.  This
           is the default.

       <b>-mno-fpu</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
           <b>Warning: </b>the requisite libraries are not available for all
           SPARC targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's
           usual C compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly
           in cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to
           provide suitable library functions for cross-compilation.
           The embedded targets <b>sparc-*-aout </b>and <b>sparclite-*-* </b>do
           provide software floating-point support.

           <b>-msoft-float </b>changes the calling convention in the output
           file; therefore, it is only useful if you compile <i>all</i> of a
           program with this option.  In particular, you need to compile
           <i>libgcc.a</i>, the library that comes with GCC, with <b>-msoft-float</b>
           in order for this to work.

       <b>-mhard-quad-float</b>
           Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-
           point instructions.

       <b>-msoft-quad-float</b>
           Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long
           double) floating-point instructions.  The functions called
           are those specified in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

           As of this writing, there are no SPARC implementations that
           have hardware support for the quad-word floating-point
           instructions.  They all invoke a trap handler for one of
           these instructions, and then the trap handler emulates the
           effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler
           overhead, this is much slower than calling the ABI library
           routines.  Thus the <b>-msoft-quad-float </b>option is the default.

       <b>-mno-unaligned-doubles</b>
       <b>-munaligned-doubles</b>
           Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment.  This is the
           default.

           With <b>-munaligned-doubles</b>, GCC assumes that doubles have
           8-byte alignment only if they are contained in another type,
           or if they have an absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes
           they have 4-byte alignment.  Specifying this option avoids
           some rare compatibility problems with code generated by other
           compilers.  It is not the default because it results in a
           performance loss, especially for floating-point code.

       <b>-muser-mode</b>
       <b>-mno-user-mode</b>
           Do not generate code that can only run in supervisor mode.
           This is relevant only for the "casa" instruction emitted for
           the LEON3 processor.  This is the default.

       <b>-mfaster-structs</b>
       <b>-mno-faster-structs</b>
           With <b>-mfaster-structs</b>, the compiler assumes that structures
           should have 8-byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs
           of "ldd" and "std" instructions for copies in structure
           assignment, in place of twice as many "ld" and "st" pairs.
           However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates
           the SPARC ABI.  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets
           where the developer acknowledges that their resulting code is
           not directly in line with the rules of the ABI.

       <b>-mstd-struct-return</b>
       <b>-mno-std-struct-return</b>
           With <b>-mstd-struct-return</b>, the compiler generates checking
           code in functions returning structures or unions to detect
           size mismatches between the two sides of function calls, as
           per the 32-bit ABI.

           The default is <b>-mno-std-struct-return</b>.  This option has no
           effect in 64-bit mode.

       <b>-mlra</b>
       <b>-mno-lra</b>
           Enable Local Register Allocation.  This is the default for
           SPARC since GCC 7 so <b>-mno-lra </b>needs to be passed to get old
           Reload.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
           Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction
           scheduling parameters for machine type <i>cpu_type</i>.  Supported
           values for <i>cpu_type</i> are <b>v7</b>, <b>cypress</b>, <b>v8</b>, <b>supersparc</b>,
           <b>hypersparc</b>, <b>leon</b>, <b>leon3</b>, <b>leon3v7</b>, <b>sparclite</b>, <b>f930</b>, <b>f934</b>,

           <b>niagara</b>, <b>niagara2</b>, <b>niagara3</b>, <b>niagara4</b>, <b>niagara7 </b>and <b>m8</b>.

           Native Solaris and GNU/Linux toolchains also support the
           value <b>native</b>, which selects the best architecture option for
           the host processor.  <b>-mcpu=native </b>has no effect if GCC does
           not recognize the processor.

           Default instruction scheduling parameters are used for values
           that select an architecture and not an implementation.  These
           are <b>v7</b>, <b>v8</b>, <b>sparclite</b>, <b>sparclet</b>, <b>v9</b>.

           Here is a list of each supported architecture and their
           supported implementations.

           v7  cypress, leon3v7

           v8  supersparc, hypersparc, leon, leon3

           sparclite
               f930, f934, sparclite86x

           sparclet
               tsc701

           v9  ultrasparc, ultrasparc3, niagara, niagara2, niagara3,
               niagara4, niagara7, m8

           By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC generates code
           for the V7 variant of the SPARC architecture.  With
           <b>-mcpu=cypress</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
           Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the SPARCStation/SPARCServer
           3xx series.  This is also appropriate for the older
           SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.

           With <b>-mcpu=v8</b>, GCC generates code for the V8 variant of the
           SPARC architecture.  The only difference from V7 code is that
           the compiler emits the integer multiply and integer divide
           instructions which exist in SPARC-V8 but not in SPARC-V7.
           With <b>-mcpu=supersparc</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it
           for the SuperSPARC chip, as used in the SPARCStation 10, 1000
           and 2000 series.

           With <b>-mcpu=sparclite</b>, GCC generates code for the SPARClite
           variant of the SPARC architecture.  This adds the integer
           multiply, integer divide step and scan ("ffs") instructions
           which exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC-V7.  With
           <b>-mcpu=f930</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for the
           Fujitsu MB86930 chip, which is the original SPARClite, with
           no FPU.  With <b>-mcpu=f934</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes
           it for the Fujitsu MB86934 chip, which is the more recent
           SPARClite with FPU.

           With <b>-mcpu=sparclet</b>, GCC generates code for the SPARClet
           variant of the SPARC architecture.  This adds the integer
           multiply, multiply/accumulate, integer divide step and scan
           ("ffs") instructions which exist in SPARClet but not in
           SPARC-V7.  With <b>-mcpu=tsc701</b>, the compiler additionally
           optimizes it for the TEMIC SPARClet chip.

           With <b>-mcpu=v9</b>, GCC generates code for the V9 variant of the
           SPARC architecture.  This adds 64-bit integer and floating-
           point move instructions, 3 additional floating-point
           condition code registers and conditional move instructions.
           With <b>-mcpu=ultrasparc</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it
           for the Sun UltraSPARC I/II/IIi chips.  With
           <b>-mcpu=ultrasparc3</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
           the Sun UltraSPARC III/III+/IIIi/IIIi+/IV/IV+ chips.  With
           <b>-mcpu=niagara</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for Sun
           UltraSPARC T1 chips.  With <b>-mcpu=niagara2</b>, the compiler
           additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T2 chips. With
           <b>-mcpu=niagara3</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
           Sun UltraSPARC T3 chips.  With <b>-mcpu=niagara4</b>, the compiler
           additionally optimizes it for Sun UltraSPARC T4 chips.  With
           <b>-mcpu=niagara7</b>, the compiler additionally optimizes it for
           Oracle SPARC M7 chips.  With <b>-mcpu=m8</b>, the compiler
           additionally optimizes it for Oracle M8 chips.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
           Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
           <i>cpu_type</i>, but do not set the instruction set or register set
           that the option <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i> does.

           The same values for <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i> can be used for
           <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu_type</i>, but the only useful values are those that
           select a particular CPU implementation.  Those are <b>cypress</b>,
           <b>supersparc</b>, <b>hypersparc</b>, <b>leon</b>, <b>leon3</b>, <b>leon3v7</b>, <b>f930</b>, <b>f934</b>,
           <b>sparclite86x</b>, <b>tsc701</b>, <b>ultrasparc</b>, <b>ultrasparc3</b>, <b>niagara</b>,
           <b>niagara2</b>, <b>niagara3</b>, <b>niagara4</b>, <b>niagara7 </b>and <b>m8</b>.  With native
           Solaris and GNU/Linux toolchains, <b>native </b>can also be used.

       <b>-mv8plus</b>
       <b>-mno-v8plus</b>
           With <b>-mv8plus</b>, GCC generates code for the SPARC-V8+ ABI.  The
           difference from the V8 ABI is that the global and out
           registers are considered 64 bits wide.  This is enabled by
           default on Solaris in 32-bit mode for all SPARC-V9
           processors.

       <b>-mvis</b>
       <b>-mno-vis</b>
           With <b>-mvis</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
           UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set extensions.  The default is
           <b>-mno-vis</b>.

       <b>-mvis2</b>
       <b>-mno-vis2</b>
           With <b>-mvis2</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
           version 2.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
           extensions.  The default is <b>-mvis2 </b>when targeting a cpu that
           supports such instructions, such as UltraSPARC-III and later.
           Setting <b>-mvis2 </b>also sets <b>-mvis</b>.

       <b>-mvis3</b>
       <b>-mno-vis3</b>
           With <b>-mvis3</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
           version 3.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
           extensions.  The default is <b>-mvis3 </b>when targeting a cpu that
           supports such instructions, such as niagara-3 and later.
           Setting <b>-mvis3 </b>also sets <b>-mvis2 </b>and <b>-mvis</b>.

       <b>-mvis4</b>
       <b>-mno-vis4</b>
           With <b>-mvis4</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
           version 4.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
           extensions.  The default is <b>-mvis4 </b>when targeting a cpu that
           supports such instructions, such as niagara-7 and later.
           Setting <b>-mvis4 </b>also sets <b>-mvis3</b>, <b>-mvis2 </b>and <b>-mvis</b>.

       <b>-mvis4b</b>
       <b>-mno-vis4b</b>
           With <b>-mvis4b</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of
           version 4.0 of the UltraSPARC Visual Instruction Set
           extensions, plus the additional VIS instructions introduced
           in the Oracle SPARC Architecture 2017.  The default is
           <b>-mvis4b </b>when targeting a cpu that supports such instructions,
           such as m8 and later.  Setting <b>-mvis4b </b>also sets <b>-mvis4</b>,
           <b>-mvis3</b>, <b>-mvis2 </b>and <b>-mvis</b>.

       <b>-mcbcond</b>
       <b>-mno-cbcond</b>
           With <b>-mcbcond</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
           UltraSPARC Compare-and-Branch-on-Condition instructions.  The
           default is <b>-mcbcond </b>when targeting a CPU that supports such
           instructions, such as Niagara-4 and later.

       <b>-mfmaf</b>
       <b>-mno-fmaf</b>
           With <b>-mfmaf</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
           UltraSPARC Fused Multiply-Add Floating-point instructions.
           The default is <b>-mfmaf </b>when targeting a CPU that supports such
           instructions, such as Niagara-3 and later.

       <b>-mfsmuld</b>
       <b>-mno-fsmuld</b>
           With <b>-mfsmuld</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
           Floating-point Multiply Single to Double (FsMULd)
           instruction.  The default is <b>-mfsmuld </b>when targeting a CPU
           supporting the architecture versions V8 or V9 with FPU except
           <b>-mcpu=leon</b>.

       <b>-mpopc</b>
       <b>-mno-popc</b>
           With <b>-mpopc</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
           UltraSPARC Population Count instruction.  The default is
           <b>-mpopc </b>when targeting a CPU that supports such an
           instruction, such as Niagara-2 and later.

       <b>-msubxc</b>
       <b>-mno-subxc</b>
           With <b>-msubxc</b>, GCC generates code that takes advantage of the
           UltraSPARC Subtract-Extended-with-Carry instruction.  The
           default is <b>-msubxc </b>when targeting a CPU that supports such an
           instruction, such as Niagara-7 and later.

       <b>-mfix-at697f</b>
           Enable the documented workaround for the single erratum of
           the Atmel AT697F processor (which corresponds to erratum #13
           of the AT697E processor).

       <b>-mfix-ut699</b>
           Enable the documented workarounds for the floating-point
           errata and the data cache nullify errata of the UT699
           processor.

       <b>-mfix-ut700</b>
           Enable the documented workaround for the back-to-back store
           errata of the UT699E/UT700 processor.

       <b>-mfix-gr712rc</b>
           Enable the documented workaround for the back-to-back store
           errata of the GR712RC processor.

       These <b>-m </b>options are supported in addition to the above on
       SPARC-V9 processors in 64-bit environments:

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
           Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
           environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.  The
           64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer
           to 64 bits.

       <b>-mcmodel=</b><i>which</i>
           Set the code model to one of

           <b>medlow</b>
               The Medium/Low code model: 64-bit addresses, programs
               must be linked in the low 32 bits of memory.  Programs
               can be statically or dynamically linked.

           <b>medmid</b>
               The Medium/Middle code model: 64-bit addresses, programs
               must be linked in the low 44 bits of memory, the text and
               data segments must be less than 2GB in size and the data
               segment must be located within 2GB of the text segment.

           <b>medany</b>
               The Medium/Anywhere code model: 64-bit addresses,
               programs may be linked anywhere in memory, the text and
               data segments must be less than 2GB in size and the data
               segment must be located within 2GB of the text segment.

           <b>embmedany</b>
               The Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded systems:
               64-bit addresses, the text and data segments must be less
               than 2GB in size, both starting anywhere in memory
               (determined at link time).  The global register %g4
               points to the base of the data segment.  Programs are
               statically linked and PIC is not supported.

       <b>-mmemory-model=</b><i>mem-model</i>
           Set the memory model in force on the processor to one of

           <b>default</b>
               The default memory model for the processor and operating
               system.

           <b>rmo </b>Relaxed Memory Order

           <b>pso </b>Partial Store Order

           <b>tso </b>Total Store Order

           <b>sc  </b>Sequential Consistency

           These memory models are formally defined in Appendix D of the
           SPARC-V9 architecture manual, as set in the processor's
           "PSTATE.MM" field.

       <b>-mstack-bias</b>
       <b>-mno-stack-bias</b>
           With <b>-mstack-bias</b>, GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and
           frame pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be
           added back when making stack frame references.  This is the
           default in 64-bit mode.  Otherwise, assume no such offset is
           present.

       <i>SPU Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are supported on the SPU:

       <b>-mwarn-reloc</b>
       <b>-merror-reloc</b>
           The loader for SPU does not handle dynamic relocations.  By
           default, GCC gives an error when it generates code that
           requires a dynamic relocation.  <b>-mno-error-reloc </b>disables the
           error, <b>-mwarn-reloc </b>generates a warning instead.

       <b>-msafe-dma</b>
       <b>-munsafe-dma</b>
           Instructions that initiate or test completion of DMA must not
           be reordered with respect to loads and stores of the memory
           that is being accessed.  With <b>-munsafe-dma </b>you must use the
           "volatile" keyword to protect memory accesses, but that can
           lead to inefficient code in places where the memory is known
           to not change.  Rather than mark the memory as volatile, you
           can use <b>-msafe-dma </b>to tell the compiler to treat the DMA
           instructions as potentially affecting all memory.

       <b>-mbranch-hints</b>
           By default, GCC generates a branch hint instruction to avoid
           pipeline stalls for always-taken or probably-taken branches.
           A hint is not generated closer than 8 instructions away from
           its branch.  There is little reason to disable them, except
           for debugging purposes, or to make an object a little bit
           smaller.

       <b>-msmall-mem</b>
       <b>-mlarge-mem</b>
           By default, GCC generates code assuming that addresses are
           never larger than 18 bits.  With <b>-mlarge-mem </b>code is
           generated that assumes a full 32-bit address.

       <b>-mstdmain</b>
           By default, GCC links against startup code that assumes the
           SPU-style main function interface (which has an
           unconventional parameter list).  With <b>-mstdmain</b>, GCC links
           your program against startup code that assumes a C99-style
           interface to "main", including a local copy of "argv"
           strings.

       <b>-mfixed-range=</b><i>register-range</i>
           Generate code treating the given register range as fixed
           registers.  A fixed register is one that the register
           allocator cannot use.  This is useful when compiling kernel
           code.  A register range is specified as two registers
           separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
           specified separated by a comma.

       <b>-mea32</b>
       <b>-mea64</b>
           Compile code assuming that pointers to the PPU address space
           accessed via the "__ea" named address space qualifier are
           either 32 or 64 bits wide.  The default is 32 bits.  As this
           is an ABI-changing option, all object code in an executable
           must be compiled with the same setting.

       <b>-maddress-space-conversion</b>
       <b>-mno-address-space-conversion</b>
           Allow/disallow treating the "__ea" address space as superset
           of the generic address space.  This enables explicit type
           casts between "__ea" and generic pointer as well as implicit
           conversions of generic pointers to "__ea" pointers.  The
           default is to allow address space pointer conversions.

       <b>-mcache-size=</b><i>cache-size</i>
           This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler
           links to an executable and selects a software-managed cache
           for accessing variables in the "__ea" address space with a
           particular cache size.  Possible options for <i>cache-size</i> are
           <b>8</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>64 </b>and <b>128</b>.  The default cache size is 64KB.

       <b>-matomic-updates</b>
       <b>-mno-atomic-updates</b>
           This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler
           links to an executable and selects whether atomic updates to
           the software-managed cache of PPU-side variables are used.
           If you use atomic updates, changes to a PPU variable from SPU
           code using the "__ea" named address space qualifier do not
           interfere with changes to other PPU variables residing in the
           same cache line from PPU code.  If you do not use atomic
           updates, such interference may occur; however, writing back
           cache lines is more efficient.  The default behavior is to
           use atomic updates.

       <b>-mdual-nops</b>
       <b>-mdual-nops=</b><i>n</i>
           By default, GCC inserts NOPs to increase dual issue when it
           expects it to increase performance.  <i>n</i> can be a value from 0
           to 10.  A smaller <i>n</i> inserts fewer NOPs.  10 is the default, 0
           is the same as <b>-mno-dual-nops</b>.  Disabled with <b>-Os</b>.

       <b>-mhint-max-nops=</b><i>n</i>
           Maximum number of NOPs to insert for a branch hint.  A branch
           hint must be at least 8 instructions away from the branch it
           is affecting.  GCC inserts up to <i>n</i> NOPs to enforce this,
           otherwise it does not generate the branch hint.

       <b>-mhint-max-distance=</b><i>n</i>
           The encoding of the branch hint instruction limits the hint
           to be within 256 instructions of the branch it is affecting.
           By default, GCC makes sure it is within 125.

       <b>-msafe-hints</b>
           Work around a hardware bug that causes the SPU to stall
           indefinitely.  By default, GCC inserts the "hbrp" instruction
           to make sure this stall won't happen.

       <i>Options for System V</i>

       These additional options are available on System V Release 4 for
       compatibility with other compilers on those systems:

       <b>-G  </b>Create a shared object.  It is recommended that <b>-symbolic </b>or
           <b>-shared </b>be used instead.

       <b>-Qy </b>Identify the versions of each tool used by the compiler, in a
           ".ident" assembler directive in the output.

       <b>-Qn </b>Refrain from adding ".ident" directives to the output file
           (this is the default).

       <b>-YP,</b><i>dirs</i>
           Search the directories <i>dirs</i>, and no others, for libraries
           specified with <b>-l</b>.

       <b>-Ym,</b><i>dir</i>
           Look in the directory <i>dir</i> to find the M4 preprocessor.  The
           assembler uses this option.

       <i>TILE-Gx Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are supported on the TILE-Gx:

       <b>-mcmodel=small</b>
           Generate code for the small model.  The distance for direct
           calls is limited to 500M in either direction.  PC-relative
           addresses are 32 bits.  Absolute addresses support the full
           address range.

       <b>-mcmodel=large</b>
           Generate code for the large model.  There is no limitation on
           call distance, pc-relative addresses, or absolute addresses.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>name</i>
           Selects the type of CPU to be targeted.  Currently the only
           supported type is <b>tilegx</b>.

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
           Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
           environment sets int, long, and pointer to 32 bits.  The
           64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer
           to 64 bits.

       <b>-mbig-endian</b>
       <b>-mlittle-endian</b>
           Generate code in big/little endian mode, respectively.

       <i>TILEPro Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are supported on the TILEPro:

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>name</i>
           Selects the type of CPU to be targeted.  Currently the only
           supported type is <b>tilepro</b>.

       <b>-m32</b>
           Generate code for a 32-bit environment, which sets int, long,
           and pointer to 32 bits.  This is the only supported behavior
           so the flag is essentially ignored.

       <i>V850 Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for V850 implementations:

       <b>-mlong-calls</b>
       <b>-mno-long-calls</b>
           Treat all calls as being far away (near).  If calls are
           assumed to be far away, the compiler always loads the
           function's address into a register, and calls indirect
           through the pointer.

       <b>-mno-ep</b>
       <b>-mep</b>
           Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same
           index pointer 4 or more times to copy pointer into the "ep"
           register, and use the shorter "sld" and "sst" instructions.
           The <b>-mep </b>option is on by default if you optimize.

       <b>-mno-prolog-function</b>
       <b>-mprolog-function</b>
           Do not use (do use) external functions to save and restore
           registers at the prologue and epilogue of a function.  The
           external functions are slower, but use less code space if
           more than one function saves the same number of registers.
           The <b>-mprolog-function </b>option is on by default if you
           optimize.

       <b>-mspace</b>
           Try to make the code as small as possible.  At present, this
           just turns on the <b>-mep </b>and <b>-mprolog-function </b>options.

       <b>-mtda=</b><i>n</i>
           Put static or global variables whose size is <i>n</i> bytes or less
           into the tiny data area that register "ep" points to.  The
           tiny data area can hold up to 256 bytes in total (128 bytes
           for byte references).

       <b>-msda=</b><i>n</i>
           Put static or global variables whose size is <i>n</i> bytes or less
           into the small data area that register "gp" points to.  The
           small data area can hold up to 64 kilobytes.

       <b>-mzda=</b><i>n</i>
           Put static or global variables whose size is <i>n</i> bytes or less
           into the first 32 kilobytes of memory.

       <b>-mv850</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850.

       <b>-mv850e3v5</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850E3V5.  The
           preprocessor constant "__v850e3v5__" is defined if this
           option is used.

       <b>-mv850e2v4</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850E3V5.  This is
           an alias for the <b>-mv850e3v5 </b>option.

       <b>-mv850e2v3</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850E2V3.  The
           preprocessor constant "__v850e2v3__" is defined if this
           option is used.

       <b>-mv850e2</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850E2.  The
           preprocessor constant "__v850e2__" is defined if this option
           is used.

       <b>-mv850e1</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850E1.  The
           preprocessor constants "__v850e1__" and "__v850e__" are
           defined if this option is used.

       <b>-mv850es</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850ES.  This is an
           alias for the <b>-mv850e1 </b>option.

       <b>-mv850e</b>
           Specify that the target processor is the V850E.  The
           preprocessor constant "__v850e__" is defined if this option
           is used.

           If neither <b>-mv850 </b>nor <b>-mv850e </b>nor <b>-mv850e1 </b>nor <b>-mv850e2 </b>nor
           <b>-mv850e2v3 </b>nor <b>-mv850e3v5 </b>are defined then a default target
           processor is chosen and the relevant <b>__v850*__ </b>preprocessor
           constant is defined.

           The preprocessor constants "__v850" and "__v851__" are always
           defined, regardless of which processor variant is the target.

       <b>-mdisable-callt</b>
       <b>-mno-disable-callt</b>
           This option suppresses generation of the "CALLT" instruction
           for the v850e, v850e1, v850e2, v850e2v3 and v850e3v5 flavors
           of the v850 architecture.

           This option is enabled by default when the RH850 ABI is in
           use (see <b>-mrh850-abi</b>), and disabled by default when the GCC
           ABI is in use.  If "CALLT" instructions are being generated
           then the C preprocessor symbol "__V850_CALLT__" is defined.

       <b>-mrelax</b>
       <b>-mno-relax</b>
           Pass on (or do not pass on) the <b>-mrelax </b>command-line option
           to the assembler.

       <b>-mlong-jumps</b>
       <b>-mno-long-jumps</b>
           Disable (or re-enable) the generation of PC-relative jump
           instructions.

       <b>-msoft-float</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Disable (or re-enable) the generation of hardware floating
           point instructions.  This option is only significant when the
           target architecture is <b>V850E2V3 </b>or higher.  If hardware
           floating point instructions are being generated then the C
           preprocessor symbol "__FPU_OK__" is defined, otherwise the
           symbol "__NO_FPU__" is defined.

       <b>-mloop</b>
           Enables the use of the e3v5 LOOP instruction.  The use of
           this instruction is not enabled by default when the e3v5
           architecture is selected because its use is still
           experimental.

       <b>-mrh850-abi</b>
       <b>-mghs</b>
           Enables support for the RH850 version of the V850 ABI.  This
           is the default.  With this version of the ABI the following
           rules apply:

           *   Integer sized structures and unions are returned via a
               memory pointer rather than a register.

           *   Large structures and unions (more than 8 bytes in size)
               are passed by value.

           *   Functions are aligned to 16-bit boundaries.

           *   The <b>-m8byte-align </b>command-line option is supported.

           *   The <b>-mdisable-callt </b>command-line option is enabled by
               default.  The <b>-mno-disable-callt </b>command-line option is
               not supported.

           When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor
           symbol "__V850_RH850_ABI__" is defined.

       <b>-mgcc-abi</b>
           Enables support for the old GCC version of the V850 ABI.
           With this version of the ABI the following rules apply:

           *   Integer sized structures and unions are returned in
               register "r10".

           *   Large structures and unions (more than 8 bytes in size)
               are passed by reference.

           *   Functions are aligned to 32-bit boundaries, unless
               optimizing for size.

           *   The <b>-m8byte-align </b>command-line option is not supported.

           *   The <b>-mdisable-callt </b>command-line option is supported but
               not enabled by default.

           When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor
           symbol "__V850_GCC_ABI__" is defined.

       <b>-m8byte-align</b>
       <b>-mno-8byte-align</b>
           Enables support for "double" and "long long" types to be
           aligned on 8-byte boundaries.  The default is to restrict the
           alignment of all objects to at most 4-bytes.  When
           <b>-m8byte-align </b>is in effect the C preprocessor symbol
           "__V850_8BYTE_ALIGN__" is defined.

       <b>-mbig-switch</b>
           Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this
           option only if the assembler/linker complain about out of
           range branches within a switch table.

       <b>-mapp-regs</b>
           This option causes r2 and r5 to be used in the code generated
           by the compiler.  This setting is the default.

       <b>-mno-app-regs</b>
           This option causes r2 and r5 to be treated as fixed
           registers.

       <i>VAX Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the VAX:

       <b>-munix</b>
           Do not output certain jump instructions ("aobleq" and so on)
           that the Unix assembler for the VAX cannot handle across long
           ranges.

       <b>-mgnu</b>
           Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that the
           GNU assembler is being used.

       <b>-mg </b>Output code for G-format floating-point numbers instead of
           D-format.

       <i>Visium Options</i>

       <b>-mdebug</b>
           A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on
           an MCM target should be linked with this option.  It causes
           the libraries libc.a and libdebug.a to be linked.  The
           program should be run on the target under the control of the
           GDB remote debugging stub.

       <b>-msim</b>
           A program which performs file I/O and is destined to run on
           the simulator should be linked with option.  This causes
           libraries libc.a and libsim.a to be linked.

       <b>-mfpu</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate code containing floating-point instructions.  This
           is the default.

       <b>-mno-fpu</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate code containing library calls for floating-point.

           <b>-msoft-float </b>changes the calling convention in the output
           file; therefore, it is only useful if you compile <i>all</i> of a
           program with this option.  In particular, you need to compile
           <i>libgcc.a</i>, the library that comes with GCC, with <b>-msoft-float</b>
           in order for this to work.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
           Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction
           scheduling parameters for machine type <i>cpu_type</i>.  Supported
           values for <i>cpu_type</i> are <b>mcm</b>, <b>gr5 </b>and <b>gr6</b>.

           <b>mcm </b>is a synonym of <b>gr5 </b>present for backward compatibility.

           By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC generates code
           for the GR5 variant of the Visium architecture.

           With <b>-mcpu=gr6</b>, GCC generates code for the GR6 variant of the
           Visium architecture.  The only difference from GR5 code is
           that the compiler will generate block move instructions.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
           Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
           <i>cpu_type</i>, but do not set the instruction set or register set
           that the option <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i> would.

       <b>-msv-mode</b>
           Generate code for the supervisor mode, where there are no
           restrictions on the access to general registers.  This is the
           default.

       <b>-muser-mode</b>
           Generate code for the user mode, where the access to some
           general registers is forbidden: on the GR5, registers r24 to
           r31 cannot be accessed in this mode; on the GR6, only
           registers r29 to r31 are affected.

       <i>VMS Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the VMS implementations:

       <b>-mvms-return-codes</b>
           Return VMS condition codes from "main". The default is to
           return POSIX-style condition (e.g. error) codes.

       <b>-mdebug-main=</b><i>prefix</i>
           Flag the first routine whose name starts with <i>prefix</i> as the
           main routine for the debugger.

       <b>-mmalloc64</b>
           Default to 64-bit memory allocation routines.

       <b>-mpointer-size=</b><i>size</i>
           Set the default size of pointers. Possible options for <i>size</i>
           are <b>32 </b>or <b>short </b>for 32 bit pointers, <b>64 </b>or <b>long </b>for 64 bit
           pointers, and <b>no </b>for supporting only 32 bit pointers.  The
           later option disables "pragma pointer_size".

       <i>VxWorks Options</i>

       The options in this section are defined for all VxWorks targets.
       Options specific to the target hardware are listed with the other
       options for that target.

       <b>-mrtp</b>
           GCC can generate code for both VxWorks kernels and real time
           processes (RTPs).  This option switches from the former to
           the latter.  It also defines the preprocessor macro
           "__RTP__".

       <b>-non-static</b>
           Link an RTP executable against shared libraries rather than
           static libraries.  The options <b>-static </b>and <b>-shared </b>can also
           be used for RTPs; <b>-static </b>is the default.

       <b>-Bstatic</b>
       <b>-Bdynamic</b>
           These options are passed down to the linker.  They are
           defined for compatibility with Diab.

       <b>-Xbind-lazy</b>
           Enable lazy binding of function calls.  This option is
           equivalent to <b>-Wl,-z,now </b>and is defined for compatibility
           with Diab.

       <b>-Xbind-now</b>
           Disable lazy binding of function calls.  This option is the
           default and is defined for compatibility with Diab.

       <i>x86 Options</i>

       These <b>-m </b>options are defined for the x86 family of computers.

       <b>-march=</b><i>cpu-type</i>
           Generate instructions for the machine type <i>cpu-type</i>.  In
           contrast to <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu-type</i>, which merely tunes the generated
           code for the specified <i>cpu-type</i>, <b>-march=</b><i>cpu-type</i> allows GCC
           to generate code that may not run at all on processors other
           than the one indicated.  Specifying <b>-march=</b><i>cpu-type</i> implies
           <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu-type</i>.

           The choices for <i>cpu-type</i> are:

           <b>native</b>
               This selects the CPU to generate code for at compilation
               time by determining the processor type of the compiling
               machine.  Using <b>-march=native </b>enables all instruction
               subsets supported by the local machine (hence the result
               might not run on different machines).  Using
               <b>-mtune=native </b>produces code optimized for the local
               machine under the constraints of the selected instruction
               set.

           <b>x86-64</b>
               A generic CPU with 64-bit extensions.

           <b>i386</b>

               Intel Pentium Pro CPU.

           <b>i686</b>
               When used with <b>-march</b>, the Pentium Pro instruction set is
               used, so the code runs on all i686 family chips.  When
               used with <b>-mtune</b>, it has the same meaning as <b>generic</b>.

           <b>pentium2</b>
               Intel Pentium II CPU, based on Pentium Pro core with MMX
               instruction set support.

       <b>-mtune=</b><i>cpu-type</i>
           Tune to <i>cpu-type</i> everything applicable about the generated
           code, except for the ABI and the set of available
           instructions.  While picking a specific <i>cpu-type</i> schedules
           things appropriately for that particular chip, the compiler
           does not generate any code that cannot run on the default
           machine type unless you use a <b>-march=</b><i>cpu-type</i> option.  For
           example, if GCC is configured for i686-pc-linux-gnu then
           <b>-mtune=pentium4 </b>generates code that is tuned for Pentium 4
           but still runs on i686 machines.

           The choices for <i>cpu-type</i> are the same as for <b>-march</b>.  In
           addition, <b>-mtune </b>supports 2 extra choices for <i>cpu-type</i>:

           <b>generic</b>
               Produce code optimized for the most common
               IA32/AMD64/EM64T processors.  If you know the CPU on
               which your code will run, then you should use the
               corresponding <b>-mtune </b>or <b>-march </b>option instead of
               <b>-mtune=generic</b>.  But, if you do not know exactly what CPU
               users of your application will have, then you should use
               this option.

               As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the
               behavior of this option will change.  Therefore, if you
               upgrade to a newer version of GCC, code generation
               controlled by this option will change to reflect the
               processors that are most common at the time that version
               of GCC is released.

               There is no <b>-march=generic </b>option because <b>-march</b>
               indicates the instruction set the compiler can use, and
               there is no generic instruction set applicable to all
               processors.  In contrast, <b>-mtune </b>indicates the processor
               (or, in this case, collection of processors) for which
               the code is optimized.

           <b>intel</b>
               Produce code optimized for the most current Intel
               processors, which are Haswell and Silvermont for this
               version of GCC.  If you know the CPU on which your code
               will run, then you should use the corresponding <b>-mtune </b>or
               <b>-march </b>option instead of <b>-mtune=intel</b>.  But, if you want
               your application performs better on both Haswell and
               Silvermont, then you should use this option.

               As new Intel processors are deployed in the marketplace,
               the behavior of this option will change.  Therefore, if
               you upgrade to a newer version of GCC, code generation
               controlled by this option will change to reflect the most
               current Intel processors at the time that version of GCC
               is released.

               There is no <b>-march=intel </b>option because <b>-march </b>indicates
               the instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no
               common instruction set applicable to all processors.  In
               contrast, <b>-mtune </b>indicates the processor (or, in this
               case, collection of processors) for which the code is
               optimized.

       <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu-type</i>
           A deprecated synonym for <b>-mtune</b>.

       <b>-mfpmath=</b><i>unit</i>
           Generate floating-point arithmetic for selected unit <i>unit</i>.
           The choices for <i>unit</i> are:

           <b>387 </b>Use the standard 387 floating-point coprocessor present
               on the majority of chips and emulated otherwise.  Code
               compiled with this option runs almost everywhere.  The
               temporary results are computed in 80-bit precision
               instead of the precision specified by the type, resulting
               in slightly different results compared to most of other
               chips.  See <b>-ffloat-store </b>for more detailed description.

               This is the default choice for non-Darwin x86-32 targets.

           <b>sse </b>Use scalar floating-point instructions present in the SSE
               instruction set.  This instruction set is supported by
               Pentium III and newer chips, and in the AMD line by
               Athlon-4, Athlon XP and Athlon MP chips.  The earlier
               version of the SSE instruction set supports only single-
               precision arithmetic, thus the double and extended-
               precision arithmetic are still done using 387.  A later
               version, present only in Pentium 4 and AMD x86-64 chips,
               supports double-precision arithmetic too.

               For the x86-32 compiler, you must use <b>-march=</b><i>cpu-type</i>,
               <b>-msse </b>or <b>-msse2 </b>switches to enable SSE extensions and
               make this option effective.  For the x86-64 compiler,
               these extensions are enabled by default.

               The resulting code should be considerably faster in the
               majority of cases and avoid the numerical instability
               problems of 387 code, but may break some existing code
               that expects temporaries to be 80 bits.

               This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler,
               Darwin x86-32 targets, and the default choice for x86-32
               targets with the SSE2 instruction set when <b>-ffast-math </b>is
               enabled.

           <b>sse,387</b>
           <b>sse+387</b>
           <b>both</b>
               Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This
               effectively doubles the amount of available registers,
               and on chips with separate execution units for 387 and
               SSE the execution resources too.  Use this option with
               care, as it is still experimental, because the GCC
               register allocator does not model separate functional
               units well, resulting in unstable performance.

       <b>-masm=</b><i>dialect</i>
           Output assembly instructions using selected <i>dialect</i>.  Also
           affects which dialect is used for basic "asm" and extended
           "asm". Supported choices (in dialect order) are <b>att </b>or <b>intel</b>.
           The default is <b>att</b>. Darwin does not support <b>intel</b>.

       <b>-mieee-fp</b>
       <b>-mno-ieee-fp</b>
           Control whether or not the compiler uses IEEE floating-point
           comparisons.  These correctly handle the case where the
           result of a comparison is unordered.

       <b>-m80387</b>
       <b>-mhard-float</b>
           Generate output containing 80387 instructions for floating
           point.

       <b>-mno-80387</b>
       <b>-msoft-float</b>
           Generate output containing library calls for floating point.

           <b>Warning: </b>the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.
           Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
           used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.
           You must make your own arrangements to provide suitable
           library functions for cross-compilation.

           On machines where a function returns floating-point results
           in the 80387 register stack, some floating-point opcodes may
           be emitted even if <b>-msoft-float </b>is used.

       <b>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</b>
           Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

           The usual calling convention has functions return values of
           types "float" and "double" in an FPU register, even if there
           is no FPU.  The idea is that the operating system should
           emulate an FPU.

           The option <b>-mno-fp-ret-in-387 </b>causes such values to be
           returned in ordinary CPU registers instead.

       <b>-mno-fancy-math-387</b>
           Some 387 emulators do not support the "sin", "cos" and "sqrt"
           instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid
           generating those instructions.  This option is overridden
           when <b>-march </b>indicates that the target CPU always has an FPU
           and so the instruction does not need emulation.  These
           instructions are not generated unless you also use the
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>switch.

       <b>-malign-double</b>
       <b>-mno-align-double</b>
           Control whether GCC aligns "double", "long double", and "long
           long" variables on a two-word boundary or a one-word
           boundary.  Aligning "double" variables on a two-word boundary
           produces code that runs somewhat faster on a Pentium at the
           expense of more memory.

           On x86-64, <b>-malign-double </b>is enabled by default.

           <b>Warning: </b>if you use the <b>-malign-double </b>switch, structures
           containing the above types are aligned differently than the
           published application binary interface specifications for the
           x86-32 and are not binary compatible with structures in code
           compiled without that switch.

       <b>-m96bit-long-double</b>
       <b>-m128bit-long-double</b>
           These switches control the size of "long double" type.  The
           x86-32 application binary interface specifies the size to be
           96 bits, so <b>-m96bit-long-double </b>is the default in 32-bit
           mode.

           Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) prefer "long double"
           to be aligned to an 8- or 16-byte boundary.  In arrays or
           structures conforming to the ABI, this is not possible.  So
           specifying <b>-m128bit-long-double </b>aligns "long double" to a
           16-byte boundary by padding the "long double" with an
           additional 32-bit zero.

           In the x86-64 compiler, <b>-m128bit-long-double </b>is the default
           choice as its ABI specifies that "long double" is aligned on
           16-byte boundary.

           Notice that neither of these options enable any extra
           precision over the x87 standard of 80 bits for a "long
           double".

           <b>Warning: </b>if you override the default value for your target
           ABI, this changes the size of structures and arrays
           containing "long double" variables, as well as modifying the
           function calling convention for functions taking "long
           double".  Hence they are not binary-compatible with code
           compiled without that switch.

       <b>-mlong-double-64</b>
       <b>-mlong-double-80</b>
       <b>-mlong-double-128</b>
           These switches control the size of "long double" type. A size
           of 64 bits makes the "long double" type equivalent to the
           "double" type. This is the default for 32-bit Bionic C
           library.  A size of 128 bits makes the "long double" type
           equivalent to the "__float128" type. This is the default for
           64-bit Bionic C library.

           <b>Warning: </b>if you override the default value for your target
           ABI, this changes the size of structures and arrays
           containing "long double" variables, as well as modifying the
           function calling convention for functions taking "long
           double".  Hence they are not binary-compatible with code
           compiled without that switch.

       <b>-malign-data=</b><i>type</i>
           Control how GCC aligns variables.  Supported values for <i>type</i>
           are <b>compat </b>uses increased alignment value compatible uses GCC
           4.8 and earlier, <b>abi </b>uses alignment value as specified by the
           psABI, and <b>cacheline </b>uses increased alignment value to match
           the cache line size.  <b>compat </b>is the default.

       <b>-mlarge-data-threshold=</b><i>threshold</i>
           When <b>-mcmodel=medium </b>is specified, data objects larger than
           <i>threshold</i> are placed in the large data section.  This value
           must be the same across all objects linked into the binary,
           and defaults to 65535.

       <b>-mrtd</b>
           Use a different function-calling convention, in which
           functions that take a fixed number of arguments return with
           the "ret <i>num"</i> instruction, which pops their arguments while
           returning.  This saves one instruction in the caller since
           there is no need to pop the arguments there.

           You can specify that an individual function is called with
           this calling sequence with the function attribute "stdcall".
           You can also override the <b>-mrtd </b>option by using the function
           attribute "cdecl".

           <b>Warning: </b>this calling convention is incompatible with the one
           normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to
           call libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

           Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions
           that take variable numbers of arguments (including "printf");
           otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those
           functions.

           In addition, seriously incorrect code results if you call a
           function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments
           are harmlessly ignored.)

       <b>-mregparm=</b><i>num</i>
           Control how many registers are used to pass integer
           arguments.  By default, no registers are used to pass
           arguments, and at most 3 registers can be used.  You can
           control this behavior for a specific function by using the
           function attribute "regparm".

           <b>Warning: </b>if you use this switch, and <i>num</i> is nonzero, then you
           must build all modules with the same value, including any
           libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup
           modules.

       <b>-msseregparm</b>
           Use SSE register passing conventions for float and double
           arguments and return values.  You can control this behavior
           for a specific function by using the function attribute
           "sseregparm".

           <b>Warning: </b>if you use this switch then you must build all
           modules with the same value, including any libraries.  This
           includes the system libraries and startup modules.

       <b>-mvect8-ret-in-mem</b>
           Return 8-byte vectors in memory instead of MMX registers.
           This is the default on Solaris 8 and 9 and VxWorks to match
           the ABI of the Sun Studio compilers until version 12.  Later
           compiler versions (starting with Studio 12 Update 1) follow
           the ABI used by other x86 targets, which is the default on
           Solaris 10 and later.  <i>Only</i> use this option if you need to
           remain compatible with existing code produced by those
           previous compiler versions or older versions of GCC.

       <b>-mpc32</b>
       <b>-mpc64</b>
       <b>-mpc80</b>
           Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits.
           When <b>-mpc32 </b>is specified, the significands of results of
           floating-point operations are rounded to 24 bits (single
           precision); <b>-mpc64 </b>rounds the significands of results of
           floating-point operations to 53 bits (double precision) and
           <b>-mpc80 </b>rounds the significands of results of floating-point
           operations to 64 bits (extended double precision), which is
           the default.  When this option is used, floating-point
           operations in higher precisions are not available to the
           programmer without setting the FPU control word explicitly.

           Setting the rounding of floating-point operations to less
           than the default 80 bits can speed some programs by 2% or
           more.  Note that some mathematical libraries assume that
           extended-precision (80-bit) floating-point operations are
           enabled by default; routines in such libraries could suffer
           significant loss of accuracy, typically through so-called
           "catastrophic cancellation", when this option is used to set
           the precision to less than extended precision.

       <b>-mstackrealign</b>
           Realign the stack at entry.  On the x86, the <b>-mstackrealign</b>
           option generates an alternate prologue and epilogue that
           realigns the run-time stack if necessary.  This supports
           mixing legacy codes that keep 4-byte stack alignment with
           modern codes that keep 16-byte stack alignment for SSE
           compatibility.  See also the attribute
           "force_align_arg_pointer", applicable to individual
           functions.

       <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</b><i>num</i>
           Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to
           <i>num</i> byte boundary.  If <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary </b>is not
           specified, the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).

           <b>Warning: </b>When generating code for the x86-64 architecture
           with SSE extensions disabled, <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</b>
           can be used to keep the stack boundary aligned to 8 byte
           boundary.  Since x86-64 ABI require 16 byte stack alignment,
           this is ABI incompatible and intended to be used in
           controlled environment where stack space is important
           limitation.  This option leads to wrong code when functions
           compiled with 16 byte stack alignment (such as functions from
           a standard library) are called with misaligned stack.  In
           this case, SSE instructions may lead to misaligned memory
           access traps.  In addition, variable arguments are handled
           incorrectly for 16 byte aligned objects (including x87 long
           double and __int128), leading to wrong results.  You must
           build all modules with <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</b>,
           including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries
           and startup modules.

       <b>-mincoming-stack-boundary=</b><i>num</i>
           Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to <i>num</i>
           byte boundary.  If <b>-mincoming-stack-boundary </b>is not
           specified, the one specified by <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary </b>is
           used.

           On Pentium and Pentium Pro, "double" and "long double" values
           should be aligned to an 8-byte boundary (see <b>-malign-double</b>)
           or suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On
           Pentium III, the Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type
           "__m128" may not work properly if it is not 16-byte aligned.

           To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the
           stack boundary must be as aligned as that required by any
           value stored on the stack.  Further, every function must be
           generated such that it keeps the stack aligned.  Thus calling
           a function compiled with a higher preferred stack boundary
           from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
           boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It is recommended
           that libraries that use callbacks always use the default
           setting.

           This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and
           generally increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to

           CLDEMOTE extended instruction sets.  Each has a corresponding
           <b>-mno- </b>option to disable use of these instructions.

           These extensions are also available as built-in functions:
           see <b>x86 Built-in Functions</b>, for details of the functions
           enabled and disabled by these switches.

           To generate SSE/SSE2 instructions automatically from
           floating-point code (as opposed to 387 instructions), see
           <b>-mfpmath=sse</b>.

           GCC depresses SSEx instructions when <b>-mavx </b>is used. Instead,
           it generates new AVX instructions or AVX equivalence for all
           SSEx instructions when needed.

           These options enable GCC to use these extended instructions
           in generated code, even without <b>-mfpmath=sse</b>.  Applications
           that perform run-time CPU detection must compile separate
           files for each supported architecture, using the appropriate
           flags.  In particular, the file containing the CPU detection
           code should be compiled without these options.

       <b>-mdump-tune-features</b>
           This option instructs GCC to dump the names of the x86
           performance tuning features and default settings. The names
           can be used in <b>-mtune-ctrl=</b><i>feature-list</i>.

       <b>-mtune-ctrl=</b><i>feature-list</i>
           This option is used to do fine grain control of x86 code
           generation features.  <i>feature-list</i> is a comma separated list
           of <i>feature</i> names. See also <b>-mdump-tune-features</b>. When
           specified, the <i>feature</i> is turned on if it is not preceded
           with <b>^</b>, otherwise, it is turned off.  <b>-mtune-ctrl=</b><i>feature-</i>
           <i>list</i> is intended to be used by GCC developers. Using it may
           lead to code paths not covered by testing and can potentially
           result in compiler ICEs or runtime errors.

       <b>-mno-default</b>
           This option instructs GCC to turn off all tunable features.
           See also <b>-mtune-ctrl=</b><i>feature-list</i> and <b>-mdump-tune-features</b>.

       <b>-mcld</b>
           This option instructs GCC to emit a "cld" instruction in the
           prologue of functions that use string instructions.  String
           instructions depend on the DF flag to select between
           autoincrement or autodecrement mode.  While the ABI specifies
           the DF flag to be cleared on function entry, some operating
           systems violate this specification by not clearing the DF
           flag in their exception dispatchers.  The exception handler
           can be invoked with the DF flag set, which leads to wrong
           direction mode when string instructions are used.  This
           option can be enabled by default on 32-bit x86 targets by
           configuring GCC with the <b>--enable-cld </b>configure option.
           Generation of "cld" instructions can be suppressed with the
           <b>-mno-cld </b>compiler option in this case.

       <b>-mvzeroupper</b>
           This option instructs GCC to emit a "vzeroupper" instruction
           before a transfer of control flow out of the function to
           minimize the AVX to SSE transition penalty as well as remove
           unnecessary "zeroupper" intrinsics.

       <b>-mprefer-avx128</b>
           This option instructs GCC to use 128-bit AVX instructions
           instead of 256-bit AVX instructions in the auto-vectorizer.

       <b>-mprefer-vector-width=</b><i>opt</i>
           This option instructs GCC to use <i>opt</i>-bit vector width in
           instructions instead of default on the selected platform.

           <b>none</b>
               No extra limitations applied to GCC other than defined by
               the selected platform.

           <b>128 </b>Prefer 128-bit vector width for instructions.

           <b>256 </b>Prefer 256-bit vector width for instructions.

           <b>512 </b>Prefer 512-bit vector width for instructions.

       <b>-mcx16</b>
           This option enables GCC to generate "CMPXCHG16B" instructions
           in 64-bit code to implement compare-and-exchange operations
           on 16-byte aligned 128-bit objects.  This is useful for
           atomic updates of data structures exceeding one machine word
           in size.  The compiler uses this instruction to implement
           <b>__sync Builtins</b>.  However, for <b>__atomic Builtins </b>operating on
           128-bit integers, a library call is always used.

       <b>-msahf</b>
           This option enables generation of "SAHF" instructions in
           64-bit code.  Early Intel Pentium 4 CPUs with Intel 64
           support, prior to the introduction of Pentium 4 G1 step in
           December 2005, lacked the "LAHF" and "SAHF" instructions
           which are supported by AMD64.  These are load and store
           instructions, respectively, for certain status flags.  In
           64-bit mode, the "SAHF" instruction is used to optimize
           "fmod", "drem", and "remainder" built-in functions; see <b>Other</b>
           <b>Builtins </b>for details.

       <b>-mmovbe</b>
           This option enables use of the "movbe" instruction to
           implement "__builtin_bswap32" and "__builtin_bswap64".

       <b>-mshstk</b>
           The <b>-mshstk </b>option enables shadow stack built-in functions
           from x86 Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET).

       <b>-mcrc32</b>
           This option enables built-in functions
           "__builtin_ia32_crc32qi", "__builtin_ia32_crc32hi",
           "__builtin_ia32_crc32si" and "__builtin_ia32_crc32di" to
           generate the "crc32" machine instruction.

       <b>-mrecip</b>
           This option enables use of "RCPSS" and "RSQRTSS" instructions
           (and their vectorized variants "RCPPS" and "RSQRTPS") with an
           additional Newton-Raphson step to increase precision instead
           of "DIVSS" and "SQRTSS" (and their vectorized variants) for
           single-precision floating-point arguments.  These
           instructions are generated only when
           <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>is enabled together with
           <b>-ffinite-math-only </b>and <b>-fno-trapping-math</b>.  Note that while
           the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
           of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the
           sequence can be decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of
           1.0 equals 0.99999994).

           Note that GCC implements "1.0f/sqrtf(<i>x)"</i> in terms of
           "RSQRTSS" (or "RSQRTPS") already with <b>-ffast-math </b>(or the
           above option combination), and doesn't need <b>-mrecip</b>.

           Also note that GCC emits the above sequence with additional
           Newton-Raphson step for vectorized single-float division and
           vectorized "sqrtf(<i>x)"</i> already with <b>-ffast-math </b>(or the above
           option combination), and doesn't need <b>-mrecip</b>.

       <b>-mrecip=</b><i>opt</i>
           This option controls which reciprocal estimate instructions
           may be used.  <i>opt</i> is a comma-separated list of options, which
           may be preceded by a <b>! </b>to invert the option:

           <b>all </b>Enable all estimate instructions.

           <b>default</b>
               Enable the default instructions, equivalent to <b>-mrecip</b>.

           <b>none</b>
               Disable all estimate instructions, equivalent to
               <b>-mno-recip</b>.

           <b>div </b>Enable the approximation for scalar division.

           <b>vec-div</b>
               Enable the approximation for vectorized division.

           <b>sqrt</b>
               Enable the approximation for scalar square root.

           <b>vec-sqrt</b>
               Enable the approximation for vectorized square root.

           So, for example, <b>-mrecip=all,!sqrt </b>enables all of the
           reciprocal approximations, except for square root.

       <b>-mveclibabi=</b><i>type</i>
           Specifies the ABI type to use for vectorizing intrinsics
           using an external library.  Supported values for <i>type</i> are
           <b>svml </b>for the Intel short vector math library and <b>acml </b>for the
           AMD math core library.  To use this option, both
           <b>-ftree-vectorize </b>and <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations </b>have to be
           enabled, and an SVML or ACML ABI-compatible library must be
           specified at link time.

           GCC currently emits calls to "vmldExp2", "vmldLn2",
           "vmldLog102", "vmldPow2", "vmldTanh2", "vmldTan2",
           "vmldAtan2", "vmldAtanh2", "vmldCbrt2", "vmldSinh2",
           "vmldSin2", "vmldAsinh2", "vmldAsin2", "vmldCosh2",

           "vmlsSin4", "vmlsAsinh4", "vmlsAsin4", "vmlsCosh4",
           "vmlsCos4", "vmlsAcosh4" and "vmlsAcos4" for corresponding
           function type when <b>-mveclibabi=svml </b>is used, and
           "__vrd2_sin", "__vrd2_cos", "__vrd2_exp", "__vrd2_log",
           "__vrd2_log2", "__vrd2_log10", "__vrs4_sinf", "__vrs4_cosf",
           "__vrs4_expf", "__vrs4_logf", "__vrs4_log2f", "__vrs4_log10f"
           and "__vrs4_powf" for the corresponding function type when
           <b>-mveclibabi=acml </b>is used.

       <b>-mabi=</b><i>name</i>
           Generate code for the specified calling convention.
           Permissible values are <b>sysv </b>for the ABI used on GNU/Linux and
           other systems, and <b>ms </b>for the Microsoft ABI.  The default is
           to use the Microsoft ABI when targeting Microsoft Windows and
           the SysV ABI on all other systems.  You can control this
           behavior for specific functions by using the function
           attributes "ms_abi" and "sysv_abi".

       <b>-mforce-indirect-call</b>
           Force all calls to functions to be indirect. This is useful
           when using Intel Processor Trace where it generates more
           precise timing information for function calls.

       <b>-mmanual-endbr</b>
           Insert ENDBR instruction at function entry only via the
           "cf_check" function attribute. This is useful when used with
           the option <b>-fcf-protection=branch </b>to control ENDBR insertion
           at the function entry.

       <b>-mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues</b>
           Due to differences in 64-bit ABIs, any Microsoft ABI function
           that calls a System V ABI function must consider RSI, RDI and
           XMM6-15 as clobbered.  By default, the code for saving and
           restoring these registers is emitted inline, resulting in
           fairly lengthy prologues and epilogues.  Using
           <b>-mcall-ms2sysv-xlogues </b>emits prologues and epilogues that use
           stubs in the static portion of libgcc to perform these saves
           and restores, thus reducing function size at the cost of a
           few extra instructions.

       <b>-mtls-dialect=</b><i>type</i>
           Generate code to access thread-local storage using the <b>gnu </b>or
           <b>gnu2 </b>conventions.  <b>gnu </b>is the conservative default; <b>gnu2 </b>is
           more efficient, but it may add compile- and run-time
           requirements that cannot be satisfied on all systems.

       <b>-mpush-args</b>
       <b>-mno-push-args</b>
           Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters.  This
           method is shorter and usually equally fast as method using
           SUB/MOV operations and is enabled by default.  In some cases
           disabling it may improve performance because of improved
           scheduling and reduced dependencies.

       <b>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</b>
           If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing
           arguments is computed in the function prologue.  This is
           faster on most modern CPUs because of reduced dependencies,
           improved scheduling and reduced stack usage when the
           preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is
           a notable increase in code size.  This switch implies
           <b>-mno-push-args</b>.

       <b>-mthreads</b>
           Support thread-safe exception handling on MinGW.  Programs
           that rely on thread-safe exception handling must compile and
           link all code with the <b>-mthreads </b>option.  When compiling,
           <b>-mthreads </b>defines <b>-D_MT</b>; when linking, it links in a special
           thread helper library <b>-lmingwthrd </b>which cleans up per-thread
           exception-handling data.

       <b>-mms-bitfields</b>
       <b>-mno-ms-bitfields</b>
           Enable/disable bit-field layout compatible with the native
           Microsoft Windows compiler.

           If "packed" is used on a structure, or if bit-fields are
           used, it may be that the Microsoft ABI lays out the structure
           differently than the way GCC normally does.  Particularly
           when moving packed data between functions compiled with GCC
           and the native Microsoft compiler (either via function call
           or as data in a file), it may be necessary to access either
           format.

           This option is enabled by default for Microsoft Windows
           targets.  This behavior can also be controlled locally by use
           of variable or type attributes.  For more information, see
           <b>x86 Variable Attributes </b>and <b>x86 Type Attributes</b>.

           The Microsoft structure layout algorithm is fairly simple
           with the exception of the bit-field packing.  The padding and
           alignment of members of structures and whether a bit-field
           can straddle a storage-unit boundary are determine by these
           rules:

           1. Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in
           which they are
               declared: the first member has the lowest memory address
               and the last member the highest.

           2. Every data object has an alignment requirement.  The
           alignment requirement
               for all data except structures, unions, and arrays is
               either the size of the object or the current packing size
               (specified with either the "aligned" attribute or the
               "pack" pragma), whichever is less.  For structures,
               unions, and arrays, the alignment requirement is the
               largest alignment requirement of its members.  Every
               object is allocated an offset so that:

                       offset % alignment_requirement == 0

           3. Adjacent bit-fields are packed into the same 1-, 2-, or
           4-byte allocation
               unit if the integral types are the same size and if the
               next bit-field fits into the current allocation unit
               without crossing the boundary imposed by the common
               alignment requirements of the bit-fields.

           MSVC interprets zero-length bit-fields in the following ways:

           1. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted between two bit-
           fields that
               are normally coalesced, the bit-fields are not coalesced.

               For example:

                       struct
                        {
                          unsigned long bf_1 : 12;
                          unsigned long : 0;
                          unsigned long bf_2 : 12;
                        } t1;

               The size of "t1" is 8 bytes with the zero-length bit-
               field.  If the zero-length bit-field were removed, "t1"'s
               size would be 4 bytes.

           2. If a zero-length bit-field is inserted after a bit-field,
           "foo", and the
               alignment of the zero-length bit-field is greater than
               the member that follows it, "bar", "bar" is aligned as
               the type of the zero-length bit-field.

               For example:

                       struct
                        {
                          char foo : 4;
                          short : 0;
                          char bar;
                        } t2;

                       struct
                        {
                          char foo : 4;
                          short : 0;
                          double bar;
                        } t3;

               For "t2", "bar" is placed at offset 2, rather than offset
               1.  Accordingly, the size of "t2" is 4.  For "t3", the
               zero-length bit-field does not affect the alignment of
               "bar" or, as a result, the size of the structure.

               Taking this into account, it is important to note the
               following:

               1. If a zero-length bit-field follows a normal bit-field,
               the type of the
                   zero-length bit-field may affect the alignment of the
                   structure as whole. For example, "t2" has a size of 4
                   bytes, since the zero-length bit-field follows a
                   normal bit-field, and is of type short.

               2. Even if a zero-length bit-field is not followed by a
               normal bit-field, it may
                   still affect the alignment of the structure:

                           struct
                            {
                              char foo : 6;
                              long : 0;
                            } t4;

                   Here, "t4" takes up 4 bytes.

           3. Zero-length bit-fields following non-bit-field members are
           ignored:
                       struct
                        {
                          char foo;
                          long : 0;
                          char bar;
                        } t5;

               Here, "t5" takes up 2 bytes.

       <b>-mno-align-stringops</b>
           Do not align the destination of inlined string operations.
           This switch reduces code size and improves performance in
           case the destination is already aligned, but GCC doesn't know
           about it.

       <b>-minline-all-stringops</b>
           By default GCC inlines string operations only when the
           destination is known to be aligned to least a 4-byte
           boundary.  This enables more inlining and increases code
           size, but may improve performance of code that depends on
           fast "memcpy", "strlen", and "memset" for short lengths.

       <b>-minline-stringops-dynamically</b>
           For string operations of unknown size, use run-time checks
           with inline code for small blocks and a library call for
           large blocks.

       <b>-mstringop-strategy=</b><i>alg</i>
           Override the internal decision heuristic for the particular
           algorithm to use for inlining string operations.  The allowed
           values for <i>alg</i> are:

           <b>rep_byte</b>
           <b>rep_4byte</b>
           <b>rep_8byte</b>
               Expand using i386 "rep" prefix of the specified size.

           <b>byte_loop</b>
           <b>loop</b>
           <b>unrolled_loop</b>
               Expand into an inline loop.

           <b>libcall</b>
               Always use a library call.

       <b>-mmemcpy-strategy=</b><i>strategy</i>
           Override the internal decision heuristic to decide if
           "__builtin_memcpy" should be inlined and what inline
           algorithm to use when the expected size of the copy operation
           is known. <i>strategy</i> is a comma-separated list of
           <i>alg</i>:<i>max_size</i>:<i>dest_align</i> triplets.  <i>alg</i> is specified in
           <b>-mstringop-strategy</b>, <i>max_size</i> specifies the max byte size
           with which inline algorithm <i>alg</i> is allowed.  For the last
           triplet, the <i>max_size</i> must be "-1". The <i>max_size</i> of the
           triplets in the list must be specified in increasing order.
           The minimal byte size for <i>alg</i> is 0 for the first triplet and
           "<i>max_size + 1"</i> of the preceding range.

       <b>-mmemset-strategy=</b><i>strategy</i>
           The option is similar to <b>-mmemcpy-strategy= </b>except that it is
           to control "__builtin_memset" expansion.

       <b>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
           Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf
           functions.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up, and
           restore frame pointers and makes an extra register available
           in leaf functions.  The option <b>-fomit-leaf-frame-pointer</b>
           removes the frame pointer for leaf functions, which might
           make debugging harder.

       <b>-mtls-direct-seg-refs</b>
       <b>-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs</b>
           Controls whether TLS variables may be accessed with offsets
           from the TLS segment register (%gs for 32-bit, %fs for
           64-bit), or whether the thread base pointer must be added.
           Whether or not this is valid depends on the operating system,
           and whether it maps the segment to cover the entire TLS area.

           For systems that use the GNU C Library, the default is on.

       <b>-msse2avx</b>
       <b>-mno-sse2avx</b>
           Specify that the assembler should encode SSE instructions
           with VEX prefix.  The option <b>-mavx </b>turns this on by default.

       <b>-mfentry</b>
       <b>-mno-fentry</b>
           If profiling is active (<b>-pg</b>), put the profiling counter call
           before the prologue.  Note: On x86 architectures the
           attribute "ms_hook_prologue" isn't possible at the moment for
           <b>-mfentry </b>and <b>-pg</b>.

       <b>-mrecord-mcount</b>
       <b>-mno-record-mcount</b>
           If profiling is active (<b>-pg</b>), generate a __mcount_loc section
           that contains pointers to each profiling call. This is useful
           for automatically patching and out calls.

       <b>-mnop-mcount</b>
       <b>-mno-nop-mcount</b>
           If profiling is active (<b>-pg</b>), generate the calls to the
           profiling functions as NOPs. This is useful when they should
           be patched in later dynamically. This is likely only useful
           together with <b>-mrecord-mcount</b>.

       <b>-minstrument-return=</b><i>type</i>
           Instrument function exit in -pg -mfentry instrumented
           functions with call to specified function. This only
           instruments true returns ending with ret, but not sibling
           calls ending with jump. Valid types are <i>none</i> to not
           instrument, <i>call</i> to generate a call to __return__, or <i>nop5</i> to
           generate a 5 byte nop.

       <b>-mrecord-return</b>
       <b>-mno-record-return</b>
           Generate a __return_loc section pointing to all return
           instrumentation code.

       <b>-mfentry-name=</b><i>name</i>
           Set name of __fentry__ symbol called at function entry for
           -pg -mfentry functions.

       <b>-mfentry-section=</b><i>name</i>
           Set name of section to record -mrecord-mcount calls (default
           __mcount_loc).

       <b>-mskip-rax-setup</b>
       <b>-mno-skip-rax-setup</b>
           When generating code for the x86-64 architecture with SSE
           extensions disabled, <b>-mskip-rax-setup </b>can be used to skip
           setting up RAX register when there are no variable arguments
           passed in vector registers.

           <b>Warning: </b>Since RAX register is used to avoid unnecessarily
           saving vector registers on stack when passing variable
           arguments, the impacts of this option are callees may waste
           some stack space, misbehave or jump to a random location.
           GCC 4.4 or newer don't have those issues, regardless the RAX
           register value.

       <b>-m8bit-idiv</b>
       <b>-mno-8bit-idiv</b>
           On some processors, like Intel Atom, 8-bit unsigned integer
           divide is much faster than 32-bit/64-bit integer divide.
           This option generates a run-time check.  If both dividend and
           divisor are within range of 0 to 255, 8-bit unsigned integer
           divide is used instead of 32-bit/64-bit integer divide.

       <b>-mavx256-split-unaligned-load</b>
       <b>-mavx256-split-unaligned-store</b>
           Split 32-byte AVX unaligned load and store.

       <b>-mstack-protector-guard=</b><i>guard</i>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><i>reg</i>
       <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><i>offset</i>
           Generate stack protection code using canary at <i>guard</i>.
           Supported locations are <b>global </b>for global canary or <b>tls </b>for
           per-thread canary in the TLS block (the default).  This
           option has effect only when <b>-fstack-protector </b>or
           <b>-fstack-protector-all </b>is specified.

           With the latter choice the options
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-reg=</b><i>reg</i> and
           <b>-mstack-protector-guard-offset=</b><i>offset</i> furthermore specify
           which segment register (%fs or %gs) to use as base register
           for reading the canary, and from what offset from that base
           register.  The default for those is as specified in the
           relevant ABI.

       <b>-mgeneral-regs-only</b>
           Generate code that uses only the general-purpose registers.
           This prevents the compiler from using floating-point, vector,
           mask and bound registers.

       <b>-mindirect-branch=</b><i>choice</i>
           Convert indirect call and jump with <i>choice</i>.  The default is
           <b>keep</b>, which keeps indirect call and jump unmodified.  <b>thunk</b>
           converts indirect call and jump to call and return thunk.
           <b>thunk-inline </b>converts indirect call and jump to inlined call
           and return thunk.  <b>thunk-extern </b>converts indirect call and
           jump to external call and return thunk provided in a separate
           object file.  You can control this behavior for a specific
           function by using the function attribute "indirect_branch".

           Note that <b>-mcmodel=large </b>is incompatible with
           <b>-mindirect-branch=thunk </b>and <b>-mindirect-branch=thunk-extern</b>
           since the thunk function may not be reachable in the large
           code model.

           Note that <b>-mindirect-branch=thunk-extern </b>is compatible with
           <b>-fcf-protection=branch </b>since the external thunk can be made
           to enable control-flow check.

       <b>-mfunction-return=</b><i>choice</i>
           Convert function return with <i>choice</i>.  The default is <b>keep</b>,
           which keeps function return unmodified.  <b>thunk </b>converts
           function return to call and return thunk.  <b>thunk-inline</b>
           converts function return to inlined call and return thunk.
           <b>thunk-extern </b>converts function return to external call and
           return thunk provided in a separate object file.  You can
           control this behavior for a specific function by using the
           function attribute "function_return".

           Note that <b>-mindirect-return=thunk-extern </b>is compatible with
           <b>-fcf-protection=branch </b>since the external thunk can be made
           to enable control-flow check.

           Note that <b>-mcmodel=large </b>is incompatible with
           <b>-mfunction-return=thunk </b>and <b>-mfunction-return=thunk-extern</b>
           since the thunk function may not be reachable in the large
           code model.

       <b>-mindirect-branch-register</b>
           Force indirect call and jump via register.

       These <b>-m </b>switches are supported in addition to the above on
       x86-64 processors in 64-bit environments.

       <b>-m32</b>
       <b>-m64</b>
       <b>-mx32</b>
       <b>-m16</b>
       <b>-miamcu</b>
           Generate code for a 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit environment.
           The <b>-m32 </b>option sets "int", "long", and pointer types to 32
           bits, and generates code that runs on any i386 system.

           The <b>-m64 </b>option sets "int" to 32 bits and "long" and pointer
           types to 64 bits, and generates code for the x86-64
           architecture.  For Darwin only the <b>-m64 </b>option also turns off
           the <b>-fno-pic </b>and <b>-mdynamic-no-pic </b>options.

           The <b>-mx32 </b>option sets "int", "long", and pointer types to 32
           bits, and generates code for the x86-64 architecture.

           The <b>-m16 </b>option is the same as <b>-m32</b>, except for that it
           outputs the ".code16gcc" assembly directive at the beginning
           of the assembly output so that the binary can run in 16-bit
           mode.

           The <b>-miamcu </b>option generates code which conforms to Intel MCU
           psABI.  It requires the <b>-m32 </b>option to be turned on.

       <b>-mno-red-zone</b>
           Do not use a so-called "red zone" for x86-64 code.  The red
           zone is mandated by the x86-64 ABI; it is a 128-byte area
           beyond the location of the stack pointer that is not modified
           by signal or interrupt handlers and therefore can be used for
           temporary data without adjusting the stack pointer.  The flag
           <b>-mno-red-zone </b>disables this red zone.

       <b>-mcmodel=small</b>
           Generate code for the small code model: the program and its
           symbols must be linked in the lower 2 GB of the address
           space.  Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can be statically or
           dynamically linked.  This is the default code model.

       <b>-mcmodel=kernel</b>
           Generate code for the kernel code model.  The kernel runs in
           the negative 2 GB of the address space.  This model has to be
           used for Linux kernel code.

       <b>-mcmodel=medium</b>
           Generate code for the medium model: the program is linked in
           the lower 2 GB of the address space.  Small symbols are also
           placed there.  Symbols with sizes larger than
           <b>-mlarge-data-threshold </b>are put into large data or BSS
           sections and can be located above 2GB.  Programs can be
           statically or dynamically linked.

       <b>-mcmodel=large</b>
           Generate code for the large model.  This model makes no
           assumptions about addresses and sizes of sections.

       <b>-maddress-mode=long</b>
           Generate code for long address mode.  This is only supported
           for 64-bit and x32 environments.  It is the default address
           mode for 64-bit environments.

       <b>-maddress-mode=short</b>
           Generate code for short address mode.  This is only supported
           for 32-bit and x32 environments.  It is the default address
           mode for 32-bit and x32 environments.

       <i>x86 Windows Options</i>

       These additional options are available for Microsoft Windows
       targets:

       <b>-mconsole</b>
           This option specifies that a console application is to be
           generated, by instructing the linker to set the PE header
           subsystem type required for console applications.  This
           option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets and is
           enabled by default on those targets.

       <b>-mdll</b>
           This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
           specifies that a DLL---a dynamic link library---is to be
           generated, enabling the selection of the required runtime
           startup object and entry point.

       <b>-mnop-fun-dllimport</b>
           This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
           specifies that the "dllimport" attribute should be ignored.

       <b>-mthread</b>
           This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies that
           MinGW-specific thread support is to be used.

       <b>-municode</b>
           This option is available for MinGW-w64 targets.  It causes
           the "UNICODE" preprocessor macro to be predefined, and
           chooses Unicode-capable runtime startup code.

       <b>-mwin32</b>
           This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
           specifies that the typical Microsoft Windows predefined
           macros are to be set in the pre-processor, but does not
           influence the choice of runtime library/startup code.

       <b>-mwindows</b>
           This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
           specifies that a GUI application is to be generated by
           instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem type
           appropriately.

       <b>-fno-set-stack-executable</b>
           This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies that
           the executable flag for the stack used by nested functions
           isn't set. This is necessary for binaries running in kernel
           mode of Microsoft Windows, as there the User32 API, which is
           used to set executable privileges, isn't available.

       <b>-fwritable-relocated-rdata</b>
           This option is available for MinGW and Cygwin targets.  It
           specifies that relocated-data in read-only section is put
           into the ".data" section.  This is a necessary for older
           runtimes not supporting modification of ".rdata" sections for
           pseudo-relocation.

       <b>-mpe-aligned-commons</b>
           This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.  It
           specifies that the GNU extension to the PE file format that
           permits the correct alignment of COMMON variables should be
           used when generating code.  It is enabled by default if GCC
           detects that the target assembler found during configuration
           supports the feature.

       These options are defined for Xstormy16:

       <b>-msim</b>
           Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the
           simulator.

       <i>Xtensa Options</i>

       These options are supported for Xtensa targets:

       <b>-mconst16</b>
       <b>-mno-const16</b>
           Enable or disable use of "CONST16" instructions for loading
           constant values.  The "CONST16" instruction is currently not
           a standard option from Tensilica.  When enabled, "CONST16"
           instructions are always used in place of the standard "L32R"
           instructions.  The use of "CONST16" is enabled by default
           only if the "L32R" instruction is not available.

       <b>-mfused-madd</b>
       <b>-mno-fused-madd</b>
           Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and
           multiply/subtract instructions in the floating-point option.
           This has no effect if the floating-point option is not also
           enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
           instructions forces the compiler to use separate instructions
           for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
           desirable in some cases where strict IEEE 754-compliant
           results are required: the fused multiply add/subtract
           instructions do not round the intermediate result, thereby
           producing results with <i>more</i> bits of precision than specified
           by the IEEE standard.  Disabling fused multiply add/subtract
           instructions also ensures that the program output is not
           sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and
           add/subtract operations.

       <b>-mserialize-volatile</b>
       <b>-mno-serialize-volatile</b>
           When this option is enabled, GCC inserts "MEMW" instructions
           before "volatile" memory references to guarantee sequential
           consistency.  The default is <b>-mserialize-volatile</b>.  Use
           <b>-mno-serialize-volatile </b>to omit the "MEMW" instructions.

       <b>-mforce-no-pic</b>
           For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code
           must be position-independent code (PIC), this option disables
           PIC for compiling kernel code.

       <b>-mtext-section-literals</b>
       <b>-mno-text-section-literals</b>
           These options control the treatment of literal pools.  The
           default is <b>-mno-text-section-literals</b>, which places literals
           in a separate section in the output file.  This allows the
           literal pool to be placed in a data RAM/ROM, and it also
           allows the linker to combine literal pools from separate
           object files to remove redundant literals and improve code
           size.  With <b>-mtext-section-literals</b>, the literals are
           interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as
           close as possible to their references.  This may be necessary
           for large assembly files.  Literals for each function are
           placed right before that function.

       <b>-mauto-litpools</b>
       <b>-mno-auto-litpools</b>
           These options control the treatment of literal pools.  The
           default is <b>-mno-auto-litpools</b>, which places literals in a
           separate section in the output file unless
           <b>-mtext-section-literals </b>is used.  With <b>-mauto-litpools </b>the
           literals are interspersed in the text section by the
           assembler.  Compiler does not produce explicit ".literal"
           directives and loads literals into registers with "MOVI"
           instructions instead of "L32R" to let the assembler do
           relaxation and place literals as necessary.  This option
           allows assembler to create several literal pools per function
           and assemble very big functions, which may not be possible
           with <b>-mtext-section-literals</b>.

       <b>-mtarget-align</b>
       <b>-mno-target-align</b>
           When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
           automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties
           at the expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts
           to widen density instructions to align branch targets and the
           instructions following call instructions.  If there are not
           enough preceding safe density instructions to align a target,
           no widening is performed.  The default is <b>-mtarget-align</b>.
           These options do not affect the treatment of auto-aligned
           instructions like "LOOP", which the assembler always aligns,
           either by widening density instructions or by inserting NOP
           instructions.

       <b>-mlongcalls</b>
       <b>-mno-longcalls</b>
           When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
           translate direct calls to indirect calls unless it can
           determine that the target of a direct call is in the range
           allowed by the call instruction.  This translation typically
           occurs for calls to functions in other source files.
           Specifically, the assembler translates a direct "CALL"
           instruction into an "L32R" followed by a "CALLX" instruction.
           The default is <b>-mno-longcalls</b>.  This option should be used in
           programs where the call target can potentially be out of
           range.  This option is implemented in the assembler, not the
           compiler, so the assembly code generated by GCC still shows
           direct call instructions---look at the disassembled object
           code to see the actual instructions.  Note that the assembler
           uses an indirect call for every cross-file call, not just
           those that really are out of range.

       <i>zSeries Options</i>

       These are listed under
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       This section describes several environment variables that affect
       how GCC operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or
       prefixes to use when searching for various kinds of files.  Some
       are used to specify other aspects of the compilation environment.

       Note that you can also specify places to search using options
       such as <b>-B</b>, <b>-I </b>and <b>-L</b>.  These take precedence over places
       specified using environment variables, which in turn take
       precedence over those specified by the configuration of GCC.

       <b>LANG</b>
       <b>LC_CTYPE</b>
       <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>
       <b>LC_ALL</b>
           These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
           localization information which allows GCC to work with
           different national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale
           categories <b>LC_CTYPE </b>and <b>LC_MESSAGES </b>if it has been configured
           to do so.  These locale categories can be set to any value
           supported by your installation.  A typical value is
           <b>en_GB.UTF-8 </b>for English in the United Kingdom encoded in
           UTF-8.

           The <b>LC_CTYPE </b>environment variable specifies character
           classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character
           boundaries in a string; this is needed for some multibyte
           encodings that contain quote and escape characters that are
           otherwise interpreted as a string end or escape.

           The <b>LC_MESSAGES </b>environment variable specifies the language
           to use in diagnostic messages.

           If the <b>LC_ALL </b>environment variable is set, it overrides the
           value of <b>LC_CTYPE </b>and <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>; otherwise, <b>LC_CTYPE </b>and
           <b>LC_MESSAGES </b>default to the value of the <b>LANG </b>environment
           variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC defaults
           to traditional C English behavior.

       <b>TMPDIR</b>
           If <b>TMPDIR </b>is set, it specifies the directory to use for
           temporary files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output
           of one stage of compilation which is to be used as input to
           the next stage: for example, the output of the preprocessor,
           which is the input to the compiler proper.

       <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b>
           Setting <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG </b>is nearly equivalent to passing
           <b>-fcompare-debug </b>to the compiler driver.  See the
           documentation of this option for more details.

       <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>
           If <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX </b>is set, it specifies a prefix to use in
           the names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No
           slash is added when this prefix is combined with the name of
           a subprogram, but you can specify a prefix that ends with a
           slash if you wish.

           If <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX </b>is not set, GCC attempts to figure out an
           appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked
           with.

           If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix,
           it tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.

           The default value of <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX </b>is <i>prefix/lib/gcc/</i> where
           <i>prefix</i> is the prefix to the installed compiler. In many cases
           <i>prefix</i> is the value of "prefix" when you ran the <i>configure</i>
           script.

           Other prefixes specified with <b>-B </b>take precedence over this
           prefix.

           This prefix is also used for finding files such as <i>crt0.o</i>
           that are used for linking.

           In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding
           the directories to search for header files.  For each of the
           standard directories whose name normally begins with
           <b>/usr/local/lib/gcc </b>(more precisely, with the value of
           <b>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</b>), GCC tries replacing that beginning with the
           specified prefix to produce an alternate directory name.
           Thus, with <b>-Bfoo/</b>, GCC searches <i>foo/bar</i> just before it
           searches the standard directory <i>/usr/local/lib/bar</i>.  If a
           standard directory begins with the configured <i>prefix</i> then the
           value of <i>prefix</i> is replaced by <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX </b>when looking
           for header files.

       <b>COMPILER_PATH</b>
           The value of <b>COMPILER_PATH </b>is a colon-separated list of
           directories, much like <b>PATH</b>.  GCC tries the directories thus
           specified when searching for subprograms, if it cannot find
           the subprograms using <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.

       <b>LIBRARY_PATH</b>
           The value of <b>LIBRARY_PATH </b>is a colon-separated list of
           directories, much like <b>PATH</b>.  When configured as a native
           compiler, GCC tries the directories thus specified when
           searching for special linker files, if it cannot find them
           using <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.  Linking using GCC also uses these
           directories when searching for ordinary libraries for the <b>-l</b>
           option (but directories specified with <b>-L </b>come first).

       <b>LANG</b>
           This variable is used to pass locale information to the
           compiler.  One way in which this information is used is to
           determine the character set to be used when character
           literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and
           C++.  When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte
           characters, the following values for <b>LANG </b>are recognized:

           <b>C-JIS</b>
               Recognize JIS characters.

           <b>C-SJIS</b>
               Recognize SJIS characters.

           <b>C-EUCJP</b>
               Recognize EUCJP characters.

           If <b>LANG </b>is not defined, or if it has some other value, then
           the compiler uses "mblen" and "mbtowc" as defined by the
           default locale to recognize and translate multibyte
           characters.

       Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
       preprocessor.

       <b>CPATH</b>
       <b>C_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
       <b>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
       <b>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</b>
           Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a
           special character, much like <b>PATH</b>, in which to look for
           header files.  The special character, "PATH_SEPARATOR", is
           target-dependent and determined at GCC build time.  For
           Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for
           almost all other targets it is a colon.

           <b>CPATH </b>specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
           specified with <b>-I</b>, but after any paths given with <b>-I </b>options
           on the command line.  This environment variable is used
           regardless of which language is being preprocessed.

           The remaining environment variables apply only when
           preprocessing the particular language indicated.  Each
           specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
           specified with <b>-isystem</b>, but after any paths given with
           <b>-isystem </b>options on the command line.

           In all these variables, an empty element instructs the
           compiler to search its current working directory.  Empty
           elements can appear at the beginning or end of a path.  For
           instance, if the value of <b>CPATH </b>is ":/special/include", that
           has the same effect as <b>-I. -I/special/include</b>.

       <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>
           If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
           dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files
           processed by the compiler.  System header files are ignored
           in the dependency output.

           The value of <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT </b>can be just a file name, in
           which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing
           the target name from the source file name.  Or the value can
           have the form <i>file target</i>, in which case the rules are
           written to file <i>file</i> using <i>target</i> as the target name.

           In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to
           combining the options <b>-MM </b>and <b>-MF</b>, with an optional <b>-MT</b>
           switch too.

       <b>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</b>
           This variable is the same as <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT </b>(see above),
           except that system header files are not ignored, so it
           implies <b>-M </b>rather than <b>-MM</b>.  However, the dependence on the
           main input file is omitted.

       <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>
           If this variable is set, its value specifies a UNIX timestamp
           to be used in replacement of the current date and time in the
           "__DATE__" and "__TIME__" macros, so that the embedded
           timestamps become reproducible.

           The value of <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH </b>must be a UNIX timestamp,
           defined as the number of seconds (excluding leap seconds)
           since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in ASCII; identical to
           the output of <b>@command{date +%s</b>} on GNU/Linux and other
           systems that support the %s extension in the "date" command.

           The value should be a known timestamp such as the last
           modification time of the source or package and it should be
           set by the build process.
