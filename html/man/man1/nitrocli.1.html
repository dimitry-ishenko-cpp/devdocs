</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       nitrocli - access Nitrokey devices
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>nitrocli </b><i>command</i> [<i>arguments</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>nitrocli </b>provides access to Nitrokey devices.  It supports the
       Nitrokey Pro, the Nitrokey Storage, and the Librem Key.  It can
       be used to access the encrypted volume, the one-time password
       generator, and the password safe.

   <b>Device selection</b>
       Per default, <b>nitrocli </b>connects to any attached Nitrokey device.
       You can use the <b>--model</b>, <b>--serial-number </b>and <b>--usb-path </b>options
       to select the device to connect to.  <b>nitrocli </b>fails if more than
       one attached Nitrokey device matches this filter or if multiple
       Nitrokey devices are attached and none of the filter options is
       set.  Use the <b>list </b>command to list all attached devices with
       their USB path, model, and serial number (if available).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-m</b>, <b>--model librem</b>|<b>pro</b>|<b>storage</b>
              Restrict connections to the given device model, see the
              Device selection section.

       <b>--serial-number </b><i>serial-number</i>
              Restrict connections to the given serial number, see the
              Device selection section.  <i>serial-number</i> must be a hex
              string with an optional 0x prefix.  This option can be set
              multiple times to allow any of the given serial numbers.
              Nitrokey Storage devices never match this restriction as
              they do not expose their serial number in the USB device
              descriptor.

       <b>--usb-path </b><i>usb-path</i>
              Restrict connections to the given USB path, see the Device
              selection section.

       <b>--no-cache</b>
              If this option is set, nitrocli will not cache any
              inquired secrets using <b>gpg-agent</b>(1) but ask for them each
              time they are needed.  Note that this option does not
              cause any cached secrets to be cleared.  If a secret is
              already in the cache it will be ignored, but left
              otherwise untouched.  Use the <b>pin clear </b>command to clear
              secrets from the cache.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Enable additional logging and control its verbosity.
              Logging enabled through this option will appear on the
              standard error stream. This option can be supplied
              multiple times. A single occurrence will show additional
              warnings.  Commands sent to the device will be shown when
              supplied three times and full device communication is
              available with four occurrences. Supplying this option
              five times enables the highest verbosity.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the nitrocli version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>General</b>
       <b>nitrocli list </b>[<b>-n</b>|<b>--no-connect</b>]
              List all attached Nitrokey devices.  This command prints a
              list of the USB path, the model and the serial number of
              all attached Nitrokey devices.  To access the serial
              number of a Nitrokey Storage device, <b>nitrocli </b>has to
              connect to it.  To omit the serial number of Nitrokey
              Storage devices instead of connecting to them, set the
              <b>--no-connect </b>option.

       <b>nitrocli status</b>
              Print the status of the connected Nitrokey device,
              including the stick serial number, the firmware version,
              and the PIN retry count. If the device is a Nitrokey
              Storage, also print storage related information including
              the SD card serial number, the SD card usage during this
              power cycle, the encryption status, and the status of the
              volumes.

       <b>nitrocli lock</b>
              Lock the Nitrokey.  This command locks the password safe
              (see the Password safe section). On the Nitrokey Storage,
              it will also close any active encrypted or hidden volumes
              (see the Storage section).

       <b>nitrocli reset </b>[<b>--only-aes-key</b>]
              Perform a factory reset on the Nitrokey.  This command
              performs a factory reset on the OpenPGP smart card, clears
              the flash storage and builds a new AES key.  The user PIN
              is reset to 123456, the admin PIN to 12345678.

              If the <b>--only-aes-key </b>option is set, the command does not
              perform a full factory reset but only creates a new AES
              key.  The AES key is for example used to encrypt the
              password safe.

              This command requires the admin PIN.  To avoid accidental
              calls of this command, the user has to enter the PIN even
              if it has been cached.

   <b>Storage</b>
       The Nitrokey Storage comes with a storage area. This area is
       comprised of an <i>unencrypted</i> region and an <i>encrypted</i> one of fixed
       sizes, each made available to the user in the form of block
       devices. The encrypted region can optionally further be overlayed
       with up to four <i>hidden</i> volumes. Because of this overlay (which is
       required to achieve plausible deniability of the existence of
       hidden volumes), the burden of ensuring that data on the
       encrypted volume does not overlap with data on one of the hidden
       volumes is on the user.

       <b>nitrocli unencrypted set </b><i>mode</i>
              Change the read-write mode of the volume.  <i>mode</i> is the
              type of the mode to change to: <b>read-write </b>to make the
              volume readable and writable or <b>read-only </b>to make it only
              readable.  This command requires the admin PIN.

              Note that this command requires firmware version 0.51 or
              higher. Earlier versions are not supported.

       <b>nitrocli encrypted open</b>
              Open the encrypted volume on the Nitrokey Storage.  The
              user PIN that is required to open the volume is queried
              using <b>pinentry</b>(1) and cached by <b>gpg-agent</b>(1).

       <b>nitrocli encrypted close</b>
              Close the encrypted volume on the Nitrokey Storage.

       <b>nitrocli hidden create </b><i>slot start end</i>
              Create a new hidden volume inside the encrypted volume.
              <i>slot</i> must indicate one of the four available slots. <i>start</i>
              and <i>end</i> represent, respectively, the start and end
              position of the hidden volume inside the encrypted volume,
              as a percentage of the encrypted volume's size.  This
              command requires a password which is later used to look up
              the hidden volume to open. Unlike a PIN, this password is
              not cached by <b>gpg-agent</b>(1).

              As a guide line for creating new hidden volumes, the
              <b>status </b>command provides a range of the SD card that has
              not been written to during this power cycle.

       <b>nitrocli hidden open</b>
              Open a hidden volume. The volume to open is determined
              based on the password entered, which must have a minimum
              of six characters. Only one hidden volume can be active at
              any point in time and previously opened volumes will be
              automatically closed. Similarly, the encrypted volume will
              be closed if it was open.

       <b>nitrocli hidden close</b>
              Close a hidden volume.

       <b>nitrocli fill </b>[<b>-a</b>|<b>--attach</b>
              Fills the SD card with random data, overwriting all
              existing data.  This operation takes about one hour to
              finish for a 16 GiB SD card.  It cannot be canceled, even
              if the <b>nitrocli </b>process is terminated before it finishes.

              This command requires the admin PIN.  To avoid accidental
              calls of this command, the user has to enter the PIN even
              if it has been cached.

              If the <b>--attach </b>option is set, this command will not start
              a new fill operation.  Instead it checks whether a fill
              operation is currently running on the device and shows its
              progress.

   <b>One-time passwords</b>
       The Nitrokey Pro, the Nitrokey Storage, and the Librem Key
       support the generation of one-time passwords using the HOTP
       algorithm according to RFC 4226 or the TOTP algorithm according
       to RFC 6238.  The required data – a name and the secret – is
       stored in slots.  Currently, the Nitrokey devices provide three
       HOTP slots and 15 TOTP slots.  The slots are numbered per
       algorithm starting at zero.

       The TOTP algorithm is a modified version of the HOTP algorithm
       that also uses the current time.  Therefore, the Nitrokey clock
       must be synchronized with the clock of the application that
       requests the one-time password.

       <b>nitrocli otp get </b><i>slot</i> [<b>-a</b>|<b>--algorithm </b><i>algorithm</i>] <b>[-t</b>|<b>--time </b><i>time</i>]
              Generate a one-time password.  <i>slot</i> is the number of the
              slot to generate the password from.  <i>algorithm</i> is the OTP
              algorithm to use.  Possible values are <b>hotp </b>for the HOTP
              algorithm according to RFC 4226 and <b>totp </b>for the TOTP
              algorithm according to RFC 6238 (default).  Per default,
              this commands sets the Nitrokey's time to the system time
              if the TOTP algorithm is selected.  If <b>--time </b>is set, it
              is set to <i>time</i> instead, which must be a Unix timestamp
              (i.e., the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00
              UTC).  This command might require the user PIN (see the
              Configuration section).

       <b>nitrocli otp set </b><i>slot name secret</i>|<b>- </b>[<b>-a</b>|<b>--algorithm </b><i>algorithm</i>]
       [<b>-d</b>|<b>--digits </b><i>digits</i>] [<b>-c</b>|<b>--counter </b><i>counter</i>] [<b>-t</b>|<b>--time-window</b>
       <i>time-window</i>] [<b>-f</b>|<b>--format ascii</b>|<b>base32</b>|<b>hex</b>]
              Configure a one-time password slot.  <i>slot</i> is the number of
              the slot to configure.  <i>name</i> is the name of the slot (may
              not be empty).  <i>secret</i> is the secret value to store in
              that slot.  If <i>secret</i> is set to <b>-</b>, the secret is read from
              the standard input.

              The <b>--format </b>option specifies the format of the secret.
              If it is set to <b>ascii</b>, each character of the given secret
              is interpreted as the ASCII code of one byte.  If it is
              set to <b>base32</b>, the secret is interpreted as a base32
              string according to RFC 4648.  If it is set to <b>hex</b>, every
              two characters are interpreted as the hexadecimal value of
              one byte.  The default value is <b>base32</b>.

              <i>algorithm</i> is the OTP algorithm to use.  Possible values
              are <b>hotp </b>for the HOTP algorithm according to RFC 4226 and
              <b>totp </b>for the TOTP algorithm according to RFC 6238
              (default).  <i>digits</i> is the number of digits the one-time
              password should have.  Allowed values are 6 and 8
              (default: 6).  <i>counter</i> is the initial counter if the HOTP
              algorithm is used (default: 0).  <i>time-window</i> is the time
              window used with TOTP in seconds (default: 30).

       <b>nitrocli otp clear </b><i>slot</i> [<b>-a</b>|<b>--algorithm </b><i>algorithm</i>]
              Delete the name and the secret stored in a one-time
              password slot.  <i>slot</i> is the number of the slot to clear.
              <i>algorithm</i> is the OTP algorithm to use.  Possible values
              are <b>hotp </b>for the HOTP algorithm according to RFC 4226 and
              <b>totp </b>for the TOTP algorithm according to RFC 6238
              (default).

       <b>nitrocli otp status </b>[<b>-a</b>|<b>--all</b>]
              List all OTP slots.  If <b>--all </b>is not set, empty slots are
              ignored.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       Nitrokey devices have four configuration settings:  the Num Lock,
       Caps Lock and Scroll Lock keys can be mapped to an HOTP slot, and
       OTP generation can be set to require the user PIN.

       <b>nitrocli config get</b>
              Print the current Nitrokey configuration.

       <b>nitrocli config set </b>[[<b>-n</b>|<b>--num-lock </b><i>slot</i>] | [<b>-N</b>|<b>--no-num-lock</b>]]
       [[<b>-c</b>|<b>--caps-lock </b><i>slot</i>] | [<b>-C</b>|<b>--no-caps-lock</b>]] [[<b>-s</b>|<b>--scroll-lock</b>
       <i>slot</i>] | [<b>-S</b>|<b>--no-scroll-lock</b>]] [[<b>-o</b>|<b>--otp-pin</b>] |
       [<b>-O</b>|<b>--no-otp-pin</b>]]
              Update the Nitrokey configuration.  This command requires
              the admin PIN.

              With the <b>--num-lock</b>, <b>--caps-lock </b>and <b>--scroll-lock</b>
              options, the respective bindings can be set.  <i>slot</i> is the
              number of the HOTP slot to bind the key to.  If <b>--no-num-</b>
              <b>lock</b>, <b>--no-caps-lock </b>or <b>--no-scroll-lock </b>is set, the
              respective binding is disabled.  The two corresponding
              options are mutually exclusive.

              If <b>--otp-pin </b>is set, the user PIN will be required to
              generate one-time passwords using the <b>otp get </b>command.  If
              <b>--no-otp-pin </b>is set, OTP generation can be performed
              without PIN.  These two options are mutually exclusive.

   <b>Password safe</b>
       The Nitrokey Pro, the Nitrokey Storage, and the Librem Key
       provide a password safe (PWS) with 16 slots.  In each of these
       slots you can store a name, a login, and a password.  The PWS is
       not encrypted, but it is protected with the user PIN by the
       firmware.  Once the PWS is unlocked by one of the commands listed
       below, it can be accessed without authentication.  You can use
       the <b>lock </b>command to lock the password safe.

       <b>nitrocli pws get </b><i>slot</i> [<b>-n</b>|<b>--name</b>] [<b>-l</b>|<b>--login</b>] [<b>-p</b>|<b>--password</b>]
       [<b>-q</b>|<b>--quiet</b>]
              Print the content of one PWS slot.  <i>slot</i> is the number of
              the slot.  Per default, this command prints the name, the
              login and the password (in that order).  If one or more of
              the options <b>--name</b>, <b>--login</b>, and <b>--password </b>are set, only
              the selected fields are printed.  The order of the fields
              never changes.

              The fields are printed together with a label.  Use the
              <b>--quiet </b>option to suppress the labels and to only output
              the values stored in the PWS slot.

       <b>nitrocli pws add </b>[<b>-s</b>|<b>--slot </b><i>slot</i>] <i>name login password</i>|<b>-</b>
              Add a new PWS slot.  If the <b>--slot </b>option is set, this
              command writes the data to the given slot and fails if the
              slot is already programmed.  If the <b>--slot </b>option is not
              set, this command locates the first free PWS slot and sets
              its content to the given values.  It fails if all PWS
              slots are programmed.

              If <i>password</i> is set to <b>-</b>, the password is read from the
              standard input.

       <b>nitrocli pws update </b><i>slot</i> [<b>-n</b>|<b>--name </b><i>name</i>] [<b>-l</b>|<b>--login </b><i>login</i>]
       [<b>-p</b>|<b>--password </b><i>password</i>|<b>-</b>]
              Update the content of a programmed PWS slot.  <i>slot</i> is the
              number of the slot to write.  This command only sets the
              data given with the <b>--name</b>, <b>--login</b>, and <b>--password</b>
              options and does not overwrite the other fields of the
              slot.

              If <i>password</i> is set to <b>-</b>, the password is read from the
              standard input.

       <b>nitrocli pws clear </b><i>slot</i>
              Delete the data stored in a PWS slot.  <i>slot</i> is the number
              of the slot clear.

       <b>nitrocli pws status </b>[<b>-a</b>|<b>--all</b>]
              List all PWS slots.  If <b>--all </b>is not set, empty slots are
              ignored.

   <b>PINs</b>
       Nitrokey devices have two PINs: the user PIN and the admin PIN.
       The user PIN must have at least six, the admin PIN at least eight
       characters. The user PIN is required for commands such as <b>otp get</b>
       (depending on the configuration) and for all <b>pws </b>commands.  The
       admin PIN is usually required to change the device configuration.

       Each PIN has a retry counter that is decreased with every wrong
       PIN entry and reset if the PIN was entered correctly.  The
       initial retry counter is three.  If the retry counter for the
       user PIN is zero, you can use the <b>pin unblock </b>command to unblock
       and reset the user PIN.  If the retry counter for the admin PIN
       is zero, you have to perform a factory reset using the <b>reset</b>
       command or <b>gpg</b>(1).  Use the <b>status </b>command to check the retry
       counters.

       <b>nitrocli pin clear</b>
              Clear the PINs cached by the other commands. Note that
              cached PINs are associated with the device they belong to
              and the <b>clear </b>command will only clear the PIN for the
              currently used device, not all others.

       <b>nitrocli pin set </b><i>type</i>
              Change a PIN.  <i>type</i> is the type of the PIN that will be
              changed:  <b>admin </b>to change the admin PIN or <b>user </b>to change
              the user PIN.  This command only works if the retry
              counter for the PIN type is at least one.  (Use the <b>status</b>
              command to check the retry counters.)

       <b>nitrocli pin unblock</b>
              Unblock and reset the user PIN.  This command requires the
              admin PIN.  The admin PIN cannot be unblocked.  This
              operation is equivalent to the unblock PIN option provided
              by <b>gpg</b>(1) (using the <b>--change-pin </b>option).

   <b>Extensions</b>
       In addition to the above built-in commands, <b>nitrocli </b>supports
       user-provided functionality in the form of extensions. An
       extension can be any executable file whose filename starts with
       "nitrocli-" and that is discoverable through lookup via the <b>PATH</b>
       environment variable. Those executables can be invoked as regular
       subcommands (without the need of the prefix; e.g., an extension
       with the name "nitrocli-otp-cache" could be invoked as "nitrocli
       otp-cache").

       More information on how to write extensions can be found in the
       Extensions section below.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIG FILE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>nitrocli </b>tries to read the configuration file at
       <b>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nitrocli/config.toml </b>(or
       <b>${HOME}/nitrocli/config.toml </b>if the <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME </b>environment
       variable is not set).  It is used to set default values for the
       options listed below.

       You can also set the environment variable <b>NITROCLI_</b><i>KEY</i> to
       overwrite the configuration for <i>key</i> (see the Environment
       section).  Note that command-line arguments overwrite both the
       configuration file and the environment variables.

       The following values can be set in the configuration file:

       <b>model  </b>Restrict connections to the given device model (string,
              default: not set, see <b>--model</b>).

       <b>serial_numbers</b>
              Restrict connections to the given serial numbers (list of
              strings, default: empty, see <b>--serial-number</b>).

       <b>usb_path</b>
              Restrict connections to the given USB path (string,
              default: not set, see <b>--usb-path</b>).

       <b>no_cache</b>
              If set to true, do not cache any inquired secrets
              (boolean, default: false, see <b>--no-cache</b>).

       <b>verbosity</b>
              Set the log level (integer, default: 0, see <b>--verbose</b>).

       The configuration file must use the TOML format, for example:
           model = "pro"
           serial_numbers = ["0xf00baa", "deadbeef"]
           usb_path = "0001:0006:02"
           no_cache = false
           verbosity = 0
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The program honors two sets of environment variables, all
       prefixed by "NITROCLI_".

   <b>Configuration</b>
       The first set controls basic configuration of the program. These
       variables mirror the respective command line options and
       configuration file settings. They are:

       <b>NITROCLI_MODEL</b>
              Restrict connections to the given device model (string,
              default: not set, see <b>--model</b>).

       <b>NITROCLI_SERIAL_NUMBERS</b>
              Restrict connections to the given list of serial numbers
              (comma-separated list of strings, default: empty, see
              <b>--serial-number</b>).

       <b>NITROCLI_USB_PATH</b>
              Restrict connections to the given USB path (string,
              default: not set, see <b>--usb-path</b>).

       <b>NITROCLI_NO_CACHE</b>
              If set to true, do not cache any inquired secrets
              (boolean, default: false, see <b>--no-cache</b>).

       <b>NITROCLI_VERBOSITY</b>
              Set the log level (integer, default: 0, see <b>--verbose</b>).

   <b>Password &amp; PIN entry</b>
       The second set can be used to provide password &amp; PIN data to the
       program to suppress interactive entry through <b>pinentry</b>(1) for
       operations that otherwise would ask for it. The following
       variables are recognized:

       <b>NITROCLI_ADMIN_PIN</b>
              The admin PIN to use.

       <b>NITROCLI_USER_PIN</b>
              The user PIN to use.

       <b>NITROCLI_NEW_ADMIN_PIN</b>
              The new admin PIN to set. This variable is only used by
              the <b>pin set </b>command for the <b>admin </b>type.

       <b>NITROCLI_NEW_USER_PIN</b>
              The new user PIN to set. This variable is only used by the
              <b>pin set </b>command for the <b>user </b>type.

       <b>NITROCLI_PASSWORD</b>
              A password used by commands that require one (e.g., <b>hidden</b>
              <b>open</b>).
</pre> <h2>
EXTENSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>nitrocli </b>supports user-provided extensions that are executable
       files whose filename starts with "nitrocli-" and that are
       discoverable through lookup via the <b>PATH </b>environment variable.

       The program conveys basic configuration information to any
       extension being started this way. Specifically, it will set each
       environment variable as described in the Configuration subsection
       of the Environment section above, if the corresponding <b>nitrocli</b>
       program configuration was set. In addition, the following
       variables will be set:

       <b>NITROCLI_BINARY</b>
              The absolute path to the <b>nitrocli </b>binary through which the
              extension was invoked. This path may be used to
              recursively invoke <b>nitrocli </b>to implement certain
              functionality.

       <b>NITROCLI_RESOLVED_USB_PATH</b>
              The USB path of the device that <b>nitrocli </b>would connect to
              based on the <b>--model</b>, <b>--serial-number</b>, and <b>--usb-path</b>
              options.  If there is no matching Nitrokey device, or if
              multiple devices match the options, the environment
              variable is not set.

       All other variables present in the environment will be passed
       through to the extension verbatim.

       Newer versions of the program reserve the right to set additional
       environment variables inside the "NITROCLI_" namespace. As such,
       extensions are advised to not define custom variables with this
       prefix. However, "NITROCLI_EXT_" is provided specifically for
       this purpose. To further avoid conflicts between extensions, it
       is recommended that this prefix be followed by the extension's
       name (uppercased).

       Extensions may optionally read or write persistent data of
       various forms.  Similar to the main program, extensions should
       follow the XDG Base Directory Specification as a guideline where
       to store such data. More specifically, the following conventions
       should be followed:

       For configuration data, <b>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/</b><i>extension/</i> is the
       preferred directory, where <i>extension</i> is the full extension name,
       including the "nitrocli-" prefix. The recommended configuration
       format is TOML. If only a single configuration file is used,
       <b>config.toml </b>is the recommended name.

       Similarly, regular data should reside in
       <b>${XDG_DATA_HOME}/</b><i>extension/</i> and cached data be stored in
       <b>${XDG_CACHE_HOME}/</b><i>extension/</i>.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nitrocli/config.toml</b>

       <b>${HOME}/nitrocli/config.toml</b>
              User configuration file, see the Config file section.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Storage</b>
       Create a hidden volume in the first available slot, starting at
       half the size of the encrypted volume (i.e., 50%) and stretching
       all the way to its end (100%):
           $ <b>nitrocli hidden create 0 50 100</b>

   <b>One-time passwords</b>
       Configure a one-time password slot with a hexadecimal secret
       representation:

           name:     example.org
           login:    john.doe
           password: passw0rd

       Copy the password to the clipboard (requires <b>xclip</b>(1)).
           $ <b>nitrocli pws get 0 --password --quiet | xclip -in</b>

       Query the PWS slots:
           $  <b>nitrocli pws status</b>
           slot name
           0    example.org
