NAME </h2>
<pre>
       m4 — macro processor
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       m4 <b>[</b>-s<b>] [</b>-D <i>name</i><b>[</b>=<i>val</i><b>]]</b>... <b>[</b>-U <i>name</i><b>]</b>... <i>file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>m4</i> utility is a macro processor that shall read one or more
       text files, process them according to their included macro
       statements, and write the results to standard output.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>m4</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       that the order of the <b>-D </b>and <b>-U </b>options shall be significant, and
       options can be interspersed with operands.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-s        </b>Enable line synchronization output for the <i>c99</i>
                 preprocessor phase (that is, <b>#line </b>directives).

       <b>-D </b><i>name</i><b>[</b>=<i>val</i><b>]</b>
                 Define <i>name</i> to <i>val</i> or to null if =<i>val</i> is omitted.

       <b>-U </b><i>name</i>   Undefine <i>name</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a text file to be processed. If no <i>file</i>
                 is given, or if it is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be
                 read.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be a text file that is used if no <i>file</i>
       operand is given, or if it is <b>'-'</b>.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input file named by the <i>file</i> operand shall be a text file.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>m4</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The standard output shall be the same as the input files, after
       being processed for macro expansion.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used to display strings with the
       <b>errprint </b>macro, macro tracing enabled by the <b>traceon </b>macro, the
       defined text for macros written by the <b>dumpdef </b>macro, or for
       diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>m4</i> utility shall compare each token from the input against
       the set of built-in and user-defined macros. If the token matches
       the name of a macro, then the token shall be replaced by the
       macro's defining text, if any, and rescanned for matching macro
       names. Once no portion of the token matches the name of a macro,
       it shall be written to standard output. Macros may have
       arguments, in which case the arguments shall be substituted into
       the defining text before it is rescanned.

       Macro calls have the form:

           <i>name</i>(<i>arg1</i>, <i>arg2</i>, ..., <i>argn</i>)

       Macro names shall consist of letters, digits, and underscores,
       where the first character is not a digit. Tokens not of this form
       shall not be treated as macros.

       The application shall ensure that the &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;
       immediately follows the name of the macro. If a token matching
       the name of a macro is not followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;, it
       is handled as a use of that macro without arguments.

       If a macro name is followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;, its
       arguments are the &lt;comma&gt;-separated tokens between the &lt;left-
       parenthesis&gt; and the matching &lt;right-parenthesis&gt;.  Unquoted
       white-space characters preceding each argument shall be ignored.
       All other characters, including trailing white-space characters,
       are retained.  &lt;comma&gt; characters enclosed between &lt;left-
       parenthesis&gt; and &lt;right-parenthesis&gt; characters do not delimit
       arguments.

       Arguments are positionally defined and referenced. The string
       <b>"$1" </b>in the defining text shall be replaced by the first
       argument. Systems shall support at least nine arguments; only the
       first nine can be referenced, using the strings <b>"$1" </b>to <b>"$9"</b>,
       inclusive. The string <b>"$0" </b>is replaced with the name of the
       macro. The string <b>"$#" </b>is replaced by the number of arguments as
       a string. The string <b>"$*" </b>is replaced by a list of all of the
       arguments, separated by &lt;comma&gt; characters. The string <b>"$@" </b>is
       replaced by a list of all of the arguments separated by &lt;comma&gt;
       characters, and each argument is quoted using the current left
       and right quoting strings. The string <b>"${" </b>produces unspecified
       behavior.

       If fewer arguments are supplied than are in the macro definition,
       the omitted arguments are taken to be null. It is not an error if
       more arguments are supplied than are in the macro definition.

       No special meaning is given to any characters enclosed between
       matching left and right quoting strings, but the quoting strings
       are themselves discarded. By default, the left quoting string
       consists of a grave accent (backquote) and the right quoting
       string consists of an acute accent (single-quote); see also the
       <b>changequote </b>macro.

       Comments are written but not scanned for matching macro names; by
       default, the begin-comment string consists of the &lt;number-sign&gt;
       character and the end-comment string consists of a &lt;newline&gt;.
       See also the <b>changecom </b>and <b>dnl </b>macros.

       The <i>m4</i> utility shall make available the following built-in
       macros. They can be redefined, but once this is done the original
       meaning is lost. Their values shall be null unless otherwise
       stated. In the descriptions below, the term <i>defining text</i> refers
       to the value of the macro: the second argument to the <b>define</b>
       macro, among other things. Except for the first argument to the
       <b>eval </b>macro, all numeric arguments to built-in macros shall be
       interpreted as decimal values. The string values produced as the
       defining text of the <b>decr</b>, <b>divnum</b>, <b>incr</b>, <b>index</b>, <b>len</b>, and <b>sysval</b>
       built-in macros shall be in the form of a decimal-constant as
       defined in the C language.

       <b>changecom </b>The <b>changecom </b>macro shall set the begin-comment and
                 end-comment strings. With no arguments, the comment
                 mechanism shall be disabled. With a single non-null
                 argument, that argument shall become the begin-comment
                 and the &lt;newline&gt; shall become the end-comment string.
                 With two non-null arguments, the first argument shall
                 become the begin-comment string and the second argument
                 shall become the end-comment string. The behavior is
                 unspecified if either argument is provided but null.
                 Systems shall support comment strings of at least five
                 characters.

       <b>changequote</b>
                 The <b>changequote </b>macro shall set the begin-quote and
                 end-quote strings. With no arguments, the quote strings
                 shall be set to the default values (that is, `'). The
                 behavior is unspecified if there is a single argument
                 or either argument is null. With two non-null
                 arguments, the first argument shall become the begin-
                 quote string and the second argument shall become the
                 end-quote string. Systems shall support quote strings
                 of at least five characters.

       <b>decr      </b>The defining text of the <b>decr </b>macro shall be its first
                 argument decremented by 1. It shall be an error to
                 specify an argument containing any non-numeric
                 characters.  The behavior is unspecified if <b>decr </b>is not
                 immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>define    </b>The second argument shall become the defining text of
                 the macro whose name is the first argument. It is
                 unspecified whether the <b>define </b>macro deletes all prior
                 definitions of the macro named by its first argument or
                 preserves all but the current definition of the macro.
                 The behavior is unspecified if <b>define </b>is not
                 immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>defn      </b>The defining text of the <b>defn </b>macro shall be the quoted
                 definition (using the current quoting strings) of its
                 arguments. The behavior is unspecified if <b>defn </b>is not
                 immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>divert    </b>The <i>m4</i> utility maintains nine temporary buffers,
                 numbered 1 to 9, inclusive.  When the last of the input
                 has been processed, any output that has been placed in
                 these buffers shall be written to standard output in
                 buffer-numerical order. The <b>divert </b>macro shall divert
                 future output to the buffer specified by its argument.
                 Specifying no argument or an argument of 0 shall resume
                 the normal output process. Output diverted to a stream
                 with a negative number shall be discarded. Behavior is
                 implementation-defined if a stream number larger than 9
                 is specified. It shall be an error to specify an
                 argument containing any non-numeric characters.

       <b>divnum    </b>The defining text of the <b>divnum </b>macro shall be the
                 number of the current output stream as a string.

       <b>dnl       </b>The <b>dnl </b>macro shall cause <i>m4</i> to discard all input
                 characters up to and including the next &lt;newline&gt;.

       <b>dumpdef   </b>The <b>dumpdef </b>macro shall write the defined text to
                 standard error for each of the macros specified as
                 arguments, or, if no arguments are specified, for all
                 macros.

       <b>errprint  </b>The <b>errprint </b>macro shall write its arguments to
                 standard error. The behavior is unspecified if <b>errprint</b>
                 is not immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>eval      </b>The <b>eval </b>macro shall evaluate its first argument as an
                 arithmetic expression, using signed integer arithmetic
                 with at least 32-bit precision. At least the following
                 C-language operators shall be supported, with
                 precedence, associativity, and behavior as described in
                 <i>Section 1.1.2.1</i>, <i>Arithmetic Precision and Operations</i>:

                     ()
                     unary +
                     unary -

                     &amp;&amp;
                     ||

                 Systems shall support octal and hexadecimal numbers as
                 in the ISO C standard.  The second argument, if
                 specified, shall set the radix for the result; if the
                 argument is blank or unspecified, the default is 10.
                 Behavior is unspecified if the radix falls outside the
                 range 2 to 36, inclusive. The third argument, if
                 specified, sets the minimum number of digits in the
                 result. Behavior is unspecified if the third argument
                 is less than zero. It shall be an error to specify the
                 second or third argument containing any non-numeric
                 characters. The behavior is unspecified if <b>eval </b>is not
                 immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>ifdef     </b>If the first argument to the <b>ifdef </b>macro is defined,
                 the defining text shall be the second argument.
                 Otherwise, the defining text shall be the third
                 argument, if specified, or the null string, if not. The
                 behavior is unspecified if <b>ifdef </b>is not immediately
                 followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>ifelse    </b>The <b>ifelse </b>macro takes three or more arguments. If the
                 first two arguments compare as equal strings (after
                 macro expansion of both arguments), the defining text
                 shall be the third argument. If the first two arguments
                 do not compare as equal strings and there are three
                 arguments, the defining text shall be null. If the
                 first two arguments do not compare as equal strings and
                 there are four or five arguments, the defining text
                 shall be the fourth argument. If the first two
                 arguments do not compare as equal strings and there are
                 six or more arguments, the first three arguments shall
                 be discarded and processing shall restart with the
                 remaining arguments. The behavior is unspecified if
                 <b>ifelse </b>is not immediately followed by a &lt;left-
                 parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>include   </b>The defining text for the <b>include </b>macro shall be the
                 contents of the file named by the first argument. It
                 shall be an error if the file cannot be read. The
                 behavior is unspecified if <b>include </b>is not immediately
                 followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>incr      </b>The defining text of the <b>incr </b>macro shall be its first
                 argument incremented by 1. It shall be an error to
                 specify an argument containing any non-numeric
                 characters.  The behavior is unspecified if <b>incr </b>is not
                 immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>index     </b>The defining text of the <b>index </b>macro shall be the first
                 character position (as a string) in the first argument
                 where a string matching the second argument begins
                 (zero origin), or -1 if the second argument does not
                 occur.  The behavior is unspecified if <b>index </b>is not
                 immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>len       </b>The defining text of the <b>len </b>macro shall be the length
                 (as a string) of the first argument.  The behavior is
                 unspecified if <b>len </b>is not immediately followed by a
                 &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>m4exit    </b>Exit from the <i>m4</i> utility. If the first argument is
                 specified, it shall be the exit code. If no argument is
                 specified, the exit code shall be zero. It shall be an
                 error to specify an argument containing any non-numeric
                 characters. If the first argument is zero or no
                 argument is specified, and an error has previously
                 occurred (for example, a <i>file</i> operand that could not be
                 opened), it is unspecified whether the exit status is
                 zero or non-zero.

       <b>m4wrap    </b>The first argument shall be processed when EOF is
                 reached. If the <b>m4wrap </b>macro is used multiple times,
                 the arguments specified shall be processed in the order
                 in which the <b>m4wrap </b>macros were processed. The behavior
                 is unspecified if <b>m4wrap </b>is not immediately followed by
                 a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>maketemp  </b>The defining text shall be the first argument, with any
                 trailing <b>'X' </b>characters replaced with the current
                 process ID as a string.  The behavior is unspecified if
                 <b>maketemp </b>is not immediately followed by a &lt;left-
                 parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>mkstemp   </b>The defining text shall be as if it were the resulting
                 pathname after a successful call to the <i>mkstemp</i>()
                 function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017 called with the first argument to the
                 macro invocation. If a file is created, that file shall
                 be closed.  If a file could not be created, the <i>m4</i>
                 utility shall write a diagnostic message to standard
                 error and shall continue processing input but its final
                 exit status shall be non-zero; the defining text of the
                 macro shall be the empty string. The behavior is
                 unspecified if <b>mkstemp </b>is not immediately followed by a
                 &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>popdef    </b>The <b>popdef </b>macro shall delete the current definition of
                 its arguments, replacing that definition with the
                 previous one. If there is no previous definition, the
                 macro is undefined. The behavior is unspecified if
                 <b>popdef </b>is not immediately followed by a &lt;left-
                 parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>pushdef   </b>The <b>pushdef </b>macro shall be equivalent to the <b>define</b>
                 macro with the exception that it shall preserve any
                 current definition for future retrieval using the
                 <b>popdef </b>macro. The behavior is unspecified if <b>pushdef </b>is
                 not immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>shift     </b>The defining text for the <b>shift </b>macro shall be a comma-
                 separated list of its arguments except the first one.
                 Each argument shall be quoted using the current quoting
                 strings.  The behavior is unspecified if <b>shift </b>is not
                 immediately followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>sinclude  </b>The <b>sinclude </b>macro shall be equivalent to the <b>include</b>
                 macro, except that it shall not be an error if the file
                 is inaccessible.  The behavior is unspecified if
                 <b>sinclude </b>is not immediately followed by a &lt;left-
                 parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>substr    </b>The defining text for the <b>substr </b>macro shall be the
                 substring of the first argument beginning at the zero-
                 offset character position specified by the second
                 argument. The third argument, if specified, shall be
                 the number of characters to select; if not specified,
                 the characters from the starting point to the end of
                 the first argument shall become the defining text. It
                 shall not be an error to specify a starting point
                 beyond the end of the first argument and the defining
                 text shall be null. It shall be an error to specify an
                 argument containing any non-numeric characters.  The
                 behavior is unspecified if <b>substr </b>is not immediately
                 followed by a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>syscmd    </b>The <b>syscmd </b>macro shall interpret its first argument as
                 a shell command line. The defining text shall be the
                 string result of that command. The string result shall
                 not be rescanned for macros while setting the defining
                 text. No output redirection shall be performed by the
                 <i>m4</i> utility. The exit status value from the command can
                 be retrieved using the <b>sysval </b>macro. The behavior is
                 unspecified if <b>syscmd </b>is not immediately followed by a
                 &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>sysval    </b>The defining text of the <b>sysval </b>macro shall be the exit
                 value of the utility last invoked by the <b>syscmd </b>macro
                 (as a string).

       <b>traceon   </b>The <b>traceon </b>macro shall enable tracing for the macros
                 specified as arguments, or, if no arguments are
                 specified, for all macros. The trace output shall be
                 written to standard error in an unspecified format.

       <b>traceoff  </b>The <b>traceoff </b>macro shall disable tracing for the macros
                 specified as arguments, or, if no arguments are
                 specified, for all macros.

       <b>translit  </b>The defining text of the <b>translit </b>macro shall be the
                 first argument with every character that occurs in the
                 second argument replaced with the corresponding
                 character from the third argument. If no replacement
                 character is specified for some source character
                 because the second argument is longer than the third
                 argument, that character shall be deleted from the
                 first argument in <b>translit</b>'s defining text. The
                 behavior is unspecified if the <b>'-' </b>character appears
                 within the second or third argument anywhere besides
                 the first or last character. The behavior is
                 unspecified if the same character appears more than
                 once in the second argument. The behavior is
                 unspecified if <b>translit </b>is not immediately followed by
                 a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>undefine  </b>The <b>undefine </b>macro shall delete all definitions
                 (including those preserved using the <b>pushdef </b>macro) of
                 the macros named by its arguments. The behavior is
                 unspecified if <b>undefine </b>is not immediately followed by
                 a &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;.

       <b>undivert  </b>The <b>undivert </b>macro shall cause immediate output of any
                 text in temporary buffers named as arguments, or all
                 temporary buffers if no arguments are specified.
                 Buffers can be undiverted into other temporary buffers.
                 Undiverting shall discard the contents of the temporary
                 buffer. The behavior is unspecified if an argument
                 contains any non-numeric characters.

EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred

       If the <b>m4exit </b>macro is used, the exit value can be specified by
       the input file.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>defn </b>macro is useful for renaming macros, especially built-
       ins.

       Since <b>eval </b>defers to the ISO C standard, some operations have
       undefined behavior. In some implementations, division or
       remainder by zero cause a fatal signal, even if the division
       occurs on the short-circuited branch of <b>"&amp;&amp;" </b>or <b>"||"</b>.  Any
       operation that overflows in signed arithmetic produces undefined
       behavior. Likewise, using the <b>shift </b>operators with a shift amount
       that is not positive and smaller than the precision is undefined,
       as is shifting a negative number to the right. Historically, not
       all implementations obeyed C-language precedence rules: <b>'~' </b>and
       <b>'!'  </b>were lower than <b>'=='</b>; <b>'==' </b>and <b>'!=' </b>were not lower than <b>'&lt;'</b>;
       and <b>'|' </b>was not lower than <b>'^'</b>; the liberal use of <b>"()" </b>can force
       the desired precedence even with these non-compliant
       implementations. Furthermore, some traditional implementations
       treated <b>'^' </b>as an exponentiation operator, although most
       implementations now use <b>"**" </b>as an extension for this purpose.

       When a macro has been multiply defined via the <b>pushdef </b>macro, it
       is unspecified whether the <b>define </b>macro will alter only the most
       recent definition (as though by <b>popdef </b>and <b>pushdef</b>), or replace
       the entire stack of definitions with a single definition (as
       though by <b>undefine </b>and <b>pushdef</b>).  An application desiring
       particular behavior for the <b>define </b>macro in this case can
       redefine it accordingly.

       Applications should use the <b>mkstemp </b>macro instead of the
       obsolescent <b>maketemp </b>macro for creating temporary files.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       If the file <b>m4src </b>contains the lines:

           The value of `VER' is "VER".
           ifdef(`VER', ``VER'' is defined to be VER., VER is not defined.)
           ifelse(VER, 1, ``VER'' is `VER'.)
           ifelse(VER, 2, ``VER'' is `VER'., ``VER'' is not 2.)
           end

       then the command

           m4 m4src

       or the command:

           m4 -U VER m4src

       produces the output:

           The value of VER is "VER".
           VER is not defined.

           VER is not 2.
           end

       The command:

           m4 -D VER m4src

       produces the output:

           The value of VER is "".
           VER is defined to be .

           VER is not 2.
           end

       The command:

           m4 -D VER=1 m4src

       produces the output:

           The value of VER is "1".
           VER is defined to be 1.
           VER is 1.
           VER is not 2.
           end

       The command:

           m4 -D VER=2 m4src

       produces the output:

           The value of VER is "2".
           VER is defined to be 2.

           VER is 2.
           end
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Historic System V-based behavior treated <b>"${" </b>in a macro
       definition as two literal characters. However, this sequence is
       left unspecified so that implementations may offer extensions
       such as <b>"${11}" </b>meaning the eleventh positional parameter. Macros
       can still be defined with appropriate uses of nested quoting to
       result in a literal <b>"${" </b>in the output after rescanning removes
       the nested quotes.

       In the <b>translit </b>built-in, historic System V-based behavior
       treated <b>'-' </b>as a literal; GNU behavior treats it as a range. This
       version of the standard allows either behavior.
