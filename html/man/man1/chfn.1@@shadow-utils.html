<span class="headline"><i>CHFN</i>(1)                       User Commands                      <i>CHFN</i>(1)</span>
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       chfn - change real user name and information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>chfn </b>[<i>options</i>] [<i>LOGIN</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>chfn </b>command changes user fullname, office room number,
       office phone number, and home phone number information for a
       user's account. This information is typically printed by
       <b>finger</b>(1) and similar programs. A normal user may only change the
       fields for her own account, subject to the restrictions in
       /etc/login.defs. (The default configuration is to prevent users
       from changing their fullname.) The superuser may change any field
       for any account. Additionally, only the superuser may use the <b>-o</b>
       option to change the undefined portions of the GECOS field.

       These fields must not contain any colons. Except for the <i>other</i>
       field, they should not contain any comma or equal sign. It is
       also recommended to avoid non-US-ASCII characters, but this is
       only enforced for the phone numbers. The <i>other</i> field is used to
       store accounting information used by other applications.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>chfn </b>command are:

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--full-name </b><i>FULL_NAME</i>
           Change the user's full name.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--home-phone </b><i>HOME_PHONE</i>
           Change the user's home phone number.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--other </b><i>OTHER</i>
           Change the user's other GECOS information. This field is used
           to store accounting information used by other applications,
           and can be changed only by a superuser.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--room </b><i>ROOM_NUMBER</i>
           Change the user's room number.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--work-phone </b><i>WORK_PHONE</i>
           Change the user's office phone number.

       If none of the options are selected, <b>chfn </b>operates in an
       interactive fashion, prompting the user with the current values
       for all of the fields. Enter the new value to change the field,
       or leave the line blank to use the current value. The current
       value is displayed between a pair of <b>[ ] </b>marks. Without options,
       <b>chfn </b>prompts for the current user account.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change
       the behavior of this tool:

       <b>CHFN_RESTRICT </b>(string)
           This parameter specifies which values in the <i>gecos</i> field of
           the /etc/passwd file may be changed by regular users using
           the <b>chfn </b>program. It can be any combination of letters <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>,
           <i>w</i>, <i>h</i>, for Full name, Room number, Work phone, and Home phone,
           respectively. For backward compatibility, <i>yes</i> is equivalent
           to <i>rwh</i> and <i>no</i> is equivalent to <i>frwh</i>. If not specified, only
           the superuser can make any changes. The most restrictive
           setting is better achieved by not installing <b>chfn </b>SUID.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /etc/login.defs
           Shadow password suite configuration.

       /etc/passwd
           User account information.
