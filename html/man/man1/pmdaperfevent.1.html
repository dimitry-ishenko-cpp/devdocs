DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaperfevent </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) that
       configures and reads the hardware performance counters using the
       Linux kernel perf_event API.

       The <b>perfevent </b>PMDA exports metrics for hardware performance
       counters that are configurable from the Linux kernel perf_event
       API.  The PMDA uses the libpfm4 library to access the hardware
       performance counters so any counters that are supported in
       libpfm4 should be available.  Also included is the ability to
       read the Intel RAPL counters via direct MSR access.  The PMDA
       supports automatically loading different counters for each
       hardware architecture.  A single configuration file is used to
       specify the desired counters for each hardware performance
       monitoring unit (PMU).  The configuration file allows different
       counters to be programmed on different CPUs and supports round-
       robin assignment of uncore counters needed for some AMD chips.

       The PMDA also counts for events exposed in the kernel via
       /sys/bus/event_source/devices directory. The PMU device name and
       the event name must be mentioned in the configuration file.
       Otherwise, the metric won't be available to monitor through this
       PMDA.

       The PMDA configures the counters to count events in both user and
       kernel mode.  This means that the hardware counters are
       unavailable to use by normal unprivileged user applications when
       they are in use by the PMDA.  The PMDA provides a mechanism to
       temporarily disable the system-wide counters in order to allow
       normal users to be able to use the counters if they wish.  See
       <a href="perfalloc.1.html">perfalloc(1)</a> for details.

       Note that <b>pmdaperfevent </b>is affected by the value of the
       <i>kernel.perf_event_paranoid</i> setting, which can be adjusted by
       <a href="../man8/sysctl.8.html">sysctl(8)</a>.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaperfevent </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>perfevent.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdaperfevent </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If
            the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the privileged "root" account.

       <b>-i   </b>listen on given port number for connection from <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>

       <b>-p   </b>communicate with <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> via stdin/stdout

       <b>-u   </b>expect <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to connect on given unix domain socket

       <b>-6   </b>expect <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> to connect on given ipv6 port (number or
            name)
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>perfevent </b>PMDA is not activated by default To install the
       PMDA, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent
            # ./Install

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdaperfevent </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

</pre> <h2>
UPGRADING </h2>
<pre>
       Some metric names have changed starting in version 3.10.8 to
       better conform to PMNS conventions.  <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> can be used
       to update old archives.  A helper utility,
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perfevent-makerewrite.pl </b>will generate a
       config file that is suitable for use with <a href="pmlogrewrite.1.html">pmlogrewrite(1)</a> to
       update the metric names in existing archives.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Each event is placed in its own group and there is no way to
       group related events together so they are guaranteed to be
       simultaneously active.  A workaround for this is to ensure that
       the number of configured events is less than or equal to the
       number of available hardware counters.  This means that the
       events will not be time-multiplexed by the kernel and will be
       simultaneously active.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
