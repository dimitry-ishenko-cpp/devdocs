NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-statoverride - override ownership and mode of files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-statoverride </b>[<i>option</i>...] <i>command</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       “<b>stat overrides</b>” are a way to tell <a href="dpkg.1.html">dpkg(1)</a> to use a different
       owner or mode for a path when a package is installed (this
       applies to any filesystem object that <b>dpkg </b>handles, including
       directories, devices, etc.).  This can be used to force programs
       that are normally setuid to be install without a setuid flag, or
       only executable by a certain group.

       <b>dpkg-statoverride </b>is a utility to manage the list of stat
       overrides.  It has three basic functions: adding, removing and
       listing overrides.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--add </b><i>user group mode path</i>
           Add an override for <i>path</i>.  <i>path</i> does not need to exist nor be
           known to <b>dpkg </b>when this command is used; the override will be
           stored and used later.  Users and groups can be specified by
           their name (for example <b>root </b>or <b>nobody</b>), or by their number
           by prepending the number with a ‘<b>#</b>’ (for example <b>#0 </b>or
           <b>#65534</b>).  The <i>mode</i> needs to be specified in octal.

           If <b>--update </b>is specified and <i>path</i> exists, it is immediately
           set to the new owner and mode.

       <b>--remove </b><i>path</i>
           Remove an override for <i>path</i>, the status of <i>path</i> is left
           unchanged by this command.

       <b>--list </b>[<i>glob-pattern</i>]
           List all overrides.  If a glob pattern is specified restrict
           the output to overrides which match the glob.

       <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--force-help</b>
           Give help about the <b>--force-</b><i>thing</i> options (since dpkg
           1.19.5).

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--admindir </b><i>directory</i>
           Set the administrative directory to <i>directory</i>.  This is where
           the <i>statoverride</i> file is stored.  Defaults to
           «<i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</i>» if <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR </b>has not been set.

       <b>--instdir </b><i>directory</i>
           Set the installation directory, which refers to the directory
           where packages get installed (since dpkg 1.19.2).  Defaults
           to «<i>/</i>» if <b>DPKG_ROOT </b>has not been set.

       <b>--root </b><i>directory</i>
           Set the root directory to <b>directory</b>, which sets the
           installation directory to «<i>directory</i>» and the administrative
           directory to «<i>directory</i><b>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg</b>» (since dpkg
           1.19.2) if <b>DPKG_ROOT </b>has not been set.

       <b>--force-</b><i>things</i>
       <b>--no-force-</b><i>things</i>, <b>--refuse-</b><i>things</i>
           Force or refuse (<b>no-force </b>and <b>refuse </b>mean the same thing) to
           do some things (since dpkg 1.19.5).  <i>things</i> is a comma
           separated list of things specified below.  <b>--force-help</b>
           displays a message describing them.  Things marked with (*)
           are forced by default.

           <b>Warning</b>: These options are mostly intended to be used by
           experts only.  Using them without fully understanding their
           effects may break your whole system.

           <b>all</b>:
               Turns on (or off) all force options.

           <b>statoverride-add</b>:
               Overwrite an existing stat override when adding it (since
               dpkg 1.19.5).

           <b>statoverride-remove</b>:
               Ignore a missing stat override when removing it (since
               dpkg 1.19.5).

           <b>security-mac</b>(*):
               Use platform-specific Mandatory Access Controls (MAC)
               based security when installing files into the filesystem
               (since dpkg 1.19.5).  On Linux systems the implementation
               uses SELinux.

           <b>not-root</b>:
               Try to (de)install things even when not root (since dpkg
               1.21.8).

       <b>--force</b>
           Force an action, even if a sanity check would otherwise
           prohibit it.  This is necessary to override an existing
           override.  This option is deprecated (since dpkg 1.19.5), it
           is replaced by <b>--force-all</b>.

       <b>--update</b>
           Immediately try to change the <i>path</i> to the new owner and mode
           if it exists.

       <b>--quiet</b>
           Be less verbose about what we do.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0   </b>The requested action was successfully performed.

       <b>1   </b>For <b>--list</b>, if there are no overrides or none match the
           supplied glob.

       <b>2   </b>Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
           usage, or interactions with the system, such as accesses to
           the database, memory allocations, etc.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
           If set and the <b>--instdir </b>or <b>--root </b>options have not been
           specified, it will be used as the filesystem root directory
           (since dpkg 1.19.2).

       <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR</b>
           If set and the <b>--admindir </b>or <b>--root </b>options have not been
           specified, it will be used as the <b>dpkg </b>data directory.

       <b>DPKG_DEBUG</b>
           Sets the debug mask (since dpkg 1.21.10) from an octal value.
           The currently accepted flags are described in the <b>dpkg</b>
           <b>--debug </b>option, but not all these flags might have an effect
           on this program.

       <b>DPKG_FORCE</b>
           If set and none of the <b>--force-</b><i>...</i> options have been
           specified, it will be used as the force options to use (since
           dpkg 1.19.5).

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.22.7).  The accepted values are:
           <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>(default).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/statoverride</i>
           File which contains the current list of stat overrides of the
           system.  It is located in the <b>dpkg </b>administration directory,
           along with other files important to <b>dpkg</b>, such as <i>status</i> or
           <i>available</i>.

           <b>Note</b>: <b>dpkg-statoverride </b>preserves the old copy of this file,
           with extension “-old”, before replacing it with the new one.
