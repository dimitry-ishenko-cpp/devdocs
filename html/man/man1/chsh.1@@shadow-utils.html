NAME </h2>
<pre>
       chsh - change login shell
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>chsh </b>[<i>options</i>] [<i>LOGIN</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>chsh </b>command changes the user login shell. This determines
       the name of the user's initial login command. A normal user may
       only change the login shell for her own account; the superuser
       may change the login shell for any account.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options which apply to the <b>chsh </b>command are:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help message and exit.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--root </b><i>CHROOT_DIR</i>
           Apply changes in the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory and use the
           configuration files from the <i>CHROOT_DIR</i> directory. Only
           absolute paths are supported.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--shell </b><i>SHELL</i>
           The name of the user's new login shell. Setting this field to
           blank causes the system to select the default login shell.

       If the <b>-s </b>option is not selected, <b>chsh </b>operates in an interactive
       fashion, prompting the user with the current login shell. Enter
       the new value to change the shell, or leave the line blank to use
       the current one. The current shell is displayed between a pair of
       <i>[ ]</i> marks.
</pre> <h2>
NOTE </h2>
<pre>
       The only restriction placed on the login shell is that the
       command name must be listed in /etc/shells, unless the invoker is
       the superuser, and then any value may be added. An account with a
       restricted login shell may not change her login shell. For this
       reason, placing /bin/rsh in /etc/shells is discouraged since
       accidentally changing to a restricted shell would prevent the
       user from ever changing her login shell back to its original
       value.

       For this reason, placing /bin/rsh in /etc/shells is discouraged
       since accidentally changing to a restricted shell would prevent
       the user from ever changing her login shell back to its original
       value.
