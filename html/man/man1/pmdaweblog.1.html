DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaweblog </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (<a href="../man3/pmda.3.html">PMDA(3)</a>) that
       scans Web server logs to extract metrics characterizing Web
       server activity.  These performance metrics are then made
       available through the infrastructure of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP).

       The <i>configfile</i> specifies which Web servers are to be monitored,
       their associated access logs and error logs, and a regular-
       expression based scheme for extracting detailed information about
       each Web access.  This file is maintained as part of the PMDA
       installation and/or de-installation by the scripts <b>Install </b>and
       <b>Remove </b>in the directory <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog</b>.  For more details,
       refer to the section below covering installation.

       Once started, <b>pmdaweblog </b>monitors a set of log files and in
       response to a request for information, will process any new
       information that has been appended to the log files, similar to a
       <a href="tail.1.html">tail(1)</a>.  There is also periodic "catch up" to process new
       information from all log files, and a scheme to detect the
       rotation of log files.

       Like all other PMDAs, <b>pmdaweblog </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> using
       command line options specified in <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i> - the
       <b>Install </b>script will prompt for appropriate values for the command
       line options, and update <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i>.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdaweblog </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-C     </b>Check the configuration and exit.

       <b>-d </b><i>domain</i>
              Specify the <i>domain</i> number.  It is absolutely crucial that
              the performance metrics <i>domain</i> number specified here is
              unique and consistent.  That is, <i>domain</i> should be
              different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
              <i>domain</i> number should be used for the <b>pmdaweblog </b>PMDA on
              all hosts.

              For most installations, the default <i>domain</i> as encapsulated
              in the file <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog/domain.h </b>will suffice.
              For alternate values, check <i>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</i> for the
              <i>domain</i> values already in use on this host, and the file
              <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/stdpmid </b>contains a repository of ``well
              known'' <i>domain</i> assignments that probably should be
              avoided.

       <b>-h </b><i>helpfile</i>
              Get the help text from the supplied <i>helpfile</i> rather than
              from the default location.

       <b>-i </b><i>port</i>
              Communicate with <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on the specified Internet <i>port</i>
              (which may be a number or a name).

       <b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>
              Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
              <i>weblog.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
              when <b>pmdaweblog </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If
              the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output
              is written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-n </b><i>idlesec</i>
              If a Web server log file has not been modified for <i>idlesec</i>
              seconds, then the file will be closed and re-opened.  This
              is the only way <b>pmdaweblog </b>can detect any asynchronous
              rotation of the logs by Web server administrative scripts.
              The default period is 20 seconds.  This value may be
              changed dynamically using <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> to modify the value
              of the performance metric <b>web.config.check</b>.

       <b>-p     </b>Communicate with <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> via a pipe.

       <b>-S </b><i>num</i> Specify the maximum number of Web servers per <i>sproc</i>.  It
              may be desirable (from a latency and load balancing
              perspective) or necessary (due to file descriptor limits)
              to delegate responsibility for scanning the Web server log
              files to several <i>sprocs</i>.  <b>pmdaweblog </b>will ensure that each
              <i>sproc</i> handles the log files for at most <i>num</i> Web servers.
              The default value is 80 Web servers per <i>sproc</i>.

       <b>-t </b><i>delay</i>
              To avoid the need to scan a lot of information from the
              Web server logs in response to a single request for
              performance metrics, all log files will be checked at
              least once every <i>delay</i> seconds.  The default is 15
              seconds.  This value may by changed dynamically using
              <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> to modify the value of the performance metric
              <b>web.config.catchup</b>.

       <b>-u </b><i>socket</i>
              Communicate with <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> via the given Unix domain <i>socket</i>.

       <b>-U     </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
              the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
              but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
              used by default.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       The PCP framework allows metrics to be collected on one host and
       monitored from another.  These hosts are referred to as <i>collector</i>
       and <i>monitor</i> hosts, respectively.  A host may be both a collector
       and a monitor.

       Collector hosts require the installation of the agent, while
       monitoring hosts require no agent installation at all.

       For collector hosts do the following as root:

         # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog
         # ./Install

       The installation procedure prompts for a default or non-default
       installation.  A default installation will search for known
       server configurations and automatically configure the PMDA for
       any server log files that are found.  A non-default installation
       will step through each server, prompting the user for other
       server configurations and arguments to <b>pmdaweblog</b>.  The end
       result of a collector installation is to build a configuration
       file that is passed to <b>pmdaweblog </b>via the <i>configfile</i> argument.

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

         # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog
         # ./Remove

       <b>pmdaweblog </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The <b>Install </b>and <b>Remove </b>scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The configuration file for the weblog PMDA is an ASCII file that
       can be easily modified.  Empty lines and lines beginning with '<b>#</b>'
       are ignored.  All other lines must be either a regular expression
       or server specification.

       Regular expressions, which are used on both the access and error
       log files, must be of the form:

         <b>regex </b><i>regexName regexp</i>
       <i>or</i>

         <b>regex_posix </b><i>regexName ordering regexp_posix</i>

       The <i>regexName</i> is a word which uniquely identifies the regular
       expression.  This is the reference used in the server
       specification.  The <i>regexp</i> for access logs is in the format
       described for <b>regcmp</b>(3).  The <i>regexp_posix</i> for access logs is in
       the format described for <a href="../man3/regcomp.3.html">regcomp(3)</a>.  The argument <i>ordering</i> is
       explained below. The <b>Posix </b>form should be available on all
       platforms.

       The regular expression requires the specification of up to four
       arguments to be extracted from each line of a Web server access
       log, depending on the type of server. In the most common case
       there are two arguments representing the method and the size.

       For the non- <b>Posix </b>version, argument <i>$0</i> should contain the
       method: <b>GET</b>, <b>HEAD , POST </b>or <b>PUT</b>.  The method <b>PUT </b>is treated as a
       synonym for <b>POST</b>, and anything else is categorized as <b>OTHER</b>.

       The second argument, <i>$1</i>, should contain the size of the request.
       A size of ``<b>-</b>'' or `` '' is treated as unknown.

       Argument <i>$3</i> should contain the status code returned to the client
       browser and argument <i>$4</i> should contain the status code returned
       to the server from a remote host.  These latter two arguments are
       used for caching servers and must be specified as a pair (or <i>$3</i>
       will be ignored). For further information on status codes, refer
       to the web site
       <b><a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html</a> </b>.

       Some legal non- <b>Posix </b>regex expression specifications for
       monitoring an access log are:

         # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape etc Access Logs
         regex CERN ] "([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+)$0 .*" [-0-9]+ ([-0-9]+)$1

         # pattern for FTP Server access logs (normally in SYSLOG)
         regex SYSLOG_FTP ftpd[.*]: ([gp][-A-Za-z]+)$0( )$1

       There is 1 special types of access logs with the <i>RegexName SQUID.</i>
       This formats extract 4 parameters but since the <b>Squid </b>log file
       uses text-based status codes, it is handled as a special case.

       In the examples below, <i>NS_PROXY</i> parses the Netscape/W3C <i>Common</i>
       <i>Extended Log Format</i> and <i>SQUID</i> parses the default Squid Object
       Cache format log file.

         # pattern for Netscape Proxy Server Extended Logs
         regex NS_PROXY ] "([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+)$0 .*" ([-0-9]+)$2 \
              ([-0-9]+)$1 ([-0-9]+)$3

         # pattern for Squid Cache logs
         regex SQUID [0-9]+.[0-9]+[ ]+[0-9]+ [a-zA-Z0-9.]+ \
              ([_A-Z]+)$3([0-9]+)$2 ([0-9]+)$1 ([A-Z]+)$0

       The <i>regexp</i> for the error logs does not require any arguments,
       only a match.  Some legal expressions are:

         # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape etc Error Logs
         regex CERN_err .

         # pattern for FTP Server error logs (normally in SYSLOG)
         regex SYSLOG_FTP_err FTP LOGIN FAILED

       If <b>POSIX </b>compliant regular expressions are used, additional
       information is required since the order of parameters cannot be
       specified in the regular expression.  For backwards
       compatibility, the common case of two parameters the order may be
       specified as <i>method,size</i> or <i>size,method</i> In the general case, the
       ordering is specified by one of the following methods:

       n1,n2,n3,n4
            where nX is a digit between 1 and 4. Each comma-separated
            field represents (in order) the argument number for
            <i>method,size,client_status,server_status</i>

       -    Used for cases like the error logs where the content is
            ignored.

       As for the non- <b>Posix </b>format, the <i>SQUID</i> RegexName is treated as a
       special case to match the non-numerical status codes.

       Some legal <b>Posix </b>regex expression specifications for monitoring
       an access log are:

         # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape, Apache etc Access Logs
         regex_posix CERN method,size ][ \]+"([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+) \
              [^"]*" [-0-9]+ ([-0-9]+)

         # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape, Apache etc Access Logs
         regex_posix CERN 1,2 ][ \]+"([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+) \
              [^"]*" [-0-9]+ ([-0-9]+)

         # pattern for FTP Server access logs (normally in SYSLOG)
         regex_posix SYSLOG_FTP method,size ftpd[.*]: \
              ([gp][-A-Za-z]+)( )

         # pattern for Netscape Proxy Server Extended Logs
         regex_posix NS_PROXY 1,3,2,4 ][ ]+"([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+) \
              [^"]*" ([-0-9]+) ([-0-9]+) ([-0-9]+)

         # pattern for Squid Cache logs
         regex_posix SQUID 4,3,2,1 [0-9]+.[0-9]+[ ]+[0-9]+ \
              [a-zA-Z0-9.]+ ([_A-Z]+)([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([A-Z]+)

         # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape etc Error Logs
         regex_posix CERN_err - .

         # pattern for FTP Server error logs (normally in SYSLOG)
         regex_posix SYSLOG_FTP_err - FTP LOGIN FAILED

       A Web server can be specified using this syntax:

         <b>server </b><i>serverName</i> <b>on</b><i>|</i><b>off </b><i>accessRegex accessFile errorRegex errorFile</i>

       The <i>serverName</i> must be unique for each server, and is the name
       given to the instance for the associated performance metrics.
       See <a href="../man3/pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> for a discussion of PCP instance domains.  The <b>on </b>or
       <b>off </b>flag indicates whether the server is to be monitored when the
       PMDA is installed.  This can altered dynamically using <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a>
       for the metric <b>web.perserver.watched</b>, which has one instance for
       each Web server named in <i>configfile</i>.

       Two files are monitored for each Web server, the access and the
       error log.  Each file requires the name of a previously declared
       regular expression, and a file name.  The log files specified for
       each server do not have to exist when the weblog PMDA is
       installed.  The PMDA will continue to check for non-existent log
       files and open them when possible.  Some legal server
       specifications are:

         # Netscape Server on Port 80 at IP address 127.55.555.555
         server 127.55.555.555:80 on CERN /logs/access CERN_err /logs/errors

         # FTP Server.
         server ftpd on SYSLOG_FTP /var/log/messages SYSLOG_FTP_err /var/log/messages
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       Specifying regular expressions with an incorrect number of
       arguments, anything other than 2 for access logs, and none for
       error logs, may cause the PMDA to behave incorrectly and even
       crash. This is due to limitations in the interface of <a href="../man3/regex.3.html">regex(3)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
