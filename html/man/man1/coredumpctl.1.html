NAME </h2>
<pre>
       coredumpctl - Retrieve and process saved core dumps and metadata
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>coredumpctl </b>[OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [PID|COMM|EXE|MATCH...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>coredumpctl </b>is a tool that can be used to retrieve and process
       core dumps and metadata which were saved by <a href="../man8/systemd-coredump.8.html">systemd-coredump(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>list</b>
           List core dumps captured in the journal matching specified
           characteristics. If no command is specified, this is the
           implied default.

           The output is designed to be human readable and contains a
           table with the following columns:

           TIME
               The timestamp of the crash, as reported by the kernel.

               Added in version 233.

           PID
               The identifier of the process that crashed.

               Added in version 233.

           UID, GID
               The user and group identifiers of the process that
               crashed.

               Added in version 233.

           SIGNAL
               The signal that caused the process to crash, when
               applicable.

               Added in version 233.

           COREFILE
               Information whether the coredump was stored, and whether
               it is still accessible: "none" means the core was not
               stored, "-" means that it was not available (for example
               because the process was not terminated by a signal),
               "present" means that the core file is accessible by the
               current user, "journal" means that the core was stored in
               the "journal", "truncated" is the same as one of the
               previous two, but the core was too large and was not
               stored in its entirety, "error" means that the core file
               cannot be accessed, most likely because of insufficient
               permissions, and "missing" means that the core was stored
               in a file, but this file has since been removed.

               Added in version 233.

           EXE
               The full path to the executable. For backtraces of
               scripts this is the name of the interpreter.

               Added in version 233.

           It's worth noting that different restrictions apply to data
           saved in the journal and core dump files saved in
           /var/lib/systemd/coredump, see overview in
           <a href="../man8/systemd-coredump.8.html">systemd-coredump(8)</a>. Thus it may very well happen that a
           particular core dump is still listed in the journal while its
           corresponding core dump file has already been removed.

           Added in version 215.

       <b>info</b>
           Show detailed information about the last core dump or core
           dumps matching specified characteristics captured in the
           journal.

           Added in version 215.

       <b>dump</b>
           Extract the last core dump matching specified
           characteristics. The core dump will be written on standard
           output, unless an output file is specified with <b>--output=</b>.

           Added in version 215.

       <b>debug</b>
           Invoke a debugger on the last core dump matching specified
           characteristics. By default, <a href="gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a> will be used. This may be
           changed using the <b>--debugger= </b>option or the <i>$SYSTEMD_DEBUGGER</i>
           environment variable. Use the <b>--debugger-arguments= </b>option to
           pass extra command line arguments to the debugger.

           Added in version 239.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer
           with hints.

       <b>--json=</b><i>MODE</i>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for
           the shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace
           or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same,
           with indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON
           output, the default).

       <b>-1</b>
           Show information of the most recent core dump only, instead
           of listing all known core dumps. Equivalent to <b>--reverse -n</b>
           <b>1</b>.

           Added in version 215.

       <b>-n </b><i>INT</i>
           Show at most the specified number of entries. The specified
           parameter must be an integer greater or equal to 1.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--since</b>
           Only print entries which are since the specified date.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--until</b>
           Only print entries which are until the specified date.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--reverse</b>
           Reverse output so that the newest entries are displayed
           first.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>-F </b><i>FIELD</i>, <b>--field=</b><i>FIELD</i>
           Print all possible data values the specified field takes in
           matching core dump entries of the journal.

           Added in version 215.

       <b>-o </b><i>FILE</i>, <b>--output=</b><i>FILE</i>
           Write the core to <b>FILE</b>.

           Added in version 215.

       <b>--debugger=</b><i>DEBUGGER</i>
           Use the given debugger for the <b>debug </b>command. If not given
           and <i>$SYSTEMD_DEBUGGER</i> is unset, then <a href="gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a> will be used.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-A </b><i>ARGS</i>, <b>--debugger-arguments=</b><i>ARGS</i>
           Pass the given <i>ARGS</i> as extra command line arguments to the
           debugger. Quote as appropriate when <i>ARGS</i> contain whitespace.
           (See Examples.)

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--file=</b><i>GLOB</i>
           Takes a file glob as an argument. If specified, coredumpctl
           will operate on the specified journal files matching <i>GLOB</i>
           instead of the default runtime and system journal paths. May
           be specified multiple times, in which case files will be
           suitably interleaved.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>-D </b><i>DIR</i>, <b>--directory=</b><i>DIR</i>
           Use the journal files in the specified <b>DIR</b>.

           Added in version 225.

       <b>--root=</b><i>ROOT</i>
           Use root directory <b>ROOT </b>when searching for coredumps.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--image=</b><i>image</i>
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If
           specified, all operations are applied to file system in the
           indicated disk image. This option is similar to <b>--root=</b>, but
           operates on file systems stored in disk images or block
           devices. The disk image should either contain just a file
           system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table,
           following the <b>Discoverable Partitions Specification</b>[1]. For
           further information on supported disk images, see
           <a href="systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a>'s switch of the same name.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--image-policy=</b><i>policy</i>
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per
           <a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy(7)</a>. The policy is enforced when
           operating on the disk image specified via <b>--image=</b>, see
           above. If not specified defaults to the "*" policy, i.e. all
           recognized file systems in the image are used.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppresses informational messages about lack of access to
           journal files and possible in-flight coredumps.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>--all</b>
           Look at all available journal files in /var/log/journal/
           (excluding journal namespaces) instead of only local ones.

           Added in version 250.
</pre> <h2>
MATCHING </h2>
<pre>
       A match can be:

       <i>PID</i>
           Process ID of the process that dumped core. An integer.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>COMM</i>
           Name of the executable (matches <b>COREDUMP_COMM=</b>). Must not
           contain slashes.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>EXE</i>
           Path to the executable (matches <b>COREDUMP_EXE=</b>). Must contain
           at least one slash.

           Added in version 215.

       <i>MATCH</i>
           General journalctl match filter, must contain an equals sign
           ("="). See <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a>.

           Added in version 215.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned; otherwise, a non-zero failure code is
       returned. Not finding any matching core dumps is treated as
       failure.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$SYSTEMD_DEBUGGER</i>
           Use the given debugger for the <b>debug </b>command. See the
           <b>--debugger= </b>option.

           Added in version 239.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Example 1. List all the core dumps of a program</b>

           $ coredumpctl list /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox
           TIME       PID  UID  GID SIG     COREFILE EXE                         SIZE
           Tue ...   8018 1000 1000 SIGSEGV missing  /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox     -
           Wed ... 251609 1000 1000 SIGTRAP missing  /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox     -
           Fri ... 552351 1000 1000 SIGSEGV present  /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox 28.7M

       The journal has three entries pertaining to
       /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox, and only the last entry still has an
       available core file (in external storage on disk).

       Note that coredumpctl needs access to the journal files to
       retrieve the relevant entries from the journal. Thus, an
       unprivileged user will normally only see information about
       crashing programs of this user.

       <b>Example 2. Invoke gdb on the last core dump</b>

           $ coredumpctl debug

       <b>Example 3. Use gdb to display full register info from the last</b>
       <b>core dump</b>

           $ coredumpctl debug --debugger-arguments="-batch -ex 'info all-registers'"

       <b>Example 4. Show information about a core dump matched by PID</b>

           $ coredumpctl info 6654
                      PID: 6654 (bash)
