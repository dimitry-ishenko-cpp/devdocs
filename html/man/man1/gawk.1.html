       gawk - pattern scanning and processing language
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>gawk </b>[ POSIX or GNU style options ] <b>-f </b><i>program-file</i> [ <b>-- </b>] file
       ...
       <b>gawk </b>[ POSIX or GNU style options ] [ <b>-- </b>] <i>program-text</i> file ...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Gawk</i> is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming
       language.  It conforms to the definition of the language in the
       POSIX 1003.1 standard.  This version in turn is based on the
       description in <i>The AWK Programming Language</i>, by Aho, Kernighan,
       and Weinberger.  <i>Gawk</i> provides the additional features found in
       the current version of Brian Kernighan's <i>awk</i> and numerous GNU-
       specific extensions.

       The command line consists of options to <i>gawk</i> itself, the AWK
       program text (if not supplied via the <b>-f </b>or <b>--include </b>options),
       and values to be made available in the <b>ARGC </b>and <b>ARGV </b>pre-defined
       AWK variables.
</pre> <h2>
PREFACE </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is intentionally as terse as possible.  Full
       details are provided in <i>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</i>, and you
       should look there for the full story on any specific feature.
       Where possible, links to the online version of the manual are
       provided.
</pre> <h2>
OPTION FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Gawk</i> options may be either traditional POSIX-style one letter
       options, or GNU-style long options.  POSIX options start with a
       single “-”, while long options start with “--”.  Long options are
       provided for both GNU-specific features and for POSIX-mandated
       features.

       <i>Gawk</i>-specific options are typically used in long-option form.
       Arguments to long options are either joined with the option by an
       <b>= </b>sign, with no intervening spaces, or they may be provided in
       the next command line argument.  Long options may be abbreviated,
       as long as the abbreviation remains unique.

       Additionally, every long option has a corresponding short option,
       so that the option's functionality may be used from within <b>#!</b>
       executable scripts.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Gawk</i> accepts the following options.  Standard options are listed
       first, followed by options for <i>gawk</i> extensions, listed
       alphabetically by short option.

       <b>-f </b><i>program-file</i>, <b>--file </b><i>program-file</i>
              Read the AWK program source from the file <i>program-file</i>,
              instead of from the first command line argument.  Multiple
              <b>-f </b>options may be used.  Files read with <b>-f </b>are treated as
              if they begin with an implicit <b>@namespace "awk" </b>statement.

       <b>-F </b><i>fs</i>, <b>--field-separator </b><i>fs</i>
              Use <i>fs</i> for the input field separator (the value of the <b>FS</b>
              predefined variable).

       <b>-v </b><i>var</i><b>=</b><i>val</i>, <b>--assign </b><i>var</i><b>=</b><i>val</i>
              Assign the value <i>val</i> to the variable <i>var</i>, before execution
              of the program begins.  Such variable values are available
              to the <b>BEGIN </b>rule of an AWK program.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--characters-as-bytes</b>
              Treat all input data as single-byte characters.  The
              <b>--posix </b>option overrides this one.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--traditional</b>
              Run in <i>compatibility</i> mode.  In compatibility mode, <i>gawk</i>
              behaves identically to Brian Kernighan's <i>awk</i>; none of the
              GNU-specific extensions are recognized.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--copyright</b>
              Print the short version of the GNU copyright information
              message on the standard output and exit successfully.

       <b>-d</b>[<i>file</i>], <b>--dump-variables</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Print a sorted list of global variables, their types and
              final values to <i>file</i>.  The default file is <b>awkvars.out </b>in
              the current directory.

       <b>-D</b>[<i>file</i>], <b>--debug</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Enable debugging of AWK programs.  By default, the
              debugger reads commands interactively from the keyboard
              (standard input).  The optional <i>file</i> argument specifies a
              file with a list of commands for the debugger to execute
              non-interactively.
              In this mode of execution, <i>gawk</i> loads the AWK source code
              and then prompts for debugging commands.  <i>Gawk</i> can only
              debug AWK program source provided with the <b>-f </b>and
              <b>--include </b>options.  The debugger is documented in <i>GAWK:</i>
              <i>Effective AWK Programming</i>; see
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Debugger.html#Debugger">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Debugger.html#Debugger</a> </i>.

       <b>-e </b><i>program-text</i>, <b>--source </b><i>program-text</i>
              Use <i>program-text</i> as AWK program source code.  Each
              argument supplied via <b>-e </b>is treated as if it begins with
              an implicit <b>@namespace "awk" </b>statement.

       <b>-E </b><i>file</i>, <b>--exec </b><i>file</i>
              Similar to <b>-f</b>, however, this option is the last one
              processed.  This should be used with <b>#!  </b>scripts,
              particularly for CGI applications, to avoid passing in
              options or source code (!) on the command line from a URL.
              This option disables command-line variable assignments.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gen-pot</b>
              Scan and parse the AWK program, and generate a GNU <b>.pot</b>
              (Portable Object Template) format file on standard output
              with entries for all localizable strings in the program.
              The program itself is not executed.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a relatively short summary of the available options
              on the standard output.  Per the <i>GNU Coding Standards</i>,
              these options cause an immediate, successful exit.

       <b>-i </b><i>include-file</i>, <b>--include </b><i>include-file</i>
              Load an awk source library.  This searches for the library
              using the <b>AWKPATH </b>environment variable.  If the initial
              search fails, another attempt will be made after appending
              the <b>.awk </b>suffix.  The file will be loaded only once (i.e.,
              duplicates are eliminated), and the code does not
              constitute the main program source.  Files read with
              <b>--include </b>are treated as if they begin with an implicit
              <b>@namespace "awk" </b>statement.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--trace</b>
              Print the internal byte code names as they are executed
              when running the program. The trace is printed to standard
              error. Each ``op code'' is preceded by a <b>+ </b>sign in the
              output.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--csv</b>
              Enable CSV special processing.  See <b>Comma Separated</b>
              <b>Values</b>, below, for more detail.

       <b>-l </b><i>lib</i>, <b>--load </b><i>lib</i>
              Load a <i>gawk</i> extension from the shared library <i>lib</i>.  This
              searches for the library using the <b>AWKLIBPATH </b>environment
              variable.  If the initial search fails, another attempt
              will be made after appending the default shared library
              suffix for the platform.  The library initialization
              routine is expected to be named <b>dl_load()</b>.

       <b>-L </b>[<i>value</i>], <b>--lint</b>[<b>=</b><i>value</i>]
              Provide warnings about constructs that are dubious or non-
              portable to other AWK implementations.  See
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Options.html#Options">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Options.html#Options</a> </i>
              for the list of possible values for <i>value</i>.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--bignum</b>
              Force arbitrary precision arithmetic on numbers. This
              option has no effect if <i>gawk</i> is not compiled to use the
              GNU MPFR and GMP libraries.  (In such a case, <i>gawk</i> issues
              a warning.)

              <b>NOTE: </b>This feature is <i>on parole</i>.  The primary <i>gawk</i>
              maintainer is no longer supporting it, although there is a
              member of the development team who is. If this situation
              changes, the feature will be removed from <i>gawk</i>.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--non-decimal-data</b>
              Recognize octal and hexadecimal values in input data.  <i>Use</i>
              <i>this option with great caution!</i>

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--use-lc-numeric</b>
              Force <i>gawk</i> to use the locale's decimal point character
              when parsing input data.

       <b>-o</b>[<i>file</i>], <b>--pretty-print</b>[<b>=</b><i>file</i>]
              Output a pretty printed version of the program to <i>file</i>.
              The default file is <b>awkprof.out </b>in the current directory.
              This option implies <b>--no-optimize</b>.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--optimize</b>
              Enable <i>gawk</i>'s default optimizations upon the internal
              representation of the program.  This option is on by
              default.

       <b>-p</b>[<i>prof-file</i>], <b>--profile</b>[<b>=</b><i>prof-file</i>]
              Start a profiling session, and send the profiling data to
              <i>prof-file</i>.  The default is <b>awkprof.out </b>in the current
              directory.  The profile contains execution counts of each
              statement in the program in the left margin and function
              call counts for each user-defined function.  <i>Gawk</i> runs
              more slowly in this mode.  This option implies
              <b>--no-optimize</b>.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--posix</b>
              This turns on <i>compatibility</i> mode, and disables a number of
              common extensions.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--re-interval</b>
              Enable the use of <i>interval expressions</i> in regular
              expression matching.  Interval expressions are enabled by
              default, but this option remains for backwards
              compatibility.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--no-optimize</b>
              Disable <i>gawk</i>'s default optimizations upon the internal
              representation of the program.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--sandbox</b>
              Run <i>gawk</i> in sandbox mode, disabling the <b>system() </b>function,
              input redirection with <b>getline</b>, output redirection with
              <b>print </b>and <b>printf</b>, and loading dynamic extensions.  Command
              execution (through pipelines) is also disabled.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--lint-old</b>
              Provide warnings about constructs that are not portable to
              the original version of UNIX <i>awk</i>.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print version information for this particular copy of <i>gawk</i>
              on the standard output.  This is useful when reporting
              bugs.  Per the <i>GNU Coding Standards</i>, these options cause
              an immediate, successful exit.

       <b>--     </b>Signal the end of options. This is useful to allow further
              arguments to the AWK program itself to start with a “-”.

       In compatibility mode, any other options are flagged as invalid,
       but are otherwise ignored.  In normal operation, as long as
       program text has been supplied, unknown options are passed on to
       the AWK program in the <b>ARGV </b>array for processing.

       For POSIX compatibility, the <b>-W </b>option may be used, followed by
       the name of a long option.
</pre> <h2>
AWK PROGRAM EXECUTION </h2>
<pre>
       An AWK program consists of a sequence of optional directives,
       pattern-action statements, and optional function definitions.

              <b>@include "</b><i>filename</i><b>"</b>
              <b>@load "</b><i>filename</i><b>"</b>
              <b>@namespace "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b>
              <i>pattern</i>   <b>{ </b><i>action statements</i> <b>}</b>
              <b>function </b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>parameter list</i><b>) { </b><i>statements</i> <b>}</b>

       <i>Gawk</i> first reads the program source from the <i>program-file</i>(s) if
       specified, from arguments to <b>--source</b>, or from the first non-
       option argument on the command line.  The <b>-f </b>and <b>--source </b>options
       may be used multiple times on the command line.  <i>Gawk</i> reads the
       program text as if all the <i>program-file</i>s and command line source
       texts had been concatenated together.

       In addition, lines beginning with <b>@include </b>may be used to include
       other source files into your program.  This is equivalent to
       using the <b>--include </b>option.

       Lines beginning with <b>@load </b>may be used to load extension
       functions into your program.  This is equivalent to using the
       <b>--load </b>option.

       The environment variable <b>AWKPATH </b>specifies a search path to use
       when finding source files named with the <b>-f </b>and <b>--include</b>
       options.  If this variable does not exist, the default path is
       <b>".:/usr/local/share/awk"</b>.  (The actual directory may vary,
       depending upon how <i>gawk</i> was built and installed.)  If a file name
       given to the <b>-f </b>option contains a “/” character, no path search
       is performed.

       The environment variable <b>AWKLIBPATH </b>specifies a search path to
       use when finding source files named with the <b>--load </b>option.  If
       this variable does not exist, the default path is
       <b>"/usr/local/lib/gawk"</b>.  (The actual directory may vary, depending
       upon how <i>gawk</i> was built and installed.)

       <i>Gawk</i> executes AWK programs in the following order.  First, all
       variable assignments specified via the <b>-v </b>option are performed.
       Next, <i>gawk</i> compiles the program into an internal form.  Then,
       <i>gawk</i> executes the code in the <b>BEGIN </b>rule(s) (if any), and then
       proceeds to read each file named in the <b>ARGV </b>array (up to
       <b>ARGV[ARGC-1]</b>).  If there are no files named on the command line,
       <i>gawk</i> reads the standard input.

       If a filename on the command line has the form <i>var</i><b>=</b><i>val</i> it is
       treated as a variable assignment.  The variable <i>var</i> will be
       assigned the value <i>val</i>.  (This happens after any <b>BEGIN </b>rule(s)
       have been run.)

       If the value of a particular element of <b>ARGV </b>is empty (<b>""</b>), <i>gawk</i>
       skips over it.

       For each input file, if a <b>BEGINFILE </b>rule exists, <i>gawk</i> executes
       the associated code before processing the contents of the file.
       Similarly, <i>gawk</i> executes the code associated with <b>ENDFILE </b>rules
       after processing the file.

       For each record in the input, <i>gawk</i> tests to see if it matches any
       <i>pattern</i> in the AWK program.  For each pattern that the record
       matches, <i>gawk</i> executes the associated <i>action</i>.  The patterns are
       tested in the order they occur in the program.

       Finally, after all the input is exhausted, <i>gawk</i> executes the code
       in the <b>END </b>rule(s) (if any).

   <b>Command Line Directories</b>
       According to POSIX, files named on the <i>awk</i> command line must be
       text files.  The behavior is ``undefined'' if they are not.  Most
       versions of <i>awk</i> treat a directory on the command line as a fatal
       error.

       For <i>gawk</i>, a directory on the command line produces a warning, but
       is otherwise skipped.  If either of the <b>--posix </b>or <b>--traditional</b>
       options is given, then <i>gawk</i> reverts to treating directories on
       the command line as a fatal error.
</pre> <h2>
VARIABLES, RECORDS AND FIELDS </h2>
<pre>
       AWK variables are dynamic; they come into existence when they are
       first used.  Their values are either floating-point numbers or
       strings, or both, depending upon how they are used.
       Additionally, <i>gawk</i> allows variables to have regular-expression
       type.  AWK also has one dimensional arrays; arrays with multiple
       dimensions may be simulated.  However, <i>gawk</i> provides true arrays
       of arrays.  Several pre-defined variables are set as a program
       runs; these are described as needed and summarized below.

   <b>Records</b>
       Normally, records are separated by newline characters.  You can
       control how records are separated by assigning values to the
       built-in variable <b>RS</b>.  See
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Records.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Records.html</a> </i>
       for the details.

   <b>Fields</b>
       As each input record is read, <i>gawk</i> splits the record into <i>fields</i>,
       using the value of the <b>FS </b>variable as the field separator.
       Additionally, <b>FIELDWIDTHS </b>and <b>FPAT </b>may be used to control input
       field splitting.  See the details, starting at
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Fields.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Fields.html</a> </i>.

       Each field in the input record may be referenced by its position:
       <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b>, and so on.  <b>$0 </b>is the whole record, including leading and
       trailing whitespace.

       The variable <b>NF </b>is set to the total number of fields in the input
       record.

       References to non-existent fields (i.e., fields after <b>$NF</b>)
       produce the null string.  However, assigning to a non-existent
       field (e.g., <b>$(NF+2) = 5</b>) increases the value of <b>NF</b>, creates any
       intervening fields with the null string as their values, and
       causes the value of <b>$0 </b>to be recomputed, with the fields being
       separated by the value of <b>OFS</b>.  References to negative numbered
       fields cause a fatal error.  Decrementing <b>NF </b>causes the values of
       fields past the new value to be lost, and the value of <b>$0 </b>to be
       recomputed, with the fields being separated by the value of <b>OFS</b>.

       Assigning a value to an existing field causes the whole record to
       be rebuilt when <b>$0 </b>is referenced.  Similarly, assigning a value
       to <b>$0 </b>causes the record to be resplit, creating new values for
       the fields.

   <b>Comma Separated Values</b>
       When invoked with either the <b>-k </b>or the <b>--csv </b>option, <i>gawk</i> does
       not use regular record determination and field splitting as
       described above.  Instead, records are terminated by unquoted
       newlines, and fields are separated by commas.  Double-quotes may
       be used to enclose fields containing commas, newlines, or doubled
       double-quotes.  See
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Comma-Separated-Fields.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Comma-Separated-Fields.html</a> </i>
       for more details.

   <b>Built-in Variables</b>
       <i>Gawk</i>'s built-in variables are listed below.  This list is
       purposely terse. For details, see
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Built_002din-Variables">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Built_002din-Variables</a> </i>.

       <b>ARGC   </b>The number of command line arguments.

       <b>ARGIND </b>The index in <b>ARGV </b>of the current file being processed.

       <b>ARGV   </b>Array of command line arguments.  The array is indexed
              from 0 to <b>ARGC </b>- 1.

       <b>BINMODE</b>
              On non-POSIX systems, specifies use of “binary” mode for
              all file I/O.  See
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/PC-Using.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/PC-Using.html</a> </i>
              for the details.

       <b>CONVFMT</b>
              The conversion format for numbers, <b>"%.6g"</b>, by default.

       <b>ENVIRON</b>
              An array containing the values of the current environment.
              The array is indexed by the environment variables, each
              element being the value of that variable.

       <b>ERRNO  </b>If a system error occurs either doing a redirection for
              <b>getline</b>, during a read for <b>getline</b>, or during a <b>close()</b>,
              then <b>ERRNO </b>is set to a string describing the error.  The
              value is subject to translation in non-English locales.

       <b>FIELDWIDTHS</b>
              A whitespace-separated list of field widths.  When set,
              <i>gawk</i> parses the input into fields of fixed width, instead
              of using the value of the <b>FS </b>variable as the field
              separator.  Each field width may optionally be preceded by
              a colon-separated value specifying the number of
              characters to skip before the field starts.

       <b>FILENAME</b>
              The name of the current input file.  If no files are
              specified on the command line, the value of <b>FILENAME </b>is
              “-”.  However, <b>FILENAME </b>is undefined inside the <b>BEGIN </b>rule
              (unless set by <b>getline</b>).

       <b>FNR    </b>The input record number in the current input file.

       <b>FPAT   </b>A regular expression describing the contents of the fields
              in a record.  When set, <i>gawk</i> parses the input into fields,
              where the fields match the regular expression, instead of
              using the value of <b>FS </b>as the field separator.

       <b>FS     </b>The input field separator, a space by default.  See
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Field-Separators.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Field-Separators.html</a> </i>
              for the details.

       <b>FUNCTAB</b>
              An array whose indices and corresponding values are the
              names of all the user-defined or extension functions in
              the program.  <b>NOTE</b>: You may not use the <b>delete </b>statement
              with the <b>FUNCTAB </b>array.

       <b>IGNORECASE</b>
              Controls the case-sensitivity of all regular expression
              and string operations.  See
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Case_002dsensitivity.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Case_002dsensitivity.html</a> </i>
              for details.

       <b>LINT   </b>Provides dynamic control of the <b>--lint </b>option from within
              an AWK program.

       <b>NF     </b>The number of fields in the current input record.

       <b>NR     </b>The total number of input records seen so far.

       <b>OFMT   </b>The output format for numbers, <b>"%.6g"</b>, by default.

       <b>OFS    </b>The output field separator, a space by default.

       <b>ORS    </b>The output record separator, by default a newline.

       <b>PREC   </b>The working precision of arbitrary precision floating-
              point numbers, 53 by default.

       <b>PROCINFO</b>
              The elements of this array provide access to information
              about the running AWK program.  See
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Auto_002dset">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Auto_002dset</a> </i>
              for the details.

       <b>ROUNDMODE</b>
              The rounding mode to use for arbitrary precision
              arithmetic on numbers, by default <b>"N" </b>(IEEE-754
              roundTiesToEven mode).  See
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Setting-the-rounding-mode">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Setting-the-rounding-mode</a> </i>
              for the details.

       <b>RS     </b>The input record separator, by default a newline.

       <b>RT     </b>The record terminator.  <i>Gawk</i> sets <b>RT </b>to the input text
              that matched the character or regular expression specified
              by <b>RS</b>.

       <b>RSTART </b>The index of the first character matched by <b>match()</b>; 0 if
              no match.

       <b>RLENGTH</b>
              The length of the string matched by <b>match()</b>; -1 if no
              match.

       <b>SUBSEP </b>The string used to separate multiple subscripts in array
              elements, by default <b>"\034"</b>.

       <b>SYMTAB </b>An array whose indices are the names of all currently
              defined global variables and arrays in the program.  You
              may not use the <b>delete </b>statement with the <b>SYMTAB </b>array,
              nor assign to elements with an index that is not a
              variable name.

       <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>
              The text domain of the AWK program; used to find the
              localized translations for the program's strings.

   <b>Arrays</b>
       Arrays are subscripted with an expression between square brackets
       (<b>[ </b>and <b>]</b>).  If the expression is an expression list (<i>expr</i>, <i>expr</i>
       ...)  then the array subscript is a string consisting of the
       concatenation of the (string) value of each expression, separated
       by the value of the <b>SUBSEP </b>variable.  This facility is used to
       simulate multiply dimensioned arrays.  For example:

              <b>i = "A"; j = "B"; k = "C"</b>
              <b>x[i, j, k] = "hello, world\n"</b>

       assigns the string <b>"hello, world\n" </b>to the element of the array <b>x</b>
       which is indexed by the string <b>"A\034B\034C"</b>.  All arrays in AWK
       are associative, i.e., indexed by string values.

       The special operator <b>in </b>may be used to test if an array has an
       index consisting of a particular value:

              <b>if (val in array)</b>
                   <b>print array[val]</b>

       If the array has multiple subscripts, use <b>(i, j) in array</b>.

       The <b>in </b>construct may also be used in a <b>for </b>loop to iterate over
       all the elements of an array.  However, the <b>(i, j) in array</b>
       construct only works in tests, not in <b>for </b>loops.

       An element may be deleted from an array using the <b>delete</b>
       statement.  The <b>delete </b>statement may also be used to delete the
       entire contents of an array, just by specifying the array name
       without a subscript.

       <i>gawk</i> supports true multidimensional arrays. It does not require
       that such arrays be ``rectangular'' as in C or C++.  See
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Arrays">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Arrays</a> </i> for
       details.

   <b>Namespaces</b>
       <i>Gawk</i> provides a simple <i>namespace</i> facility to help work around the
       fact that all variables in AWK are global.

       A <i>qualified name</i> consists of a two simple identifiers joined by a
       double colon (<b>::</b>).  The left-hand identifier represents the
       namespace and the right-hand identifier is the variable within
       it.  All simple (non-qualified) names are considered to be in the
       ``current'' namespace; the default namespace is <b>awk</b>.  However,
       simple identifiers consisting solely of uppercase letters are
       forced into the <b>awk </b>namespace, even if the current namespace is
       different.

       You change the current namespace with an <b>@namespace "</b><i>name</i><b>"</b>
       directive.

       The standard predefined builtin function names may not be used as
       namespace names.  The names of additional functions provided by
       <i>gawk</i> may be used as namespace names or as simple identifiers in
       other namespaces.  For more details, see
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Namespaces.html#Namespaces">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Namespaces.html#Namespaces</a> </i>.

   <b>Variable Typing And Conversion</b>
       Variables and fields may be (floating point) numbers, or strings,
       or both.  They may also be regular expressions. How the value of
       a variable is interpreted depends upon its context.  If used in a
       numeric expression, it will be treated as a number; if used as a
       string it will be treated as a string.

       To force a variable to be treated as a number, add zero to it; to
       force it to be treated as a string, concatenate it with the null
       string.

       Uninitialized variables have the numeric value zero and the
       string value "" (the null, or empty, string).

       When a string must be converted to a number, the conversion is
       accomplished using <a href="../man3/strtod.3.html">strtod(3)</a>.  A number is converted to a string
       by using the value of <b>CONVFMT </b>as a format string for <a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf(3)</a>,
       with the numeric value of the variable as the argument.  However,
       even though all numbers in AWK are floating-point, integral
       values are <i>always</i> converted as integers.

       <i>Gawk</i> performs comparisons as follows: If two variables are
       numeric, they are compared numerically.  If one value is numeric
       and the other has a string value that is a “numeric string,” then
       comparisons are also done numerically.  Otherwise, the numeric
       value is converted to a string and a string comparison is
       performed.  Two strings are compared, of course, as strings.

       Note that string constants, such as <b>"57"</b>, are <i>not</i> numeric
       strings, they are string constants.  The idea of “numeric string”
       only applies to fields, <b>getline </b>input, <b>FILENAME</b>, <b>ARGV </b>elements,
       <b>ENVIRON </b>elements and the elements of an array created by <b>split()</b>
       or <b>patsplit() </b>that are numeric strings.  The basic idea is that
       <i>user input</i>, and only user input, that looks numeric, should be
       treated that way.

   <b>Octal and Hexadecimal Constants</b>
       You may use C-style octal and hexadecimal constants in your AWK
       program source code.  For example, the octal value <b>011 </b>is equal
       to decimal <b>9</b>, and the hexadecimal value <b>0x11 </b>is equal to decimal
       17.

   <b>String Constants</b>
       String constants in AWK are sequences of characters enclosed
       between double quotes (like <b>"value"</b>).  Within strings, certain
       <i>escape sequences</i> are recognized, as in C.  See
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Escape-Sequences">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Escape-Sequences</a> </i>
       for the details.

   <b>Regexp Constants</b>
       A regular expression constant is a sequence of characters
       enclosed between forward slashes (like <b>/value/</b>).

       The escape sequences described in the manual may also be used
       inside constant regular expressions (e.g., <b>/[ \t\f\n\r\v]/</b>
       matches whitespace characters).

       <i>Gawk</i> provides <i>strongly typed</i> regular expression constants. These
       are written with a leading <b>@ </b>symbol (like so: <b>@/value/</b>).  Such
       constants may be assigned to scalars (variables, array elements)
       and passed to user-defined functions. Variables that have been so
       assigned have regular expression type.
</pre> <h2>
PATTERNS AND ACTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       AWK is a line-oriented language.  The pattern comes first, and
       then the action.  Action statements are enclosed in <b>{ </b>and <b>}</b>.
       Either the pattern may be missing, or the action may be missing,
       but, of course, not both.  If the pattern is missing, the action
       executes for every single record of input.  A missing action is
       equivalent to

              <b>{ print }</b>

       which prints the entire record.

       Comments begin with the <b># </b>character, and continue until the end
       of the line.  Empty lines may be used to separate statements.
       Normally, a statement ends with a newline, however, this is not
       the case for lines ending in a comma, <b>{</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>:</b>, <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, or <b>||</b>.  Lines
       ending in <b>do </b>or <b>else </b>also have their statements automatically
       continued on the following line.  In other cases, a line can be
       continued by ending it with a “\”, in which case the newline is
       ignored.  However, a “\” after a <b># </b>is not special.

       Multiple statements may be put on one line by separating them
       with a “;”.  This applies to both the statements within the
       action part of a pattern-action pair (the usual case), and to the
       pattern-action statements themselves.

   <b>Patterns</b>
       AWK patterns may be one of the following:

              <b>BEGIN</b>
              <b>END</b>
              <b>BEGINFILE</b>
              <b>ENDFILE</b>
              <b>/</b><i>regular expression</i><b>/</b>
              <i>relational expression</i>
              <i>pattern</i> <b>&amp;&amp; </b><i>pattern</i>
              <i>pattern</i> <b>|| </b><i>pattern</i>
              <i>pattern</i> <b>? </b><i>pattern</i> <b>: </b><i>pattern</i>
              <b>(</b><i>pattern</i><b>)</b>
              <b>! </b><i>pattern</i>
              <i>pattern1</i><b>, </b><i>pattern2</i>

       <b>BEGIN </b>and <b>END </b>are two special kinds of patterns which are not
       tested against the input.  The action parts of all <b>BEGIN </b>patterns
       are merged as if all the statements had been written in a single
       <b>BEGIN </b>rule.  They are executed before any of the input is read.
       Similarly, all the <b>END </b>rules are merged, and executed when all
       the input is exhausted (or when an <b>exit </b>statement is executed).
       <b>BEGIN </b>and <b>END </b>patterns cannot be combined with other patterns in
       pattern expressions.  <b>BEGIN </b>and <b>END </b>patterns cannot have missing
       action parts.

       <b>BEGINFILE </b>and <b>ENDFILE </b>are additional special patterns whose
       actions are executed before reading the first record of each
       command-line input file and after reading the last record of each
       file.  Inside the <b>BEGINFILE </b>rule, the value of <b>ERRNO </b>is the empty
       string if the file was opened successfully.  Otherwise, there is
       some problem with the file and the code should use <b>nextfile </b>to
       skip it. If that is not done, <i>gawk</i> produces its usual fatal error
       for files that cannot be opened.

       For <b>/</b><i>regular expression</i><b>/ </b>patterns, the associated statement is
       executed for each input record that matches the regular
       expression.  Regular expressions are essentially the same as
       those in <b>egrep</b>(1).  See
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Regexp.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Regexp.html</a> </i>
       for the details on regular expressions.

       A <i>relational expression</i> may use any of the operators defined
       below in the section on actions.  These generally test whether
       certain fields match certain regular expressions.

       The <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, <b>||</b>, and <b>!  </b>operators are logical AND, logical OR, and
       logical NOT, respectively, as in C.  They do short-circuit
       evaluation, also as in C, and are used for combining more
       primitive pattern expressions.  As in most languages, parentheses
       may be used to change the order of evaluation.

       The <b>?: </b>operator is like the same operator in C.  If the first
       pattern is true then the pattern used for testing is the second
       pattern, otherwise it is the third.  Only one of the second and
       third patterns is evaluated.

       The <i>pattern1</i><b>, </b><i>pattern2</i> form of an expression is called a <i>range</i>
       <i>pattern</i>.  It matches all input records starting with a record
       that matches <i>pattern1</i>, and continuing until a record that matches
       <i>pattern2</i>, inclusive.  It does not combine with any other sort of
       pattern expression.

   <b>Actions</b>
       Action statements are enclosed in braces, <b>{ </b>and <b>}</b>.  Action
       statements consist of the usual assignment, conditional, and
       looping statements found in most languages.  The operators,
       control statements, and input/output statements available are
       patterned after those in C.

   <b>Operators</b>
       The operators in AWK, in order of decreasing precedence, are:

       <b>(</b>...<b>)  </b>Grouping

       <b>$      </b>Field reference.

       <b>++ --  </b>Increment and decrement, both prefix and postfix.

       <b>^      </b>Exponentiation.

       <b>+ - !  </b>Unary plus, unary minus, and logical negation.

       <b>* / %  </b>Multiplication, division, and modulus.

       <b>+ -    </b>Addition and subtraction.

       <i>space</i>  String concatenation.

       <b>|   |&amp; </b>Piped I/O for <b>getline</b>, <b>print</b>, and <b>printf</b>.

       <b>&lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= == !=</b>
              The regular relational operators.

       <b>~ !~   </b>Regular expression match, negated match.

       <b>in     </b>Array membership.

       <b>&amp;&amp;     </b>Logical AND.

       <b>||     </b>Logical OR.

       <b>?:     </b>The C conditional expression.  This has the form <i>expr1</i> <b>?</b>
              <i>expr2</i> <b>: </b><i>expr3</i>.  If <i>expr1</i> is true, the value of the
              expression is <i>expr2</i>, otherwise it is <i>expr3</i>.  Only one of
              <i>expr2</i> and <i>expr3</i> is evaluated.

       <b>= += -= *= /= %= ^=</b>
              Assignment.  Both absolute assignment <b>(</b><i>var</i> <b>= </b><i>value</i><b>) </b>and
              operator-assignment (the other forms) are supported.

   <b>Control Statements</b>
       The control statements are as follows:

              <b>if (</b><i>condition</i><b>) </b><i>statement</i> [ <b>else </b><i>statement</i> ]
              <b>while (</b><i>condition</i><b>) </b><i>statement</i>
              <b>do </b><i>statement</i> <b>while (</b><i>condition</i><b>)</b>
              <b>for (</b><i>expr1</i><b>; </b><i>expr2</i><b>; </b><i>expr3</i><b>) </b><i>statement</i>
              <b>for (</b><i>var</i> <b>in </b><i>array</i><b>) </b><i>statement</i>
              <b>break</b>
              <b>continue</b>
              <b>delete </b><i>array</i><b>[</b><i>index</i><b>]</b>
              <b>delete </b><i>array</i>
              <b>exit </b>[ <i>expression</i> ]
              <b>{ </b><i>statements</i> <b>}</b>
              <b>switch (</b><i>expression</i><b>) {</b>
              <b>case </b><i>value</i><b>|</b><i>regex</i> <b>: </b><i>statement</i>
              <i>...</i>
              [ <b>default: </b><i>statement</i> ]
              <b>}</b>

   <b>I/O Statements</b>
       The input/output statements are as follows:

       <b>close(</b><i>file</i> [<b>, </b><i>how</i>]<b>)</b>
              Close an open file, pipe or coprocess.  The optional <i>how</i>
              should only be used when closing one end of a two-way pipe
              to a coprocess.  It must be a string value, either <b>"to" </b>or
              <b>"from"</b>.

       <b>getline</b>
              Set <b>$0 </b>from the next input record; set <b>NF</b>, <b>NR</b>, <b>FNR</b>, <b>RT</b>.

       <b>getline &lt;</b><i>file</i>
              Set <b>$0 </b>from the next record of <i>file</i>; set <b>NF</b>, <b>RT</b>.

       <b>getline </b><i>var</i>
              Set <i>var</i> from the next input record; set <b>NR</b>, <b>FNR</b>, <b>RT</b>.

       <b>getline </b><i>var</i> <b>&lt;</b><i>file</i>
              Set <i>var</i> from the next record of <i>file</i>; set <b>RT</b>.

       <i>command</i> <b>| getline </b>[<i>var</i>]
              Run <i>command</i>, piping the output either into <b>$0 </b>or <i>var</i>, as
              above, and <b>RT</b>.

       <i>command</i> <b>|&amp; getline </b>[<i>var</i>]
              Run <i>command</i> as a coprocess piping the output either into
              <b>$0 </b>or <i>var</i>, as above, and <b>RT</b>.  (The <i>command</i> can also be a
              socket.  See the subsection <b>Special File Names</b>, below.)

       <b>fflush(</b>[<i>file</i>]<b>)</b>
              Flush any buffers associated with the open output file or
              pipe <i>file</i>.  If <i>file</i> is missing or if it is the null
              string, then flush all open output files and pipes.

       <b>next   </b>Stop processing the current input record.  Read the next
              input record and start processing over with the first
              pattern in the AWK program.  Upon reaching the end of the
              input data, execute any <b>END </b>rule(s).

       <b>nextfile</b>
              Stop processing the current input file.  The next input
              record read comes from the next input file.  Update
              <b>FILENAME </b>and <b>ARGIND</b>, reset <b>FNR </b>to 1, and start processing
              over with the first pattern in the AWK program.  Upon
              reaching the end of the input data, execute any <b>ENDFILE</b>
              and <b>END </b>rule(s).

       <b>print  </b>Print the current record.  The output record is terminated
              with the value of <b>ORS</b>.

       <b>print </b><i>expr-list</i>
              Print expressions.  Each expression is separated by the
              value of <b>OFS</b>.  The output record is terminated with the
              value of <b>ORS</b>.

       <b>print </b><i>expr-list</i> <b>&gt;</b><i>file</i>
              Print expressions on <i>file</i>.  Each expression is separated
              by the value of <b>OFS</b>.  The output record is terminated with
              the value of <b>ORS</b>.

       <b>printf </b><i>fmt, expr-list</i>
              Format and print.

       <b>printf </b><i>fmt, expr-list</i> <b>&gt;</b><i>file</i>
              Format and print on <i>file</i>.

       <b>system(</b><i>cmd-line</i><b>)</b>
              Execute the command <i>cmd-line</i>, and return the exit status.
              (This may not be available on non-POSIX systems.)  See
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/I_002fO-Functions.html#I_002fO-Functions">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/I_002fO-Functions.html#I_002fO-Functions</a> </i>
              for the full details on the exit status.

       Additional output redirections are allowed for <b>print </b>and <b>printf</b>.

       <b>print ... &gt;&gt; </b><i>file</i>
              Append output to the <i>file</i>.

       <b>print ... | </b><i>command</i>
              Write on a pipe.

       <b>print ... |&amp; </b><i>command</i>
              Send data to a coprocess or socket.  (See also the
              subsection <b>Special File Names</b>, below.)

       The <b>getline </b>command returns 1 on success, zero on end of file,
       and -1 on an error.  If the <a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno(3)</a> value indicates that the I/O
       operation may be retried, and <b>PROCINFO["</b><i>input</i><b>", "RETRY"] </b>is set,
       then -2 is returned instead of -1, and further calls to <b>getline</b>
       may be attempted.  Upon an error, <b>ERRNO </b>is set to a string
       describing the problem.

       <b>NOTE</b>: Failure in opening a two-way socket results in a non-fatal
       error being returned to the calling function. If using a pipe,
       coprocess, or socket to <b>getline</b>, or from <b>print </b>or <b>printf </b>within a
       loop, you <i>must</i> use <b>close() </b>to create new instances of the command
       or socket.  AWK does not automatically close pipes, sockets, or
       coprocesses when they return EOF.

       The AWK versions of the <b>printf </b>statement and <b>sprintf() </b>function
       are similar to those of C. For details, see
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Printf.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Printf.html</a> </i>.

   <b>Special File Names</b>
       When doing I/O redirection from either <b>print </b>or <b>printf </b>into a
       file, or via <b>getline </b>from a file, <i>gawk</i> recognizes certain special
       filenames internally.  These filenames allow access to open file
       descriptors inherited from <i>gawk</i>'s parent process (usually the
       shell).  These file names may also be used on the command line to
       name data files.  The filenames are:

       <b>-      </b>The standard input.

       <b>/dev/stdin</b>
              The standard input.

       <b>/dev/stdout</b>
              The standard output.

       <b>/dev/stderr</b>
              The standard error output.

       <b>/dev/fd/</b><i>n</i>
              The file associated with the open file descriptor <i>n</i>.

       The following special filenames may be used with the <b>|&amp; </b>coprocess
       operator for creating TCP/IP network connections:

       <b>/inet/tcp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
       <b>/inet4/tcp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
       <b>/inet6/tcp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
              Files for a TCP/IP connection on local port <i>lport</i> to
              remote host <i>rhost</i> on remote port <i>rport</i>.  Use a port of <b>0</b>
              to have the system pick a port.  Use <b>/inet4 </b>to force an
              IPv4 connection, and <b>/inet6 </b>to force an IPv6 connection.
              Plain <b>/inet </b>uses the system default (most likely IPv4).
              Usable only with the <b>|&amp; </b>two-way I/O operator.

       <b>/inet/udp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
       <b>/inet4/udp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
       <b>/inet6/udp/</b><i>lport</i><b>/</b><i>rhost</i><b>/</b><i>rport</i>
              Similar, but use UDP/IP instead of TCP/IP.

   <b>Numeric Functions</b>
       AWK has the following built-in arithmetic functions:

       <b>atan2(</b><i>y</i><b>, </b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
              Return the arctangent of <i>y/x</i> in radians.

       <b>cos(</b><i>expr</i><b>)</b>
              Return the cosine of <i>expr</i>, which is in radians.

       <b>exp(</b><i>expr</i><b>)</b>
              The exponential function.

       <b>int(</b><i>expr</i><b>)</b>
              Truncate to integer.

       <b>log(</b><i>expr</i><b>)</b>
              The natural logarithm function.

       <b>rand() </b>Return a random number <i>N</i>, between zero and one, such that
              0 ≤ <i>N</i> &lt; 1.

       <b>sin(</b><i>expr</i><b>)</b>
              Return the sine of <i>expr</i>, which is in radians.

       <b>sqrt(</b><i>expr</i><b>)</b>
              Return the square root of <i>expr</i>.

       <b>srand(</b>[<i>expr</i>]<b>)</b>
              Use <i>expr</i> as the new seed for the random number generator.
              If no <i>expr</i> is provided, use the time of day.  Return the
              previous seed for the random number generator.

   <b>String Functions</b>
       <i>Gawk</i> has the following built-in string functions; details are
       provided in
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions</a> </i>.

       <b>asort(</b><i>s</i> [<b>, </b><i>d</i> [<b>, </b><i>how</i>] ]<b>)</b>
              Return the number of elements in the source array <i>s</i>.  Sort
              the contents of <i>s</i> using <i>gawk</i>'s normal rules for comparing
              values, and replace the indices of the sorted values <i>s</i>
              with sequential integers starting with 1. If the optional
              destination array <i>d</i> is specified, first duplicate <i>s</i> into
              <i>d</i>, and then sort <i>d</i>, leaving the indices of the source
              array <i>s</i> unchanged. The optional string <i>how</i> controls the
              direction and the comparison mode.  Valid values for <i>how</i>
              are described in
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions.html#String-Functions">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions.html#String-Functions</a> </i>.
              <i>s</i> and <i>d</i> are allowed to be the same array; this only makes
              sense when supplying the third argument as well.

       <b>asorti(</b><i>s</i> [<b>, </b><i>d</i> [<b>, </b><i>how</i>] ]<b>)</b>
              Return the number of elements in the source array <i>s</i>.  The
              behavior is the same as that of <b>asort()</b>, except that the
              array <i>indices</i> are used for sorting, not the array values.
              When done, the array is indexed numerically, and the
              values are those of the original indices.  The original
              values are lost; thus provide a second array if you wish
              to preserve the original.  The purpose of the optional
              string <i>how</i> is the same as for <b>asort()</b>.  Here too, <i>s</i> and <i>d</i>
              are allowed to be the same array; this only makes sense
              when supplying the third argument as well.

       <b>gensub(</b><i>r</i><b>, </b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>h</i> [<b>, </b><i>t</i>]<b>)</b>
              Search the target string <i>t</i> for matches of the regular
              expression <i>r</i>.  If <i>h</i> is a string beginning with <b>g </b>or <b>G</b>,
              then replace all matches of <i>r</i> with <i>s</i>.  Otherwise, <i>h</i> is a
              number indicating which match of <i>r</i> to replace.  If <i>t</i> is
              not supplied, use <b>$0 </b>instead.  Within the replacement text
              <i>s</i>, the sequence <b>\</b><i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a digit from 1 to 9, may be
              used to indicate just the text that matched the <i>n</i>'th
              parenthesized subexpression.  The sequence <b>\0 </b>represents
              the entire matched text, as does the character <b>&amp;</b>.  Unlike
              <b>sub() </b>and <b>gsub()</b>, the modified string is returned as the
              result of the function, and the original target string is
              <i>not</i> changed.

       <b>gsub(</b><i>r</i><b>, </b><i>s</i> [<b>, </b><i>t</i>]<b>)</b>
              For each substring matching the regular expression <i>r</i> in
              the string <i>t</i>, substitute the string <i>s</i>, and return the
              number of substitutions.  If <i>t</i> is not supplied, use <b>$0</b>.
              An <b>&amp; </b>in the replacement text is replaced with the text
              that was actually matched.  Use <b>\&amp; </b>to get a literal <b>&amp;</b>.
              (This must be typed as <b>"\\&amp;"</b>; see
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Gory-Details.html#Gory-Details">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Gory-Details.html#Gory-Details</a> </i>
              for a fuller discussion of the rules for ampersands and
              backslashes in the replacement text of <b>sub()</b>, <b>gsub()</b>, and
              <b>gensub()</b>.)

       <b>index(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>t</i><b>)</b>
              Return the index of the string <i>t</i> in the string <i>s</i>, or zero
              if <i>t</i> is not present.  (This implies that character indices
              start at one.)

       <b>length(</b>[<i>s</i>]<b>)</b>
              Return the length of the string <i>s</i>, or the length of <b>$0 </b>if
              <i>s</i> is not supplied.  With an array argument, <b>length()</b>
              returns the number of elements in the array.

       <b>match(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>r</i> [<b>, </b><i>a</i>]<b>)</b>
              Return the position in <i>s</i> where the regular expression <i>r</i>
              occurs, or zero if <i>r</i> is not present, and set the values of
              <b>RSTART </b>and <b>RLENGTH</b>.  Note that the argument order is the
              same as for the <b>~ </b>operator: <i>str</i> <b>~ </b><i>re</i>.  See
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions.html#String-Functions">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions.html#String-Functions</a> </i>
              for a description of how the array <i>a</i> is filled if it is
              provided.

       <b>patsplit(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>a</i> [<b>, </b><i>r</i> [<b>, </b><i>seps</i>] ]<b>)</b>
              Split the string <i>s</i> into the array <i>a</i> and the separators
              array <i>seps</i> on the regular expression <i>r</i>, and return the
              number of fields.  Element values are the portions of <i>s</i>
              that matched <i>r</i>.  The value of <b>seps[</b><i>i</i><b>] </b>is the possibly null
              separator that appeared after <b>a[</b><i>i</i><b>]</b>.  The value of <b>seps[0]</b>
              is the possibly null leading separator.  If <i>r</i> is omitted,
              <b>FPAT </b>is used instead.  The arrays <i>a</i> and <i>seps</i> are cleared
              first.  Splitting behaves identically to field splitting
              with <b>FPAT</b>.

       <b>split(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>a</i> [<b>, </b><i>r</i> [<b>, </b><i>seps</i>] ]<b>)</b>
              Split the string <i>s</i> into the array <i>a</i> and the separators
              array <i>seps</i> on the regular expression <i>r</i>, and return the
              number of fields.  If <i>r</i> is omitted, <b>FS </b>is used instead.
              The arrays <i>a</i> and <i>seps</i> are cleared first.  <b>seps[</b><i>i</i><b>] </b>is the
              field separator matched by <i>r</i> between <b>a[</b><i>i</i><b>] </b>and <b>a[</b><i>i</i><b>+1]</b>.
              Splitting behaves identically to field splitting.

       <b>sprintf(</b><i>fmt</i><b>, </b><i>expr-list</i><b>)</b>
              Print <i>expr-list</i> according to <i>fmt</i>, and return the resulting
              string.

       <b>strtonum(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b>
              Examine <i>str</i>, and return its numeric value.  If <i>str</i> begins
              with a leading <b>0</b>, treat it as an octal number.  If <i>str</i>
              begins with a leading <b>0x </b>or <b>0X</b>, treat it as a hexadecimal
              number.  Otherwise, assume it is a decimal number.

       <b>sub(</b><i>r</i><b>, </b><i>s</i> [<b>, </b><i>t</i>]<b>)</b>
              Just like <b>gsub()</b>, but replace only the first matching
              substring.  Return either zero or one.

       <b>substr(</b><i>s</i><b>, </b><i>i</i> [<b>, </b><i>n</i>]<b>)</b>
              Return the at most <i>n</i>-character substring of <i>s</i> starting at
              <i>i</i>.  If <i>n</i> is omitted, use the rest of <i>s</i>.

       <b>tolower(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b>
              Return a copy of the string <i>str</i>, with all the uppercase
              characters in <i>str</i> translated to their corresponding
              lowercase counterparts.  Non-alphabetic characters are
              left unchanged.

       <b>toupper(</b><i>str</i><b>)</b>
              Return a copy of the string <i>str</i>, with all the lowercase
              characters in <i>str</i> translated to their corresponding
              uppercase counterparts.  Non-alphabetic characters are
              left unchanged.

       <i>Gawk</i> is multibyte aware.  This means that <b>index()</b>, <b>length()</b>,
       <b>substr() </b>and <b>match() </b>all work in terms of characters, not bytes.

   <b>Time Functions</b>
       <i>Gawk</i> provides the following functions for obtaining time stamps
       and formatting them. Details are provided in
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Time-Functions">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Time-Functions</a> </i>.

       <b>mktime(</b><i>datespec</i> [<b>, </b><i>utc-flag</i>]<b>)</b>
              Turn <i>datespec</i> into a time stamp of the same form as
              returned by <b>systime()</b>, and return the result.  If <i>utc-flag</i>
              is present and is non-zero or non-null, the time is
              assumed to be in the UTC time zone; otherwise, the time is
              assumed to be in the local time zone.  If <i>datespec</i> does
              not contain enough elements or if the resulting time is
              out of range, <b>mktime() </b>returns -1.  See
              <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Time-Functions.html#Time-Functions">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Time-Functions.html#Time-Functions</a> </i>
              for the details of <i>datespec</i>.

       <b>strftime(</b>[<i>format</i> [<b>, </b><i>timestamp</i>[<b>, </b><i>utc-flag</i>]]]<b>)</b>
              Format <i>timestamp</i> according to the specification in <i>format</i>.
              If <i>utc-flag</i> is present and is non-zero or non-null, the
              result is in UTC, otherwise the result is in local time.
              The <i>timestamp</i> should be of the same form as returned by
              <b>systime()</b>.  If <i>timestamp</i> is missing, the current time of
              day is used.  If <i>format</i> is missing, a default format
              equivalent to the output of <a href="date.1.html">date(1)</a> is used.  The default
              format is available in <b>PROCINFO["strftime"]</b>.  See the
              specification for the <b>strftime() </b>function in ISO C for the
              format conversions that are guaranteed to be available.

       <b>systime()</b>
              Return the current time of day as the number of seconds
              since the Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC on POSIX
              systems).

   <b>Bit Manipulations Functions</b>
       <i>Gawk</i> supplies the following bit manipulation functions.  They
       work by converting double-precision floating point values to
       <b>uintmax_t </b>integers, doing the operation, and then converting the
       result back to floating point.  Passing negative operands to any
       of these functions causes a fatal error.

       The functions are:

       <b>and(</b><i>v1</i><b>, </b><i>v2</i> [, ...]<b>)</b>
              Return the bitwise AND of the values provided in the
              argument list.  There must be at least two.

       <b>compl(</b><i>val</i><b>)</b>
              Return the bitwise complement of <i>val</i>.

       <b>lshift(</b><i>val</i><b>, </b><i>count</i><b>)</b>
              Return the value of <i>val</i>, shifted left by <i>count</i> bits.

       <b>or(</b><i>v1</i><b>, </b><i>v2</i> [, ...]<b>)</b>
              Return the bitwise OR of the values provided in the
              argument list.  There must be at least two.

       <b>rshift(</b><i>val</i><b>, </b><i>count</i><b>)</b>
              Return the value of <i>val</i>, shifted right by <i>count</i> bits.

       <b>xor(</b><i>v1</i><b>, </b><i>v2</i> [, ...]<b>)</b>
              Return the bitwise XOR of the values provided in the
              argument list.  There must be at least two.

   <b>Type Functions</b>
       The following functions provide type related information about
       their arguments.

       <b>isarray(</b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
              Return true if <i>x</i> is an array, false otherwise.

       <b>typeof(</b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
              Return a string indicating the type of <i>x</i>.  The string will
              be one of <b>"array"</b>, <b>"number"</b>, <b>"regexp"</b>, <b>"string"</b>, <b>"strnum"</b>,
              <b>"unassigned"</b>, or <b>"undefined"</b>.

   <b>Internationalization Functions</b>
       The following functions may be used from within your AWK program
       for translating strings at run-time.  For full details, see
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/I18N-Functions.html#I18N-Functions">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/I18N-Functions.html#I18N-Functions</a> </i>.

       <b>bindtextdomain(</b><i>directory</i> [<b>, </b><i>domain</i>]<b>)</b>
              Specify the directory where <i>gawk</i> looks for the <b>.gmo </b>files,
              in case they will not or cannot be placed in the
              ``standard'' locations.  It returns the directory where
              <i>domain</i> is ``bound.''
              The default <i>domain</i> is the value of <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>.  If
              <i>directory</i> is the null string (<b>""</b>), then <b>bindtextdomain()</b>
              returns the current binding for the given <i>domain</i>.

       <b>dcgettext(</b><i>string</i> [<b>, </b><i>domain</i> [<b>, </b><i>category</i>]]<b>)</b>
              Return the translation of <i>string</i> in text domain <i>domain</i> for
              locale category <i>category</i>.  The default value for <i>domain</i> is
              the current value of <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>.  The default value for
              <i>category</i> is <b>"LC_MESSAGES"</b>.

       <b>dcngettext(</b><i>string1</i><b>, </b><i>string2</i><b>, </b><i>number</i> [<b>, </b><i>domain</i> [<b>, </b><i>category</i>]]<b>)</b>
              Return the plural form used for <i>number</i> of the translation
              of <i>string1</i> and <i>string2</i> in text domain <i>domain</i> for locale
              category <i>category</i>.  The default value for <i>domain</i> is the
              current value of <b>TEXTDOMAIN</b>.  The default value for
              <i>category</i> is <b>"LC_MESSAGES"</b>.

   <b>Boolean Valued Functions</b>
       You can create special Boolean-typed values; see the manual for
       how they work and why they exist.

       <b>mkbool(</b><i>expression</i><b>)</b>
              Based on the boolean value of <i>expression</i> return either a
              true value or a false value.  True values have numeric
              value one.  False values have numeric value zero.
</pre> <h2>
USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Functions in AWK are defined as follows:

              <b>function </b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>parameter list</i><b>) { </b><i>statements</i> <b>}</b>

       Functions execute when they are called from within expressions in
       either patterns or actions.  Actual parameters supplied in the
       function call are used to instantiate the formal parameters
       declared in the function.  Arrays are passed by reference, other
       variables are passed by value.

       Local variables are declared as extra parameters in the parameter
       list.  The convention is to separate local variables from real
       parameters by extra spaces in the parameter list.  For example:

              <b>function  f(p, q,     a, b)   # a and b are local</b>
              <b>{</b>
                   <b>...</b>
              <b>}</b>

              <b>/abc/     { ... ; f(1, 2) ; ... }</b>

       The left parenthesis in a function call is required to
       immediately follow the function name, without any intervening
       whitespace.  This restriction does not apply to the built-in
       functions listed above.

       Functions may call each other and may be recursive.  Function
       parameters used as local variables are initialized to the null
       string and the number zero upon function invocation.

       Use <b>return </b><i>expr</i> to return a value from a function.  The return
       value is undefined if no value is provided, or if the function
       returns by “falling off” the end.

       Functions may be called indirectly. To do this, assign the name
       of the function to be called, as a string, to a variable.  Then
       use the variable as if it were the name of a function, prefixed
       with an <b>@ </b>sign, like so:
              <b>function myfunc()</b>
              <b>{</b>
                   <b>print "myfunc called"</b>
                   <b>...</b>
              <b>}</b>

              <b>{    ...</b>
                   <b>the_func = "myfunc"</b>
                   <b>@the_func()    # call through the_func to myfunc</b>
                   <b>...</b>
              <b>}</b>

       If <b>--lint </b>has been provided, <i>gawk</i> warns about calls to undefined
       functions at parse time, instead of at run time.  Calling an
       undefined function at run time is a fatal error.
</pre> <h2>
DYNAMICALLY LOADING NEW FUNCTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       You can dynamically add new functions written in C or C++ to the
       running <i>gawk</i> interpreter with the <b>@load </b>statement.  The full
       details are beyond the scope of this manual page; see
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Dynamic-Extensions.html#Dynamic-Extensions">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Dynamic-Extensions.html#Dynamic-Extensions</a> </i>.
</pre> <h2>
SIGNALS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>gawk</i> profiler accepts two signals.  <b>SIGUSR1 </b>causes it to dump
       a profile and function call stack to the profile file, which is
       either <b>awkprof.out</b>, or whatever file was named with the <b>--profile</b>
       option.  It then continues to run.  <b>SIGHUP </b>causes <i>gawk</i> to dump
       the profile and function call stack and then exit.
</pre> <h2>
INTERNATIONALIZATION </h2>
<pre>
       String constants are sequences of characters enclosed in double
       quotes.  In non-English speaking environments, it is possible to
       mark strings in the AWK program as requiring translation to the
       local natural language. Such strings are marked in the AWK
       program with a leading underscore (“_”).  For example,

              <b>gawk 'BEGIN { print "hello, world" }'</b>

       always prints <b>hello, world</b>.  But,

              <b>gawk 'BEGIN { print _"hello, world" }'</b>

       might print <b>bonjour, monde </b>in France.  See
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Internationalization.html#Internationalization">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Internationalization.html#Internationalization</a> </i>
       for the steps involved in producing and running a localizable AWK
       program.
</pre> <h2>
GNU EXTENSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Gawk</i> has a too-large number of extensions to POSIX <i>awk</i>.  They are
       described in
       <i><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/POSIX_002fGNU.html">https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/POSIX_002fGNU.html</a> </i>.
       All the extensions can be disabled by invoking <i>gawk</i> with the
       <b>--traditional </b>or <b>--posix </b>options.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>AWKPATH </b>environment variable can be used to provide a list of
       directories that <i>gawk</i> searches when looking for files named via
       the <b>-f</b>, <b>--file</b>, <b>-i </b>and <b>--include </b>options, and the <b>@include</b>
       directive.  If the initial search fails, the path is searched
       again after appending <b>.awk </b>to the filename.

       The <b>AWKLIBPATH </b>environment variable can be used to provide a list
       of directories that <i>gawk</i> searches when looking for files named
       via the <b>-l </b>and <b>--load </b>options.

       The <b>GAWK_PERSIST_FILE </b>environment variable, if present, specifies
       a file to use as the backing store for persistent memory.  <i>This</i>
       <i>is an experimental feature</i>.  See <i>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</i>
       for the details.

       The <b>GAWK_READ_TIMEOUT </b>environment variable can be used to specify
       a timeout in milliseconds for reading input from a terminal, pipe
       or two-way communication including sockets.

       For connection to a remote host via socket, <b>GAWK_SOCK_RETRIES</b>
       controls the number of retries, and <b>GAWK_MSEC_SLEEP </b>the interval
       between retries.  The interval is in milliseconds. On systems
       that do not support <a href="../man3/usleep.3.html">usleep(3)</a>, the value is rounded up to an
       integral number of seconds.

       If <b>POSIXLY_CORRECT </b>exists in the environment, then <i>gawk</i> behaves
       exactly as if <b>--posix </b>had been specified on the command line.  If
       <b>--lint </b>has been specified, <i>gawk</i> issues a warning message to this
       effect.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>exit </b>statement is used with a value, then <i>gawk</i> exits with
       the numeric value given to it.

       Otherwise, if there were no problems during execution, <i>gawk</i> exits
       with the value of the C constant <b>EXIT_SUCCESS</b>.  This is usually
       zero.

       If an error occurs, <i>gawk</i> exits with the value of the C constant
       <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>.  This is usually one.

       If <i>gawk</i> exits because of a fatal error, the exit status is 2.  On
       non-POSIX systems, this value may be mapped to <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>.
</pre> <h2>
VERSION INFORMATION </h2>
<pre>
       This man page documents <i>gawk</i>, version 5.3.
</pre> <h2>
AUTHORS </h2>
<pre>
       The original version of UNIX <i>awk</i> was designed and implemented by
       Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan of Bell
       Laboratories.  Ozan Yigit is the the current maintainer.  Brian
       Kernighan occasionally dabbles in its development.

       Paul Rubin and Jay Fenlason, of the Free Software Foundation,
       wrote <i>gawk</i>, to be compatible with the original version of <i>awk</i>
       distributed in Seventh Edition UNIX.  John Woods contributed a
       number of bug fixes.  David Trueman, with contributions from
       Arnold Robbins, made <i>gawk</i> compatible with the new version of UNIX
       <i>awk</i>.  Arnold Robbins is the current maintainer.

       See <i>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</i> for a full list of the
       contributors to <i>gawk</i> and its documentation.

       See the <b>README </b>file in the <i>gawk</i> distribution for up-to-date
       information about maintainers and which ports are currently
       supported.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-F </b>option is not necessary given the command line variable
       assignment feature; it remains only for backwards compatibility.

       This manual page is too long; <i>gawk</i> has too many features.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Print and sort the login names of all users:

            <b>BEGIN     { FS = ":" }</b>
                 <b>{ print $1 | "sort" }</b>

       Count lines in a file:

                 <b>{ nlines++ }</b>
            <b>END  { print nlines }</b>

       Precede each line by its number in the file:

            <b>{ print FNR, $0 }</b>

       Concatenate and line number (a variation on a theme):

            <b>{ print NR, $0 }</b>

       Run an external command for particular lines of data:

            <b>tail -f access_log |</b>
            <b>awk '/myhome.html/ { system("nmap " $1 "&gt;&gt; logdir/myhome.html") }'</b>
