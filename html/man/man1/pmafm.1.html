NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmafm </b>- Performance Co-Pilot archive folio manager
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmafm </b><i>folioname</i> [<i>command</i> [<i>arg</i> ...]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A collection of one or more Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archives
       may be combined with a control file to produce a PCP archive
       folio.  Archive folios are created using either <a href="mkaf.1.html">mkaf(1)</a> or the
       interactive ``record mode'' services of PCP clients like
       <a href="pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>.

       <b>pmafm </b>provides a number of services that may be used to process
       folios.  In particular, it provides support for execution of PCP
       tools using one or more of the component archives within an
       archive folio.

       The target folio is identified by the folio control file
       <i>folioname</i>.  The syntax for a folio control file is described in
       <a href="mkaf.1.html">mkaf(1)</a>.

       If present, the command and arguments following <i>folioname</i> are
       interpreted and executed as a single command, otherwise commands
       are read from standard input.

       The following commands are supported.

       <b>archives</b>
              Subsequent commands apply to all archives in the folio.

       <b>archives </b><i>N</i>[,...]
              Archives within a folio are numbered 1, 2, etc.
              Subsequent commands are restricted to apply only to the
              designated archives.

       <b>archives </b><i>name</i>[,...]
              Archives within a folio have unique names.  Subsequent
              commands are restricted to apply only to the designated
              archives.

       <b>check  </b>Validate the presence and format of each file in the folio
              and the component archives.

       <b>help</b>
              A brief reminder of the command syntax.  <b>?  </b>is a synonym
              for <b>help</b>.

       <b>hosts</b>
              Subsequent commands apply to all archives in the folio.

       <b>hosts </b><i>hostname</i>[,...]
              Subsequent commands are restricted to apply only to those
              archives that match the designated hostnames.

       <b>list </b>[<b>verbose</b>]
              Display the contents of the folio.  By default the control
              header and the ordinal number, hostname and archive base
              name for each archive in the folio.  The <b>verbose </b>option
              causes <b>pmafm </b>to dump the label record from each archive
              using <b>pmlogdump -l</b>.

              The first named archive in the folio is assumed to be
              associated with the default host for any tool that tries
              to replay multiple archives from the folio.

       <b>quit</b>
              Exit <b>pmafm</b>.

       <b>remove</b>
              Echo on standard output the <b>sh</b>(1) commands required to
              remove all of the physical files associated with this
              archive folio.

       <b>repeat </b><i>tool</i> [<i>arg</i> ...]
              Execute the known PCP <i>tool</i> once per selected archive.  For
              example, the command
                   repeat pmval -t60 kernel.all.load
              would run <a href="pmval.1.html">pmval(1)</a> once per archive, with an appropriate
              <b>-a </b>argument.

       <b>replay</b>
              Some archive folios are created by tools (e.g. <a href="pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a>)
              that provide sufficient information to allow all of the
              information in all of the archives of a folio to be
              replayed.

       [<b>run</b>] <i>tool</i> [<i>arg</i> ...]
              Execute the known PCP <i>tool</i> on the selected archives.  Some
              PCP tools are able to process multiple concurrent
              archives, and in this case the tool is run once with the
              list of all selected archives passed via a <b>-a </b>argument.
              Otherwise, this command is synonymous with <b>repeat</b>.

       <b>selections</b>
              Display those archives that would be selected for
              processing with a <b>repeat</b>, <b>replay </b>or <b>run </b>command.

       The restrictions via any <b>hosts </b>and <b>archives </b>commands are
       conjuncted.  These restrictions serve to limit the specific
       archives processed in the subsequent <b>repeat</b>, <b>replay</b>, <b>run </b>and
       <b>selections </b>commands.  By default, all archives are selected.

       Keywords in commands may be abbreviated provided no ambiguity is
       introduced, e.g.  <b>help</b>, <b>hel </b>and <b>he </b>are synonymous, but <b>h </b>is
       ambiguous.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmafm/*</i>
            control files that define the behavior of each PCP tool
            known to <b>pmafm</b>.  This information may be customized or
            extended, see <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmafm/pcp</i> for
            documentation of the syntax and semantics of these files.

       <i>$HOME/.pcp/pmafm/*</i>
            User customization of the control files.  All files in this
            directory are treated in the same manner as control files in
            the <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmafm</i> directory.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
