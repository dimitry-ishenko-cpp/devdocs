SYNOPSIS </h2>

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdanvidia </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the metrics available on
       NVIDIA GPU cards via the NVML library.

       The <b>nvidia </b>PMDA exports metrics that measure gpu activity, memory
       utilization, fan speed, etc on NVIDIA Tesla and Quadro cards.
       Metrics are unlikely to be available for consumer class cards.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdanvidia </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>nvidia.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdanvidia </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-t   </b>Enables and sets a sampling <i>interval</i> for automatic
            refreshing of metric values.  The functionality is disabled
            by default, however this option allows a time interval to be
            specified on which all values are sampled - this has the
            effect of constantly updating the accumulating metrics, with
            the goal of assisting client tools such as <a href="pcp-atop.1.html">pcp-atop(1)</a> and
            <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> to observe sub-sample time changes in GPU and
            process state.  Typically these tools have longer sampling
            intervals, and can thus 'miss' activity happening during
            their sampling interval.

INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>nvidia </b>PMDA is not installed and available by default.  If
       you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia
            # ./Remove

       If you want to establish access to the names, help text and
       values for the nvidia performance metrics once more, after
       removal, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia
            # ./Install

       <b>pmdanvidia </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</b>
              command line options used to launch <b>pmdanvidia</b>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia/help</b>
              default help text file for the nvidia metrics
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia/Install</b>
              installation script for the <b>pmdanvidia </b>agent
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/nvidia/Remove</b>
              undo installation script for the <b>pmdanvidia </b>agent
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/nvidia.log</b>
              default log file for error messages and other information
              from <b>pmdanvidia</b>
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
