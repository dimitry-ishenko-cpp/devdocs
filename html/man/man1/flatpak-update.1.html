NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-update - Update an application or runtime
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak update </b>[OPTION...] [REF...]

       <b>flatpak update </b>[OPTION...] --appstream [REMOTE]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Updates applications and runtimes.  REF is a reference to the
       application or runtime to update. If no REF is given, everything
       is updated, as well as appstream info for all remotes.

       Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
       ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
       elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
       the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
       part left out will be matched against what is installed, and if
       there are multiple matches an error message will list the
       alternatives.

       By default this looks for both apps and runtimes with the given
       REF, but you can limit this by using the <b>--app </b>or <b>--runtime</b>
       option, or by supplying the initial element in the REF.

       Normally, this command updates the application to the tip of its
       branch. But it is possible to check out another commit, with the
       <b>--commit </b>option.

       If the configured remote for a ref being updated has a collection
       ID configured on it, Flatpak will search the sideload-repos
       directories configured either with the <b>--sideload-repo </b>option, or
       on a per-installation or system-wide basis (see <a href="flatpak.1.html">flatpak(1)</a>).

       Note that updating a runtime is different from installing a
       different branch, and runtime updates are expected to keep strict
       compatibility. If an application update does cause a problem, it
       is possible to go back to the previous version, with the <b>--commit</b>
       option.

       In addition to updates, this command will offer to uninstall any
       unused end-of-life runtimes. Runtimes that were explicitly
       installed (not as a dependency) or explicitly pinned (see
       <a href="flatpak-pin.1.html">flatpak-pin(1)</a>) are left installed even if unused and
       end-of-life.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user</b>, <b>--system </b>or <b>--installation</b>
       option, this command updates any matching refs in the standard
       system-wide installation and the per-user one.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Update a per-user installation.

       <b>--system</b>
           Update the default system-wide installation.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Updates a system-wide installation specified by NAME among
           those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
           <b>--installation=default </b>is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--arch=ARCH</b>
           The architecture to update for. See <b>flatpak</b>
           <b>--supported-arches </b>for architectures supported by the host.

       <b>--subpath=PATH</b>
           Install only a subpath of the ref. This is mainly used to
           install a subset of locales. This can be added multiple times
           to install multiple subpaths. If this is not specified the
           subpaths specified at install time are reused.

       <b>--commit=COMMIT</b>
           Update to this commit, instead of the tip of the branch. You
           can find commits using <b>flatpak remote-info --log REMOTE REF</b>.

       <b>--no-deploy</b>
           Download the latest version, but don't deploy it.

       <b>--no-pull</b>
           Don't download the latest version, deploy whatever is locally
           available.

       <b>--no-related</b>
           Don't download related extensions, such as the locale data.

       <b>--no-deps</b>
           Don't update or install runtime dependencies when installing.

       <b>--app</b>
           Only look for an app with the given name.

       <b>--appstream</b>
           Update appstream for REMOTE, or all remotes if no remote is
           specified.

       <b>--runtime</b>
           Only look for a runtime with the given name.

       <b>--sideload-repo=PATH</b>
           Adds an extra local ostree repo as a source for installation.
           This is equivalent to using the sideload-repos directories
           (see <a href="flatpak.1.html">flatpak(1)</a>), but can be done on a per-command basis. Any
           path added here is used in addition to ones in those
           directories.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--assumeyes</b>
           Automatically answer yes to all questions (or pick the most
           prioritized answer). This is useful for automation.

       <b>--noninteractive</b>
           Produce minimal output and avoid most questions. This is
           suitable for use in non-interactive situations, e.g. in a
           build script.

       <b>--force-remove</b>
           Remove old files even if they're in use by a running
           application.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
