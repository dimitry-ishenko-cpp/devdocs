</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>addr2line </b>translates addresses or symbol+offset into file names
       and line numbers.  Given an address or symbol+offset in an
       executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it
       uses the debugging information to figure out which file name and
       line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the
       <b>-e </b>option.  The default is the file <i>a.out</i>.  The section in the
       relocatable object to use is specified with the <b>-j </b>option.

       <b>addr2line </b>has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses or symbol+offset are
       specified on the command line, and <b>addr2line </b>displays the file
       name and line number for each address.

       In the second, <b>addr2line </b>reads hexadecimal addresses or
       symbol+offset from standard input, and prints the file name and
       line number for each address on standard output.  In this mode,
       <b>addr2line </b>may be used in a pipe to convert dynamically chosen
       addresses.

       The format of the output is <b>FILENAME:LINENO</b>.  By default each
       input address generates one line of output.

       Two options can generate additional lines before each
       <b>FILENAME:LINENO </b>line (in that order).

       If the <b>-a </b>option is used then a line with the input address is
       displayed.

       If the <b>-f </b>option is used, then a line with the <b>FUNCTIONNAME </b>is
       displayed.  This is the name of the function containing the
       address.

       One option can generate additional lines after the
       <b>FILENAME:LINENO </b>line.

       If the <b>-i </b>option is used and the code at the given address is
       present there because of inlining by the compiler then additional
       lines are displayed afterwards.  One or two extra lines (if the
       <b>-f </b>option is used) are displayed for each inlined function.

       Alternatively if the <b>-p </b>option is used then each input address
       generates a single, long, output line containing the address, the
       function name, the file name and the line number.  If the <b>-i</b>
       option has also been used then any inlined functions will be
       displayed in the same manner, but on separate lines, and prefixed
       by the text <b>(inlined by)</b>.

       If the file name or function name can not be determined,
       <b>addr2line </b>will print two question marks in their place.  If the
       line number can not be determined, <b>addr2line </b>will print 0.

       When symbol+offset is used, +offset is optional, except when the
       symbol is ambigious with a hex number. The resolved symbols can
       be mangled or unmangled, except unmangled symbols with + are not
       allowed.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives,
       are equivalent.

       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--addresses</b>
           Display the address before the function name, file and line
           number information.  The address is printed with a <b>0x </b>prefix
           to easily identify it.

       <b>-b </b><i>bfdname</i>
       <b>--target=</b><i>bfdname</i>
           Specify that the object-code format for the object files is
           <i>bfdname</i>.

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--demangle[=</b><i>style</i><b>]</b>
           Decode (<i>demangle</i>) low-level symbol names into user-level
           names.  Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by
           the system, this makes C++ function names readable.
           Different compilers have different mangling styles. The
           optional demangling style argument can be used to choose an
           appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

       <b>-e </b><i>filename</i>
       <b>--exe=</b><i>filename</i>
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should
           be translated.  The default file is <i>a.out</i>.

       <b>-f</b>
       <b>--functions</b>
           Display function names as well as file and line number
           information.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--basenames</b>
           Display only the base of each file name.

       <b>-i</b>
       <b>--inlines</b>
           If the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the
           source information for all enclosing scopes back to the first
           non-inlined function will also be printed.  For example, if
           "main" inlines "callee1" which inlines "callee2", and address
           is from "callee2", the source information for "callee1" and
           "main" will also be printed.

       <b>-j</b>
       <b>--section</b>
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of
           absolute addresses.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--pretty-print</b>
           Make the output more human friendly: each location are
           printed on one line.  If option <b>-i </b>is specified, lines for
           all enclosing scopes are prefixed with <b>(inlined by)</b>.

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>-R</b>
       <b>--recurse-limit</b>
       <b>--no-recurse-limit</b>
       <b>--recursion-limit</b>
       <b>--no-recursion-limit</b>
           Enables or disables a limit on the amount of recursion
           performed whilst demangling strings.  Since the name mangling
           formats allow for an infinite level of recursion it is
           possible to create strings whose decoding will exhaust the
           amount of stack space available on the host machine,
           triggering a memory fault.  The limit tries to prevent this
           from happening by restricting recursion to 2048 levels of
           nesting.

           The default is for this limit to be enabled, but disabling it
           may be necessary in order to demangle truly complicated
           names.  Note however that if the recursion limit is disabled
           then stack exhaustion is possible and any bug reports about
           such an event will be rejected.

           The <b>-r </b>option is a synonym for the <b>--no-recurse-limit </b>option.
           The <b>-R </b>option is a synonym for the <b>--recurse-limit </b>option.

           Note this option is only effective if the <b>-C </b>or <b>--demangle</b>
           option has been enabled.

       <b>@</b><i>file</i>
           Read command-line options from <i>file</i>.  The options read are
           inserted in place of the original @<i>file</i> option.  If <i>file</i> does
           not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
           literally, and not removed.

           Options in <i>file</i> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
           character may be included in an option by surrounding the
           entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any
           character (including a backslash) may be included by
           prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The
           <i>file</i> may itself contain additional @<i>file</i> options; any such
           options will be processed recursively.
