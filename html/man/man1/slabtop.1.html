</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       slabtop - display kernel slab cache information in real time
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>slabtop </b>[<i>option</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>slabtop </b>displays detailed kernel slab cache information in real
       time.  It displays a listing of the top caches sorted by one of
       the listed sort criteria.  It also displays a statistics header
       filled with slab layer information.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Normal invocation of <b>slabtop </b>does not require any options.  The
       behavior, however, can be fine-tuned by specifying one or more of
       the following flags:

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--delay</b>=<i>N</i>
              Refresh the display every <i>n</i> in seconds.  By default,
              <b>slabtop </b>refreshes the display every three seconds.  To
              exit the program, hit <b>q</b>.  This cannot be combined with the
              <b>-o </b>option.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sort</b>=<i>S</i>
              Sort by <i>S</i>, where <i>S</i> is one of the sort criteria.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--once</b>
              Display the output once and then exit.

       <b>--human</b>
              Show slab sizes automatically scaled to shortest three
              digit unit and display the units of print out.  Following
              units are used.

                B = bytes
                Ki = kibibyte
                Mi = mebibyte
                Gi = gibibyte
                Ti = tebibyte
                Pi = pebibyte

       If this flag is not used, the slab sizes will be shown in KiB.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display usage information and exit.
</pre> <h2>
SORT CRITERIA </h2>
<pre>
       The following are valid sort criteria used to sort the individual
       slab caches and thereby determine what are the "top" slab caches
       to display.  The default sort criteria is to sort by the number
       of objects ("o").

       The sort criteria can also be changed while <b>slabtop </b>is running by
       pressing the associated character.
       <b>character   description                header</b>
       a           number of active objects   ACTIVE
       b           objects per slab           OBJ/SLAB
       c           cache size                 CACHE SIZE
       l           number of slabs            SLABS
       v           number of active slabs     N/A
       n           name                       NAME
       o           number of objects          OBJS
       p           pages per slab             N/A
       s           object size                OBJ SIZE
       u           cache utilization          USE
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>slabtop </b>accepts keyboard commands from the user during use.  The
       following are supported.  In the case of letters, both cases are
       accepted.

       Each of the valid sort characters are also accepted, to change
       the sort routine. See the section <b>SORT CRITERIA</b>.

       <b>&lt;SPACEBAR&gt;</b>
              Refresh the screen.

       <b>Q      </b>Quit the program.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Currently, <b>slabtop </b>requires a 2.4 or later kernel (specifically,
       a version 1.1 or later <i>/proc/slabinfo</i>).  Kernel 2.2 should be
       supported in the future.

       The <b>slabtop </b>statistic header is tracking how many bytes of slabs
       are being used and is not a measure of physical memory.  The
       'Slab' field in the <i>/proc/meminfo</i> file is tracking information
       about used slab physical memory.

       The <b>CACHE SIZE </b>column is not accurate, it's the upper limit of
       memory used by specific slab. When system using slub (most common
       case) is under high memory pressure, there are slab order
       fallbacks, which means "pages per slab" is not constant and may
       decrease.
