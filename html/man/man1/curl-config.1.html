NAME </h2>
<pre>
       curl-config - Get information about a libcurl installation
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>curl-config [options]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>curl-config </b>displays information about the curl and libcurl
       installation.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --ca   Displays the built-in path to the CA cert bundle this
              libcurl uses.

       --cc   Displays the compiler used to build libcurl.

       --cflags
              Set of compiler options (CFLAGS) to use when compiling
              files that use libcurl. Currently that is only the include
              path to the curl include files.

       --checkfor [version]
              Specify the oldest possible libcurl version string you
              want, and this script returns 0 if the current
              installation is new enough or it returns 1 and outputs a
              text saying that the current version is not new enough.
              (Added in 7.15.4)

       --configure
              Displays the arguments given to configure when building
              curl.

       --feature
              Lists what particular main features the installed libcurl
              was built with. At the time of writing, this list may
              include SSL, KRB4 or IPv6. Do not assume any particular
              order. The keywords are separated by newlines. There may
              be none, one, or several keywords in the list.

       --help Displays the available options.

       --libs Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options
              you need in order to link your application with libcurl.

       --prefix
              This is the prefix used when libcurl was installed.
              Libcurl is then installed in $prefix/lib and its header
              files are installed in $prefix/include and so on. The
              prefix is set with "configure --prefix".

       --protocols
              Lists what particular protocols the installed libcurl was
              built to support. At the time of writing, this list may
              include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, FILE, TELNET, LDAP, DICT
              and many more. Do not assume any particular order. The
              protocols are listed using uppercase and are separated by
              newlines. There may be none, one, or several protocols in
              the list. (Added in 7.13.0)

       --ssl-backends
              Lists the SSL backends that were enabled when libcurl was
              built. It might be no, one or several names. If more than
              one name, they appear comma-separated.  (Added in 7.58.0)

       --static-libs
              Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options
              you need in order to link your application with libcurl
              statically. (Added in 7.17.1)

       --version
              Outputs version information about the installed libcurl.

       --vernum
              Outputs version information about the installed libcurl,
              in numerical mode.  This shows the version number, in
              hexadecimal, using 8 bits for each part: major, minor, and
              patch numbers. This makes libcurl 7.7.4 appear as 070704
              and libcurl 12.13.14 appear as 0c0d0e... Note that the
              initial zero might be omitted. (This option was broken in
              the 7.15.0 release.)
