</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fuser </b>displays the PIDs of processes using the specified files or
       file  systems.   In  the  default display mode, each file name is
       followed by a letter denoting the type of access:

              <b>c      </b>current directory.
              <b>e      </b>executable being run.
              <b>f      </b>open file.  <b>f </b>is omitted in default display mode.
              <b>F      </b>open file for writing.  <b>F </b>is omitted in default
                     display mode.
              <b>r      </b>root directory.
              <b>m      </b>mmap'ed file or shared library.
              <b>.      </b>Placeholder, omitted in default display mode.

       <b>fuser </b>returns a non-zero return code if none of the specified
       files is accessed or in case of a fatal error.  If at least one
       access has been found, <b>fuser </b>returns zero.

       In order to look up processes using TCP and UDP sockets, the
       corresponding name space has to be selected with the <b>-n </b>option.
       By default <b>fuser </b>will look in both IPv6 and IPv4 sockets.  To
       change the default behavior, use the <b>-4 </b>and <b>-6 </b>options.  The
       socket(s) can be specified by the local and remote port, and the
       remote address.  All fields are optional, but commas in front of
       missing fields must be present:

       [<i>lcl_port</i>][,[<i>rmt_host</i>][,[<i>rmt_port</i>]]]

       Either symbolic or numeric values can be used for IP addresses
       and port numbers.

       <b>fuser </b>outputs only the PIDs to stdout, everything else is sent to
       stderr.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              Show all files specified on the command line.  By default,
              only files that are accessed by at least one process are
              shown.

       <b>-c     </b>Same as <b>-m </b>option, used for POSIX compatibility.

       <b>-f     </b>Silently ignored, used for POSIX compatibility.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--kill</b>
              Kill processes accessing the file.  Unless changed with
              <b>-</b><i>SIGNAL</i>, SIGKILL is sent.  An <b>fuser </b>process never kills
              itself, but may kill other <b>fuser </b>processes.  The effective
              user ID of the process executing <b>fuser </b>is set to its real
              user ID before attempting to kill.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interactive</b>
              Ask the user for confirmation before killing a process.
              This option is silently ignored if <b>-k </b>is not present too.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--inode</b>
              For the name space <b>file </b>let all comparisons be based on
              the inodes of the specified file(s) and never on the file
              names even on network based file systems.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list-signals</b>
              List all known signal names.

       <b>-m </b><i>NAME</i>, <b>--mount </b><i>NAME</i>
              <i>NAME</i> specifies a file on a mounted file system or a block
              device that is mounted.  All processes accessing files on
              that file system are listed.  If a directory is specified,
              it is automatically changed to <i>NAME</i>/ to use any file
              system that might be mounted on that directory.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--ismountpoint</b>
              Request will be fulfilled only if <i>NAME</i> specifies a
              mountpoint.  This is an invaluable seat belt which
              prevents you from killing the machine if <i>NAME</i> happens to
              not be a filesystem.

       <b>-w     </b>Kill only processes which have write access.  This option
              is silently ignored if <b>-k </b>is not present too.

       <b>-n </b><i>NAMESPACE</i>, <b>--namespace </b><i>NAMESPACE</i>
              Select a different name space.  The name spaces <b>file </b>(file
              names, the default), <b>udp </b>(local UDP ports), and <b>tcp </b>(local
              TCP ports) are supported.  For ports, either the port
              number or the symbolic name can be specified.  If there is
              no ambiguity, the shortcut notation <i>name</i><b>/</b><i>space</i> (e.g.,
              <i>80</i><b>/</b><i>tcp</i>) can be used.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              Silent operation.  <b>-u </b>and <b>-v </b>are ignored in this mode.  <b>-a</b>
              must not be used with <b>-s</b>.

       <b>-</b><i>SIGNAL</i>
              Use the specified signal instead of SIGKILL when killing
              processes.  Signals can be specified either by name (e.g.,
              <b>-HUP</b>) or by number (e.g., <b>-1</b>).  This option is silently
              ignored if the <b>-k </b>option is not used.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
              Append the user name of the process owner to each PID.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose mode.  Processes are shown in a <b>ps</b>-like style.
              The fields PID, USER and COMMAND are similar to <b>ps</b>.
              ACCESS shows how the process accesses the file.  Verbose
              mode will also show when a particular file is being
              accessed as a mount point, knfs export or swap file.  In
              this case <b>kernel </b>is shown instead of the PID.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.

       <b>-4</b>, <b>--ipv4</b>
              Search only for IPv4 sockets.  This option must not be
              used with the <b>-6 </b>option and only has an effect with the
              tcp and udp namespaces.

       <b>-6</b>, <b>--ipv6</b>
              Search only for IPv6 sockets.  This option must not be
              used with the <b>-4 </b>option and only has an effect with the
              tcp and udp namespaces.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /proc  location of the proc file system
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fuser -km /home</b>
              kills all processes accessing the file system /home in any
              way.

       <b>if fuser -s /dev/ttyS1; then :; else </b><i>command</i><b>; fi</b>
              invokes <i>command</i> if no other process is using /dev/ttyS1.

       <b>fuser telnet/tcp</b>
              shows all processes at the (local) TELNET port.
</pre> <h2>
RESTRICTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Processes accessing the same file or file system several times in
       the same way are only shown once.

       If the same object is specified several times on the command
       line, some of those entries may be ignored.

       <b>fuser </b>may only be able to gather partial information unless run
       with privileges.  As a consequence, files opened by processes
       belonging to other users may not be listed and executables may be
       classified as mapped only.

       <b>fuser </b>cannot report on any processes that it doesn't have
       permission to look at the file descriptor table for.  The most
       common time this problem occurs is when looking for TCP or UDP
       sockets when running <b>fuser </b>as a non-root user.  In this case
       <b>fuser </b>will report no access.

       Installing <b>fuser </b>SUID root will avoid problems associated with
       partial information, but may be undesirable for security and
       privacy reasons.

       <b>udp </b>and <b>tcp </b>name spaces, and UNIX domain sockets can't be
       searched with kernels older than 1.3.78.

       Accesses by the kernel are only shown with the <b>-v </b>option.

       The <b>-k </b>option only works on processes.  If the user is the
       kernel, <b>fuser </b>will print an advice, but take no action beyond
       that.

       <b>fuser </b>will not see block devices mounted by processes in a
       different mount namespace.  This is due to the device ID shown in
       the process' file descriptor table being from the process
       namespace, not fuser's; meaning it won't match.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>fuser -m /dev/sgX </b>will show (or kill with the <b>-k </b>flag) all
       processes, even if you don't have that device configured.  There
       may be other devices it does this for too.

       The mount <b>-m </b>option will match any file within the same device as
       the specified file, use the <b>-M </b>option as well if you mean to
       specify only the mount point.

       <b>fuser </b>will not match mapped files, such as a process' shared
       libraries if they are on a <b>btrfs</b>(5) filesystem due to the device
       IDs being different for <a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat(2)</a> and <i>/proc/&lt;PID&gt;/maps</i>.
