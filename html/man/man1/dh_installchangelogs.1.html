NAME </h2>

       dh_installchangelogs - install changelogs into package build
       directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installchangelogs </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>]
       [<b>--no-trim</b>] [<i>upstream</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installchangelogs </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible
       for installing changelogs into package build directories.

       An upstream <i>changelog</i> file may be specified as an option. If none
       is specified, <b>dh_installchangelogs </b>may look for files with names
       that seem likely to be changelogs as described in the next
       paragraphs.

       In non-native packages, <b>dh_installchangelogs </b>will first look for
       changelog files installed by the upstream build system into
       <i>usr/share/doc/package</i> (of the package build directory) and rename
       the most likely candidate (if any) to
       <i>usr/share/doc/package/changelog</i>.  Note that <b>dh_installchangelogs</b>
       does <i>not</i> look into any source directory (such as <i>debian/tmp</i>).
       Otherwise, <b>dh_installchangelogs </b>(at compatibility level 7 or any
       later) will look for changelog files in the source directory
       (e.g. the root or the <i>docs</i> subdirectory).  It will look for
       <i>changelog</i>, <i>changes</i> and <i>history</i> optionally with common extensions
       (such as <i>.txt</i>, <i>.md</i> and <i>.rst</i>).

       If a changelog file is specified and is an <i>html</i> file (determined
       by file extension), it will be installed as
       <i>usr/share/doc/package/changelog.html</i> instead. If the html
       changelog is converted to plain text, that variant can be
       specified as a second parameter. When no plain text variant is
       specified, a short <i>usr/share/doc/package/changelog</i> is generated,
       pointing readers at the html changelog file.

       The <b>debchange</b>-style Debian changelogs are trimmed to include only
       entries more recent than the release date of <i>oldstable</i>.  No
       trimming will be performed if the <b>--no-trim </b>option is passed or
       if the <b>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS </b>environment variable contains <b>notrimdch</b>.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>debian/changelog</i>
       <i>debian/NEWS</i>
       debian/<i>package</i>.changelog
       debian/<i>package</i>.NEWS
           Automatically installed into usr/share/doc/<i>package</i>/ in the
           package build directory.

           Use the package specific name if <i>package</i> needs a different
           <i>NEWS</i> or <i>changelog</i> file.

           The <i>changelog</i> file is installed with a name of changelog for
           native packages, and <i>changelog.Debian</i> for non-native
           packages.  The <i>NEWS</i> file is always installed with a name of
           <i>NEWS.Debian</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep</b>
           Keep the original name of the upstream changelog. This will
           be accomplished by installing the upstream changelog as
           <i>changelog</i>, and making a symlink from that to the original
           name of the <i>changelog</i> file. This can be useful if the
           upstream changelog has an unusual name, or if other
           documentation in the package refers to the <i>changelog</i> file.

       <b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude upstream <i>changelog</i> files that contain <i>item</i> anywhere
           in their filename from being installed.

           Note that directory name of the changelog is also part of the
           match.

       <b>--no-trim</b>
           Install the full changelog, not its trimmed version that
           includes only recent entries.

       <i>upstream</i>
           Install this file as the upstream changelog.
