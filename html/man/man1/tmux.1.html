DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals
       to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.
       <b>tmux </b>may be detached from a screen and continue running in the
       background, then later reattached.

       When <b>tmux </b>is started, it creates a new <i>session</i> with a single
       <i>window</i> and displays it on screen.  A status line at the bottom of
       the screen shows information on the current session and is used
       to enter interactive commands.

       A session is a single collection of <i>pseudo terminals</i> under the
       management of <b>tmux</b>.  Each session has one or more windows linked
       to it.  A window occupies the entire screen and may be split into
       rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal
       (the <i>pty</i>(4) manual page documents the technical details of pseudo
       terminals).  Any number of <b>tmux </b>instances may connect to the same
       session, and any number of windows may be present in the same
       session.  Once all sessions are killed, <b>tmux </b>exits.

       Each session is persistent and will survive accidental
       disconnection (such as <i>ssh</i>(1) connection timeout) or intentional
       detaching (with the ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  <b>tmux </b>may be reattached
       using:

             <b>$ tmux attach</b>

       In <b>tmux</b>, a session is displayed on screen by a <i>client</i> and all
       sessions are managed by a single <i>server</i>.  The server and each
       client are separate processes which communicate through a socket
       in <i>/tmp</i>.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-2            </b>Force <b>tmux </b>to assume the terminal supports 256
                     colours.  This is equivalent to <b>-T </b><i>256</i>.

       <b>-C            </b>Start in control mode (see the “CONTROL MODE”
                     section).  Given twice (<b>-CC</b>) disables echo.

       <b>-c </b><i>shell-command</i>
                     Execute <i>shell-command</i> using the default shell.  If
                     necessary, the <b>tmux </b>server will be started to
                     retrieve the <b>default-shell </b>option.  This option is
                     for compatibility with <i>sh</i>(1) when <b>tmux </b>is used as a
                     login shell.

       <b>-D            </b>Do not start the <b>tmux </b>server as a daemon.  This
                     also turns the <b>exit-empty </b>option off.  With <b>-D</b>,
                     <i>command</i> may not be specified.

       <b>-f </b><i>file</i>       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By
                     default, <b>tmux </b>loads the system configuration file
                     from <i>@SYSCONFDIR@/tmux.conf</i>, if present, then looks
                     for a user configuration file at <i>~/.tmux.conf</i> or
                     <i>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf</i>.

                     The configuration file is a set of <b>tmux </b>commands
                     which are executed in sequence when the server is
                     first started.  <b>tmux </b>loads configuration files once
                     when the server process has started.  The
                     <b>source-file </b>command may be used to load a file
                     later.

                     <b>tmux </b>shows any error messages from commands in
                     configuration files in the first session created,
                     and continues to process the rest of the
                     configuration file.

       <b>-L </b><i>socket-name</i>
                     <b>tmux </b>stores the server socket in a directory under
                     TMUX_TMPDIR or <i>/tmp</i> if it is unset.  The default
                     socket is named <i>default</i>.  This option allows a
                     different socket name to be specified, allowing
                     several independent <b>tmux </b>servers to be run.  Unlike
                     <b>-S </b>a full path is not necessary: the sockets are
                     all created in a directory <i>tmux-UID</i> under the
                     directory given by TMUX_TMPDIR or in <i>/tmp</i>.  The
                     <i>tmux-UID</i> directory is created by <b>tmux </b>and must not
                     be world readable, writable or executable.

                     If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1
                     signal may be sent to the <b>tmux </b>server process to
                     recreate it (note that this will fail if any parent
                     directories are missing).

       <b>-l            </b>Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has
                     no effect and is for compatibility with other
                     shells when using tmux as a login shell.

       <b>-N            </b>Do not start the server even if the command would
                     normally do so (for example <b>new-session </b>or
                     <b>start-server</b>).

       <b>-S </b><i>socket-path</i>
                     Specify a full alternative path to the server
                     socket.  If <b>-S </b>is specified, the default socket
                     directory is not used and any <b>-L </b>flag is ignored.

       <b>-T </b><i>features</i>   Set terminal features for the client.  This is a
                     comma-separated list of features.  See the
                     <b>terminal-features </b>option.

       <b>-u            </b>Write UTF-8 output to the terminal even if the
                     first environment variable of LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or
                     LANG that is set does not contain "UTF-8" or
                     "UTF8".

       <b>-V            </b>Report the <b>tmux </b>version.

       <b>-v            </b>Request verbose logging.  Log messages will be
                     saved into <i>tmux-client-PID.log</i> and
                     <i>tmux-server-PID.log</i> files in the current directory,
                     where <i>PID</i> is the PID of the server or client
                     process.  If <b>-v </b>is specified twice, an additional
                     <i>tmux-out-PID.log</i> file is generated with a copy of
                     everything <b>tmux </b>writes to the terminal.

                     The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the <b>tmux </b>server
                     process to toggle logging between on (as if <b>-v </b>was
                     given) and off.

       <i>command</i> [<i>flags</i>]
                     This specifies one of a set of commands used to
                     control <b>tmux</b>, as described in the following
                     sections.  If no commands are specified, the
                     <b>new-session </b>command is assumed.

DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>may be controlled from an attached client by using a key
       combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed
       by a command key.

       The default command key bindings are:

             C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the
                         application.

       commands.
</pre> <h2>
COMMAND PARSING AND EXECUTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>supports a large number of commands which can be used to
       control its behaviour.  Each command is named and can accept zero
       or more flags and arguments.  They may be bound to a key with the
       <b>bind-key </b>command or run from the shell prompt, a shell script, a
       configuration file or the command prompt.  For example, the same
       <b>set-option </b>command run from the shell prompt, from <i>~/.tmux.conf</i>
       and bound to a key may look like:

             $ tmux set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

             set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

             bind-key C set-option -g status-style bg=cyan

       Here, the command name is ‘set-option’, ‘<b>-g</b>’ is a flag and
       ‘status-style’ and ‘bg=cyan’ are arguments.

       <b>tmux </b>distinguishes between command parsing and execution.  In
       order to execute a command, <b>tmux </b>needs it to be split up into its
       name and arguments.  This is command parsing.  If a command is
       run from the shell, the shell parses it; from inside <b>tmux </b>or from
       a configuration file, <b>tmux </b>does.  Examples of when <b>tmux </b>parses
       commands are:

             <b>-   </b>in a configuration file;

             <b>-   </b>typed at the command prompt (see <b>command-prompt</b>);

             <b>-   </b>given to <b>bind-key</b>;

             <b>-   </b>passed as arguments to <b>if-shell </b>or <b>confirm-before</b>.

       To execute commands, each client has a ‘command queue’.  A global
       command queue not attached to any client is used on startup for
       configuration files like <i>~/.tmux.conf</i>.  Parsed commands added to
       the queue are executed in order.  Some commands, like <b>if-shell</b>
       and <b>confirm-before</b>, parse their argument to create a new command
       which is inserted immediately after themselves.  This means that
       arguments can be parsed twice or more - once when the parent
       command (such as <b>if-shell</b>) is parsed and again when it parses and
       executes its command.  Commands like <b>if-shell</b>, <b>run-shell </b>and
       <b>display-panes </b>stop execution of subsequent commands on the queue
       until something happens - <b>if-shell </b>and <b>run-shell </b>until a shell
       command finishes and <b>display-panes </b>until a key is pressed.  For
       example, the following commands:

             new-session; new-window
             if-shell "true" "split-window"
             kill-session

       Will execute <b>new-session</b>, <b>new-window</b>, <b>if-shell</b>, the shell command
       <i>true</i>(1), <b>split-window </b>and <b>kill-session </b>in that order.

       The “COMMANDS” section lists the <b>tmux </b>commands and their
       arguments.
</pre> <h2>
PARSING SYNTAX </h2>
<pre>
       This section describes the syntax of commands parsed by <b>tmux</b>, for
       example in a configuration file or at the command prompt.  Note
       that when commands are entered into the shell, they are parsed by
       the shell - see for example <i>ksh</i>(1) or <i>csh</i>(1).

       Each command is terminated by a newline or a semicolon (;).
       Commands separated by semicolons together form a ‘command
       sequence’ - if a command in the sequence encounters an error, no
       subsequent commands are executed.

       It is recommended that a semicolon used as a command separator
       should be written as an individual token, for example from <i>sh</i>(1):

             $ tmux neww \; splitw

       Or:

             $ tmux neww ';' splitw

       Or from the tmux command prompt:

             neww ; splitw

       However, a trailing semicolon is also interpreted as a command
       separator, for example in these <i>sh</i>(1) commands:

             $ tmux neww\; splitw

       Or:

             $ tmux 'neww;' splitw

       As in these examples, when running tmux from the shell extra care
       must be taken to properly quote semicolons:

             1.   Semicolons that should be interpreted as a command
                  separator should be escaped according to the shell
                  conventions.  For <i>sh</i>(1) this typically means quoted
                  (such as ‘neww ';' splitw’) or escaped (such as ‘neww
                  \\\\; splitw’).

             2.   Individual semicolons or trailing semicolons that
                  should be interpreted as arguments should be escaped
                  twice: once according to the shell conventions and a
                  second time for <b>tmux</b>; for example:

                        $ tmux neww 'foo\\;' bar
                        $ tmux neww foo\\\\; bar

             3.   Semicolons that are not individual tokens or trailing
                  another token should only be escaped once according to
                  shell conventions; for example:

                        $ tmux neww 'foo-;-bar'
                        $ tmux neww foo-\\;-bar

       Comments are marked by the unquoted # character - any remaining
       text after a comment is ignored until the end of the line.

       If the last character of a line is \, the line is joined with the
       following line (the \ and the newline are completely removed).
       This is called line continuation and applies both inside and
       outside quoted strings and in comments, but not inside braces.

       Command arguments may be specified as strings surrounded by
       single (') quotes, double quotes (") or braces ({}).  This is
       required when the argument contains any special character.
       Single and double quoted strings cannot span multiple lines
       except with line continuation.  Braces can span multiple lines.

       Outside of quotes and inside double quotes, these replacements
       are performed:

             <b>-   </b>Environment variables preceded by $ are replaced with
                 their value from the global environment (see the
                 “GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT” section).

             <b>-   </b>A leading ~ or ~user is expanded to the home directory
                 of the current or specified user.

             <b>-   </b>\uXXXX or \uXXXXXXXX is replaced by the Unicode
                 codepoint corresponding to the given four or eight
                 digit hexadecimal number.

             <b>-   </b>When preceded (escaped) by a \, the following
                 characters are replaced: \e by the escape character; \r
                 by a carriage return; \n by a newline; and \t by a tab.

             <b>-   </b>\ooo is replaced by a character of the octal value ooo.
                 Three octal digits are required, for example \001.  The
                 largest valid character is \377.

             <b>-   </b>Any other characters preceded by \ are replaced by
                 themselves (that is, the \ is removed) and are not
                 treated as having any special meaning - so for example
                 \; will not mark a command sequence and \$ will not
                 expand an environment variable.

       Braces are parsed as a configuration file (so conditions such as
       ‘%if’ are processed) and then converted into a string.  They are
       designed to avoid the need for additional escaping when passing a
       group of <b>tmux </b>commands as an argument (for example to <b>if-shell</b>).
       These two examples produce an identical command - note that no
       escaping is needed when using {}:

             if-shell true {
                 display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }$foo'
             }

             if-shell true "display -p 'brace-dollar-foo: }\$foo'"

       Braces may be enclosed inside braces, for example:

             bind x if-shell "true" {
                 if-shell "true" {
                     display "true!"
                 }
             }

       Environment variables may be set by using the syntax
       ‘name=value’, for example ‘HOME=/home/user’.  Variables set
       during parsing are added to the global environment.  A hidden
       variable may be set with ‘%hidden’, for example:

             %hidden MYVAR=42

       Hidden variables are not passed to the environment of processes
       created by tmux.  See the “GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT”
       section.

       Commands may be parsed conditionally by surrounding them with
       ‘%if’, ‘%elif’, ‘%else’ and ‘%endif’.  The argument to ‘%if’ and
       ‘%elif’ is expanded as a format (see “FORMATS”) and if it
       evaluates to false (zero or empty), subsequent text is ignored
       until the closing ‘%elif’, ‘%else’ or ‘%endif’.  For example:

             %if "#{==:#{host},myhost}"
             set -g status-style bg=red
             %elif "#{==:#{host},myotherhost}"
             set -g status-style bg=green
             %else
             set -g status-style bg=blue
             %endif

       Will change the status line to red if running on ‘myhost’, green
       if running on ‘myotherhost’, or blue if running on another host.
       Conditionals may be given on one line, for example:

             %if #{==:#{host},myhost} set -g status-style bg=red %endif
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       This section describes the commands supported by <b>tmux</b>.  Most
       commands accept the optional <b>-t </b>(and sometimes <b>-s</b>) argument with
       one of <i>target-client</i>, <i>target-session</i>, <i>target-window</i>, or
       <i>target-pane</i>.  These specify the client, session, window or pane
       which a command should affect.

       <i>target-client</i> should be the name of the client, typically the
       <i>pty</i>(4) file to which the client is connected, for example either
       of <i>/dev/ttyp1</i> or <i>ttyp1</i> for the client attached to <i>/dev/ttyp1</i>.  If
       no client is specified, <b>tmux </b>attempts to work out the client
       currently in use; if that fails, an error is reported.  Clients
       may be listed with the <b>list-clients </b>command.

       <i>target-session</i> is tried as, in order:

             1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

             2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the
                  <b>list-sessions </b>command).

             3.   The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’
                  would match a session named ‘mysession’.

             4.   An <i>fnmatch</i>(3) pattern which is matched against the
                  session name.

       If the session name is prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match
       is accepted (so ‘=mysess’ will only match exactly ‘mysess’, not
       ‘mysession’).

       If a single session is found, it is used as the target session;
       multiple matches produce an error.  If a session is omitted, the
       current session is used if available; if no current session is
       available, the most recently used is chosen.

       <i>target-window</i> (or <i>src-window</i> or <i>dst-window</i>) specifies a window in
       the form <i>session</i>:<i>window</i>.  <i>session</i> follows the same rules as for
       <i>target-session</i>, and <i>window</i> is looked for in order as:

             1.   A special token, listed below.

             2.   A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1
                  in session ‘mysession’.

             3.   A window ID, such as @1.

             4.   An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.

             5.   The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.

             6.   As an <i>fnmatch</i>(3) pattern matched against the window
                  name.

       Like sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An
       empty window name specifies the next unused index if appropriate
       (for example the <b>new-window </b>and <b>link-window </b>commands) otherwise
       the current window in <i>session</i> is chosen.

       The following special tokens are available to indicate particular
       windows.  Each has a single-character alternative form.

       <b>Token              Meaning</b>
       <b>{start}       </b>^    The lowest-numbered window
       <b>{end}         </b>$    The highest-numbered window
       <b>{last}        </b>!    The last (previously current) window
       <b>{next}        </b>+    The next window by number
       <b>{previous}    </b>-    The previous window by number

       <i>target-pane</i> (or <i>src-pane</i> or <i>dst-pane</i>) may be a pane ID or takes a
       similar form to <i>target-window</i> but with the optional addition of a
       period followed by a pane index or pane ID, for example:
       ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the
       currently active pane in the specified window is used.  The
       following special tokens are available for the pane index:

       <b>Token                  Meaning</b>
       <b>{last}            </b>!    The last (previously active) pane
       <b>{next}            </b>+    The next pane by number
       <b>{previous}        </b>-    The previous pane by number
       <b>{top}                  </b>The top pane
       <b>{bottom}               </b>The bottom pane
       <b>{left}                 </b>The leftmost pane
       <b>{right}                </b>The rightmost pane
       <b>{top-left}             </b>The top-left pane
       <b>{top-right}            </b>The top-right pane
       <b>{bottom-left}          </b>The bottom-left pane
       <b>{bottom-right}         </b>The bottom-right pane
       <b>{up-of}                </b>The pane above the active pane
       <b>{down-of}              </b>The pane below the active pane
       <b>{left-of}              </b>The pane to the left of the active pane
       <b>{right-of}             </b>The pane to the right of the active pane

       The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:

             select-window -t:+2

       In addition, <i>target-session</i>, <i>target-window</i> or <i>target-pane</i> may
       consist entirely of the token ‘{mouse}’ (alternative form ‘=’) to
       specify the session, window or pane where the most recent mouse
       event occurred (see the “MOUSE SUPPORT” section) or ‘{marked}’
       (alternative form ‘~’) to specify the marked pane (see
       <b>select-pane -m</b>).

       Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID;
       session IDs are prefixed with a ‘$’, windows with a ‘@’, and
       panes with a ‘%’.  These are unique and are unchanged for the
       life of the session, window or pane in the <b>tmux </b>server.  The pane
       ID is passed to the child process of the pane in the TMUX_PANE
       environment variable.  IDs may be displayed using the
       ‘session_id’, ‘window_id’, or ‘pane_id’ formats (see the
       “FORMATS” section) and the <b>display-message</b>, <b>list-sessions</b>,
       <b>list-windows </b>or <b>list-panes </b>commands.

       <i>shell-command</i> arguments are <i>sh</i>(1) commands.  This may be a single
       argument passed to the shell, for example:

             new-window 'vi ~/.tmux.conf'

       Will run:

             /bin/sh -c 'vi ~/.tmux.conf'

       Additionally, the <b>new-window</b>, <b>new-session</b>, <b>split-window</b>,
       <b>respawn-window </b>and <b>respawn-pane </b>commands allow <i>shell-command</i> to
       be given as multiple arguments and executed directly (without ‘sh
       -c’).  This can avoid issues with shell quoting.  For example:

             $ tmux new-window vi ~/.tmux.conf

       Will run <i>vi</i>(1) directly without invoking the shell.

       <i>command</i> [<i>argument ...</i>] refers to a <b>tmux </b>command, either passed
       with the command and arguments separately, for example:

             bind-key F1 set-option status off

       Or passed as a single string argument in <i>.tmux.conf</i>, for example:

             bind-key F1 { set-option status off }

       Example <b>tmux </b>commands include:

             refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

             rename-session -tfirst newname

             set-option -wt:0 monitor-activity on

             new-window ; split-window -d

             bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; \
                     display-message "source-file done"

       Or from <i>sh</i>(1):

             $ tmux kill-window -t :1

             $ tmux new-window \; split-window -d

             $ tmux new-session -d 'vi ~/.tmux.conf' \; split-window -d \; attach
</pre> <h2>
CLIENTS AND SESSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>tmux </b>server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.
       Clients are attached to sessions to interact with them, either
       when they are created with the <b>new-session </b>command, or later with
       the <b>attach-session </b>command.  Each session has one or more windows
       <i>linked</i> into it.  Windows may be linked to multiple sessions and
       are made up of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo
       terminal.  Commands for creating, linking and otherwise
       manipulating windows are covered in the “WINDOWS AND PANES”
       section.

       The following commands are available to manage clients and
       sessions:

       <b>attach-session </b>[<b>-dErx</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>working-directory</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>flags</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>target-session</i>]
                     (alias: <b>attach</b>)
               If run from outside <b>tmux</b>, attach to <i>target-session</i> in the
               current terminal.  <i>target-session</i> must already exist - to
               create a new session, see the <b>new-session </b>command (with
               <b>-A </b>to create or attach).  If used from inside, switch the
               currently attached session to <i>target-session</i>.  If <b>-d </b>is
               specified, any other clients attached to the session are
               detached.  If <b>-x </b>is given, send SIGHUP to the parent
               process of the client as well as detaching the client,
               typically causing it to exit.  <b>-f </b>sets a comma-separated
               list of client flags.  The flags are:

               active-pane
                       the client has an independent active pane

               ignore-size
                       the client does not affect the size of other
                       clients

               no-output
                       the client does not receive pane output in
                       control mode

               pause-after=seconds
                       output is paused once the pane is <i>seconds</i> behind
                       in control mode

               read-only
                       the client is read-only

               wait-exit
                       wait for an empty line input before exiting in
                       control mode

               A leading ‘!’ turns a flag off if the client is already
               attached.  <b>-r </b>is an alias for <b>-f </b><i>read-only,ignore-size</i>.
               When a client is read-only, only keys bound to the
               <b>detach-client </b>or <b>switch-client </b>commands have any effect.
               A client with the <i>active-pane</i> flag allows the active pane
               to be selected independently of the window's active pane
               used by clients without the flag.  This only affects the
               cursor position and commands issued from the client;
               other features such as hooks and styles continue to use
               the window's active pane.

               If no server is started, <b>attach-session </b>will attempt to
               start it; this will fail unless sessions are created in
               the configuration file.

               The <i>target-session</i> rules for <b>attach-session </b>are slightly
               adjusted: if <b>tmux </b>needs to select the most recently used
               session, it will prefer the most recently used <i>unattached</i>
               session.

               <b>-c </b>will set the session working directory (used for new
               windows) to <i>working-directory</i>.

               If <b>-E </b>is used, the <b>update-environment </b>option will not be
               applied.

       <b>detach-client </b>[<b>-aP</b>] [<b>-E </b><i>shell-command</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>target-session</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>target-client</i>]
                     (alias: <b>detach</b>)
               Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client
               specified with <b>-t</b>, or all clients currently attached to
               the session specified by <b>-s</b>.  The <b>-a </b>option kills all but
               the client given with <b>-t</b>.  If <b>-P </b>is given, send SIGHUP to
               the parent process of the client, typically causing it to
               exit.  With <b>-E</b>, run <i>shell-command</i> to replace the client.

       <b>has-session </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                     (alias: <b>has</b>)
               Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session
               does not exist.  If it does exist, exit with 0.

       <b>kill-server</b>
               Kill the <b>tmux </b>server and clients and destroy all
               sessions.

       <b>kill-session </b>[<b>-aC</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
               Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to
               it and no other sessions, and detaching all clients
               attached to it.  If <b>-a </b>is given, all sessions but the
               specified one is killed.  The <b>-C </b>flag clears alerts
               (bell, activity, or silence) in all windows linked to the
               session.

       <b>list-clients </b>[<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                     (alias: <b>lsc</b>)
               List all clients attached to the server.  <b>-F </b>specifies
               the format of each line and <b>-f </b>a filter.  Only clients
               for which the filter is true are shown.  See the
               “FORMATS” section.  If <i>target-session</i> is specified, list
               only clients connected to that session.

       <b>list-commands </b>[<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<i>command</i>]
                     (alias: <b>lscm</b>)
               List the syntax of <i>command</i> or - if omitted - of all
               commands supported by <b>tmux</b>.

       <b>list-sessions </b>[<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>]
                     (alias: <b>ls</b>)
               List all sessions managed by the server.  <b>-F </b>specifies
               the format of each line and <b>-f </b>a filter.  Only sessions
               for which the filter is true are shown.  See the
               “FORMATS” section.

       <b>lock-client </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>]
                     (alias: <b>lockc</b>)
               Lock <i>target-client</i>, see the <b>lock-server </b>command.

       <b>lock-session </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                     (alias: <b>locks</b>)
               Lock all clients attached to <i>target-session</i>.

       <b>new-session </b>[<b>-AdDEPX</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>start-directory</i>] [<b>-e </b><i>environment</i>] [<b>-f</b>
               <i>flags</i>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-n </b><i>window-name</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>session-name</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>group-name</i>] [<b>-x </b><i>width</i>] [<b>-y </b><i>height</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>]
                     (alias: <b>new</b>)
               Create a new session with name <i>session-name</i>.

               The new session is attached to the current terminal
               unless <b>-d </b>is given.  <i>window-name</i> and <i>shell-command</i> are
               the name of and shell command to execute in the initial
               window.  With <b>-d</b>, the initial size comes from the global
               <b>default-size </b>option; <b>-x </b>and <b>-y </b>can be used to specify a
               different size.  ‘-’ uses the size of the current client
               if any.  If <b>-x </b>or <b>-y </b>is given, the <b>default-size </b>option is
               set for the session.  <b>-f </b>sets a comma-separated list of
               client flags (see <b>attach-session</b>).

               If run from a terminal, any <i>termios</i>(4) special characters
               are saved and used for new windows in the new session.

               The <b>-A </b>flag makes <b>new-session </b>behave like <b>attach-session</b>
               if <i>session-name</i> already exists; if <b>-A </b>is given, <b>-D</b>
               behaves like <b>-d </b>to <b>attach-session</b>, and <b>-X </b>behaves like <b>-x</b>
               to <b>attach-session</b>.

               If <b>-t </b>is given, it specifies a <b>session group</b>.  Sessions
               in the same group share the same set of windows - new
               windows are linked to all sessions in the group and any
               windows closed removed from all sessions.  The current
               and previous window and any session options remain
               independent and any session in a group may be killed
               without affecting the others.  The <i>group-name</i> argument
               may be:

               1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the
                       new session is added to that group;

               2.      the name of an existing session - the new session
                       is added to the same group as that session,
                       creating a new group if necessary;

               3.      the name for a new group containing only the new
                       session.

               <b>-n </b>and <i>shell-command</i> are invalid if <b>-t </b>is used.

               The <b>-P </b>option prints information about the new session
               after it has been created.  By default, it uses the
               format ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different format may be
               specified with <b>-F</b>.

               If <b>-E </b>is used, the <b>update-environment </b>option will not be
               applied.  <b>-e </b>takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an
               environment variable for the newly created session; it
               may be specified multiple times.

       <b>refresh-client </b>[<b>-cDLRSU</b>] [<b>-A </b><i>pane:state</i>] [<b>-B </b><i>name:what:format</i>]
               [<b>-C </b><i>size</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>flags</i>] [<b>-l </b>[<i>target-pane</i>]] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>target-client</i>] [<i>adjustment</i>]
                     (alias: <b>refresh</b>)
               Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single
               client if one is given with <b>-t</b>.  If <b>-S </b>is specified, only
               update the client's status line.

               The <b>-U</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-L -R</b>, and <b>-c </b>flags allow the visible portion
               of a window which is larger than the client to be
               changed.  <b>-U </b>moves the visible part up by <i>adjustment</i> rows
               and <b>-D </b>down, <b>-L </b>left by <i>adjustment</i> columns and <b>-R </b>right.
               <b>-c </b>returns to tracking the cursor automatically.  If
               <i>adjustment</i> is omitted, 1 is used.  Note that the visible
               position is a property of the client not of the window,
               changing the current window in the attached session will
               reset it.

               <b>-C </b>sets the width and height of a control mode client or
               of a window for a control mode client, <i>size</i> must be one
               of ‘widthxheight’ or ‘window ID:widthxheight’, for
               example ‘80x24’ or ‘@0:80x24’.  <b>-A </b>allows a control mode
               client to trigger actions on a pane.  The argument is a
               pane ID (with leading ‘%’), a colon, then one of ‘on’,
               ‘off’, ‘continue’ or ‘pause’.  If ‘off’, <b>tmux </b>will not
               send output from the pane to the client and if all
               clients have turned the pane off, will stop reading from
               the pane.  If ‘continue’, <b>tmux </b>will return to sending
               output to the pane if it was paused (manually or with the
               <i>pause-after</i> flag).  If ‘pause’, <b>tmux </b>will pause the pane.
               <b>-A </b>may be given multiple times for different panes.

               <b>-B </b>sets a subscription to a format for a control mode
               client.  The argument is split into three items by
               colons: <i>name</i> is a name for the subscription; <i>what</i> is a
               type of item to subscribe to; <i>format</i> is the format.
               After a subscription is added, changes to the format are
               reported with the <b>%subscription-changed </b>notification, at
               most once a second.  If only the name is given, the
               subscription is removed.  <i>what</i> may be empty to check the
               format only for the attached session, or one of: a pane
               ID such as ‘%0’; ‘%*’ for all panes in the attached
               session; a window ID such as ‘@0’; or ‘@*’ for all
               windows in the attached session.

               <b>-f </b>sets a comma-separated list of client flags, see
               <b>attach-session</b>.

               <b>-l </b>requests the clipboard from the client using the
               <i>xterm</i>(1) escape sequence.  If <i>target-pane</i> is given, the
               clipboard is sent (in encoded form), otherwise it is
               stored in a new paste buffer.

               <b>-L</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-U </b>and <b>-D </b>move the visible portion of the window
               left, right, up or down by <i>adjustment</i>, if the window is
               larger than the client.  <b>-c </b>resets so that the position
               follows the cursor.  See the <b>window-size </b>option.

       <b>rename-session </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>] <i>new-name</i>
                     (alias: <b>rename</b>)
               Rename the session to <i>new-name</i>.

       <b>server-access </b>[<b>-adlrw</b>] [<i>user</i>]
               Change the access or read/write permission of <i>user</i>.  The
               user running the <b>tmux </b>server (its owner) and the root
               user cannot be changed and are always permitted access.

               <b>-a </b>and <b>-d </b>are used to give or revoke access for the
               specified user.  If the user is already attached, the <b>-d</b>
               flag causes their clients to be detached.

               <b>-r </b>and <b>-w </b>change the permissions for <i>user</i>: <b>-r </b>makes their
               clients read-only and <b>-w </b>writable.  <b>-l </b>lists current
               access permissions.

               By default, the access list is empty and <b>tmux </b>creates
               sockets with file system permissions preventing access by
               any user other than the owner (and root).  These
               permissions must be changed manually.  Great care should
               be taken not to allow access to untrusted users even
               read-only.

       <b>show-messages </b>[<b>-JT</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>]
                     (alias: <b>showmsgs</b>)
               Show server messages or information.  Messages are
               stored, up to a maximum of the limit set by the
               <i>message-limit</i> server option.  <b>-J </b>and <b>-T </b>show debugging
               information about jobs and terminals.

       <b>source-file </b>[<b>-Fnqv</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] <i>path ...</i>
                     (alias: <b>source</b>)
               Execute commands from one or more files specified by <i>path</i>
               (which may be <i>glob</i>(7) patterns).  If <b>-F </b>is present, then
               <i>path</i> is expanded as a format.  If <b>-q </b>is given, no error
               will be returned if <i>path</i> does not exist.  With <b>-n</b>, the
               file is parsed but no commands are executed.  <b>-v </b>shows
               the parsed commands and line numbers if possible.

       <b>start-server</b>
                     (alias: <b>start</b>)
               Start the <b>tmux </b>server, if not already running, without
               creating any sessions.

               Note that as by default the <b>tmux </b>server will exit with no
               sessions, this is only useful if a session is created in
               <i>~/.tmux.conf</i>, <b>exit-empty </b>is turned off, or another
               command is run as part of the same command sequence.  For
               example:

                     $ tmux start \; show -g

       <b>suspend-client </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>]
                     (alias: <b>suspendc</b>)
               Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).

       <b>switch-client </b>[<b>-ElnprZ</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>target-client</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
               [<b>-T </b><i>key-table</i>]
                     (alias: <b>switchc</b>)
               Switch the current session for client <i>target-client</i> to
               <i>target-session</i>.  As a special case, <b>-t </b>may refer to a
               pane (a target that contains ‘:’, ‘.’ or ‘%’), to change
               session, window and pane.  In that case, <b>-Z </b>keeps the
               window zoomed if it was zoomed.  If <b>-l</b>, <b>-n </b>or <b>-p </b>is used,
               the client is moved to the last, next or previous session
               respectively.  <b>-r </b>toggles the client <b>read-only </b>and
               <b>ignore-size </b>flags (see the <b>attach-session </b>command).

               If <b>-E </b>is used, <b>update-environment </b>option will not be
               applied.

               <b>-T </b>sets the client's key table; the next key from the
               client will be interpreted from <i>key-table</i>.  This may be
               used to configure multiple prefix keys, or to bind
               commands to sequences of keys.  For example, to make
               typing ‘abc’ run the <b>list-keys </b>command:

                     bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
                     bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
                     bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1
</pre> <h2>
WINDOWS AND PANES </h2>
<pre>
       Each window displayed by <b>tmux </b>may be split into one or more
       <i>panes</i>; each pane takes up a certain area of the display and is a
       separate terminal.  A window may be split into panes using the
       <b>split-window </b>command.  Windows may be split horizontally (with
       the <b>-h </b>flag) or vertically.  Panes may be resized with the
       <b>resize-pane </b>command (bound to ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’ ‘C-Left’ and
       ‘C-Right’ by default), the current pane may be changed with the
       <b>select-pane </b>command and the <b>rotate-window </b>and <b>swap-pane </b>commands
       may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes
       are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are created.

       By default, a <b>tmux </b>pane permits direct access to the terminal
       contained in the pane.  A pane may also be put into one of
       several modes:

             <b>-   </b>Copy mode, which permits a section of a window or its
                 history to be copied to a <i>paste buffer</i> for later
                 insertion into another window.  This mode is entered
                 with the <b>copy-mode </b>command, bound to ‘[’ by default.
                 Copied text can be pasted with the <b>paste-buffer</b>
                 command, bound to ‘]’.

             <b>-   </b>View mode, which is like copy mode but is entered when
                 a command that produces output, such as <b>list-keys</b>, is
                 executed from a key binding.

             <b>-   </b>Choose mode, which allows an item to be chosen from a
                 list.  This may be a client, a session or window or
                 pane, or a buffer.  This mode is entered with the
                 <b>choose-buffer</b>, <b>choose-client </b>and <b>choose-tree </b>commands.

       In copy mode an indicator is displayed in the top-right corner of
       the pane with the current position and the number of lines in the
       history.

       Commands are sent to copy mode using the <b>-X </b>flag to the <b>send-keys</b>
       command.  When a key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one
       of two key tables, depending on the <b>mode-keys </b>option: <b>copy-mode</b>
       for emacs, or <b>copy-mode-vi </b>for vi.  Key tables may be viewed with
       the <b>list-keys </b>command.

       The following commands are supported in copy mode:

       <b>append-selection</b>
               Append the selection to the top paste buffer.

       <b>append-selection-and-cancel </b>(vi: A)
               Append the selection to the top paste buffer and exit
               copy mode.

       <b>back-to-indentation </b>(vi: ^) (emacs: M-m)
               Move the cursor back to the indentation.

       <b>begin-selection </b>(vi: Space) (emacs: C-Space)
               Begin selection.

       <b>bottom-line </b>(vi: L)
               Move to the bottom line.

       <b>cancel </b>(vi: q) (emacs: Escape)
               Exit copy mode.

       <b>clear-selection </b>(vi: Escape) (emacs: C-g)
               Clear the current selection.

       <b>copy-end-of-line </b>[<i>prefix</i>]
               Copy from the cursor position to the end of the line.
               <i>prefix</i> is used to name the new paste buffer.

       <b>copy-end-of-line-and-cancel </b>[<i>prefix</i>]
               Copy from the cursor position and exit copy mode.

       <b>copy-line </b>[<i>prefix</i>]
               Copy the entire line.

       <b>copy-line-and-cancel </b>[<i>prefix</i>]
               Copy the entire line and exit copy mode.

       <b>copy-selection </b>[<i>prefix</i>]
               Copies the current selection.

       <b>copy-selection-and-cancel </b>[<i>prefix</i>] (vi: Enter) (emacs: M-w)
               Copy the current selection and exit copy mode.

       <b>cursor-down </b>(vi: j) (emacs: Down)
               Move the cursor down.

       <b>cursor-left </b>(vi: h) (emacs: Left)

       <b>middle-line </b>(vi: M) (emacs: M-r)
               Move to the middle line.

       <b>next-matching-bracket </b>(vi: %) (emacs: M-C-f)
               Move to the next matching bracket.

       <b>next-paragraph </b>(vi: }) (emacs: M-})
               Move to the next paragraph.

       <b>next-prompt </b>[<b>-o</b>]
               Move to the next prompt.

       <b>next-word </b>(vi: w)
               Move to the next word.

       <b>page-down </b>(vi: C-f) (emacs: PageDown)
               Scroll down by one page.

       <b>page-up </b>(vi: C-b) (emacs: PageUp)
               Scroll up by one page.

       <b>previous-matching-bracket </b>(emacs: M-C-b)
               Move to the previous matching bracket.

       <b>previous-paragraph </b>(vi: {) (emacs: M-{)
               Move to the previous paragraph.

       <b>previous-prompt </b>[<b>-o</b>]
               Move to the previous prompt.

       <b>previous-word </b>(vi: b) (emacs: M-b)
               Move to the previous word.

       <b>rectangle-toggle </b>(vi: v) (emacs: R)
               Toggle rectangle selection mode.

       <b>refresh-from-pane </b>(vi: r) (emacs: r)
               Refresh the content from the pane.

       <b>search-again </b>(vi: n) (emacs: n)
               Repeat the last search.

       <b>search-backward </b><i>text</i> (vi: ?)
               Search backwards for the specified text.

       <b>search-forward </b><i>text</i> (vi: /)
               Search forward for the specified text.

       <b>select-line </b>(vi: V)
               Select the current line.

       <b>select-word</b>
               Select the current word.

       <b>start-of-line </b>(vi: 0) (emacs: C-a)
               Move the cursor to the start of the line.

       <b>top-line </b>(vi: H) (emacs: M-R)
               Move to the top line.

       The search commands come in several varieties: ‘search-forward’
       and ‘search-backward’ search for a regular expression; the
       ‘-text’ variants search for a plain text string rather than a
       regular expression; ‘-incremental’ perform an incremental search
       and expect to be used with the <b>-i </b>flag to the <b>command-prompt</b>
       command.  ‘search-again’ repeats the last search and
       ‘search-reverse’ does the same but reverses the direction
       (forward becomes backward and backward becomes forward).

       The ‘next-prompt’ and ‘previous-prompt’ move between shell
       prompts, but require the shell to emit an escape sequence
       (\033]133;A\033\\) to tell <b>tmux </b>where the prompts are located; if
       the shell does not do this, these commands will do nothing.  The
       <b>-o </b>flag jumps to the beginning of the command output instead of
       the shell prompt.

       Copy commands may take an optional buffer prefix argument which
       is used to generate the buffer name (the default is ‘buffer’ so
       buffers are named ‘buffer0’, ‘buffer1’ and so on).  Pipe commands
       take a command argument which is the command to which the
       selected text is piped.  ‘copy-pipe’ variants also copy the
       selection.  The ‘-and-cancel’ variants of some commands exit copy
       mode after they have completed (for copy commands) or when the
       cursor reaches the bottom (for scrolling commands).  ‘-no-clear’
       variants do not clear the selection.

       The next and previous word keys skip over whitespace and treat
       consecutive runs of either word separators or other letters as
       words.  Word separators can be customized with the
       <i>word-separators</i> session option.  Next word moves to the start of
       the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and
       previous word to the start of the previous word.  The three next
       and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as
       the word separator.  Setting <i>word-separators</i> to the empty string
       makes next/previous word equivalent to next/previous space.

       The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For
       instance, typing ‘f’ followed by ‘/’ will move the cursor to the
       next ‘/’ character on the current line.  A ‘;’ will then jump to
       the next occurrence.

       Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat
       count.  With vi key bindings, a prefix is entered using the
       number keys; with emacs, the Alt (meta) key and a number begins
       prefix entry.

       The synopsis for the <b>copy-mode </b>command is:

       <b>copy-mode </b>[<b>-eHMqu</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-pane</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
               Enter copy mode.  The <b>-u </b>option scrolls one page up.  <b>-M</b>
               begins a mouse drag (only valid if bound to a mouse key
               binding, see “MOUSE SUPPORT”).  <b>-H </b>hides the position
               indicator in the top right.  <b>-q </b>cancels copy mode and any
               other modes.  <b>-s </b>copies from <i>src-pane</i> instead of
               <i>target-pane</i>.

               <b>-e </b>specifies that scrolling to the bottom of the history
               (to the visible screen) should exit copy mode.  While in
               copy mode, pressing a key other than those used for
               scrolling will disable this behaviour.  This is intended
               to allow fast scrolling through a pane's history, for
               example with:

                     bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

       A number of preset arrangements of panes are available, these are
       called layouts.  These may be selected with the <b>select-layout</b>
       command or cycled with <b>next-layout </b>(bound to ‘Space’ by default);
       once a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized
       as normal.

       The following layouts are supported:

       <b>even-horizontal</b>
               Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the
               window.

       <b>even-vertical</b>
               Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

       <b>main-horizontal</b>
               A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and
               the remaining panes are spread from left to right in the
               leftover space at the bottom.  Use the <i>main-pane-height</i>
               window option to specify the height of the top pane.

       <b>main-vertical</b>
               Similar to <b>main-horizontal </b>but the large pane is placed
               on the left and the others spread from top to bottom
               along the right.  See the <i>main-pane-width</i> window option.

       <b>tiled   </b>Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the
               window in both rows and columns.

       In addition, <b>select-layout </b>may be used to apply a previously used
       layout - the <b>list-windows </b>command displays the layout of each
       window in a form suitable for use with <b>select-layout</b>.  For
       example:

             $ tmux list-windows
             0: ksh [159x48]
                 layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
             $ tmux select-layout 'bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}'

       <b>tmux </b>automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current
       window size.  Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window
       with more panes than that from which the layout was originally
       defined.

       Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

       <b>break-pane </b>[<b>-abdP</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-n </b><i>window-name</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-pane</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>dst-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>breakp</b>)
               Break <i>src-pane</i> off from its containing window to make it
               the only pane in <i>dst-window</i>.  With <b>-a </b>or <b>-b</b>, the window
               is moved to the next index after or before (existing
               windows are moved if necessary).  If <b>-d </b>is given, the new
               window does not become the current window.  The <b>-P </b>option
               prints information about the new window after it has been
               created.  By default, it uses the format
               ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}.#{pane_index}’ but a
               different format may be specified with <b>-F</b>.

       <b>capture-pane </b>[<b>-aAepPqCJN</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] [<b>-E </b><i>end-line</i>] [<b>-S</b>
               <i>start-line</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
                     (alias: <b>capturep</b>)
               Capture the contents of a pane.  If <b>-p </b>is given, the
               output goes to stdout, otherwise to the buffer specified
               with <b>-b </b>or a new buffer if omitted.  If <b>-a </b>is given, the
               alternate screen is used, and the history is not
               accessible.  If no alternate screen exists, an error will
               be returned unless <b>-q </b>is given.  If <b>-e </b>is given, the
               output includes escape sequences for text and background
               attributes.  <b>-C </b>also escapes non-printable characters as
               octal \xxx.  <b>-T </b>ignores trailing positions that do not
               contain a character.  <b>-N </b>preserves trailing spaces at
               each line's end and <b>-J </b>preserves trailing spaces and
               joins any wrapped lines; <b>-J </b>implies <b>-T</b>.  <b>-P </b>captures only
               any output that the pane has received that is the
               beginning of an as-yet incomplete escape sequence.

               <b>-S </b>and <b>-E </b>specify the starting and ending line numbers,
               zero is the first line of the visible pane and negative
               numbers are lines in the history.  ‘-’ to <b>-S </b>is the start
               of the history and to <b>-E </b>the end of the visible pane.
               The default is to capture only the visible contents of
               the pane.

       <b>choose-client </b>[<b>-NrZ</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-K </b><i>key-format</i>] [<b>-O</b>
               <i>sort-order</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>template</i>]
               Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be
               selected interactively from a list.  Each client is shown
               on one line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left in
               brackets allowing for immediate choice, or the list may
               be navigated and an item chosen or otherwise manipulated
               using the keys below.  <b>-Z </b>zooms the pane.  The following
               keys may be used in client mode:

                     <b>Key    Function</b>
                     <b>Enter  </b>Choose selected client
                     <b>Up     </b>Select previous client
                     <b>Down   </b>Select next client
                     <b>C-s    </b>Search by name
                     <b>n      </b>Repeat last search forwards
                     <b>N      </b>Repeat last search backwards
                     <b>t      </b>Toggle if client is tagged
                     <b>T      </b>Tag no clients
                     <b>C-t    </b>Tag all clients
                     <b>d      </b>Detach selected client
                     <b>D      </b>Detach tagged clients
                     <b>x      </b>Detach and HUP selected client
                     <b>X      </b>Detach and HUP tagged clients
                     <b>z      </b>Suspend selected client
                     <b>Z      </b>Suspend tagged clients
                     <b>f      </b>Enter a format to filter items
                     <b>O      </b>Change sort field
                     <b>r      </b>Reverse sort order
                     <b>v      </b>Toggle preview
                     <b>q      </b>Exit mode

               After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client
               name in <i>template</i> and the result executed as a command.
               If <i>template</i> is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is
               used.

               <b>-O </b>specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘name’,
               ‘size’, ‘creation’ (time), or ‘activity’ (time).  <b>-r</b>
               reverses the sort order.  <b>-f </b>specifies an initial filter:
               the filter is a format - if it evaluates to zero, the
               item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If
               a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  <b>-F</b>
               specifies the format for each item in the list and <b>-K </b>a
               format for each shortcut key; both are evaluated once for
               each line.  <b>-N </b>starts without the preview.  This command
               works only if at least one client is attached.

       <b>choose-tree </b>[<b>-GNrswZ</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-K </b><i>key-format</i>] [<b>-O</b>
               <i>sort-order</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>template</i>]
               Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or
               pane may be chosen interactively from a tree.  Each
               session, window or pane is shown on one line.  A shortcut
               key is shown on the left in brackets allowing for
               immediate choice, or the tree may be navigated and an
               item chosen or otherwise manipulated using the keys
               below.  <b>-s </b>starts with sessions collapsed and <b>-w </b>with
               windows collapsed.  <b>-Z </b>zooms the pane.  The following
               keys may be used in tree mode:

                     <b>Key    Function</b>
                     <b>Enter  </b>Choose selected item
                     <b>Up     </b>Select previous item
                     <b>Down   </b>Select next item
                     <b>+      </b>Expand selected item

                     <b>M      </b>Clear the marked pane
                     <b>n      </b>Repeat last search forwards
                     <b>N      </b>Repeat last search backwards
                     <b>t      </b>Toggle if item is tagged
                     <b>T      </b>Tag no items
                     <b>C-t    </b>Tag all items
                     <b>:      </b>Run a command for each tagged item
                     <b>f      </b>Enter a format to filter items
                     <b>H      </b>Jump to the starting pane
                     <b>O      </b>Change sort field
                     <b>r      </b>Reverse sort order
                     <b>v      </b>Toggle preview
                     <b>q      </b>Exit mode

               After a session, window or pane is chosen, the first
               instance of ‘%%’ and all instances of ‘%1’ are replaced
               by the target in <i>template</i> and the result executed as a
               command.  If <i>template</i> is not given, "switch-client -t
               '%%'" is used.

               <b>-O </b>specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘index’,
               ‘name’, or ‘time’ (activity).  <b>-r </b>reverses the sort
               order.  <b>-f </b>specifies an initial filter: the filter is a
               format - if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is
               not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead
               to an empty list, it is ignored.  <b>-F </b>specifies the format
               for each item in the tree and <b>-K </b>a format for each
               shortcut key; both are evaluated once for each line.  <b>-N</b>
               starts without the preview.  <b>-G </b>includes all sessions in
               any session groups in the tree rather than only the
               first.  This command works only if at least one client is
               attached.

       <b>customize-mode </b>[<b>-NZ</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
               [<i>template</i>]
               Put a pane into customize mode, where options and key
               bindings may be browsed and modified from a list.  Option
               values in the list are shown for the active pane in the
               current window.  <b>-Z </b>zooms the pane.  The following keys
               may be used in customize mode:

                     <b>Key    Function</b>
                     <b>Enter  </b>Set pane, window, session or global option
                                        value
                     <b>Up     </b>Select previous item

               <b>-f </b>specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format -
               if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not
               shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead to
               an empty list, it is ignored.  <b>-F </b>specifies the format
               for each item in the tree.  <b>-N </b>starts without the option
               information.  This command works only if at least one
               client is attached.

       <b>display-panes </b>[<b>-bN</b>] [<b>-d </b><i>duration</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>] [<i>template</i>]
                     (alias: <b>displayp</b>)
               Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by
               <i>target-client</i>.  See the <b>display-panes-colour </b>and
               <b>display-panes-active-colour </b>session options.  The
               indicator is closed when a key is pressed (unless <b>-N </b>is

               not given, <b>display-panes-time </b>is used.  A duration of
               zero means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.
               While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be chosen
               with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys, which will cause <i>template</i> to be
               executed as a command with ‘%%’ substituted by the pane
               ID.  The default <i>template</i> is "select-pane -t '%%'".  With
               <b>-b</b>, other commands are not blocked from running until the
               indicator is closed.

       <b>find-window </b>[<b>-iCNrTZ</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] <i>match-string</i>
                     (alias: <b>findw</b>)
               Search for a <i>fnmatch</i>(3) pattern or, with <b>-r</b>, regular
               expression <i>match-string</i> in window names, titles, and
               visible content (but not history).  The flags control
               matching behavior: <b>-C </b>matches only visible window
               contents, <b>-N </b>matches only the window name and <b>-T </b>matches
               only the window title.  <b>-i </b>makes the search ignore case.
               The default is <b>-CNT</b>.  <b>-Z </b>zooms the pane.

               This command works only if at least one client is
               attached.

       <b>join-pane </b>[<b>-bdfhv</b>] [<b>-l </b><i>size</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-pane</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-pane</i>]
                     (alias: <b>joinp</b>)
               Like <b>split-window</b>, but instead of splitting <i>dst-pane</i> and
               creating a new pane, split it and move <i>src-pane</i> into the
               space.  This can be used to reverse <b>break-pane</b>.  The <b>-b</b>
               option causes <i>src-pane</i> to be joined to left of or above
               <i>dst-pane</i>.

               If <b>-s </b>is omitted and a marked pane is present (see
               <b>select-pane -m</b>), the marked pane is used rather than the
               current pane.

       <b>kill-pane </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
                     (alias: <b>killp</b>)
               Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the
               containing window, it is also destroyed.  The <b>-a </b>option
               kills all but the pane given with <b>-t</b>.

       <b>kill-window </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>killw</b>)
               Kill the current window or the window at <i>target-window</i>,
               removing it from any sessions to which it is linked.  The
               <b>-a </b>option kills all but the window given with <b>-t</b>.

       <b>last-pane </b>[<b>-deZ</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>lastp</b>)
               Select the last (previously selected) pane.  <b>-Z </b>keeps the
               window zoomed if it was zoomed.  <b>-e </b>enables or <b>-d</b>
               disables input to the pane.

       <b>last-window </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                     (alias: <b>last</b>)
               Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no
               <i>target-session</i> is specified, select the last window of
               the current session.

       <b>link-window </b>[<b>-abdk</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-window</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>linkw</b>)
               Link the window at <i>src-window</i> to the specified
               <i>dst-window</i>.  If <i>dst-window</i> is specified and no such
               window exists, the <i>src-window</i> is linked there.  With <b>-a</b>
               or <b>-b </b>the window is moved to the next index after or
               before <i>dst-window</i> (existing windows are moved if
               necessary).  If <b>-k </b>is given and <i>dst-window</i> exists, it is
               killed, otherwise an error is generated.  If <b>-d </b>is given,
               the newly linked window is not selected.

       <b>list-panes </b>[<b>-as</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target</i>]
                     (alias: <b>lsp</b>)
               If <b>-a </b>is given, <i>target</i> is ignored and all panes on the
               server are listed.  If <b>-s </b>is given, <i>target</i> is a session
               (or the current session).  If neither is given, <i>target</i> is
               a window (or the current window).  <b>-F </b>specifies the
               format of each line and <b>-f </b>a filter.  Only panes for
               which the filter is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS”
               section.

       <b>list-windows </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                     (alias: <b>lsw</b>)
               If <b>-a </b>is given, list all windows on the server.
               Otherwise, list windows in the current session or in
               <i>target-session</i>.  <b>-F </b>specifies the format of each line and
               <b>-f </b>a filter.  Only windows for which the filter is true
               are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       <b>move-pane </b>[<b>-bdfhv</b>] [<b>-l </b><i>size</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-pane</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-pane</i>]
                     (alias: <b>movep</b>)
               Does the same as <b>join-pane</b>.

       <b>move-window </b>[<b>-abrdk</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-window</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>movew</b>)
               This is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the window at
               <i>src-window</i> is moved to <i>dst-window</i>.  With <b>-r</b>, all windows
               in the session are renumbered in sequential order,
               respecting the <b>base-index </b>option.

       <b>new-window </b>[<b>-abdkPS</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>start-directory</i>] [<b>-e </b><i>environment</i>] [<b>-F</b>
               <i>format</i>] [<b>-n </b><i>window-name</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
               [<i>shell-command</i>]
                     (alias: <b>neww</b>)
               Create a new window.  With <b>-a </b>or <b>-b</b>, the new window is
               inserted at the next index after or before the specified
               <i>target-window</i>, moving windows up if necessary; otherwise
               <i>target-window</i> is the new window location.

               If <b>-d </b>is given, the session does not make the new window
               the current window.  <i>target-window</i> represents the window
               to be created; if the target already exists an error is
               shown, unless the <b>-k </b>flag is used, in which case it is
               destroyed.  If <b>-S </b>is given and a window named <i>window-name</i>
               already exists, it is selected (unless <b>-d </b>is also given
               in which case the command does nothing).

               <i>shell-command</i> is the command to execute.  If
               <i>shell-command</i> is not specified, the value of the
               <b>default-command </b>option is used.  <b>-c </b>specifies the working
               directory in which the new window is created.

               When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See
               the <b>remain-on-exit </b>option to change this behaviour.

               <b>-e </b>takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an
               environment variable for the newly created window; it may
               be specified multiple times.

               The TERM environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or
               ‘tmux’ for all programs running <i>inside</i> <b>tmux</b>.  New windows
               will automatically have ‘TERM=screen’ added to their
               environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in
               shell start-up files or by the <b>-e </b>option.

               The <b>-P </b>option prints information about the new window
               after it has been created.  By default, it uses the
               format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different
               format may be specified with <b>-F</b>.

       <b>next-layout </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>nextl</b>)
               Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes
               to fit.

       <b>next-window </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                     (alias: <b>next</b>)
               Move to the next window in the session.  If <b>-a </b>is used,
               move to the next window with an alert.

       <b>pipe-pane </b>[<b>-IOo</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>]
                     (alias: <b>pipep</b>)
               Pipe output sent by the program in <i>target-pane</i> to a shell
               command or vice versa.  A pane may only be connected to
               one command at a time, any existing pipe is closed before
               <i>shell-command</i> is executed.  The <i>shell-command</i> string may
               contain the special character sequences supported by the
               <b>status-left </b>option.  If no <i>shell-command</i> is given, the
               current pipe (if any) is closed.

               <b>-I </b>and <b>-O </b>specify which of the <i>shell-command</i> output
               streams are connected to the pane: with <b>-I </b>stdout is
               connected (so anything <i>shell-command</i> prints is written to
               the pane as if it were typed); with <b>-O </b>stdin is connected
               (so any output in the pane is piped to <i>shell-command</i>).
               Both may be used together and if neither are specified,
               <b>-O </b>is used.

               The <b>-o </b>option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe
               exists, allowing a pipe to be toggled with a single key,
               for example:

                     bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat &gt;&gt;~/output.#I-#P'

       <b>previous-layout </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>prevl</b>)
               Move to the previous layout in the session.

       <b>previous-window </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>]
                     (alias: <b>prev</b>)
               Move to the previous window in the session.  With <b>-a</b>,
               move to the previous window with an alert.

       <b>rename-window </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>] <i>new-name</i>
                     (alias: <b>renamew</b>)
               Rename the current window, or the window at <i>target-window</i>
               if specified, to <i>new-name</i>.

       <b>resize-pane </b>[<b>-DLMRTUZ</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<b>-x </b><i>width</i>] [<b>-y </b><i>height</i>]
               [<i>adjustment</i>]
                     (alias: <b>resizep</b>)
               Resize a pane, up, down, left or right by <i>adjustment</i> with
               <b>-U</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-L </b>or <b>-R</b>, or to an absolute size with <b>-x </b>or <b>-y</b>.
               The <i>adjustment</i> is given in lines or columns (the default
               is 1); <b>-x </b>and <b>-y </b>may be a given as a number of lines or
               columns or followed by ‘%’ for a percentage of the window
               size (for example ‘-x 10%’).  With <b>-Z</b>, the active pane is
               toggled between zoomed (occupying the whole of the
               window) and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).

               <b>-M </b>begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse
               key binding, see “MOUSE SUPPORT”).

               <b>-T </b>trims all lines below the current cursor position and
               moves lines out of the history to replace them.

       <b>resize-window </b>[<b>-aADLRU</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>] [<b>-x </b><i>width</i>] [<b>-y </b><i>height</i>]
               [<i>adjustment</i>]
                     (alias: <b>resizew</b>)
               Resize a window, up, down, left or right by <i>adjustment</i>
               with <b>-U</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-L </b>or <b>-R</b>, or to an absolute size with <b>-x </b>or
               <b>-y</b>.  The <i>adjustment</i> is given in lines or cells (the
               default is 1).  <b>-A </b>sets the size of the largest session
               containing the window; <b>-a </b>the size of the smallest.  This
               command will automatically set <b>window-size </b>to manual in
               the window options.

       <b>respawn-pane </b>[<b>-k</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>start-directory</i>] [<b>-e </b><i>environment</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>target-pane</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>]
                     (alias: <b>respawnp</b>)
               Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see
               the <b>remain-on-exit </b>window option).  If <i>shell-command</i> is
               not given, the command used when the pane was created or
               last respawned is executed.  The pane must be already
               inactive, unless <b>-k </b>is given, in which case any existing
               command is killed.  <b>-c </b>specifies a new working directory
               for the pane.  The <b>-e </b>option has the same meaning as for
               the <b>new-window </b>command.

       <b>respawn-window </b>[<b>-k</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>start-directory</i>] [<b>-e </b><i>environment</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>target-window</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>]
                     (alias: <b>respawnw</b>)
               Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see
               the <b>remain-on-exit </b>window option).  If <i>shell-command</i> is
               not given, the command used when the window was created
               or last respawned is executed.  The window must be
               already inactive, unless <b>-k </b>is given, in which case any
               existing command is killed.  <b>-c </b>specifies a new working
               directory for the window.  The <b>-e </b>option has the same
               meaning as for the <b>new-window </b>command.

       <b>rotate-window </b>[<b>-DUZ</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>rotatew</b>)
               Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either
               upward (numerically lower) with <b>-U </b>or downward
               (numerically higher).  <b>-Z </b>keeps the window zoomed if it
               was zoomed.

       <b>select-layout </b>[<b>-Enop</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>layout-name</i>]
                     (alias: <b>selectl</b>)
               Choose a specific layout for a window.  If <i>layout-name</i> is
               not given, the last preset layout used (if any) is
               reapplied.  <b>-n </b>and <b>-p </b>are equivalent to the <b>next-layout</b>
               and <b>previous-layout </b>commands.  <b>-o </b>applies the last set
               layout if possible (undoes the most recent layout
               change).  <b>-E </b>spreads the current pane and any panes next
               to it out evenly.

       <b>select-pane </b>[<b>-DdeLlMmRUZ</b>] [<b>-T </b><i>title</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
                     (alias: <b>selectp</b>)
               Make pane <i>target-pane</i> the active pane in its window.  If
               one of <b>-D</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-R</b>, or <b>-U </b>is used, respectively the pane
               below, to the left, to the right, or above the target
               pane is used.  <b>-Z </b>keeps the window zoomed if it was
               zoomed.  <b>-l </b>is the same as using the <b>last-pane </b>command.
               <b>-e </b>enables or <b>-d </b>disables input to the pane.  <b>-T </b>sets the
               pane title.

               <b>-m </b>and <b>-M </b>are used to set and clear the <i>marked pane</i>.
               There is one marked pane at a time, setting a new marked
               pane clears the last.  The marked pane is the default
               target for <b>-s </b>to <b>join-pane</b>, <b>move-pane</b>, <b>swap-pane </b>and
               <b>swap-window</b>.

       <b>select-window </b>[<b>-lnpT</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>selectw</b>)
               Select the window at <i>target-window</i>.  <b>-l</b>, <b>-n </b>and <b>-p </b>are
               equivalent to the <b>last-window</b>, <b>next-window </b>and
               <b>previous-window </b>commands.  If <b>-T </b>is given and the
               selected window is already the current window, the
               command behaves like <b>last-window</b>.

       <b>split-window </b>[<b>-bdfhIvPZ</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>start-directory</i>] [<b>-e </b><i>environment</i>]
               [<b>-l </b><i>size</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>shell-command</i>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>]
                     (alias: <b>splitw</b>)
               Create a new pane by splitting <i>target-pane</i>: <b>-h </b>does a
               horizontal split and <b>-v </b>a vertical split; if neither is
               specified, <b>-v </b>is assumed.  The <b>-l </b>option specifies the
               size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in
               columns (for horizontal split); <i>size</i> may be followed by
               ‘%’ to specify a percentage of the available space.  The
               <b>-b </b>option causes the new pane to be created to the left
               of or above <i>target-pane</i>.  The <b>-f </b>option creates a new
               pane spanning the full window height (with <b>-h</b>) or full
               window width (with <b>-v</b>), instead of splitting the active
               pane.  <b>-Z </b>zooms if the window is not zoomed, or keeps it
               zoomed if already zoomed.

               An empty <i>shell-command</i> ('') will create a pane with no
               command running in it.  Output can be sent to such a pane
               with the <b>display-message </b>command.  The <b>-I </b>flag (if
               <i>shell-command</i> is not specified or empty) will create an
               empty pane and forward any output from stdin to it.  For
               example:

                     $ make 2&gt;&amp;1|tmux splitw -dI &amp;

               All other options have the same meaning as for the
               <b>new-window </b>command.

       <b>swap-pane </b>[<b>-dDUZ</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-pane</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-pane</i>]
                     (alias: <b>swapp</b>)
               Swap two panes.  If <b>-U </b>is used and no source pane is
               specified with <b>-s</b>, <i>dst-pane</i> is swapped with the previous
               pane (before it numerically); <b>-D </b>swaps with the next pane
               (after it numerically).  <b>-d </b>instructs <b>tmux </b>not to change
               the active pane and <b>-Z </b>keeps the window zoomed if it was
               zoomed.

               If <b>-s </b>is omitted and a marked pane is present (see
               <b>select-pane -m</b>), the marked pane is used rather than the
               current pane.

       <b>swap-window </b>[<b>-d</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>src-window</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>dst-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>swapw</b>)
               This is similar to <b>link-window</b>, except the source and
               destination windows are swapped.  It is an error if no
               window exists at <i>src-window</i>.  If <b>-d </b>is given, the new
               window does not become the current window.

               If <b>-s </b>is omitted and a marked pane is present (see
               <b>select-pane -m</b>), the window containing the marked pane is
               used rather than the current window.

       <b>unlink-window </b>[<b>-k</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-window</i>]
                     (alias: <b>unlinkw</b>)
               Unlink <i>target-window</i>.  Unless <b>-k </b>is given, a window may
               be unlinked only if it is linked to multiple sessions -
               windows may not be linked to no sessions; if <b>-k </b>is
               specified and the window is linked to only one session,
               it is unlinked and destroyed.
</pre> <h2>
KEY BINDINGS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a
       prefix key.  When specifying keys, most represent themselves (for
       example ‘A’ to ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may be prefixed with ‘C-’ or ‘^’,
       Shift keys with ‘S-’ and Alt (meta) with ‘M-’.  In addition, the
       following special key names are accepted: <i>Up</i>, <i>Down</i>, <i>Left</i>, <i>Right</i>,
       <i>BSpace</i>, <i>BTab</i>, <i>DC</i> (Delete), <i>End</i>, <i>Enter</i>, <i>Escape</i>, <i>F1</i> to <i>F12</i>, <i>Home</i>,
       <i>IC</i> (Insert), <i>NPage/PageDown/PgDn</i>, <i>PPage/PageUp/PgUp</i>, <i>Space</i>, and
       <i>Tab</i>.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’ keys, quotation marks are
       necessary, for example:

             bind-key '"' split-window
             bind-key "'" new-window

       A command bound to the <i>Any</i> key will execute for all keys which do
       not have a more specific binding.

       Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

       <b>bind-key </b>[<b>-nr</b>] [<b>-N </b><i>note</i>] [<b>-T </b><i>key-table</i>] <i>key command</i> [<i>argument</i>
               <i>...</i>]
                     (alias: <b>bind</b>)
               Bind key <i>key</i> to <i>command</i>.  Keys are bound in a key table.
               By default (without -T), the key is bound in the <i>prefix</i>
               key table.  This table is used for keys pressed after the
               prefix key (for example, by default ‘c’ is bound to
               <b>new-window </b>in the <i>prefix</i> table, so ‘C-b c’ creates a new
               window).  The <i>root</i> table is used for keys pressed without
               the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to <b>new-window </b>in the <i>root</i>
               table (not recommended) means a plain ‘c’ will create a
               new window.  <b>-n </b>is an alias for <b>-T </b><i>root</i>.  Keys may also
               be bound in custom key tables and the <b>switch-client -T</b>
               command used to switch to them from a key binding.  The
               <b>-r </b>flag indicates this key may repeat, see the
               <b>repeat-time </b>option.  <b>-N </b>attaches a note to the key (shown
               with <b>list-keys -N</b>).

               To view the default bindings and possible commands, see
               the <b>list-keys </b>command.

       <b>list-keys </b>[<b>-1aN</b>] [<b>-P </b><i>prefix-string</i> <b>-T </b><i>key-table</i>] [<i>key</i>]
                     (alias: <b>lsk</b>)
               List key bindings.  There are two forms: the default
               lists keys as <b>bind-key </b>commands; <b>-N </b>lists only keys with
               attached notes and shows only the key and note for each
               key.

               With the default form, all key tables are listed by
               default.  <b>-T </b>lists only keys in <i>key-table</i>.

               With the <b>-N </b>form, only keys in the <i>root</i> and <i>prefix</i> key
               tables are listed by default; <b>-T </b>also lists only keys in
               <i>key-table</i>.  <b>-P </b>specifies a prefix to print before each
               key and <b>-1 </b>lists only the first matching key.  <b>-a </b>lists
               the command for keys that do not have a note rather than
               skipping them.

       <b>send-keys </b>[<b>-FHKlMRX</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>target-client</i>] [<b>-N </b><i>repeat-count</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>target-pane</i>] <i>key ...</i>
                     (alias: <b>send</b>)
               Send a key or keys to a window or client.  Each argument
               <i>key</i> is the name of the key (such as ‘C-a’ or ‘NPage’) to
               send; if the string is not recognised as a key, it is
               sent as a series of characters.  If <b>-K </b>is given, keys are
               sent to <i>target-client</i>, so they are looked up in the
               client's key table, rather than to <i>target-pane</i>.  All
               arguments are sent sequentially from first to last.  If
               no keys are given and the command is bound to a key, then
               that key is used.

               The <b>-l </b>flag disables key name lookup and processes the
               keys as literal UTF-8 characters.  The <b>-H </b>flag expects
               each key to be a hexadecimal number for an ASCII
               character.

               The <b>-R </b>flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

               <b>-M </b>passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a
               mouse key binding, see “MOUSE SUPPORT”).

               <b>-X </b>is used to send a command into copy mode - see the
               “WINDOWS AND PANES” section.  <b>-N </b>specifies a repeat count
               and <b>-F </b>expands formats in arguments where appropriate.

       <b>send-prefix </b>[<b>-2</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
               Send the prefix key, or with <b>-2 </b>the secondary prefix key,
               to a window as if it was pressed.

       <b>unbind-key </b>[<b>-anq</b>] [<b>-T </b><i>key-table</i>] <i>key</i>
                     (alias: <b>unbind</b>)
               Unbind the command bound to <i>key</i>.  <b>-n </b>and <b>-T </b>are the same
               as for <b>bind-key</b>.  If <b>-a </b>is present, all key bindings are
               removed.  The <b>-q </b>option prevents errors being returned.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The appearance and behaviour of <b>tmux </b>may be modified by changing
       the value of various options.  There are four types of option:
       <i>server options</i>, <i>session options</i>, <i>window options</i>, and <i>pane</i>
       <i>options</i>.

       The <b>tmux </b>server has a set of global server options which do not
       apply to any particular window or session or pane.  These are
       altered with the <b>set-option -s </b>command, or displayed with the
       <b>show-options -s </b>command.

       In addition, each individual session may have a set of session
       options, and there is a separate set of global session options.
       Sessions which do not have a particular option configured inherit
       the value from the global session options.  Session options are
       set or unset with the <b>set-option </b>command and may be listed with
       the <b>show-options </b>command.  The available server and session
       options are listed under the <b>set-option </b>command.

       Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window and
       a set of pane options to each pane.  Pane options inherit from
       window options.  This means any pane option may be set as a
       window option to apply the option to all panes in the window
       without the option set, for example these commands will set the
       background colour to red for all panes except pane 0:

             set -w window-style bg=red
             set -pt:.0 window-style bg=blue

       There is also a set of global window options from which any unset
       window or pane options are inherited.  Window and pane options
       are altered with <b>set-option -w </b>and <b>-p </b>commands and displayed with
       <b>show-option -w </b>and <b>-p</b>.

       <b>tmux </b>also supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.
       User options may have any name, so long as they are prefixed with
       ‘@’, and be set to any string.  For example:

             $ tmux set -wq @foo "abc123"
             $ tmux show -wv @foo
             abc123

       Commands which set options are as follows:

       <b>set-option </b>[<b>-aFgopqsuUw</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] <i>option value</i>
                     (alias: <b>set</b>)
               Set a pane option with <b>-p</b>, a window option with <b>-w</b>, a
               server option with <b>-s</b>, otherwise a session option.  If
               the option is not a user option, <b>-w </b>or <b>-s </b>may be
               unnecessary - <b>tmux </b>will infer the type from the option
               name, assuming <b>-w </b>for pane options.  If <b>-g </b>is given, the
               global session or window option is set.

               <b>-F </b>expands formats in the option value.  The <b>-u </b>flag
               unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from
               the global options (or with <b>-g</b>, restores a global option
               to the default).  <b>-U </b>unsets an option (like <b>-u</b>) but if
               the option is a pane option also unsets the option on any
               panes in the window.  <i>value</i> depends on the option and may
               be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or omitted to
               toggle).

               The <b>-o </b>flag prevents setting an option that is already
               set and the <b>-q </b>flag suppresses errors about unknown or
               ambiguous options.

               With <b>-a</b>, and if the option expects a string or a style,
               <i>value</i> is appended to the existing setting.  For example:

                     set -g status-left "foo"
                     set -ag status-left "bar"

               Will result in ‘foobar’.  And:

                     set -g status-style "bg=red"
                     set -ag status-style "fg=blue"

               Will result in a red background <i>and</i> blue foreground.
               Without <b>-a</b>, the result would be the default background
               and a blue foreground.

       <b>show-options </b>[<b>-AgHpqsvw</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>option</i>]
                     (alias: <b>show</b>)
               Show the pane options (or a single option if <i>option</i> is
               provided) with <b>-p</b>, the window options with <b>-w</b>, the server
               options with <b>-s</b>, otherwise the session options.  If the
               option is not a user option, <b>-w </b>or <b>-s </b>may be unnecessary
               - <b>tmux </b>will infer the type from the option name, assuming
               <b>-w </b>for pane options.  Global session or window options
               are listed if <b>-g </b>is used.  <b>-v </b>shows only the option
               value, not the name.  If <b>-q </b>is set, no error will be
               returned if <i>option</i> is unset.  <b>-H </b>includes hooks (omitted
               by default).  <b>-A </b>includes options inherited from a parent
               set of options, such options are marked with an asterisk.

       Available server options are:

       <b>backspace </b><i>key</i>
               Set the key sent by <b>tmux </b>for backspace.

       <b>buffer-limit </b><i>number</i>
               Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to
               the top of the stack, old ones are removed from the
               bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum length.

       <b>command-alias[] </b><i>name=value</i>
               This is an array of custom aliases for commands.  If an
               unknown command matches <i>name</i>, it is replaced with <i>value</i>.
               For example, after:

                     <b>set -s command-alias[100] zoom='resize-pane -Z'</b>

               Using:

                     <b>zoom -t:.1</b>

               Is equivalent to:

                     <b>resize-pane -Z -t:.1</b>

               Note that aliases are expanded when a command is parsed
               rather than when it is executed, so binding an alias with
               <b>bind-key </b>will bind the expanded form.

       <b>default-terminal </b><i>terminal</i>
               Set the default terminal for new windows created in this
               session - the default value of the TERM environment
               variable.  For <b>tmux </b>to work correctly, this <i>must</i> be set
               to ‘screen’, ‘tmux’ or a derivative of them.

       <b>copy-command </b><i>shell-command</i>
               Give the command to pipe to if the <b>copy-pipe </b>copy mode
               command is used without arguments.

       <b>escape-time </b><i>time</i>
               Set the time in milliseconds for which <b>tmux </b>waits after
               an escape is input to determine if it is part of a
               function or meta key sequences.

       <b>editor </b><i>shell-command</i>
               Set the command used when <b>tmux </b>runs an editor.

       <b>exit-empty </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               If enabled (the default), the server will exit when there
               are no active sessions.

       <b>exit-unattached </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               If enabled, the server will exit when there are no
               attached clients.

       <b>extended-keys </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off </b>| <b>always</b>]
               When <b>on </b>or <b>always</b>, the escape sequence to enable extended
               keys is sent to the terminal, if <b>tmux </b>knows that it is
               supported.  <b>tmux </b>always recognises extended keys itself.
               If this option is <b>on</b>, <b>tmux </b>will only forward extended
               keys to applications when they request them; if <b>always</b>,
               <b>tmux </b>will always forward the keys.

       <b>focus-events </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               When enabled, focus events are requested from the
               terminal if supported and passed through to applications
               running in <b>tmux</b>.  Attached clients should be detached and
               attached again after changing this option.

       <b>history-file </b><i>path</i>
               If not empty, a file to which <b>tmux </b>will write command
               prompt history on exit and load it from on start.

       <b>message-limit </b><i>number</i>
               Set the number of error or information messages to save
               in the message log for each client.

       <b>prompt-history-limit </b><i>number</i>
               Set the number of history items to save in the history
               file for each type of command prompt.

       <b>set-clipboard </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>external </b>| <b>off</b>]
               Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the
               <i>xterm</i>(1) escape sequence, if there is an <i>Ms</i> entry in the
               <i>terminfo</i>(5) description (see the “TERMINFO EXTENSIONS”
               section).

               If set to <b>on</b>, <b>tmux </b>will both accept the escape sequence
               to create a buffer and attempt to set the terminal
               clipboard.  If set to <b>external</b>, <b>tmux </b>will attempt to set
               the terminal clipboard but ignore attempts by
               applications to set <b>tmux </b>buffers.  If <b>off</b>, <b>tmux </b>will
               neither accept the clipboard escape sequence nor attempt
               to set the clipboard.

               Note that this feature needs to be enabled in <i>xterm</i>(1) by
               setting the resource:

                     disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop

               Or changing this property from the <i>xterm</i>(1) interactive
               menu when required.

       <b>terminal-features[] </b><i>string</i>
               Set terminal features for terminal types read from
               <i>terminfo</i>(5).  <b>tmux </b>has a set of named terminal features.
               Each will apply appropriate changes to the <i>terminfo</i>(5)
               entry in use.

               <b>tmux </b>can detect features for a few common terminals; this
               option can be used to easily tell tmux about features
               supported by terminals it cannot detect.  The
               <b>terminal-overrides </b>option allows individual <i>terminfo</i>(5)
               capabilities to be set instead, <b>terminal-features </b>is
               intended for classes of functionality supported in a
               standard way but not reported by <i>terminfo</i>(5).  Care must
               be taken to configure this only with features the
               terminal actually supports.

               This is an array option where each entry is a colon-
               separated string made up of a terminal type pattern
               (matched using <i>fnmatch</i>(3)) followed by a list of terminal
               features.  The available features are:

               256     Supports 256 colours with the SGR escape
                       sequences.

               clipboard
                       Allows setting the system clipboard.

               ccolour
                       Allows setting the cursor colour.

               cstyle  Allows setting the cursor style.

               extkeys
                       Supports extended keys.

               focus   Supports focus reporting.

               hyperlinks
                       Supports OSC 8 hyperlinks.

               ignorefkeys
                       Ignore function keys from <i>terminfo</i>(5) and use the
                       <b>tmux </b>internal set only.

               margins
                       Supports DECSLRM margins.

               mouse   Supports <i>xterm</i>(1) mouse sequences.

               osc7    Supports the OSC 7 working directory extension.

               overline
                       Supports the overline SGR attribute.

               rectfill
                       Supports the DECFRA rectangle fill escape
                       sequence.

               RGB     Supports RGB colour with the SGR escape
                       sequences.

               sixel   Supports SIXEL graphics.

               strikethrough
                       Supports the strikethrough SGR escape sequence.

               sync    Supports synchronized updates.

               title   Supports <i>xterm</i>(1) title setting.

               usstyle
                       Allows underscore style and colour to be set.

       <b>terminal-overrides[] </b><i>string</i>
               Allow terminal descriptions read using <i>terminfo</i>(5) to be
               overridden.  Each entry is a colon-separated string made
               up of a terminal type pattern (matched using <i>fnmatch</i>(3))
               and a set of <i>name=value</i> entries.

               For example, to set the ‘clear’ <i>terminfo</i>(5) entry to
               ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for all terminal types matching ‘rxvt*’:

                     <b>rxvt*:clear=\e[H\e[2J</b>

               The terminal entry value is passed through <i>strunvis</i>(3)
               before interpretation.

       <b>user-keys[] </b><i>key</i>
               Set list of user-defined key escape sequences.  Each item
               is associated with a key named ‘User0’, ‘User1’, and so
               on.

               For example:

                     set -s user-keys[0] "\e[5;30012~"
                     bind User0 resize-pane -L 3

       Available session options are:

       <b>activity-action </b>[<b>any </b>| <b>none </b>| <b>current </b>| <b>other</b>]
               Set action on window activity when <b>monitor-activity </b>is
               on.  <b>any </b>means activity in any window linked to a session
               causes a bell or message (depending on <b>visual-activity</b>)
               in the current window of that session, <b>none </b>means all
               activity is ignored (equivalent to <b>monitor-activity </b>being
               off), <b>current </b>means only activity in windows other than
               the current window are ignored and <b>other </b>means activity
               in the current window is ignored but not those in other
               windows.

       <b>assume-paste-time </b><i>milliseconds</i>
               If keys are entered faster than one in <i>milliseconds</i>, they
               are assumed to have been pasted rather than typed and
               <b>tmux </b>key bindings are not processed.  The default is one
               millisecond and zero disables.

       <b>base-index </b><i>index</i>
               Set the base index from which an unused index should be
               searched when a new window is created.  The default is
               zero.

       <b>bell-action </b>[<b>any </b>| <b>none </b>| <b>current </b>| <b>other</b>]
               Set action on a bell in a window when <b>monitor-bell </b>is on.
               The values are the same as those for <b>activity-action</b>.

       <b>default-command </b><i>shell-command</i>
               Set the command used for new windows (if not specified
               when the window is created) to <i>shell-command</i>, which may
               be any <i>sh</i>(1) command.  The default is an empty string,
               which instructs <b>tmux </b>to create a login shell using the
               value of the <b>default-shell </b>option.

       <b>default-shell </b><i>path</i>
               Specify the default shell.  This is used as the login
               shell for new windows when the <b>default-command </b>option is
               set to empty, and must be the full path of the
               executable.  When started <b>tmux </b>tries to set a default
               value from the first suitable of the SHELL environment
               variable, the shell returned by <i>getpwuid</i>(3), or <i>/bin/sh</i>.
               This option should be configured when <b>tmux </b>is used as a
               login shell.

       <b>default-size </b><i>XxY</i>
               Set the default size of new windows when the <b>window-size</b>
               option is set to manual or when a session is created with
               <b>new-session -d</b>.  The value is the width and height
               separated by an ‘x’ character.  The default is 80x24.

       <b>destroy-unattached </b>[<b>off </b>| <b>on </b>| <b>keep-last </b>| <b>keep-group</b>]
               If <b>on</b>, destroy the session after the last client has
               detached.  If <b>off </b>(the default), leave the session
               orphaned.  If <b>keep-last</b>, destroy the session only if it
               is in a group and has other sessions in that group.  If
               <b>keep-group</b>, destroy the session unless it is in a group
               and is the only session in that group.

       <b>detach-on-destroy </b>[<b>off </b>| <b>on </b>| <b>no-detached </b>| <b>previous </b>| <b>next</b>]
               If <b>on </b>(the default), the client is detached when the
               session it is attached to is destroyed.  If <b>off</b>, the
               client is switched to the most recently active of the
               remaining sessions.  If <b>no-detached</b>, the client is
               detached only if there are no detached sessions; if
               detached sessions exist, the client is switched to the
               most recently active.  If <b>previous </b>or <b>next</b>, the client is
               switched to the previous or next session in alphabetical
               order.

       <b>display-panes-active-colour </b><i>colour</i>
               Set the colour used by the <b>display-panes </b>command to show
               the indicator for the active pane.

       <b>display-panes-colour </b><i>colour</i>
               Set the colour used by the <b>display-panes </b>command to show
               the indicators for inactive panes.

       <b>display-panes-time </b><i>time</i>
               Set the time in milliseconds for which the indicators
               shown by the <b>display-panes </b>command appear.

       <b>display-time </b><i>time</i>
               Set the amount of time for which status line messages and
               other on-screen indicators are displayed.  If set to 0,
               messages and indicators are displayed until a key is
               pressed.  <i>time</i> is in milliseconds.

       <b>history-limit </b><i>lines</i>
               Set the maximum number of lines held in window history.
               This setting applies only to new windows - existing
               window histories are not resized and retain the limit at
               the point they were created.

       <b>key-table </b><i>key-table</i>
               Set the default key table to <i>key-table</i> instead of <i>root</i>.

       <b>lock-after-time </b><i>number</i>
               Lock the session (like the <b>lock-session </b>command) after
               <i>number</i> seconds of inactivity.  The default is not to lock
               (set to 0).

       <b>lock-command </b><i>shell-command</i>
               Command to run when locking each client.  The default is
               to run <i>lock</i>(1) with <b>-np</b>.

       <b>menu-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the menu style.  See the “STYLES” section on how to
               specify <i>style</i>.  Attributes are ignored.

       <b>menu-selected-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the selected menu item style.  See the “STYLES”

               Set the menu border style.  See the “STYLES” section on
               how to specify <i>style</i>.  Attributes are ignored.

       <b>menu-border-lines </b><i>type</i>
               Set the type of characters used for drawing menu borders.
               See <b>popup-border-lines </b>for possible values for
               <i>border-lines</i>.

       <b>message-command-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set status line message command style.  This is used for
               the command prompt with <i>vi</i>(1) keys when in command mode.
               For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>message-line </b>[<b>0 </b>| <b>1 </b>| <b>2 </b>| <b>3 </b>| <b>4</b>]
               Set line on which status line messages and the command
               prompt are shown.

       <b>message-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set status line message style.  This is used for messages
               and for the command prompt.  For how to specify <i>style</i>,
               see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>mouse </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               If on, <b>tmux </b>captures the mouse and allows mouse events to
               be bound as key bindings.  See the “MOUSE SUPPORT”
               section for details.

       <b>prefix </b><i>key</i>
               Set the key accepted as a prefix key.  In addition to the
               standard keys described under “KEY BINDINGS”, <b>prefix </b>can
               be set to the special key ‘None’ to set no prefix.

       <b>prefix2 </b><i>key</i>
               Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key.  Like
               <b>prefix</b>, <b>prefix2 </b>can be set to ‘None’.

       <b>renumber-windows </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               If on, when a window is closed in a session,
               automatically renumber the other windows in numerical
               order.  This respects the <b>base-index </b>option if it has
               been set.  If off, do not renumber the windows.

       <b>repeat-time </b><i>time</i>
               Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing
               the prefix-key again in the specified <i>time</i> milliseconds
               (the default is 500).  Whether a key repeats may be set
               when it is bound using the <b>-r </b>flag to <b>bind-key</b>.  Repeat
               is enabled for the default keys bound to the <b>resize-pane</b>
               command.

       <b>set-titles </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               Attempt to set the client terminal title using the <i>tsl</i>
               and <i>fsl terminfo</i>(5) entries if they exist.  <b>tmux</b>
               automatically sets these to the \e]0;...\007 sequence if
               the terminal appears to be <i>xterm</i>(1).  This option is off
               by default.

       <b>set-titles-string </b><i>string</i>
               String used to set the client terminal title if
               <b>set-titles </b>is on.  Formats are expanded, see the
               “FORMATS” section.

       <b>silence-action </b>[<b>any </b>| <b>none </b>| <b>current </b>| <b>other</b>]
               Set action on window silence when <b>monitor-silence </b>is on.
               The values are the same as those for <b>activity-action</b>.

       <b>status </b>[<b>off </b>| <b>on </b>| <b>2 </b>| <b>3 </b>| <b>4 </b>| <b>5</b>]
               Show or hide the status line or specify its size.  Using
               <b>on </b>gives a status line one row in height; <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4 </b>or <b>5</b>
               more rows.

       <b>status-format[] </b><i>format</i>
               Specify the format to be used for each line of the status
               line.  The default builds the top status line from the
               various individual status options below.

       <b>status-interval </b><i>interval</i>
               Update the status line every <i>interval</i> seconds.  By
               default, updates will occur every 15 seconds.  A setting
               of zero disables redrawing at interval.

       <b>status-justify </b>[<b>left </b>| <b>centre </b>| <b>right </b>| <b>absolute-centre</b>]
               Set the position of the window list in the status line:
               left, centre or right.  centre puts the window list in
               the relative centre of the available free space;
               absolute-centre uses the centre of the entire horizontal
               space.

       <b>status-keys </b>[<b>vi </b>| <b>emacs</b>]
               Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line,
               for example at the command prompt.  The default is emacs,
               unless the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables are set
               and contain the string ‘vi’.

       <b>status-left </b><i>string</i>
               Display <i>string</i> (by default the session name) to the left
               of the status line.  <i>string</i> will be passed through
               <i>strftime</i>(3).  Also see the “FORMATS” and “STYLES”
               sections.

               For details on how the names and titles can be set see
               the “NAMES AND TITLES” section.

               Examples are:

                     #(sysctl vm.loadavg)
                     #[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]

               The default is ‘[#S] ’.

       <b>status-left-length </b><i>length</i>
               Set the maximum <i>length</i> of the left component of the
               status line.  The default is 10.

       <b>status-left-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the style of the left part of the status line.  For
               how to specify <i>style</i>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>status-position </b>[<b>top </b>| <b>bottom</b>]
               Set the position of the status line.

       <b>status-right </b><i>string</i>
               Display <i>string</i> to the right of the status line.  By
               default, the current pane title in double quotes, the
               date and the time are shown.  As with <b>status-left</b>, <i>string</i>
               will be passed to <i>strftime</i>(3) and character pairs are
               replaced.

       <b>status-right-length </b><i>length</i>
               Set the maximum <i>length</i> of the right component of the
               status line.  The default is 40.

       <b>status-right-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the style of the right part of the status line.  For
               how to specify <i>style</i>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>status-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set status line style.  For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the
               “STYLES” section.

       <b>update-environment[] </b><i>variable</i>
               Set list of environment variables to be copied into the
               session environment when a new session is created or an
               existing session is attached.  Any variables that do not
               exist in the source environment are set to be removed
               from the session environment (as if <b>-r </b>was given to the
               <b>set-environment </b>command).

       <b>visual-activity </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off </b>| <b>both</b>]
               If on, display a message instead of sending a bell when
               activity occurs in a window for which the
               <b>monitor-activity </b>window option is enabled.  If set to
               both, a bell and a message are produced.

       <b>visual-bell </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off </b>| <b>both</b>]
               If on, a message is shown on a bell in a window for which
               the <b>monitor-bell </b>window option is enabled instead of it
               being passed through to the terminal (which normally
               makes a sound).  If set to both, a bell and a message are
               produced.  Also see the <b>bell-action </b>option.

       <b>visual-silence </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off </b>| <b>both</b>]
               If <b>monitor-silence </b>is enabled, prints a message after the
               interval has expired on a given window instead of sending
               a bell.  If set to both, a bell and a message are
               produced.

       <b>word-separators </b><i>string</i>
               Sets the session's conception of what characters are
               considered word separators, for the purposes of the next
               and previous word commands in copy mode.

       Available window options are:

       <b>aggressive-resize </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that
               <b>tmux </b>will resize the window to the size of the smallest
               or largest session (see the <b>window-size </b>option) for which
               it is the current window, rather than the session to
               which it is attached.  The window may resize when the
               current window is changed on another session; this option
               is good for full-screen programs which support SIGWINCH
               and poor for interactive programs such as shells.

       <b>automatic-rename </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               Control automatic window renaming.  When this setting is
               enabled, <b>tmux </b>will rename the window automatically using
               the format specified by <b>automatic-rename-format</b>.  This
               flag is automatically disabled for an individual window
               when a name is specified at creation with <b>new-window </b>or
               <b>new-session</b>, or later with <b>rename-window</b>, or with a
               terminal escape sequence.  It may be switched off
               globally with:

                     set-option -wg automatic-rename off

       <b>automatic-rename-format </b><i>format</i>
               The format (see “FORMATS”) used when the <b>automatic-rename</b>

               Set the width or height of the main (left or top) pane in
               the <b>main-horizontal </b>or <b>main-vertical </b>layouts.  If
               suffixed by ‘%’, this is a percentage of the window size.

       <b>copy-mode-match-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the style of search matches in copy mode.  For how to
               specify <i>style</i>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>copy-mode-mark-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the style of the line containing the mark in copy
               mode.  For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the “STYLES”

               Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within
               <b>interval </b>seconds.  Windows that have been silent for the
               interval are highlighted in the status line.  An interval
               of zero disables the monitoring.

       <b>other-pane-height </b><i>height</i>
               Set the height of the other panes (not the main pane) in
               the <b>main-horizontal </b>layout.  If this option is set to 0
               (the default), it will have no effect.  If both the
               <b>main-pane-height </b>and <b>other-pane-height </b>options are set,
               the main pane will grow taller to make the other panes
               the specified height, but will never shrink to do so.  If
               suffixed by ‘%’, this is a percentage of the window size.

       <b>other-pane-width </b><i>width</i>

               Set the text shown in pane border status lines.

       <b>pane-border-indicators </b>[<b>off </b>| <b>colour </b>| <b>arrows </b>| <b>both</b>]
               Indicate active pane by colouring only half of the border
               in windows with exactly two panes, by displaying arrow
               markers, by drawing both or neither.

       <b>pane-border-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the pane border style for panes aside from the active
               pane.  For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the “STYLES”
               section.  Attributes are ignored.

       <b>popup-style </b><i>style</i>

               how to specify <i>style</i>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>window-status-separator </b><i>string</i>
               Sets the separator drawn between windows in the status

       <b>window-status-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set status line style for a single window.  For how to
               specify <i>style</i>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>window-size </b><i>largest</i> | <i>smallest</i> | <i>manual</i> | <i>latest</i>
               Configure how <b>tmux </b>determines the window size.  If set to
               <i>largest</i>, the size of the largest attached session is
               used; if <i>smallest</i>, the size of the smallest.  If <i>manual</i>,
               the size of a new window is set from the <b>default-size</b>
               option and windows are resized automatically.  With
               <i>latest</i>, <b>tmux </b>uses the size of the client that had the
               most recent activity.  See also the <b>resize-window </b>command
               and the <b>aggressive-resize </b>option.

       <b>wrap-search </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               If this option is set, searches will wrap around the end
               of the pane contents.  The default is on.

       Available pane options are:

       <b>allow-passthrough </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off </b>| <b>all</b>]
               Allow programs in the pane to bypass <b>tmux </b>using a
               terminal escape sequence (\ePtmux;...\e\\).  If set to
               <b>on</b>, passthrough sequences will be allowed only if the
               pane is visible.  If set to <b>all</b>, they will be allowed
               even if the pane is invisible.

       <b>allow-rename </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               Allow programs in the pane to change the window name
               using a terminal escape sequence (\ek...\e\\).

       <b>allow-set-title </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               Allow programs in the pane to change the title using the
               terminal escape sequences (\e]2;...\e\\ or \e]0;...\e\\).

       <b>alternate-screen </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               This option configures whether programs running inside
               the pane may use the terminal alternate screen feature,
               which allows the <i>smcup</i> and <i>rmcup terminfo</i>(5)
               capabilities.  The alternate screen feature preserves the
               contents of the window when an interactive application
               starts and restores it on exit, so that any output
               visible before the application starts reappears unchanged
               after it exits.

       <b>cursor-colour </b><i>colour</i>
               Set the colour of the cursor.

       <b>pane-colours[] </b><i>colour</i>
               The default colour palette.  Each entry in the array
               defines the colour <b>tmux </b>uses when the colour with that
               index is requested.  The index may be from zero to 255.

       <b>cursor-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the style of the cursor.  Available styles are:
               <b>default</b>, <b>blinking-block</b>, <b>block</b>, <b>blinking-underline</b>,
               <b>underline</b>, <b>blinking-bar</b>, <b>bar</b>.

       <b>remain-on-exit </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off </b>| <b>failed</b>]
               A pane with this flag set is not destroyed when the
               program running in it exits.  If set to <b>failed</b>, then only
               when the program exit status is not zero.  The pane may
               be reactivated with the <b>respawn-pane </b>command.

       <b>remain-on-exit-format </b><i>string</i>
               Set the text shown at the bottom of exited panes when
               <b>remain-on-exit </b>is enabled.

       <b>scroll-on-clear </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               When the entire screen is cleared and this option is on,
               scroll the contents of the screen into history before
               clearing it.

       <b>synchronize-panes </b>[<b>on </b>| <b>off</b>]
               Duplicate input to all other panes in the same window
               where this option is also on (only for panes that are not
               in any mode).

       <b>window-active-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the pane style when it is the active pane.  For how
               to specify <i>style</i>, see the “STYLES” section.

       <b>window-style </b><i>style</i>
               Set the pane style.  For how to specify <i>style</i>, see the
               “STYLES” section.
</pre> <h2>
HOOKS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>allows commands to run on various triggers, called <i>hooks</i>.
       Most <b>tmux </b>commands have an <i>after</i> hook and there are a number of
       hooks not associated with commands.

       Hooks are stored as array options, members of the array are
       executed in order when the hook is triggered.  Like options
       different hooks may be global or belong to a session, window or
       pane.  Hooks may be configured with the <b>set-hook </b>or <b>set-option</b>
       commands and displayed with <b>show-hooks </b>or <b>show-options -H</b>.  The
       following two commands are equivalent:

              set-hook -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'
              set-option -g pane-mode-changed[42] 'set -g status-left-style bg=red'

       Setting a hook without specifying an array index clears the hook
       and sets the first member of the array.

       A command's after hook is run after it completes, except when the
       command is run as part of a hook itself.  They are named with an
       ‘after-’ prefix.  For example, the following command adds a hook
       to select the even-vertical layout after every <b>split-window</b>:

             set-hook -g after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"

       If a command fails, the ‘command-error’ hook will be fired.  For
       example, this could be used to write to a log file:

             set-hook -g command-error "run-shell \"echo 'a tmux command failed' &gt;&gt;/tmp/log\""

       All the notifications listed in the “CONTROL MODE” section are
       hooks (without any arguments), except <b>%exit</b>.  The following
       additional hooks are available:

       alert-activity          Run when a window has activity.  See
                               <b>monitor-activity</b>.

       alert-bell              Run when a window has received a bell.
                               See <b>monitor-bell</b>.

       alert-silence           Run when a window has been silent.  See
                               <b>monitor-silence</b>.

       client-active           Run when a client becomes the latest
                               active client of its session.

       client-attached         Run when a client is attached.

       client-detached         Run when a client is detached

       client-focus-in         Run when focus enters a client

       client-focus-out        Run when focus exits a client

       client-resized          Run when a client is resized.

       client-session-changed  Run when a client's attached session is
                               changed.

       command-error           Run when a command fails.

       pane-died               Run when the program running in a pane
                               exits, but <b>remain-on-exit </b>is on so the
                               pane has not closed.

       pane-exited             Run when the program running in a pane
                               exits.

       pane-focus-in           Run when the focus enters a pane, if the
                               <b>focus-events </b>option is on.

       pane-focus-out          Run when the focus exits a pane, if the
                               <b>focus-events </b>option is on.

       pane-set-clipboard      Run when the terminal clipboard is set
                               using the <i>xterm</i>(1) escape sequence.

       session-created         Run when a new session created.

       session-closed          Run when a session closed.

       session-renamed         Run when a session is renamed.

       window-linked           Run when a window is linked into a
                               session.

       window-renamed          Run when a window is renamed.

       window-resized          Run when a window is resized.  This may
                               be after the <i>client-resized</i> hook is run.

       window-unlinked         Run when a window is unlinked from a
                               session.

       Hooks are managed with these commands:

       <b>set-hook </b>[<b>-agpRuw</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] <i>hook-name command</i>
               Without <b>-R</b>, sets (or with <b>-u </b>unsets) hook <i>hook-name</i> to
               <i>command</i>.  The flags are the same as for <b>set-option</b>.

               With <b>-R</b>, run <i>hook-name</i> immediately.

       <b>show-hooks </b>[<b>-gpw</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
               Shows hooks.  The flags are the same as for <b>show-options</b>.
</pre> <h2>
MOUSE SUPPORT </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>mouse </b>option is on (the default is off), <b>tmux </b>allows mouse
       events to be bound as keys.  The name of each key is made up of a
       mouse event (such as ‘MouseUp1’) and a location suffix, one of
       the following:

             <b>Pane             </b>the contents of a pane
             <b>Border           </b>a pane border

             <b>StatusLeft       </b>the left part of the status line
             <b>StatusRight      </b>the right part of the status line
             <b>StatusDefault    </b>any other part of the status line

       The following mouse events are available:

             <b>WheelUp       </b>WheelDown
             <b>MouseDown1    </b>MouseUp1      MouseDrag1   MouseDragEnd1
             <b>MouseDown2    </b>MouseUp2      MouseDrag2   MouseDragEnd2
             <b>MouseDown3    </b>MouseUp3      MouseDrag3   MouseDragEnd3
             <b>SecondClick1  </b>SecondClick2  SecondClick3
             <b>DoubleClick1  </b>DoubleClick2  DoubleClick3
             <b>TripleClick1  </b>TripleClick2  TripleClick3

       The ‘SecondClick’ events are fired for the second click of a
       double click, even if there may be a third click which will fire
       ‘TripleClick’ instead of ‘DoubleClick’.

       Each should be suffixed with a location, for example
       ‘MouseDown1Status’.

       The special token ‘{mouse}’ or ‘=’ may be used as <i>target-window</i>
       or <i>target-pane</i> in commands bound to mouse key bindings.  It
       resolves to the window or pane over which the mouse event took
       place (for example, the window in the status line over which
       button 1 was released for a ‘MouseUp1Status’ binding, or the pane
       over which the wheel was scrolled for a ‘WheelDownPane’ binding).

       The <b>send-keys -M </b>flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a
       pane.

       The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and
       resize panes, to copy text and to change window using the status
       line.  These take effect if the <b>mouse </b>option is turned on.
</pre> <h2>
FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       Certain commands accept the <b>-F </b>flag with a <i>format</i> argument.  This
       is a string which controls the output format of the command.
       Format variables are enclosed in ‘#{’ and ‘}’, for example
       ‘#{session_name}’.  The possible variables are listed in the
       table below, or the name of a <b>tmux </b>option may be used for an
       option's value.  Some variables have a shorter alias such as
       ‘#S’; ‘##’ is replaced by a single ‘#’, ‘#,’ by a ‘,’ and ‘#}’ by
       a ‘}’.

       Conditionals are available by prefixing with ‘?’ and separating
       two alternatives with a comma; if the specified variable exists
       and is not zero, the first alternative is chosen, otherwise the
       second is used.  For example ‘#{?session_attached,attached,not
       attached}’ will include the string ‘attached’ if the session is
       attached and the string ‘not attached’ if it is unattached, or
       ‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’ will include ‘yes’ if
       <b>automatic-rename </b>is enabled, or ‘no’ if not.  Conditionals can be
       nested arbitrarily.  Inside a conditional, ‘,’ and ‘}’ must be
       escaped as ‘#,’ and ‘#}’, unless they are part of a ‘#{...}’
       replacement.  For example:

             #{?pane_in_mode,#[fg=white#,bg=red],#[fg=red#,bg=white]}#W .

       String comparisons may be expressed by prefixing two comma-
       separated alternatives by ‘==’, ‘!=’, ‘&lt;’, ‘&gt;’, ‘&lt;=’ or ‘&gt;=’ and
       a colon.  For example ‘#{==:#{host},myhost}’ will be replaced by
       ‘1’ if running on ‘myhost’, otherwise by ‘0’.  ‘||’ and ‘&amp;&amp;’
       evaluate to true if either or both of two comma-separated
       alternatives are true, for example
       ‘#{||:#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}}’.

       An ‘m’ specifies an <i>fnmatch</i>(3) or regular expression comparison.
       The first argument is the pattern and the second the string to
       compare.  An optional argument specifies flags: ‘r’ means the
       pattern is a regular expression instead of the default <i>fnmatch</i>(3)
       pattern, and ‘i’ means to ignore case.  For example:
       ‘#{m:*foo*,#{host}}’ or ‘#{m/ri:^A,MYVAR}’.  A ‘C’ performs a
       search for an <i>fnmatch</i>(3) pattern or regular expression in the
       pane content and evaluates to zero if not found, or a line number
       if found.  Like ‘m’, an ‘r’ flag means search for a regular
       expression and ‘i’ ignores case.  For example: ‘#{C/r:^Start}’

       Numeric operators may be performed by prefixing two comma-
       separated alternatives with an ‘e’ and an operator.  An optional
       ‘f’ flag may be given after the operator to use floating point
       numbers, otherwise integers are used.  This may be followed by a
       number giving the number of decimal places to use for the result.
       The available operators are: addition ‘+’, subtraction ‘-’,
       multiplication ‘*’, division ‘/’, modulus ‘m’ or ‘%’ (note that
       ‘%’ must be escaped as ‘%%’ in formats which are also expanded by
       <i>strftime</i>(3)) and numeric comparison operators ‘==’, ‘!=’, ‘&lt;’,
       ‘&lt;=’, ‘&gt;’ and ‘&gt;=’.  For example, ‘#{e|*|f|4:5.5,3}’ multiplies
       5.5 by 3 for a result with four decimal places and ‘#{e|%%:7,3}’
       returns the modulus of 7 and 3.  ‘a’ replaces a numeric argument
       by its ASCII equivalent, so ‘#{a:98}’ results in ‘b’.  ‘c’
       replaces a <b>tmux </b>colour by its six-digit hexadecimal RGB value.

       A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by
       prefixing it by an ‘=’, a number and a colon.  Positive numbers
       count from the start of the string and negative from the end, so
       ‘#{=5:pane_title}’ will include at most the first five characters
       of the pane title, or ‘#{=-5:pane_title}’ the last five
       characters.  A suffix or prefix may be given as a second argument
       - if provided then it is appended or prepended to the string if
       the length has been trimmed, for example ‘#{=/5/...:pane_title}’
       will append ‘...’ if the pane title is more than five characters.
       Similarly, ‘p’ pads the string to a given width, for example
       ‘#{p10:pane_title}’ will result in a width of at least 10
       characters.  A positive width pads on the left, a negative on the
       right.  ‘n’ expands to the length of the variable and ‘w’ to its
       width when displayed, for example ‘#{n:window_name}’.

       Prefixing a time variable with ‘t:’ will convert it to a string,
       so if ‘#{window_activity}’ gives ‘1445765102’,
       ‘#{t:window_activity}’ gives ‘Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015’.  Adding
       ‘p (’ ‘`t/p`’) will use shorter but less accurate time format for
       times in the past.  A custom format may be given using an ‘f’
       suffix (note that ‘%’ must be escaped as ‘%%’ if the format is
       separately being passed through <i>strftime</i>(3), for example in the
       <b>status-left </b>option): ‘#{t/f/%%H#:%%M:window_activity}’, see
       <i>strftime</i>(3).

       The ‘b:’ and ‘d:’ prefixes are <i>basename</i>(3) and <i>dirname</i>(3) of the
       variable respectively.  ‘q:’ will escape <i>sh</i>(1) special characters
       or with a ‘h’ suffix, escape hash characters (so ‘#’ becomes
       ‘##’).  ‘E:’ will expand the format twice, for example
       ‘#{E:status-left}’ is the result of expanding the content of the
       <b>status-left </b>option rather than the option itself.  ‘T:’ is like
       ‘E:’ but also expands <i>strftime</i>(3) specifiers.  ‘S:’, ‘W:’, ‘P:’
       or ‘L:’ will loop over each session, window, pane or client and
       insert the format once for each.  For windows and panes, two
       comma-separated formats may be given: the second is used for the
       current window or active pane.  For example, to get a list of
       windows formatted like the status line:

             #{W:#{E:window-status-format} ,#{E:window-status-current-format} }

       ‘N:’ checks if a window (without any suffix or with the ‘w’
       suffix) or a session (with the ‘s’ suffix) name exists, for
       example ‘`N/w:foo`’ is replaced with 1 if a window named ‘foo’
       exists.

       A prefix of the form ‘s/foo/bar/:’ will substitute ‘foo’ with
       ‘bar’ throughout.  The first argument may be an extended regular
       expression and a final argument may be ‘i’ to ignore case, for
       example ‘s/a(.)/\1x/i:’ would change ‘abABab’ into ‘bxBxbx’.  A
       different delimiter character may also be used, to avoid
       collisions with literal slashes in the pattern.  For example,
       ‘s|foo/|bar/|:’ will substitute ‘foo/’ with ‘bar/’ throughout.

       In addition, the last line of a shell command's output may be
       inserted using ‘#()’.  For example, ‘#(uptime)’ will insert the
       system's uptime.  When constructing formats, <b>tmux </b>does not wait
       for ‘#()’ commands to finish; instead, the previous result from
       running the same command is used, or a placeholder if the command
       has not been run before.  If the command hasn't exited, the most
       recent line of output will be used, but the status line will not
       be updated more than once a second.  Commands are executed using
       <i>/bin/sh</i> and with the <b>tmux </b>global environment set (see the “GLOBAL
       AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT” section).

       An ‘l’ specifies that a string should be interpreted literally
       and not expanded.  For example ‘#{l:#{?pane_in_mode,yes,no}}’
       will be replaced by ‘#{?pane_in_mode,yes,no}’.

       The following variables are available, where appropriate:

STYLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>offers various options to specify the colour and attributes
       of aspects of the interface, for example <b>status-style </b>for the
       status line.  In addition, embedded styles may be specified in
       format options, such as <b>status-left</b>, by enclosing them in ‘#[’
       and ‘]’.

       A style may be the single term ‘default’ to specify the default
       style (which may come from an option, for example <b>status-style </b>in
       the status line) or a space or comma separated list of the
       following:

       <b>fg=colour</b>
               Set the foreground colour.  The colour is one of: <b>black</b>,
               <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan</b>, <b>white</b>; if
               supported the bright variants <b>brightred</b>, <b>brightgreen</b>,
               <b>brightyellow</b>; <b>colour0 </b>to <b>colour255 </b>from the 256-colour
               set; <b>default </b>for the default colour; <b>terminal </b>for the
               terminal default colour; or a hexadecimal RGB string such
               as ‘#ffffff’.

       <b>bg=colour</b>
               Set the background colour.

       <b>us=colour</b>
               Set the underscore colour.

       <b>none    </b>Set no attributes (turn off any active attributes).

       <b>acs</b>, <b>bright </b>(or <b>bold</b>), <b>dim</b>, <b>underscore</b>, <b>blink</b>, <b>reverse</b>, <b>hidden</b>,
               <b>italics</b>, <b>overline</b>, <b>strikethrough</b>, <b>double-underscore</b>,
               <b>curly-underscore</b>, <b>dotted-underscore</b>, <b>dashed-underscore</b>
               Set an attribute.  Any of the attributes may be prefixed
               with ‘no’ to unset.  <b>acs </b>is the terminal alternate
               character set.

       <b>align=left </b>(or <b>noalign</b>), <b>align=centre</b>, <b>align=right</b>
               Align text to the left, centre or right of the available
               space if appropriate.

       <b>fill=colour</b>
               Fill the available space with a background colour if
               appropriate.

       <b>list=on</b>, <b>list=focus</b>, <b>list=left-marker</b>, <b>list=right-marker</b>, <b>nolist</b>
               Mark the position of the various window list components
               in the <b>status-format </b>option: <b>list=on </b>marks the start of
               the list; <b>list=focus </b>is the part of the list that should
               be kept in focus if the entire list won't fit in the
               available space (typically the current window);
               <b>list=left-marker </b>and <b>list=right-marker </b>mark the text to
               be used to mark that text has been trimmed from the left
               or right of the list if there is not enough space.

       <b>push-default</b>, <b>pop-default</b>
               Store the current colours and attributes as the default
               or reset to the previous default.  A <b>push-default </b>affects
               any subsequent use of the <b>default </b>term until a
               <b>pop-default</b>.  Only one default may be pushed (each
               <b>push-default </b>replaces the previous saved default).

       <b>range=left</b>, <b>range=right</b>, <b>range=session|X</b>, <b>range=window|X</b>,
               <b>range=pane|X</b>, <b>range=user|X</b>, <b>norange</b>
               Mark a range for mouse events in the <b>status-format</b>
               option.  When a mouse event occurs in the <b>range=left </b>or
               <b>range=right </b>range, the ‘StatusLeft’ and ‘StatusRight’ key
               bindings are triggered.

               <b>range=session|X</b>, <b>range=window|X </b>and <b>range=pane|X </b>are
               ranges for a session, window or pane.  These trigger the
               ‘Status’ mouse key with the target session, window or
               pane given by the ‘X’ argument.  ‘X’ is a session ID,
               window index in the current session or a pane ID.  For
               these, the <b>mouse_status_range </b>format variable will be set
               to ‘session’, ‘window’ or ‘pane’.

               <b>range=user|X </b>is a user-defined range; it triggers the
               ‘Status’ mouse key.  The argument ‘X’ will be available
               in the <b>mouse_status_range </b>format variable.  ‘X’ must be
               at most 15 bytes in length.

       Examples are:

             fg=yellow bold underscore blink
             bg=black,fg=default,noreverse
</pre> <h2>
NAMES AND TITLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>distinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and
       sessions have names, which may be used to specify them in targets
       and are displayed in the status line and various lists: the name
       is the <b>tmux </b>identifier for a window or session.  Only panes have
       titles.  A pane's title is typically set by the program running
       inside the pane using an escape sequence (like it would set the
       <i>xterm</i>(1) window title in <i>X</i>(7)).  Windows themselves do not have
       titles - a window's title is the title of its active pane.  <b>tmux</b>
       itself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is
       running, see the <b>set-titles </b>option.

       A session's name is set with the <b>new-session </b>and <b>rename-session</b>
       commands.  A window's name is set with one of:

       1.      A command argument (such as <b>-n </b>for <b>new-window </b>or
               <b>new-session</b>).

       2.      An escape sequence (if the <b>allow-rename </b>option is turned
               on):

                     $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

       3.      Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active
               command in the window's active pane.  See the
               <b>automatic-rename </b>option.

       When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A
       pane's title can be set via the title setting escape sequence,
       for example:

             $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

       It can also be modified with the <b>select-pane -T </b>command.
</pre> <h2>
GLOBAL AND SESSION ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       When the server is started, <b>tmux </b>copies the environment into the
       <i>global environment</i>; in addition, each session has a <i>session</i>
       <i>environment</i>.  When a window is created, the session and global
       environments are merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value
       from the session environment is used.  The result is the initial
       environment passed to the new process.

       The <b>update-environment </b>session option may be used to update the
       session environment from the client when a new session is created
       or an old reattached.  <b>tmux </b>also initialises the TMUX variable
       with some internal information to allow commands to be executed
       from inside, and the TERM variable with the correct terminal
       setting of ‘screen’.

       Variables in both session and global environments may be marked
       as hidden.  Hidden variables are not passed into the environment
       of new processes and instead can only be used by tmux itself (for
       example in formats, see the “FORMATS” section).

       Commands to alter and view the environment are:

       <b>set-environment </b>[<b>-Fhgru</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>] <i>name</i> [<i>value</i>]
                     (alias: <b>setenv</b>)
               Set or unset an environment variable.  If <b>-g </b>is used, the
               change is made in the global environment; otherwise, it
               is applied to the session environment for <i>target-session</i>.
               If <b>-F </b>is present, then <i>value</i> is expanded as a format.
               The <b>-u </b>flag unsets a variable.  <b>-r </b>indicates the variable
               is to be removed from the environment before starting a
               new process.  <b>-h </b>marks the variable as hidden.

       <b>show-environment </b>[<b>-hgs</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-session</i>] [<i>variable</i>]
                     (alias: <b>showenv</b>)
               Display the environment for <i>target-session</i> or the global
               environment with <b>-g</b>.  If <i>variable</i> is omitted, all
               variables are shown.  Variables removed from the
               environment are prefixed with ‘-’.  If <b>-s </b>is used, the
               output is formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.
               <b>-h </b>shows hidden variables (omitted by default).
</pre> <h2>
STATUS LINE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>includes an optional status line which is displayed in the
       bottom line of each terminal.

       By default, the status line is enabled and one line in height (it
       may be disabled or made multiple lines with the <b>status </b>session
       option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current
       session in square brackets; the window list; the title of the
       active pane in double quotes; and the time and date.

       Each line of the status line is configured with the <b>status-format</b>
       option.  The default is made of three parts: configurable left
       and right sections (which may contain dynamic content such as the
       time or output from a shell command, see the <b>status-left</b>,
       <b>status-left-length</b>, <b>status-right</b>, and <b>status-right-length </b>options
       below), and a central window list.  By default, the window list
       shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the windows present in
       the current session in ascending numerical order.  It may be
       customised with the <i>window-status-format</i> and
       <i>window-status-current-format</i> options.  The flag is one of the
       following symbols appended to the window name:

             <b>Symbol    Meaning</b>
             <b>*         </b>Denotes the current window.
             <b>-         </b>Marks the last window (previously selected).
             <b>#         </b>Window activity is monitored and activity has
                                  been detected.
             <b>!         </b>Window bells are monitored and a bell has
                                  occurred in the window.
             <b>~         </b>The window has been silent for the monitor-
                                  silence interval.
             <b>M         </b>The window contains the marked pane.
             <b>Z         </b>The window's active pane is zoomed.

       The # symbol relates to the <b>monitor-activity </b>window option.  The
       window name is printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell,
       activity or silence) is present.

       The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured,
       the entire status line using the <b>status-style </b>session option and
       individual windows using the <b>window-status-style </b>window option.

       The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has
       changed, the interval may be controlled with the <b>status-interval</b>
       session option.

       Commands related to the status line are as follows:

       <b>clear-prompt-history </b>[<b>-T </b><i>prompt-type</i>]
                     (alias: <b>clearphist</b>)
               Clear status prompt history for prompt type <i>prompt-type</i>.
               If <b>-T </b>is omitted, then clear history for all types.  See
               <b>command-prompt </b>for possible values for <i>prompt-type</i>.

       <b>command-prompt </b>[<b>-1bFikN</b>] [<b>-I </b><i>inputs</i>] [<b>-p </b><i>prompts</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>target-client</i>] [<b>-T </b><i>prompt-type</i>] [<i>template</i>]
               Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used
               from inside <b>tmux </b>to execute commands interactively.

               If <i>template</i> is specified, it is used as the command.
               With <b>-F</b>, <i>template</i> is expanded as a format.

               If present, <b>-I </b>is a comma-separated list of the initial
               text for each prompt.  If <b>-p </b>is given, <i>prompts</i> is a
               comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in
               order; otherwise a single prompt is displayed,
               constructed from <i>template</i> if it is present, or ‘:’ if
               not.

               Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of
               the string ‘%%’ and all occurrences of ‘%1’ are replaced
               by the response to the first prompt, all ‘%2’ are
               replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so
               on for further prompts.  Up to nine prompt responses may
               be replaced (‘%1’ to ‘%9’).  ‘%%%’ is like ‘%%’ but any
               quotation marks are escaped.

               <b>-1 </b>makes the prompt only accept one key press, in this
               case the resulting input is a single character.  <b>-k </b>is
               like <b>-1 </b>but the key press is translated to a key name.
               <b>-N </b>makes the prompt only accept numeric key presses.  <b>-i</b>
               executes the command every time the prompt input changes
               instead of when the user exits the command prompt.

               <b>-T </b>tells <b>tmux </b>the prompt type.  This affects what
               completions are offered when <i>Tab</i> is pressed.  Available
               types are: ‘command’, ‘search’, ‘target’ and
               ‘window-target’.

               The following keys have a special meaning in the command
               prompt, depending on the value of the <b>status-keys </b>option:

                     <b>Function                             vi        emacs</b>

                     <b>Transpose characters                           </b>C-t

               With <b>-b</b>, the prompt is shown in the background and the
               invoking client does not exit until it is dismissed.

       <b>confirm-before </b>[<b>-by</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>confirm-key</i>] [<b>-p </b><i>prompt</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>target-client</i>] <i>command</i>
                     (alias: <b>confirm</b>)
               Ask for confirmation before executing <i>command</i>.  If <b>-p </b>is
               given, <i>prompt</i> is the prompt to display; otherwise a
               prompt is constructed from <i>command</i>.  It may contain the
               special character sequences supported by the <b>status-left</b>
               option.  With <b>-b</b>, the prompt is shown in the background
               and the invoking client does not exit until it is
               dismissed.  <b>-y </b>changes the default behaviour (if Enter
               alone is pressed) of the prompt to run the command.  <b>-c</b>
               changes the confirmation key to <i>confirm-key</i>; the default
               is ‘y’.

       <b>display-menu </b>[<b>-OM</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>border-lines</i>] [<b>-c </b><i>target-client</i>] [<b>-C</b>

                     (alias: <b>menu</b>)
               Display a menu on <i>target-client</i>.  <i>target-pane</i> gives the
               target for any commands run from the menu.

               A menu is passed as a series of arguments: first the menu
               item name, second the key shortcut (or empty for none)
               and third the command to run when the menu item is
               chosen.  The name and command are formats, see the
               “FORMATS” and “STYLES” sections.  If the name begins with
               a hyphen (-), then the item is disabled (shown dim) and
               may not be chosen.  The name may be empty for a separator
               line, in which case both the key and command should be
               omitted.

               <b>-b </b>sets the type of characters used for drawing menu
               borders.  See <b>popup-border-lines </b>for possible values for
               <i>border-lines</i>.

               <b>-H </b>sets the style for the selected menu item (see
               “STYLES”).

               <b>-s </b>sets the style for the menu and <b>-S </b>sets the style for
               the menu border (see “STYLES”).

               <b>-T </b>is a format for the menu title (see “FORMATS”).

               <b>-C </b>sets the menu item selected by default, if the menu is
               not bound to a mouse key binding.

               <b>-x </b>and <b>-y </b>give the position of the menu.  Both may be a
               row or column number, or one of the following special
               values:

                     <b>Value    Flag    Meaning</b>
                     <b>C        </b>Both    The centre of the terminal

                     <b>P        </b>Both    The bottom left of the pane
                     <b>M        </b>Both    The mouse position
                     <b>W        </b>Both    The window position on the status
                                      line
                     <b>S        -y      </b>The line above or below the status
                                      line

               Or a format, which is expanded including the following
               additional variables:

               Each menu consists of items followed by a key shortcut
               shown in brackets.  If the menu is too large to fit on
               the terminal, it is not displayed.  Pressing the key
               shortcut chooses the corresponding item.  If the mouse is
               enabled and the menu is opened from a mouse key binding,
               releasing the mouse button with an item selected chooses
               that item and releasing the mouse button without an item
               selected closes the menu.  <b>-O </b>changes this behaviour so
               that the menu does not close when the mouse button is
               released without an item selected the menu is not closed
               and a mouse button must be clicked to choose an item.

               <b>-M </b>tells <b>tmux </b>the menu should handle mouse events; by
               default only menus opened from mouse key bindings do so.

               The following keys are available in menus:

                     <b>Key    Function</b>
                     <b>Enter  </b>Choose selected item
                     <b>Up     </b>Select previous item

               <i>target-pane</i>] [<i>message</i>]
                     (alias: <b>display</b>)
               Display a message.  If <b>-p </b>is given, the output is printed
               to stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the <i>target-client</i>
               status line for up to <i>delay</i> milliseconds.  If <i>delay</i> is
               not given, the <b>display-time </b>option is used; a delay of
               zero waits for a key press.  ‘N’ ignores key presses and
               closes only after the delay expires.  If <b>-l </b>is given,
               <i>message</i> is printed unchanged.  Otherwise, the format of
               <i>message</i> is described in the “FORMATS” section;
               information is taken from <i>target-pane</i> if <b>-t </b>is given,
               otherwise the active pane.

               <b>-v </b>prints verbose logging as the format is parsed and <b>-a</b>
               lists the format variables and their values.

               <b>-I </b>forwards any input read from stdin to the empty pane

                     (alias: <b>popup</b>)
               Display a popup running <i>shell-command</i> on <i>target-client</i>.
               A popup is a rectangular box drawn over the top of any
               panes.  Panes are not updated while a popup is present.

               <b>-E </b>closes the popup automatically when <i>shell-command</i>
               exits.  Two <b>-E </b>closes the popup only if <i>shell-command</i>
               exited with success.

               <b>-x </b>and <b>-y </b>give the position of the popup, they have the
               same meaning as for the <b>display-menu </b>command.  <b>-w </b>and <b>-h</b>
               give the width and height - both may be a percentage
               (followed by ‘%’).  If omitted, half of the terminal size
               is used.

               <b>-B </b>does not surround the popup by a border.

               <b>-b </b>sets the type of characters used for drawing popup
               borders.  When <b>-B </b>is specified, the <b>-b </b>option is ignored.
               See <b>popup-border-lines </b>for possible values for
               <i>border-lines</i>.

               <b>-s </b>sets the style for the popup and <b>-S </b>sets the style for
               the popup border (see “STYLES”).

               <b>-e </b>takes the form ‘VARIABLE=value’ and sets an
               environment variable for the popup; it may be specified
               multiple times.

               <b>-T </b>is a format for the popup title (see “FORMATS”).

               The <b>-C </b>flag closes any popup on the client.

       <b>show-prompt-history </b>[<b>-T </b><i>prompt-type</i>]

BUFFERS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>maintains a set of named <i>paste buffers</i>.  Each buffer may be
       either explicitly or automatically named.  Explicitly named
       buffers are named when created with the <b>set-buffer </b>or <b>load-buffer</b>
       commands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer with
       <b>set-buffer -n</b>.  Automatically named buffers are given a name such
       as ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and so on.  When the <b>buffer-limit</b>
       option is reached, the oldest automatically named buffer is
       deleted.  Explicitly named buffers are not subject to
       <b>buffer-limit </b>and may be deleted with the <b>delete-buffer </b>command.

       Buffers may be added using <b>copy-mode </b>or the <b>set-buffer </b>and
       <b>load-buffer </b>commands, and pasted into a window using the
       <b>paste-buffer </b>command.  If a buffer command is used and no buffer
       is specified, the most recently added automatically named buffer
       is assumed.

       A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.
       By default, up to 2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with
       the <b>history-limit </b>option (see the <b>set-option </b>command above).

       The buffer commands are as follows:

       <b>choose-buffer </b>[<b>-NZr</b>] [<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>] [<b>-K </b><i>key-format</i>] [<b>-O</b>
               <i>sort-order</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] [<i>template</i>]
               Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen
               interactively from a list.  Each buffer is shown on one
               line.  A shortcut key is shown on the left in brackets
               allowing for immediate choice, or the list may be
               navigated and an item chosen or otherwise manipulated
               using the keys below.  <b>-Z </b>zooms the pane.  The following
               keys may be used in buffer mode:

                     <b>Key    Function</b>
                     <b>Enter  </b>Paste selected buffer
                     <b>Up     </b>Select previous buffer
                     <b>Down   </b>Select next buffer
                     <b>C-s    </b>Search by name or content
                     <b>n      </b>Repeat last search forwards
                     <b>N      </b>Repeat last search backwards
                     <b>t      </b>Toggle if buffer is tagged
                     <b>T      </b>Tag no buffers
                     <b>C-t    </b>Tag all buffers
                     <b>p      </b>Paste selected buffer
                     <b>P      </b>Paste tagged buffers
                     <b>d      </b>Delete selected buffer
                     <b>D      </b>Delete tagged buffers
                     <b>e      </b>Open the buffer in an editor
                     <b>f      </b>Enter a format to filter items
                     <b>O      </b>Change sort field
                     <b>r      </b>Reverse sort order
                     <b>v      </b>Toggle preview
                     <b>q      </b>Exit mode

               After a buffer is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer
               name in <i>template</i> and the result executed as a command.
               If <i>template</i> is not given, "paste-buffer -p -b '%%'" is
               used.

               <b>-O </b>specifies the initial sort field: one of ‘time’
               (creation), ‘name’ or ‘size’.  <b>-r </b>reverses the sort
               order.  <b>-f </b>specifies an initial filter: the filter is a
               format - if it evaluates to zero, the item in the list is
               not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter would lead
               to an empty list, it is ignored.  <b>-F </b>specifies the format
               for each item in the list and <b>-K </b>a format for each
               shortcut key; both are evaluated once for each line.  <b>-N</b>
               starts without the preview.  This command works only if
               at least one client is attached.

       <b>clear-history </b>[<b>-H</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
                     (alias: <b>clearhist</b>)
               Remove and free the history for the specified pane.  <b>-H</b>
               also removes all hyperlinks.

       <b>delete-buffer </b>[<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>]
                     (alias: <b>deleteb</b>)
               Delete the buffer named <i>buffer-name</i>, or the most recently
               added automatically named buffer if not specified.

       <b>list-buffers </b>[<b>-F </b><i>format</i>] [<b>-f </b><i>filter</i>]
                     (alias: <b>lsb</b>)
               List the global buffers.  <b>-F </b>specifies the format of each
               line and <b>-f </b>a filter.  Only buffers for which the filter
               is true are shown.  See the “FORMATS” section.

       <b>load-buffer </b>[<b>-w</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>] <i>path</i>
                     (alias: <b>loadb</b>)
               Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from
               <i>path</i>.  If <b>-w </b>is given, the buffer is also sent to the
               clipboard for <i>target-client</i> using the <i>xterm</i>(1) escape
               sequence, if possible.

       <b>paste-buffer </b>[<b>-dpr</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>separator</i>] [<b>-t</b>
               <i>target-pane</i>]
                     (alias: <b>pasteb</b>)
               Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified
               pane.  If not specified, paste into the current one.
               With <b>-d</b>, also delete the paste buffer.  When output, any
               linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced
               with a separator, by default carriage return (CR).  A
               custom separator may be specified using the <b>-s </b>flag.  The
               <b>-r </b>flag means to do no replacement (equivalent to a
               separator of LF).  If <b>-p </b>is specified, paste bracket
               control codes are inserted around the buffer if the
               application has requested bracketed paste mode.

       <b>save-buffer </b>[<b>-a</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] <i>path</i>
                     (alias: <b>saveb</b>)
               Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to <i>path</i>.
               The <b>-a </b>option appends to rather than overwriting the
               file.

       <b>set-buffer </b>[<b>-aw</b>] [<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-client</i>] [<b>-n</b>
               <i>new-buffer-name</i>] <i>data</i>
                     (alias: <b>setb</b>)
               Set the contents of the specified buffer to <i>data</i>.  If <b>-w</b>
               is given, the buffer is also sent to the clipboard for
               <i>target-client</i> using the <i>xterm</i>(1) escape sequence, if
               possible.  The <b>-a </b>option appends to rather than
               overwriting the buffer.  The <b>-n </b>option renames the buffer
               to <i>new-buffer-name</i>.

       <b>show-buffer </b>[<b>-b </b><i>buffer-name</i>]
                     (alias: <b>showb</b>)
               Display the contents of the specified buffer.

MISCELLANEOUS </h2>
<pre>
       Miscellaneous commands are as follows:

       <b>clock-mode </b>[<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
               Display a large clock.

       <b>if-shell </b>[<b>-bF</b>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>] <i>shell-command command</i> [<i>command</i>]
                     (alias: <b>if</b>)
               Execute the first <i>command</i> if <i>shell-command</i> (run with
               <i>/bin/sh</i>) returns success or the second <i>command</i> otherwise.
               Before being executed, <i>shell-command</i> is expanded using
               the rules specified in the “FORMATS” section, including
               those relevant to <i>target-pane</i>.  With <b>-b</b>, <i>shell-command</i> is
               run in the background.

               If <b>-F </b>is given, <i>shell-command</i> is not executed but
               considered success if neither empty nor zero (after
               formats are expanded).

       <b>lock-server</b>
                     (alias: <b>lock</b>)
               Lock each client individually by running the command
               specified by the <b>lock-command </b>option.

       <b>run-shell </b>[<b>-bC</b>] [<b>-c </b><i>start-directory</i>] [<b>-d </b><i>delay</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>target-pane</i>]
               [<i>shell-command</i>]
                     (alias: <b>run</b>)
               Execute <i>shell-command</i> using <i>/bin/sh</i> or (with <b>-C</b>) a <b>tmux</b>
               command in the background without creating a window.
               Before being executed, <i>shell-command</i> is expanded using
               the rules specified in the “FORMATS” section.  With <b>-b</b>,
               the command is run in the background.  <b>-d </b>waits for <i>delay</i>
               seconds before starting the command.  If <b>-c </b>is given, the
               current working directory is set to <i>start-directory</i>.  If
               <b>-C </b>is not given, any output to stdout is displayed in
               view mode (in the pane specified by <b>-t </b>or the current
               pane if omitted) after the command finishes.  If the
               command fails, the exit status is also displayed.

               exiting until woken using <b>wait-for -S </b>with the same
               channel.  When <b>-L </b>is used, the channel is locked and any
               clients that try to lock the same channel are made to
               wait until the channel is unlocked with <b>wait-for -U</b>.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT MESSAGES </h2>
<pre>
       When a <b>tmux </b>client detaches, it prints a message.  This may be
       one of:

       detached (from session ...)
               The client was detached normally.

       detached and SIGHUP
               The client was detached and its parent sent the SIGHUP
               signal (for example with <b>detach-client -P</b>).

       lost tty
               The client's <i>tty</i>(4) or <i>pty</i>(4) was unexpectedly destroyed.

       terminated
               The client was killed with SIGTERM.

       too far behind
               The client is in control mode and became unable to keep
               up with the data from <b>tmux</b>.

       exited  The server exited when it had no sessions.

       server exited
               The server exited when it received SIGTERM.

       server exited unexpectedly
               The server crashed or otherwise exited without telling
               the client the reason.
</pre> <h2>
TERMINFO EXTENSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>understands some unofficial extensions to <i>terminfo</i>(5).  It
       is not normally necessary to set these manually, instead the
       <b>terminal-features </b>option should be used.

       <i>AX</i>      An existing extension that tells <b>tmux </b>the terminal
               supports default colours.

       <i>Bidi</i>    Tell <b>tmux </b>that the terminal supports the VTE
               bidirectional text extensions.

       <i>Cs</i>, <i>Cr</i>  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string
               argument and is used to set the colour; the second takes
               no arguments and restores the default cursor colour.  If
               set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the
               cursor colour from inside <b>tmux</b>:

                     $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

               The colour is an <i>X</i>(7) colour, see <i>XParseColor</i>(3).

       <i>Cmg, Clmg, Dsmg</i>, <i>Enmg</i>
               Set, clear, disable or enable DECSLRM margins.  These are
               set automatically if the terminal reports it is <i>VT420</i>
               compatible.

       <i>Dsbp</i>, <i>Enbp</i>
               Disable and enable bracketed paste.  These are set
               automatically if the <i>XT</i> capability is present.

       <i>Dseks</i>, <i>Eneks</i>
               Disable and enable extended keys.

       <i>Dsfcs</i>, <i>Enfcs</i>
               Disable and enable focus reporting.  These are set
               automatically if the <i>XT</i> capability is present.

       <i>Hls</i>     Set or clear a hyperlink annotation.

       <i>Nobr</i>    Tell <b>tmux </b>that the terminal does not use bright colors
               for bold display.

       <i>Rect</i>    Tell <b>tmux </b>that the terminal supports rectangle
               operations.

       <i>Smol</i>    Enable the overline attribute.

       <i>Smulx</i>   Set a styled underscore.  The single parameter is one of:
               0 for no underscore, 1 for normal underscore, 2 for
               double underscore, 3 for curly underscore, 4 for dotted
               underscore and 5 for dashed underscore.

       <i>Setulc</i>, <i>Setulc1, ol</i>
               Set the underscore colour or reset to the default.
               <i>Setulc</i> is for RGB colours and <i>Setulc1</i> for ANSI or 256
               colours.  The <i>Setulc</i> argument is (red * 65536) + (green *
               256) + blue where each is between 0 and 255.

       <i>Ss</i>, <i>Se</i>  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such
               as this may be used to change the cursor to an underline:

                     $ printf '\033[4 q'

               If <i>Se</i> is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to
               reset the cursor style instead.

       <i>Swd</i>     Set the opening sequence for the working directory
               notification.  The sequence is terminated using the
               standard <i>fsl</i> capability.

       <i>Sxl</i>     Indicates that the terminal supports SIXEL.

       <i>Sync</i>    Start (parameter is 1) or end (parameter is 2) a
               synchronized update.

       <i>Tc</i>      Indicate that the terminal supports the ‘direct colour’
               RGB escape sequence (for example, \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

               If supported, this is used for the initialize colour
               escape sequence (which may be enabled by adding the
               ‘initc’ and ‘ccc’ capabilities to the <b>tmux </b><i>terminfo</i>(5)
               entry).

               This is equivalent to the <i>RGB terminfo</i>(5) capability.

       <i>Ms</i>      Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection
               (clipboard).  See the <i>set-clipboard</i> option above and the
               <i>xterm</i>(1) man page.

       <i>XT</i>      This is an existing extension capability that tmux uses
               to mean that the terminal supports the <i>xterm</i>(1) title set
               sequences and to automatically set some of the
               capabilities above.
</pre> <h2>
CONTROL MODE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>tmux </b>offers a textual interface called <i>control mode</i>.  This allows
       applications to communicate with <b>tmux </b>using a simple text-only
       protocol.

       In control mode, a client sends <b>tmux </b>commands or command
       sequences terminated by newlines on standard input.  Each command
       will produce one block of output on standard output.  An output
       block consists of a <i>%begin</i> line followed by the output (which may
       be empty).  The output block ends with a <i>%end</i> or <i>%error</i>.  <i>%begin</i>
       and matching <i>%end</i> or <i>%error</i> have three arguments: an integer time
       (as seconds from epoch), command number and flags (currently not
       used).  For example:

             %begin 1363006971 2 1
             0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
             %end 1363006971 2 1

       The <b>refresh-client -C </b>command may be used to set the size of a
       client in control mode.

       In control mode, <b>tmux </b>outputs notifications.  A notification will
       never occur inside an output block.

       The following notifications are defined:

       <b>%client-detached </b><i>client</i>
               The client has detached.

       <b>%client-session-changed </b><i>client session-id name</i>
               The client is now attached to the session with ID
               <i>session-id</i>, which is named <i>name</i>.

       <b>%config-error </b><i>error</i>
               An error has happened in a configuration file.

       <b>%continue </b><i>pane-id</i>
               The pane has been continued after being paused (if the
               <i>pause-after</i> flag is set, see <b>refresh-client -A</b>).

       <b>%exit </b>[<i>reason</i>]
               The <b>tmux </b>client is exiting immediately, either because it
               is not attached to any session or an error occurred.  If
               present, <i>reason</i> describes why the client exited.

       <b>%extended-output </b><i>pane-id age ...</i> : <i>value</i>
               New form of <b>%output </b>sent when the <i>pause-after</i> flag is
               set.  <i>age</i> is the time in milliseconds for which tmux had
               buffered the output before it was sent.  Any subsequent
               arguments up until a single ‘:’ are for future use and
               should be ignored.

       <b>%layout-change </b><i>window-id window-layout window-visible-layout</i>
               <i>window-flags</i>
               The layout of a window with ID <i>window-id</i> changed.  The
               new layout is <i>window-layout</i>.  The window's visible layout
               is <i>window-visible-layout</i> and the window flags are
               <i>window-flags</i>.

       <b>%message </b><i>message</i>
               A message sent with the <b>display-message </b>command.

       <b>%output </b><i>pane-id value</i>
               A window pane produced output.  <i>value</i> escapes non-
               printable characters and backslash as octal \xxx.

       <b>%pane-mode-changed </b><i>pane-id</i>
               The pane with ID <i>pane-id</i> has changed mode.

       <b>%paste-buffer-changed </b><i>name</i>
               Paste buffer <i>name</i> has been changed.

       <b>%paste-buffer-deleted </b><i>name</i>
               Paste buffer <i>name</i> has been deleted.

       <b>%pause </b><i>pane-id</i>
               The pane has been paused (if the <i>pause-after</i> flag is
               set).

       <b>%session-changed </b><i>session-id name</i>
               The client is now attached to the session with ID

               The current session was renamed to <i>name</i>.

       <b>%session-window-changed </b><i>session-id window-id</i>
               The session with ID <i>session-id</i> changed its active window
               to the window with ID <i>window-id</i>.

       <b>%sessions-changed</b>
               A session was created or destroyed.

       <b>%subscription-changed </b><i>name session-id window-id window-index</i>
               <i>pane-id ...</i> : <i>value</i>
               The value of the format associated with subscription <i>name</i>
               has changed to <i>value</i>.  See <b>refresh-client -B</b>.  Any
               arguments after <i>pane-id</i> up until a single ‘:’ are for
               future use and should be ignored.

       <b>%unlinked-window-add </b><i>window-id</i>

ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       When <b>tmux </b>is started, it inspects the following environment
       variables:

       EDITOR    If the command specified in this variable contains the
                 string ‘vi’ and VISUAL is unset, use vi-style key
                 bindings.  Overridden by the <b>mode-keys </b>and <b>status-keys</b>
                 options.

       HOME      The user's login directory.  If unset, the <i>passwd</i>(5)
                 database is consulted.

       LC_CTYPE  The character encoding <i>locale</i>(1).  It is used for two
                 separate purposes.  For output to the terminal, UTF-8
                 is used if the <b>-u </b>option is given or if LC_CTYPE
                 contains "UTF-8" or "UTF8".  Otherwise, only ASCII
                 characters are written and non-ASCII characters are
                 replaced with underscores (‘_’).  For input, <b>tmux</b>
                 always runs with a UTF-8 locale.  If en_US.UTF-8 is
                 provided by the operating system, it is used and
                 LC_CTYPE is ignored for input.  Otherwise, LC_CTYPE
                 tells <b>tmux </b>what the UTF-8 locale is called on the
                 current system.  If the locale specified by LC_CTYPE is
                 not available or is not a UTF-8 locale, <b>tmux </b>exits with
                 an error message.

       LC_TIME   The date and time format <i>locale</i>(1).  It is used for
                 locale-dependent <i>strftime</i>(3) format specifiers.

       PWD       The current working directory to be set in the global
                 environment.  This may be useful if it contains
                 symbolic links.  If the value of the variable does not
                 match the current working directory, the variable is
                 ignored and the result of <i>getcwd</i>(3) is used instead.

       SHELL     The absolute path to the default shell for new windows.
                 See the <b>default-shell </b>option for details.

       TMUX_TMPDIR
                 The parent directory of the directory containing the
                 server sockets.  See the <b>-L </b>option for details.

       VISUAL    If the command specified in this variable contains the
                 string ‘vi’, use vi-style key bindings.  Overridden by
                 the <b>mode-keys </b>and <b>status-keys </b>options.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>~/.tmux.conf</i>
       <i>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tmux/tmux.conf</i>
       <i>~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf</i>   Default <b>tmux </b>configuration file.
       <i>@SYSCONFDIR@/tmux.conf</i>     System-wide configuration file.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To create a new <b>tmux </b>session running <i>vi</i>(1):

             <b>$ tmux new-session vi</b>

       Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-
       session, this is <b>new</b>:

             <b>$ tmux new vi</b>

       Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is
       accepted.  If there are several options, they are listed:

             $ tmux n
             ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

       Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing
       ‘C-b c’ (Ctrl followed by the ‘b’ key followed by the ‘c’ key).

       Windows may be navigated with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b
       1’ (to select window 1), and so on; ‘C-b n’ to select the next
       window; and ‘C-b p’ to select the previous window.

       A session may be detached using ‘C-b d’ (or by an external event
       such as <i>ssh</i>(1) disconnection) and reattached with:

             <b>$ tmux attach-session</b>

       Typing ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current
       window; up and down may be used to navigate the list or ‘q’ to
       exit from it.

       Commands to be run when the <b>tmux </b>server is started may be placed
       in the <i>~/.tmux.conf</i> configuration file.  Common examples include:

       Changing the default prefix key:

             set-option -g prefix C-a
             unbind-key C-b
             bind-key C-a send-prefix

       Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

             set-option -g status off
             set-option -g status-style bg=blue

       Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking
       after 30 minutes of inactivity:

             set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
             set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

       Creating new key bindings:

             bind-key b set-option status
             bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
             bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
