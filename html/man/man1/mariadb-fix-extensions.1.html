NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mariadb-fix-extensions - normalize table file name extensions
       (mysql_fix_extensions is now a symlink to mariadb-fix-extensions)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>mysql_fix_extensions </b><i>data_dir</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mysql_fix_extensions </b>converts the extensions for MyISAM (or ISAM)
       table files to their canonical forms. It looks for files with
       extensions matching any lettercase variant of .frm, .myd, .myi,
       .isd, and .ism and renames them to have extensions of .frm, .MYD,
       .MYI, .ISD, and .ISM, respectively. This can be useful after
       transferring the files from a system with case-insensitive file
       names (such as Windows) to a system with case-sensitive file
       names.

       Invoke <b>mysql_fix_extensions </b>like this, where <i>data_dir</i> is the path
       name to the MySQL data directory.

           shell&gt; <b>mysql_fix_extensions </b><i>data_dir</i>
