</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       w - Show who is logged on and what they are doing.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>w </b>[<i>option</i> ...] [<i>user</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>w </b>displays information about the users currently on the machine,
       and their processes.  The header shows, in this order, the
       current time, how long the system has been running, how many
       users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for
       the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

       The following entries are displayed for each user: login name,
       the tty name, the remote host, login time, idle time, JCPU, PCPU,
       and the command line of their current process.

       The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the
       tty.  It does not include past background jobs, but does include
       currently running background jobs.

       The PCPU time is the time used by the current process, named in
       the "what" field.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-c</b>, <b>--container</b>
              show the container uptime instead of system uptime in the
              header.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--no-header</b>
              Don't print the header.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--no-current</b>
              Ignores the username while figuring out the current
              process and cpu times.  To demonstrate this, do a <b>su </b>and
              do a <b>w </b>and a <b>w -u</b>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--short</b>
              Use the short format.  Don't print the login time, JCPU or
              PCPU times.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--from</b>
              Toggle printing the <b>from </b>(remote hostname) field.  The
              default as released is for the <b>from </b>field to not be
              printed, although your system administrator or
              distribution maintainer may have compiled a version in
              which the <b>from </b>field is shown by default.

       <b>--help </b>Display help text and exit.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ip-addr</b>
              Display IP address instead of hostname for <b>from </b>field.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pids</b>
              Display pid of the login process/the "what" process in the
              "what" field.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--old-style</b>
              Old style output.  Prints blank space for idle times less
              than one minute.

       <b>user   </b>Show information about the specified user only.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PROCPS_CONTAINER</b>
              If $<b>PROCPS_CONTAINER </b>is set, then <b>w </b>behaves as if the
              <b>--container </b>option has been given.

       <b>PROCPS_USERLEN</b>
              Override the default width of the username column.
              Defaults to 8.

       <b>PROCPS_FROMLEN</b>
