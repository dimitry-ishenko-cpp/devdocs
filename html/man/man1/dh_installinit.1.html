</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_installinit - install service init files into package build
       directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installinit </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>--name=</b><i>name</i>] [<b>-n</b>] [<b>-R</b>] [<b>-r</b>]
       [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-- </b><i>params</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installinit </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing init scripts with associated defaults files.  In
       compatibility levels up to and including 10, <b>dh_installinit </b>will
       also install some systemd related files provided by the debian
       packaging (see the "FILES" section below).  In compatibility
       levels up to and including 11, <b>dh_installinit </b>will also handle
       upstart jobs provided in the debian packaging (see the "FILES"
       for more information on this as well).

       It also automatically generates the <i>postinst</i> and <i>postrm</i> and <i>prerm</i>
       commands needed to set up the symlinks in <i>/etc/rc*.d/</i> to start
       and stop the init scripts.

       In compat 10 or earlier: If a package only ships a systemd
       service file and no sysvinit script is provided, you may want to
       exclude the call to dh_installinit for that package (e.g. via
       <b>-N</b>).  Otherwise, you may get warnings from lintian about init.d
       scripts not being included in the package.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.init
           If this exists, it is installed into etc/init.d/<i>package</i> in
           the package build directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.default
           If this exists, it is installed into etc/default/<i>package</i> in
           the package build directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.upstart
           In compatibility level 11, this file will trigger an error
           with a reminder about ensuring the proper removal of the
           upstart file in the previous package version.  Please
           consider using the "rm_conffile" feature from
           <a href="dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a> to ensure the proper removal of previous
           upstart files.

           In compatibility level 10, if this file exists, it is
           installed into etc/init/<i>package</i>.conf in the package build
           directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.service
           If this exists, it is installed into
           <i>usr/lib/systemd/system/package.service</i> in the package build
           directory. Only used in compat levels 10 and below.

       debian/<i>package</i>.tmpfile
           If this exists, it is installed into
           usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/<i>package</i>.conf in the package build
           directory. Only used in compat levels 10 and below.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-scripts</b>
           Do not modify <i>postinst</i>/<i>postrm</i>/<i>prerm</i> scripts.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--only-scripts</b>
           Only modify <i>postinst</i>/<i>postrm</i>/<i>prerm</i> scripts, do not actually
           install any init script, default files, upstart job or
           systemd service file. May be useful if the file is shipped
           and/or installed by upstream in a way that doesn't make it
           easy to let <b>dh_installinit </b>find it.

           <b>Caveat</b>: This will bypass all the regular checks and
           <i>unconditionally</i> modify the scripts.  You will almost
           certainly want to use this with <b>-p </b>to limit, which packages
           are affected by the call.  Example:

            override_dh_installinit:
                   dh_installinit -pfoo --only-scripts
                   dh_installinit --remaining

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--restart-after-upgrade</b>
           Do not stop the init script until after the package upgrade
           has been completed.  This is the default behaviour in compat
           10.

           In early compat levels, the default was to stop the script in
           the <i>prerm</i>, and starts it again in the <i>postinst</i>.

           This can be useful for daemons that should not have a
           possibly long downtime during upgrade. But you should make
           sure that the daemon will not get confused by the package
           being upgraded while it's running before using this option.

       <b>--no-restart-after-upgrade</b>
           Undo a previous <b>--restart-after-upgrade </b>(or the default of
           compat 10).  If no other options are given, this will cause
           the service to be stopped in the <i>prerm</i> script and started
           again in the <i>postinst</i> script.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-stop-on-upgrade</b>, <b>--no-restart-on-upgrade</b>
           Do not stop init script on upgrade.  This has the side-effect
           of not restarting the service as a part of the upgrade.

           If you want to restart the service with minimal downtime,
           please use <b>--restart-after-upgrade </b>(default in compat 10 or
           later).  If you want the service to be restarted but be
           stopped during the upgrade, then please use
           <b>--no-restart-after-upgrade </b>(note the "after-upgrade").

           Note that the <b>--no-restart-on-upgrade </b>alias is deprecated and
           will be removed in compat 12.  This is to avoid confusion
           with the <b>--no-restart-after-upgrade </b>option.  The
           <b>--no-stop-on-upgrade </b>variant was introduced in debhelper 10.2
           (included in Debian stretch).

       <b>--no-start</b>
           Do not start the init script on install or upgrade, or stop
           it on removal.  Only call <b>update-rc.d</b>. Useful for rcS
           scripts.

       <b>--no-enable</b>
           Disable the init script on purge, but do not enable them on
           install.  This implies a versioned dependency on <b>init-system-</b>
           <b>helpers (&gt;= 1.51) </b>as it is the first (functional) version
           that supports <b>update-rc.d &lt;script&gt; defaults-disabled</b>.

           <b>Note </b>that this option does not affect whether the services
           are started.  Please remember to also use <b>--no-start </b>if the
           service should not be started.

           Cannot be combined with <b>-u</b><i>params</i>, <b>--update-rcd-params=</b><i>params</i>,
           or <b>-- </b><i>params</i>.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--remove-d</b>
           Remove trailing <b>d </b>from the name of the package, and use the
           result for the filename the upstart job file is installed as
           in <i>etc/init/</i> , and for the filename the init script is
           installed as in etc/init.d and the default file is installed
           as in <i>etc/default/</i>. This may be useful for daemons with names
           ending in <b>d</b>. (Note: this takes precedence over the
           <b>--init-script </b>parameter described below.)

       <b>-u</b><i>params</i> <b>--update-rcd-params=</b><i>params</i>
       <b>-- </b><i>params</i>
           Pass <i>params</i> to <b>update-rc.d</b>(8). If not specified, <b>defaults </b>(or
           <b>defaults-disabled </b>with <b>--no-enable</b>) will be passed to
           <b>update-rc.d</b>(8).

           Cannot be combined with <b>--no-enable</b>.

       <b>--name=</b><i>name</i>
           Install the init script (and default file) as well as upstart
           job file using the filename <i>name</i> instead of the default
           filename, which is the package name. When this parameter is
           used, <b>dh_installinit </b>looks for and installs files named
           <i>debian/package.name.init</i>, <i>debian/package.name.default</i> and
           <i>debian/package.name.upstart</i> instead of the usual
           <i>debian/package.init</i>, <i>debian/package.default</i> and
           <i>debian/package.upstart</i>.

       <b>--init-script=</b><i>scriptname</i>
           Use <i>scriptname</i> as the filename the init script is installed
           as in <i>etc/init.d/</i> (and also use it as the filename for the
           defaults file, if it is installed). If you use this
           parameter, <b>dh_installinit </b>will look to see if a file in the
           <i>debian/</i> directory exists that looks like <i>package.scriptname</i>
           and if so will install it as the init script in preference to
           the files it normally installs.

           This parameter is deprecated, use the <b>--name </b>parameter
           instead. This parameter is incompatible with the use of
           upstart jobs.

       <b>--error-handler=</b><i>function</i>
           Call the named shell <i>function</i> if running the init script
           fails. The function should be provided in the <i>prerm</i> and
           <i>postinst</i> scripts, before the <b>#DEBHELPER# </b>token.
