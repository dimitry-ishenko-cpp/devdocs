NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flock - manage locks from shell scripts
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>flock </b>[options] <i>file</i>|<i>directory command</i> [<i>arguments</i>]

       <b>flock </b>[options] <i>file</i>|<i>directory</i> <b>-c </b><i>command</i>

       <b>flock </b>[options] <i>number</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This utility manages <a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock(2)</a> locks from within shell scripts or
       from the command line.

       The first and second of the above forms wrap the lock around the
       execution of a <i>command</i>, in a manner similar to <a href="su.1.html">su(1)</a> or
       <a href="newgrp.1.html">newgrp(1)</a>. They lock a specified <i>file</i> or <i>directory</i>, which is
       created (assuming appropriate permissions) if it does not already
       exist. By default, if the lock cannot be immediately acquired,
       <b>flock </b>waits until the lock is available.

       The third form uses an open file by its file descriptor <i>number</i>.
       See the examples below for how that can be used.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-c</b>, <b>--command </b><i>command</i>
           Pass a single <i>command</i>, without arguments, to the shell with
           <b>-c</b>.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--conflict-exit-code </b><i>number</i>
           The exit status used when the <b>-n </b>option is in use, and the
           conflicting lock exists, or the <b>-w </b>option is in use, and the
           timeout is reached. The default value is <b>1</b>. The <i>number</i> has to
           be in the range of 0 to 255.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--no-fork</b>
           Do not fork before executing <i>command</i>. Upon execution the
           flock process is replaced by <i>command</i> which continues to hold
           the lock. This option is incompatible with <b>--close </b>as there
           would otherwise be nothing left to hold the lock.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>-x</b>, <b>--exclusive</b>
           Obtain an exclusive lock, sometimes called a write lock. This
           is the default.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nb</b>, <b>--nonblock</b>
           Fail rather than wait if the lock cannot be immediately
           acquired. See the <b>-E </b>option for the exit status used.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--close</b>
           Close the file descriptor on which the lock is held before
           executing <i>command</i>. This is useful if <i>command</i> spawns a child
           process which should not be holding the lock.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--shared</b>
           Obtain a shared lock, sometimes called a read lock.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unlock</b>
           Drop a lock. This is usually not required, since a lock is
           automatically dropped when the file is closed. However, it
           may be required in special cases, for example if the enclosed
           command group may have forked a background process which
           should not be holding the lock.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wait</b>, <b>--timeout </b><i>seconds</i>
           Fail if the lock cannot be acquired within <i>seconds</i>. Decimal
           fractional values are allowed. See the <b>-E </b>option for the exit
           status used. The zero number of <i>seconds</i> is interpreted as
           <b>--nonblock</b>.

       <b>--fcntl</b>
           Instead of flock(2), apply an fcntl(2) open file description
           lock (that is, using the F_OFD_SETLK (non-blocking) or
           F_OFD_SETLKW (blocking) commands). These locks are
           independent of those applied via flock(2), but, unlike
           traditional POSIX fcntl() locks (F_SETLK, F_SETLKW), have
           semantics matching those of flock(2).

       This is only available on kernel versions &gt;= 3.15.

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Report how long it took to acquire the lock, or why the lock
           could not be obtained.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The command uses &lt;sysexits.h&gt; exit status values for everything,
       except when using either of the options <b>-n </b>or <b>-w </b>which report a
       failure to acquire the lock with an exit status given by the <b>-E</b>
       option, or 1 by default. The exit status given by <b>-E </b>has to be in
       the range of 0 to 255.

       When using the <i>command</i> variant, and executing the child worked,
       then the exit status is that of the child command.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>flock </b>does not detect deadlock. See <a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock(2)</a> for details.

       Some file systems (e. g. NFS and CIFS) have a limited
       implementation of <a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock(2)</a> and flock may always fail. For details
       see <a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock(2)</a>, <a href="../man5/nfs.5.html">nfs(5)</a> and <b>mount.cifs</b>(8). Depending on mount
       options, flock can always fail there.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that "shell&gt; " in examples is a command line prompt.

       shell1&gt; flock /tmp -c cat; shell2&gt; flock -w .007 /tmp -c echo;
       /bin/echo $?
           Set exclusive lock to directory <i>/tmp</i> and the second command
           will fail.

       shell1&gt; flock -s /tmp -c cat; shell2&gt; flock -s -w .007 /tmp -c
       echo; /bin/echo $?
           Set shared lock to directory <i>/tmp</i> and the second command will
           not fail. Notice that attempting to get exclusive lock with
           second command would fail.

       shell&gt; flock -x local-lock-file echo 'a b c'
           Grab the exclusive lock "local-lock-file" before running echo
           with 'a b c'.

       (; flock -n 9 || exit 1; # ... commands executed under lock ...;
       ) 9&gt;/var/lock/mylockfile
           The form is convenient inside shell scripts. The mode used to
           open the file doesn’t matter to <b>flock</b>; using <i>&gt;</i> or <i>&gt;&gt;</i> allows
           the lockfile to be created if it does not already exist,
           however, write permission is required. Using <i>&lt;</i> requires that
           the file already exists but only read permission is required.

       [ "${FLOCKER}" != "$0" ] &amp;&amp; exec env FLOCKER="$0" flock -en "$0"
       "$0" "$@" || :
           This is useful boilerplate code for shell scripts. Put it at
           the top of the shell script you want to lock and it’ll
           automatically lock itself on the first run. If the
           environment variable <b>$FLOCKER </b>is not set to the shell script
           that is being run, then execute <b>flock </b>and grab an exclusive
           non-blocking lock (using the script itself as the lock file)
           before re-execing itself with the right arguments. It also
           sets the <b>FLOCKER </b>environment variable to the right value so
           it doesn’t run again.

       shell&gt; exec 4&lt;&gt;/var/lock/mylockfile; shell&gt; flock -n 4
           This form is convenient for locking a file without spawning a
           subprocess. The shell opens the lock file for reading and
           writing as file descriptor 4, then <b>flock </b>is used to lock the
           descriptor.
