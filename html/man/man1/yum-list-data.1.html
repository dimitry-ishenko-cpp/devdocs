NAME </h2>
<pre>
       yum list data plugin
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum </b>[options] [command] [package ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This plugin extends <b>yum </b>for some commands that give aggregate
       package data based on lists of packages

       added yum <i>command</i>s are:
        * list-vendors
        * info-vendors
        * list-rpm-groups
        * info-rpm-groups
        * list-packagers
        * info-packagers
        * list-licenses
        * info-licenses
        * list-arches
        * info-arches
        * list-committers
        * info-committers
        * list-buildhosts
        * info-buildhosts
        * list-baseurls
        * info-baseurls
        * list-package-sizes
        * info-package-sizes
        * list-archive-sizes
        * info-archive-sizes
        * list-installed-sizes
        * info-installed-sizes
        * list-groups
        * info-groups

       all of which take the same arguments as the list and info yum
       commands. The difference between the list and info varieties is
       that the info versions lists all the packages under each
       aggregation.
