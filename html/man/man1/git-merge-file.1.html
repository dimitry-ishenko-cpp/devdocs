NAME </h2>

       git-merge-file - Run a three-way file merge
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git merge-file</i> [-L &lt;current-name&gt; [-L &lt;base-name&gt; [-L &lt;other-name&gt;]]]
               [--ours|--theirs|--union] [-p|--stdout] [-q|--quiet] [--marker-size=&lt;n&gt;]
               [--[no-]diff3] [--object-id] &lt;current&gt; &lt;base&gt; &lt;other&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Given three files <b>&lt;current&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;base&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;other&gt;</b>, <i>git merge-file</i>
       incorporates all changes that lead from <b>&lt;base&gt; </b>to <b>&lt;other&gt; </b>into
       <b>&lt;current&gt;</b>. The result ordinarily goes into <b>&lt;current&gt;</b>. <i>git</i>
       <i>merge-file</i> is useful for combining separate changes to an
       original. Suppose <b>&lt;base&gt; </b>is the original, and both <b>&lt;current&gt; </b>and
       <b>&lt;other&gt; </b>are modifications of <b>&lt;base&gt;</b>, then <i>git merge-file</i> combines
       both changes.

       A conflict occurs if both <b>&lt;current&gt; </b>and <b>&lt;other&gt; </b>have changes in a
       common segment of lines. If a conflict is found, <i>git merge-file</i>
       normally outputs a warning and brackets the conflict with lines
       containing &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; markers. A typical conflict will
       look like this:

           &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; A
           lines in file A
           =======
           lines in file B
           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; B

       If there are conflicts, the user should edit the result and
       delete one of the alternatives. When <b>--ours</b>, <b>--theirs</b>, or <b>--union</b>
       option is in effect, however, these conflicts are resolved
       favouring lines from <b>&lt;current&gt;</b>, lines from <b>&lt;other&gt;</b>, or lines from
       both respectively. The length of the conflict markers can be
       given with the <b>--marker-size </b>option.

       If <b>--object-id </b>is specified, exactly the same behavior occurs,
       except that instead of specifying what to merge as files, it is
       specified as a list of object IDs referring to blobs.

       The exit value of this program is negative on error, and the
       number of conflicts otherwise (truncated to 127 if there are more
       than that many conflicts). If the merge was clean, the exit value
       is 0.

       <i>git merge-file</i> is designed to be a minimal clone of RCS <i>merge</i>;
       that is, it implements all of RCS <i>merge</i>'s functionality which is
       needed by <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --object-id
           Specify the contents to merge as blobs in the current
           repository instead of files. In this case, the operation must
           take place within a valid repository.

           If the <b>-p </b>option is specified, the merged file (including
           conflicts, if any) goes to standard output as normal;
           otherwise, the merged file is written to the object store and
           the object ID of its blob is written to standard output.

       -L &lt;label&gt;
           This option may be given up to three times, and specifies
           labels to be used in place of the corresponding file names in
           conflict reports. That is, <b>git merge-file -L x -L y -L z a b</b>
           <b>c </b>generates output that looks like it came from files x, y
           and z instead of from files a, b and c.

       -p
           Send results to standard output instead of overwriting
           <b>&lt;current&gt;</b>.

       -q
           Quiet; do not warn about conflicts.

       --diff3
           Show conflicts in "diff3" style.

       --zdiff3
           Show conflicts in "zdiff3" style.

       --ours, --theirs, --union
           Instead of leaving conflicts in the file, resolve conflicts
           favouring our (or their or both) side of the lines.

       --diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}
           Use a different diff algorithm while merging. The current
           default is "myers", but selecting more recent algorithm such
           as "histogram" can help avoid mismerges that occur due to
           unimportant matching lines (such as braces from distinct
           functions). See also <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> <b>--diff-algorithm</b>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git merge-file README.my README README.upstream</b>
           combines the changes of README.my and README.upstream since
           README, tries to merge them and writes the result into
           README.my.

       <b>git merge-file -L a -L b -L c tmp/a123 tmp/b234 tmp/c345</b>
           merges tmp/a123 and tmp/c345 with the base tmp/b234, but uses
           labels <b>a </b>and <b>c </b>instead of <b>tmp/a123 </b>and <b>tmp/c345</b>.

       <b>git merge-file -p --object-id abc1234 def567 890abcd</b>
           combines the changes of the blob abc1234 and 890abcd since
           def567, tries to merge them and writes the result to standard
           output
