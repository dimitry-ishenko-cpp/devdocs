NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-merge-index - Run a merge for files needing merging
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git merge-index</i> [-o] [-q] &lt;merge-program&gt; (-a | ( [--] &lt;file&gt;...) )
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This looks up the &lt;file&gt;(s) in the index and, if there are any
       merge entries, passes the SHA-1 hash for those files as arguments
       1, 2, 3 (empty argument if no file), and &lt;file&gt; as argument 4.
       File modes for the three files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and
       7.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       -a
           Run merge against all files in the index that need merging.

       -o
           Instead of stopping at the first failed merge, do all of them
           in one shot - continue with merging even when previous merges
           returned errors, and only return the error code after all the
           merges.

       -q
           Do not complain about a failed merge program (a merge program
           failure usually indicates conflicts during the merge). This
           is for porcelains which might want to emit custom messages.

       If <i>git merge-index</i> is called with multiple &lt;file&gt;s (or -a) then
       it processes them in turn only stopping if merge returns a
       non-zero exit code.

       Typically this is run with a script calling Git’s imitation of
       the <i>merge</i> command from the RCS package.

       A sample script called <i>git merge-one-file</i> is included in the
       distribution.

       ALERT ALERT ALERT! The Git "merge object order" is different from
       the RCS <i>merge</i> program merge object order. In the above ordering,
       the original is first. But the argument order to the 3-way merge
       program <i>merge</i> is to have the original in the middle. Don’t ask me
       why.

       Examples:

           torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test&gt; git merge-index cat MM
           This is MM from the original tree.              # original
           This is modified MM in the branch A.            # merge1
           This is modified MM in the branch B.            # merge2
           This is modified MM in the branch B.            # current contents

       or

           torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test&gt; git merge-index cat AA MM
           cat: : No such file or directory
           This is added AA in the branch A.
           This is added AA in the branch B.
           This is added AA in the branch B.
           fatal: merge program failed

       where the latter example shows how <i>git merge-index</i> will stop
       trying to merge once anything has returned an error (i.e., <b>cat</b>
       returned an error for the AA file, because it didn’t exist in the
       original, and thus <i>git merge-index</i> didn’t even try to merge the
       MM thing).
