NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdagfs2 </b>- Global Filesystem v2 (GFS2) PMDA
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdagfs2 </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metric values about mounted GFS2 filesystems from the
       debugfs filesystem.  This PMDA requires debugfs along with at
       least one mounted GFS2 filesystem to be mounted in order to be
       able to provide metric data.

       This PMDA can be used with GFS2 filesystems which are both
       mounted as local filesystems and filesystems which are  mounted
       as shared storage within a clustered environment. However there
       are some metrics which specifically require GFS2 to be setup in a
       clustered environment to be able to provide metric data. This is
       due to them expecting locking messages to be passed via the
       distributed lock manager (DLM) between nodes of a cluster in
       order to generate their output.

       These cluster-environment-only metrics can be distinguished by
       the inclusion of their corresponding control metrics so that they
       can be optionally enabled or disabled on systems where they are
       not desired to be monitored or not supported.

       <a href="../man3/pmstore.3.html">pmstore(3)</a> can be used to assign values to these control metrics
       in order to enable (1) or disable (0) them.  This mechanism is
       also useful on distributions that do not currently have full
       support for the GFS2 trace-points or provide older versions of
       the GFS2 driver.

INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       Install the GFS2 PMDA by using the Install script as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, do the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdagfs2 </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <b>pmcd </b>when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2/help</b>
           default help text file for the GFS2 metrics

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2/Install</b>
           installation script for the <b>pmdagfs2 </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/gfs2/Remove</b>
           undo installation script for the <b>pmdagfs2 </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/gfs2.log</b>
           default log file for error messages from <b>pmdagfs2</b>
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by <b>PCP</b>. On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
