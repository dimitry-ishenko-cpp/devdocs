NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-series - track changes to a patch series with git
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git series </b>[<i>SUBCOMMAND</i>] [<i>OPTIONS</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git series </b>tracks changes to a patch series over time.  <b>git</b>
       <b>series </b>also tracks a cover letter for the patch series, formats
       the series for email, and prepares pull requests.

       Use <b>git series start </b><i>seriesname</i> to start a patch series
       <i>seriesname</i>.  Use normal <b>git </b>commands to commit changes, and use
       <b>git series status </b>to check what has changed.  Use <b>git series</b>
       <b>cover </b>to add or edit a cover letter.  Use <b>git series add </b>and <b>git</b>
       <b>series commit </b>(or <b>git series commit -a</b>) to commit changes to the
       patch series.  Use <b>git series rebase -i </b>to help rework or
       reorganize the patch series.  Use <b>git series format </b>to prepare
       the patch series to send via email, or <b>git series req </b>to prepare
       a "please pull" mail.

       Running <b>git series </b>without arguments shows the list of patch
       series, marking the current patch series with a '*'.
</pre> <h2>
SUBCOMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git series add </b><i>change</i>...
              Add changes to the staging area for the next <b>git series</b>
              <b>commit</b>.

              <i>change</i>...
                     Changes to add: any combination of "series",
                     "base", and "cover".

       <b>git series base </b>[<b>-d</b>|<b>--delete</b>] [<i>base</i>]
              Get or set the base commit for the patch series.  With no
              parameters, print the hash of the base commit.  With
              parameters, set or delete the base commit.

              This only changes the base in the working version of the
              patch series; use <b>git series add base </b>to add that change
              to the next <b>git series commit</b>, or use <b>git series commit -a</b>
              to commit the new base and all other changes to the series
              in one step.

              <i>base</i>   New base commit.  This can use a commit hash, ref
                     name, or special syntaxes such as refname^ or
                     refname~2.

              <b>-d</b>|<b>--delete</b>
                     Delete the current base commit.

       <b>git series checkout </b><i>name</i>
              Resume work on the patch series <i>name</i>; check out the
              current version as HEAD.

       <b>git series commit </b>[<b>-a</b>|<b>--all</b>] [<b>-m </b><i>message</i>] [<b>-v</b>|<b>--verbose</b>]
              Record a new version of the patch series.  Without
              arguments, this will run an editor to edit a commit
              message, and then commit the changes previously added with
              <b>git series add</b>.

              <b>-a</b>|<b>--all</b>
                     Commit all changes, not just those added with <b>git</b>
                     <b>series add</b>.

              <b>-m </b><i>message</i>
                     Use <i>message</i> as the commit message, rather than
                     running an editor.

              <b>-v</b>|<b>--verbose</b>
                     Show a diff of the commit in the editor, below the
                     commit message, as a reminder of the changes in the
                     commit.  This diff will not appear in the commit
                     message.

       <b>git series cover </b>[<b>-d</b>|<b>--delete</b>]
              Create or edit the cover letter for the patch series.
              Without arguments, this will run an editor to edit the
              cover letter.

              This only changes the cover letter in the working version
              of the patch series; use <b>git series add cover </b>to add that
              change to the next <b>git series commit</b>, or use <b>git series</b>
              <b>commit -a </b>to commit the new cover letter and all other
              changes to the series in one step.

              <b>-d</b>|<b>--delete</b>
                     Delete the cover letter rather than editing it.

       <b>git series cp </b>[<i>source</i>] <i>dest</i>
              Copy the series <i>source</i> to <i>dest</i>, including any work in
              progress, staged or unstaged.  <i>source</i> defaults to the
              current series if omitted.

       <b>git series delete </b><i>name</i>
              Delete the series <i>name</i>, including any work in progress,
              staged or unstaged.

       <b>git series detach</b>
              Stop working on any patch series.  Any changes in
              progress, staged or unstaged, will remain intact.  To
              start working on the branch again, use <b>git series</b>
              <b>checkout</b>.

       <b>git series diff</b>
              Show changes to the patch series from the current working
              version to the staged version.  Changes to the cover
              letter appear as standard text diffs.  If both the old and
              new version contain base and series entries, <b>git series</b>
              <b>diff </b>will find and show the correspondence between the old
              and new versions of each commit.  The series diff format
              shows reordered commits, deleted or added commits, and
              modified commits.  For modified commits, the series diff
              includes a simplified interdiff between the commits.

       <b>git series format </b>[<b>--in-reply-to=</b><i>Message-Id</i>] [<b>--no-from</b>] [<b>-v </b><i>N</i> |
       <b>--reroll-count=</b><i>N</i>] [<b>--rfc</b>] [<b>--stdout</b>] [<b>--subject-prefix=</b><i>prefix</i>]
              Prepare the patch series to send via email.  This creates
              one file per patch in the series, plus one additional file
              for the cover letter if any.  The patch series must have a
              base set with <b>git series base</b>, to identify the series of
              patches to format.

              Each file contains one email in mbox format, ready to
              send, with email headers threading all the patches
              together.  If the series has a cover letter, all of the
              patches will include headers to make them a reply to the
              cover letter; otherwise, all of the patches will include
              headers to make them a reply to the first patch.

              <b>--in-reply-to=</b><i>Message-Id</i>
                     Make the first mail a reply to the specified
                     Message-Id.  The Message-Id may include or omit the
                     surrounding angle brackets; git-series will add
                     them if not present.

              <b>--no-from</b>
                     By default, <b>git series format </b>includes a "From:"
                     line in the mail body for the commit author when
                     formatting commits you didn't write; this allows
                     you to send the patches as emails from your own
                     address while preserving authorship information for
                     each patch.  <b>git series format --no-from </b>will
                     instead use the commit author as the "From:"
                     address for each patch mail.  Use this when
                     producing patch files for purposes other than
                     email.

              <b>-v </b><i>N</i> | <b>--reroll-count=</b><i>N</i>
                     Mark the patch series as PATCH v<i>N</i>.  The patch
                     filenames and mail subjects will include the
                     version number.

              <b>--rfc  </b>Use [RFC PATCH] instead of the standard [PATCH]
                     prefix.

              <b>--stdout</b>
                     Write the entire patch series to stdout rather than
                     to separate patch files.

              <b>--subject-prefix=</b><i>prefix</i>
                     Use [<i>prefix</i>] instead of the standard [PATCH]
                     prefix.

       <b>git series help </b>[<i>subcommand</i>]
              Show help for <b>git series </b>or a subcommand.  Without
              arguments, shows a summary of the subcommands supported by
              <b>git series</b>.

              <i>subcommand</i>
                     Show help for <i>subcommand</i>.

       <b>git series log </b>[<b>-p</b>|<b>--patch</b>]
              Show the history of the patch series.

              <b>-p</b>|<b>--patch</b>
                     Include a patch for each change committed to the
                     series.  This uses the same series diff format as
                     <b>git series diff</b>.

       <b>git series mv </b>[<i>source</i>] <i>dest</i>
              Move (rename) the series <i>source</i> to <i>dest</i>, including any
              work in progress, staged or unstaged.  <i>source</i> defaults to
              the current series if omitted.  Moving the current series
              will make the destination the current series.

              You can also invoke this as <b>git series rename</b>.

       <b>git series rebase </b>[<b>-i</b>|<b>--interactive</b>] [<i>onto</i>]
              Rebase the patch series, either onto a new base,
              interactively, or both.  The patch series must have a base
              set with <b>git series base</b>, to identify the series of
              patches to rebase.

              <i>onto</i>   Commit to rebase the series onto.  This can use a
                     commit hash, ref name, or special syntaxes such as
                     refname^ or refname~2.

              <b>-i</b>|<b>--interactive</b>
                     Interactively edit the list of commits.  This uses
                     the same format and syntax as <b>git rebase -i</b>, to
                     allow reordering, dropping, combining, or editing
                     commits.

       <b>git series req </b>[<b>-p</b>|<b>--patch</b>] <i>url tag</i>
              Generate a mail requesting a pull of the patch series.

              Before running this command, push the patch series to the
              repository at <i>url</i>, as a tag or branch named <i>tag</i>.

              A pull request for a signed or annotated tag will include
              the message from the tag.  The pull request will also
              include the cover letter if any, unless the tag message
              already contains the cover letter.  The subject of the
              mail will include the first line from the cover letter, or
              the name of the series if no cover letter.

              The patch series must have a base set with <b>git series</b>
              <b>base</b>, to identify the series of patches to request a pull
              of.

              <i>url</i>    URL of the repository to pull from.

              <i>tag</i>    Name of a tag or branch to request a pull from.

              <b>-p</b>|<b>--patch</b>
                     Include a patch showing the combined change made by
                     all the patches in the series.  This can help a
                     reviewer see the effect of pulling the series.

       <b>git series start </b><i>name</i>
              Start a new patch series named <i>name</i>.

       <b>git series status</b>
              Show the status of the current patch series.

              This shows any changes staged for the next <b>git series</b>
              <b>commit</b>, changes in the current working copy but not staged
              for the next <b>git series commit</b>, and hints about the next
              commands to run.

       <b>git series unadd </b><i>change</i>
              Remove changes from the next <b>git series commit</b>, undoing
              <b>git series add</b>.

              The changes remain in the current working version of the
              series.

              <i>change</i>...
                     Changes to remove: any combination of "series",
                     "base", and "cover".
