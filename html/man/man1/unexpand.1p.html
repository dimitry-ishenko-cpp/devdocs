NAME </h2>
<pre>
       unexpand — convert spaces to tabs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       unexpand <b>[</b>-a|-t <i>tablist</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>unexpand</i> utility shall copy files or standard input to
       standard output, converting &lt;blank&gt; characters at the beginning
       of each line into the maximum number of &lt;tab&gt; characters followed
       by the minimum number of &lt;space&gt; characters needed to fill the
       same column positions originally filled by the translated &lt;blank&gt;
       characters. By default, tabstops shall be set at every eighth
       column position. Each &lt;backspace&gt; shall be copied to the output,
       and shall cause the column position count for tab calculations to
       be decremented; the count shall never be decremented to a value
       less than one.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>unexpand</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a        </b>In addition to translating &lt;blank&gt; characters at the
                 beginning of each line, translate all sequences of two
                 or more &lt;blank&gt; characters immediately preceding a tab
                 stop to the maximum number of &lt;tab&gt; characters followed
                 by the minimum number of &lt;space&gt; characters needed to
                 fill the same column positions originally filled by the
                 translated &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       <b>-t </b><i>tablist</i>
                 Specify the tab stops. The application shall ensure
                 that the <i>tablist</i> option-argument is a single argument
                 consisting of a single positive decimal integer or
                 multiple positive decimal integers, separated by
                 &lt;blank&gt; or &lt;comma&gt; characters, in ascending order. If a
                 single number is given, tabs shall be set <i>tablist</i>
                 column positions apart instead of the default 8. If
                 multiple numbers are given, the tabs shall be set at
                 those specific column positions.

                 The application shall ensure that each tab-stop
                 position <i>N</i> is an integer value greater than zero, and
                 the list shall be in strictly ascending order. This is
                 taken to mean that, from the start of a line of output,
                 tabbing to position <i>N</i> shall cause the next character
                 output to be in the (<i>N</i>+1)th column position on that
                 line. When the <b>-t </b>option is not specified, the default
                 shall be the equivalent of specifying <b>-t 8 </b>(except for
                 the interaction with <b>-a</b>, described below).

                 No &lt;space&gt;-to-&lt;tab&gt; conversions shall occur for
                 characters at positions beyond the last of those
                 specified in a multiple tab-stop list.

                 When <b>-t </b>is specified, the presence or absence of the <b>-a</b>
                 option shall be ignored; conversion shall not be
                 limited to the processing of leading &lt;blank&gt;
                 characters.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a text file to be used as input.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       See the INPUT FILES section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be text files.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>unexpand</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files), the
                 processing of &lt;tab&gt; and &lt;space&gt; characters, and for the
                 determination of the width in column positions each
                 character would occupy on an output device.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       One non-intuitive aspect of <i>unexpand</i> is its restriction to
       leading &lt;space&gt; characters when neither <b>-a </b>nor <b>-t </b>is specified.
       Users who always want to convert all &lt;space&gt; characters in a file
       can easily alias <i>unexpand</i> to use the <b>-a </b>or <b>-t 8 </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       On several occasions, consideration was given to adding a <b>-t</b>
       option to the <i>unexpand</i> utility to complement the <b>-t </b>in <i>expand</i>
       (see <a href="expand.1p.html">expand(1p)</a>).  The historical intent of <i>unexpand</i> was to
       translate multiple &lt;blank&gt; characters into tab stops, where tab
       stops were a multiple of eight column positions on most UNIX
       systems. An early proposal omitted <b>-t </b>because it seemed outside
       the scope of the User Portability Utilities option; it was not
       described in any of the base documents for IEEE Std 1003.2‐1992.
       However, hard-coding tab stops every eight columns was not
       suitable for the international community and broke historical
       precedents for some vendors in the FORTRAN community, so <b>-t </b>was
       restored in conjunction with the list of valid extension
       categories considered by the standard developers. Thus, <i>unexpand</i>
       is now the logical converse of <i>expand</i>.
