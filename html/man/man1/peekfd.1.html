NAME </h2>
<pre>
       peekfd - peek at file descriptors of running processes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>peekfd </b>[<b>-8</b>,<b>--eight-bit-clean</b>] [<b>-n</b>,<b>--no-headers</b>] [<b>-c</b>,<b>--follow</b>]
       [<b>-d</b>,<b>--duplicates-removed</b>] [<b>-V</b>,<b>--version</b>] [<b>-h</b>,<b>--help</b>] <i>pid</i> [<i>fd</i>]
       [<i>fd</i>] ...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>peekfd </b>attaches to a running process and intercepts all reads and
       writes to file descriptors.  You can specify the desired file
       descriptor numbers or dump all of them.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -8     Do no post-processing on the bytes being read or written.

       -n     Do not display headers indicating the source of the bytes
              dumped.

       -c     Also dump the requested file descriptor activity in any
              new child processes that are created.

       -d     Remove duplicate read/writes from the output.  If you're
              looking at a tty with echo, you might want this.

       -v     Display a version string.

       -h     Display a help message.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/proc/</b><i>*</i><b>/fd</b>
              Not used but useful for the user to look at to get good
              file descriptor numbers.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

       <b>Error attaching to pid </b><i>&lt;PID&gt;</i>
              An unknown error occurred while attempted to attach to a
              process, you may need to be root.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Probably lots.  Don't be surprised if the process you are
       monitoring dies.
