NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-status - Show the working tree status
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git status</i> [&lt;options&gt;] [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Displays paths that have differences between the index file and
       the current HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the
       working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree
       that are not tracked by Git (and are not ignored by
       <a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore(5)</a>). The first are what you <i>would</i> commit by running <b>git</b>
       <b>commit</b>; the second and third are what you <i>could</i> commit by running
       <i>git add</i> before running <b>git commit</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -s, --short
           Give the output in the short-format.

       -b, --branch
           Show the branch and tracking info even in short-format.

       --show-stash
           Show the number of entries currently stashed away.

       --porcelain[=&lt;version&gt;]
           Give the output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts. This
           is similar to the short output, but will remain stable across
           Git versions and regardless of user configuration. See below
           for details.

           The version parameter is used to specify the format version.
           This is optional and defaults to the original version <i>v1</i>
           format.

       --long
           Give the output in the long-format. This is the default.

       -v, --verbose
           In addition to the names of files that have been changed,
           also show the textual changes that are staged to be committed
           (i.e., like the output of <b>git diff --cached</b>). If <b>-v </b>is
           specified twice, then also show the changes in the working
           tree that have not yet been staged (i.e., like the output of
           <b>git diff</b>).

       -u[&lt;mode&gt;], --untracked-files[=&lt;mode&gt;]
           Show untracked files.

           The mode parameter is used to specify the handling of
           untracked files. It is optional: it defaults to <i>all</i>, and if
           specified, it must be stuck to the option (e.g.  <b>-uno</b>, but
           not <b>-u no</b>).

           The possible options are:

           •   <i>no</i> - Show no untracked files.

           •   <i>normal</i> - Shows untracked files and directories.

           •   <i>all</i> - Also shows individual files in untracked
               directories.

           When <b>-u </b>option is not used, untracked files and directories
           are shown (i.e. the same as specifying <b>normal</b>), to help you
           avoid forgetting to add newly created files. Because it takes
           extra work to find untracked files in the filesystem, this
           mode may take some time in a large working tree. Consider
           enabling untracked cache and split index if supported (see
           <b>git update-index --untracked-cache </b>and <b>git update-index</b>
           <b>--split-index</b>), Otherwise you can use <b>no </b>to have <b>git status</b>
           return more quickly without showing untracked files. All
           usual spellings for Boolean value <b>true </b>are taken as <b>normal</b>
           and <b>false </b>as <b>no</b>.

           The default can be changed using the
           status.showUntrackedFiles configuration variable documented
           in <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>.

       --ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]
           Ignore changes to submodules when looking for changes. &lt;when&gt;
           can be either "none", "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is
           the default. Using "none" will consider the submodule
           modified when it either contains untracked or modified files
           or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in the
           superproject and can be used to override any settings of the
           <i>ignore</i> option in <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> or <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a>. When
           "untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when
           they only contain untracked content (but they are still
           scanned for modified content). Using "dirty" ignores all
           changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the
           commits stored in the superproject are shown (this was the
           behavior before 1.7.0). Using "all" hides all changes to
           submodules (and suppresses the output of submodule summaries
           when the config option <b>status.submoduleSummary </b>is set).

       --ignored[=&lt;mode&gt;]
           Show ignored files as well.

           The mode parameter is used to specify the handling of ignored
           files. It is optional: it defaults to <i>traditional</i>.

           The possible options are:

           •   <i>traditional</i> - Shows ignored files and directories, unless
               --untracked-files=all is specified, in which case
               individual files in ignored directories are displayed.

           •   <i>no</i> - Show no ignored files.

           •   <i>matching</i> - Shows ignored files and directories matching
               an ignore pattern.

           When <i>matching</i> mode is specified, paths that explicitly match
           an ignored pattern are shown. If a directory matches an
           ignore pattern, then it is shown, but not paths contained in
           the ignored directory. If a directory does not match an
           ignore pattern, but all contents are ignored, then the
           directory is not shown, but all contents are shown.

       -z
           Terminate entries with NUL, instead of LF. This implies the
           <b>--porcelain=v1 </b>output format if no other format is given.

       --column[=&lt;options&gt;], --no-column
           Display untracked files in columns. See configuration
           variable <b>column.status </b>for option syntax.  <b>--column </b>and
           <b>--no-column </b>without options are equivalent to <i>always</i> and
           <i>never</i> respectively.

       --ahead-behind, --no-ahead-behind
           Display or do not display detailed ahead/behind counts for
           the branch relative to its upstream branch. Defaults to true.

       --renames, --no-renames
           Turn on/off rename detection regardless of user
           configuration. See also <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> <b>--no-renames</b>.

       --find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]
           Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity
           threshold. See also <a href="git-diff.1.html">git-diff(1)</a> <b>--find-renames</b>.

       &lt;pathspec&gt;...
           See the <i>pathspec</i> entry in <a href="../man7/gitglossary.7.html">gitglossary(7)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       The output from this command is designed to be used as a commit
       template comment. The default, long format, is designed to be
       human readable, verbose and descriptive. Its contents and format
       are subject to change at any time.

       The paths mentioned in the output, unlike many other Git
       commands, are made relative to the current directory if you are
       working in a subdirectory (this is on purpose, to help cutting
       and pasting). See the status.relativePaths config option below.

   <b>Short Format</b>
       In the short-format, the status of each path is shown as one of
       these forms

           XY PATH
           XY ORIG_PATH -&gt; PATH

       where <b>ORIG_PATH </b>is where the renamed/copied contents came from.
       <b>ORIG_PATH </b>is only shown when the entry is renamed or copied. The
       <b>XY </b>is a two-letter status code.

       The fields (including the <b>-&gt;</b>) are separated from each other by a
       single space. If a filename contains whitespace or other
       nonprintable characters, that field will be quoted in the manner
       of a C string literal: surrounded by ASCII double quote (34)
       characters, and with interior special characters
       backslash-escaped.

       There are three different types of states that are shown using
       this format, and each one uses the <b>XY </b>syntax differently:

       •   When a merge is occurring and the merge was successful, or
           outside of a merge situation, <b>X </b>shows the status of the index
           and <b>Y </b>shows the status of the working tree.

       •   When a merge conflict has occurred and has not yet been
           resolved, <b>X </b>and <b>Y </b>show the state introduced by each head of
           the merge, relative to the common ancestor. These paths are
           said to be <i>unmerged</i>.

       •   When a path is untracked, <b>X </b>and <b>Y </b>are always the same, since
           they are unknown to the index.  <b>??  </b>is used for untracked
           paths. Ignored files are not listed unless <b>--ignored </b>is used;
           if it is, ignored files are indicated by <b>!!</b>.

       Note that the term <i>merge</i> here also includes rebases using the
       default <b>--merge </b>strategy, cherry-picks, and anything else using
       the merge machinery.

       In the following table, these three classes are shown in separate
       sections, and these characters are used for <b>X </b>and <b>Y </b>fields for
       the first two sections that show tracked paths:

       •   ' ' = unmodified

       •   <i>M</i> = modified

       •   <i>T</i> = file type changed (regular file, symbolic link or
           submodule)

       •   <i>A</i> = added

       •   <i>D</i> = deleted

       •   <i>R</i> = renamed

       •   <i>C</i> = copied (if config option status.renames is set to
           "copies")

       •   <i>U</i> = updated but unmerged

           X          Y     Meaning
           -------------------------------------------------
                    [AMD]   not updated
           M        [ MTD]  updated in index
           T        [ MTD]  type changed in index
           A        [ MTD]  added to index
           D                deleted from index
           R        [ MTD]  renamed in index
           C        [ MTD]  copied in index
           [MTARC]          index and work tree matches
           [ MTARC]    M    work tree changed since index
           [ MTARC]    T    type changed in work tree since index
           [ MTARC]    D    deleted in work tree
                       R    renamed in work tree
                       C    copied in work tree
           -------------------------------------------------
           D           D    unmerged, both deleted
           A           U    unmerged, added by us
           U           D    unmerged, deleted by them
           U           A    unmerged, added by them
           D           U    unmerged, deleted by us
           A           A    unmerged, both added
           U           U    unmerged, both modified
           -------------------------------------------------
           ?           ?    untracked
           !           !    ignored
           -------------------------------------------------

       Submodules have more state and instead report

       •   <i>M</i> = the submodule has a different HEAD than recorded in the
           index

       •   <i>m</i> = the submodule has modified content

       •   <i>?</i>  = the submodule has untracked files

       This is since modified content or untracked files in a submodule
       cannot be added via <b>git add </b>in the superproject to prepare a
       commit.

       <i>m</i> and <i>?</i> are applied recursively. For example if a nested
       submodule in a submodule contains an untracked file, this is
       reported as <i>?</i> as well.

       If -b is used the short-format status is preceded by a line

           ## branchname tracking info

   <b>Porcelain Format Version 1</b>
       Version 1 porcelain format is similar to the short format, but is
       guaranteed not to change in a backwards-incompatible way between
       Git versions or based on user configuration. This makes it ideal
       for parsing by scripts. The description of the short format above
       also describes the porcelain format, with a few exceptions:

        1. The user’s color.status configuration is not respected; color
           will always be off.

        2. The user’s status.relativePaths configuration is not
           respected; paths shown will always be relative to the
           repository root.

       There is also an alternate -z format recommended for machine
       parsing. In that format, the status field is the same, but some
       other things change. First, the <i>-&gt;</i> is omitted from rename entries
       and the field order is reversed (e.g <i>from -&gt; to</i> becomes <i>to from</i>).
       Second, a NUL (ASCII 0) follows each filename, replacing space as
       a field separator and the terminating newline (but a space still
       separates the status field from the first filename). Third,
       filenames containing special characters are not specially
       formatted; no quoting or backslash-escaping is performed.

       Any submodule changes are reported as modified <b>M </b>instead of <b>m </b>or
       single <b>?</b>.

   <b>Porcelain Format Version 2</b>
       Version 2 format adds more detailed information about the state
       of the worktree and changed items. Version 2 also defines an
       extensible set of easy to parse optional headers.

       Header lines start with "#" and are added in response to specific
       command line arguments. Parsers should ignore headers they don’t
       recognize.

       <b>Branch Headers</b>

           If <b>--branch </b>is given, a series of header lines are printed
           with information about the current branch.

               Line                                     Notes
               ------------------------------------------------------------
               # branch.oid &lt;commit&gt; | (initial)        Current commit.
               # branch.head &lt;branch&gt; | (detached)      Current branch.
               # branch.upstream &lt;upstream-branch&gt;      If upstream is set.
               # branch.ab +&lt;ahead&gt; -&lt;behind&gt;           If upstream is set and
                                                        the commit is present.
               ------------------------------------------------------------

       <b>Stash Information</b>

           If <b>--show-stash </b>is given, one line is printed showing the
           number of stash entries if non-zero:

               # stash &lt;N&gt;

       <b>Changed Tracked Entries</b>

           Following the headers, a series of lines are printed for
           tracked entries. One of three different line formats may be
           used to describe an entry depending on the type of change.
           Tracked entries are printed in an undefined order; parsers
           should allow for a mixture of the 3 line types in any order.

           Ordinary changed entries have the following format:

               1 &lt;XY&gt; &lt;sub&gt; &lt;mH&gt; &lt;mI&gt; &lt;mW&gt; &lt;hH&gt; &lt;hI&gt; &lt;path&gt;

           Renamed or copied entries have the following format:

               2 &lt;XY&gt; &lt;sub&gt; &lt;mH&gt; &lt;mI&gt; &lt;mW&gt; &lt;hH&gt; &lt;hI&gt; &lt;X&gt;&lt;score&gt; &lt;path&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;origPath&gt;

               Field       Meaning
               --------------------------------------------------------
               &lt;XY&gt;        A 2 character field containing the staged and
                           unstaged XY values described in the short format,
                           with unchanged indicated by a "." rather than
                           a space.
               &lt;sub&gt;       A 4 character field describing the submodule state.
                           "N..." when the entry is not a submodule.
                           "S&lt;c&gt;&lt;m&gt;&lt;u&gt;" when the entry is a submodule.
                           &lt;c&gt; is "C" if the commit changed; otherwise ".".
                           &lt;m&gt; is "M" if it has tracked changes; otherwise ".".
                           &lt;u&gt; is "U" if there are untracked changes; otherwise ".".
               &lt;mH&gt;        The octal file mode in HEAD.
               &lt;mI&gt;        The octal file mode in the index.
               &lt;mW&gt;        The octal file mode in the worktree.
               &lt;hH&gt;        The object name in HEAD.
               &lt;hI&gt;        The object name in the index.
               &lt;X&gt;&lt;score&gt;  The rename or copy score (denoting the percentage
                           of similarity between the source and target of the
                           move or copy). For example "R100" or "C75".
               &lt;path&gt;      The pathname.  In a renamed/copied entry, this
                           is the target path.
               &lt;sep&gt;       When the `-z` option is used, the 2 pathnames are separated
                           with a NUL (ASCII 0x00) byte; otherwise, a tab (ASCII 0x09)
                           byte separates them.
               &lt;origPath&gt;  The pathname in the commit at HEAD or in the index.
                           This is only present in a renamed/copied entry, and
                           tells where the renamed/copied contents came from.
               --------------------------------------------------------

           Unmerged entries have the following format; the first
           character is a "u" to distinguish from ordinary changed
           entries.

               u &lt;XY&gt; &lt;sub&gt; &lt;m1&gt; &lt;m2&gt; &lt;m3&gt; &lt;mW&gt; &lt;h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;path&gt;

               Field       Meaning
               --------------------------------------------------------
               &lt;XY&gt;        A 2 character field describing the conflict type
                           as described in the short format.
               &lt;sub&gt;       A 4 character field describing the submodule state
                           as described above.
               &lt;m1&gt;        The octal file mode in stage 1.
               &lt;m2&gt;        The octal file mode in stage 2.
               &lt;m3&gt;        The octal file mode in stage 3.
               &lt;mW&gt;        The octal file mode in the worktree.
               &lt;h1&gt;        The object name in stage 1.
               &lt;h2&gt;        The object name in stage 2.
               &lt;h3&gt;        The object name in stage 3.
               &lt;path&gt;      The pathname.
               --------------------------------------------------------

       <b>Other Items</b>

           Following the tracked entries (and if requested), a series of
           lines will be printed for untracked and then ignored items
           found in the worktree.

           Untracked items have the following format:

               ? &lt;path&gt;

           Ignored items have the following format:

               ! &lt;path&gt;

       <b>Pathname Format Notes and -z</b>

           When the <b>-z </b>option is given, pathnames are printed as is and
           without any quoting and lines are terminated with a NUL
           (ASCII 0x00) byte.

           Without the <b>-z </b>option, pathnames with "unusual" characters
           are quoted as explained for the configuration variable
           <b>core.quotePath </b>(see <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>).
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The command honors <b>color.status </b>(or <b>status.color </b>— they mean the
       same thing and the latter is kept for backward compatibility) and
       <b>color.status.&lt;slot&gt; </b>configuration variables to colorize its
       output.

       If the config variable <b>status.relativePaths </b>is set to false, then
       all paths shown are relative to the repository root, not to the
       current directory.

       If <b>status.submoduleSummary </b>is set to a non zero number or true
       (identical to -1 or an unlimited number), the submodule summary
       will be enabled for the long format and a summary of commits for
       modified submodules will be shown (see --summary-limit option of
       <a href="git-submodule.1.html">git-submodule(1)</a>). Please note that the summary output from the
       status command will be suppressed for all submodules when
       <b>diff.ignoreSubmodules </b>is set to <i>all</i> or only for those submodules
       where <b>submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore=all</b>. To also view the summary for
       ignored submodules you can either use the
       --ignore-submodules=dirty command line option or the <i>git</i>
       <i>submodule summary</i> command, which shows a similar output but does
       not honor these settings.
</pre> <h2>
BACKGROUND REFRESH </h2>
<pre>
       By default, <b>git status </b>will automatically refresh the index,
       updating the cached stat information from the working tree and
       writing out the result. Writing out the updated index is an
       optimization that isn’t strictly necessary (<b>status </b>computes the
       values for itself, but writing them out is just to save
       subsequent programs from repeating our computation). When <b>status</b>
       is run in the background, the lock held during the write may
       conflict with other simultaneous processes, causing them to fail.
       Scripts running <b>status </b>in the background should consider using
       <b>git --no-optional-locks status </b>(see <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a> for details).
</pre> <h2>
UNTRACKED FILES AND PERFORMANCE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git status </b>can be very slow in large worktrees if/when it needs
       to search for untracked files and directories. There are many
       configuration options available to speed this up by either
       avoiding the work or making use of cached results from previous
       Git commands. There is no single optimum set of settings right
       for everyone. We’ll list a summary of the relevant options to
       help you, but before going into the list, you may want to run <b>git</b>
       <b>status </b>again, because your configuration may already be caching
       <b>git status </b>results, so it could be faster on subsequent runs.

       •   The <b>--untracked-files=no </b>flag or the
           <b>status.showUntrackedFiles=no </b>config (see above for both):
           indicate that <b>git status </b>should not report untracked files.
           This is the fastest option.  <b>git status </b>will not list the
           untracked files, so you need to be careful to remember if you
           create any new files and manually <b>git add </b>them.

       •   <b>advice.statusUoption=false </b>(see <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>): setting this
           variable to <b>false </b>disables the warning message given when
           enumerating untracked files takes more than 2 seconds. In a
           large project, it may take longer and the user may have
           already accepted the trade off (e.g. using "-uno" may not be
           an acceptable option for the user), in which case, there is
           no point issuing the warning message, and in such a case,
           disabling the warning may be the best.

       •   <b>core.untrackedCache=true </b>(see <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>): enable
           the untracked cache feature and only search directories that
           have been modified since the previous <b>git status </b>command. Git
           remembers the set of untracked files within each directory
           and assumes that if a directory has not been modified, then
           the set of untracked files within has not changed. This is
           much faster than enumerating the contents of every directory,
           but still not without cost, because Git still has to search
           for the set of modified directories. The untracked cache is
           stored in the <b>.git/index </b>file. The reduced cost of searching
           for untracked files is offset slightly by the increased size
           of the index and the cost of keeping it up-to-date. That
           reduced search time is usually worth the additional size.

       •   <b>core.untrackedCache=true </b>and <b>core.fsmonitor=true </b>or
           <b>core.fsmonitor=&lt;hook-command-pathname&gt; </b>(see
           <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>): enable both the untracked cache and
           FSMonitor features and only search directories that have been
           modified since the previous <b>git status </b>command. This is
           faster than using just the untracked cache alone because Git
           can also avoid searching for modified directories. Git only
           has to enumerate the exact set of directories that have
           changed recently. While the FSMonitor feature can be enabled
           without the untracked cache, the benefits are greatly reduced
           in that case.

       Note that after you turn on the untracked cache and/or FSMonitor
       features it may take a few <b>git status </b>commands for the various
       caches to warm up before you see improved command times. This is
       normal.
