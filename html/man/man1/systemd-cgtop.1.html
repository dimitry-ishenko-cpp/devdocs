NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-cgtop - Show top control groups by their resource usage
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>systemd-cgtop </b>[OPTIONS...] [GROUP]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-cgtop </b>shows the top control groups of the local Linux
       control group hierarchy, ordered by their CPU, memory, or disk
       I/O load. The display is refreshed in regular intervals (by
       default every 1s), similar in style to <a href="top.1.html">top(1)</a>. If a control group
       path is specified, shows only the services of the specified
       control group.

       If <b>systemd-cgtop </b>is not connected to a tty, no column headers are
       printed and the default is to only run one iteration. The
       <b>--iterations= </b>argument, if given, is honored. This mode is
       suitable for scripting.

       Resource usage is only accounted for control groups with the
       appropriate controllers turned on: "cpu" controller for CPU
       usage, "memory" controller for memory usage, and "io" controller
       for disk I/O consumption. If resource monitoring for these
       resources is required, it is recommended to add the
       <i>CPUAccounting=1</i>, <i>MemoryAccounting=1</i> and <i>IOAccounting=1</i> settings
       in the unit files in question. See <a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)</a>
       for details.

       The CPU load value can be between 0 and 100 times the number of
       processors the system has. For example, if the system has 8
       processors, the CPU load value is going to be between 0% and
       800%. The number of processors can be found in "/proc/cpuinfo".

       To emphasize: unless "CPUAccounting=1", "MemoryAccounting=1", and
       "IOAccounting=1" are enabled for the services in question, no
       resource accounting will be available for system services and the
       data shown by <b>systemd-cgtop </b>will be incomplete.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--order=path</b>
           Order by control group path name.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--order=tasks</b>
           Order by number of tasks/processes in the control group.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--order=cpu</b>
           Order by CPU load.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--order=memory</b>
           Order by memory usage.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--order=io</b>
           Order by disk I/O load.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--batch</b>
           Run in "batch" mode: do not accept input and run until the
           iteration limit set with <b>--iterations= </b>is exhausted or until
           killed. This mode could be useful for sending output from
           <b>systemd-cgtop </b>to other programs or to a file.

           Added in version 188.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
           Format byte counts (as in memory usage and I/O metrics) and
           CPU time with raw numeric values rather than human-readable
           numbers.

           Added in version 221.

       <b>--cpu=percentage</b>, <b>--cpu=time</b>
           Controls whether the CPU usage is shown as percentage or
           time. By default, the CPU usage is shown as percentage. This
           setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the % key.

           Added in version 226.

       <b>-P</b>
           Count only userspace processes instead of all tasks. By
           default, all tasks are counted: each kernel thread and each
           userspace thread individually. With this setting, kernel
           threads are excluded from the count and each userspace
           process only counts as one task, regardless of how many
           threads it consists of. This setting may also be toggled at
           runtime by pressing the P key. This option may not be
           combined with <b>-k</b>.

           Added in version 227.

       <b>-k</b>
           Count only userspace processes and kernel threads instead of
           all tasks. By default, all tasks are counted: each kernel
           thread and each userspace thread individually. With this
           setting, kernel threads are included in the count and each
           userspace process only counts as one task, regardless of how
           many threads it consists of. This setting may also be toggled
           at runtime by pressing the k key. This option may not be
           combined with <b>-P</b>.

           Added in version 226.

       <b>--recursive=</b>
           Controls whether the number of processes shown for a control
           group shall include all processes that are contained in any
           of the child control groups as well. Takes a boolean
           argument, which defaults to "yes". If enabled, the processes
           in child control groups are included, if disabled, only the
           processes in the control group itself are counted. This
           setting may also be toggled at runtime by pressing the r key.
           Note that this setting only applies to process counting, i.e.
           when the <b>-P </b>or <b>-k </b>options are used. It has not effect if all
           tasks are counted, in which case the counting is always
           recursive.

           Added in version 226.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--iterations=</b>
           Perform only this many iterations. A value of 0 indicates
           that the program should run indefinitely.

           Added in version 188.

       <b>-1</b>
           A shortcut for <b>--iterations=1</b>.

           Added in version 238.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--delay=</b>
           Specify refresh delay in seconds (or if one of "ms", "us",
           "min" is specified as unit in this time unit). This setting
           may also be increased and decreased at runtime by pressing
           the + and - keys.

       <b>--depth=</b>
           Maximum control group tree traversal depth. Specifies how
           deep <b>systemd-cgtop </b>shall traverse the control group
           hierarchies. If 0 is specified, only the root group is
           monitored. For 1, only the first level of control groups is
           monitored, and so on. Defaults to 3.

       <b>-M </b><i>MACHINE</i>, <b>--machine=</b><i>MACHINE</i>
           Limit control groups shown to the part corresponding to the
           container <i>MACHINE</i>. This option may not be used when a control
           group path is specified.

           Added in version 227.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

KEYS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-cgtop </b>is an interactive tool and may be controlled via
       user input using the following keys:

       h
           Shows a short help text.

       Space
           Immediately refresh output.

           also be controlled using the <b>--order= </b>command line switch.

       %
           Toggle between showing CPU time as time or percentage. This
           setting may also be controlled using the <b>--cpu= </b>command line
           switch.

           Added in version 201.

       +, -
           Increase or decrease refresh delay, respectively. This
           setting may also be controlled using the <b>--delay= </b>command
           line switch.

       P
           Toggle between counting all tasks, or only userspace
           processes. This setting may also be controlled using the <b>-P</b>
           command line switch (see above).

           Added in version 227.

       k
           Toggle between counting all tasks, or only userspace
           processes and kernel threads. This setting may also be
           controlled using the <b>-k </b>command line switch (see above).

           Added in version 226.

       r
           Toggle between recursively including or excluding processes
           in child control groups in control group process counts. This
           setting may also be controlled using the <b>--recursive= </b>command
           line switch. This key is not available if all tasks are
           counted, it is only available if processes are counted, as
           enabled with the P or k keys.

           Added in version 226.
