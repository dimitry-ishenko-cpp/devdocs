NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mariadb-waitpid - kill process and wait for its termination
       (mysql_waitpid is now a symlink to mariadb-waitpid)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>mysql_waitpid [</b><i>options</i><b>] </b><i>pid wait_time</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mysql_waitpid </b>signals a process to terminate and waits for the
       process to exit. It uses the kill() system call and Unix signals,
       so it runs on Unix and Unix-like systems.

       Invoke <b>mysql_waitpid </b>like this:

           shell&gt; <b>mysql_waitpid [</b><i>options</i><b>] </b><i>pid wait_time</i>

       <b>mysql_waitpid </b>sends signal 0 to the process identified by <i>pid</i> and
       waits up to <i>wait_time</i> seconds for the process to terminate.  <i>pid</i>
       and <i>wait_time</i> must be positive integers.

       If process termination occurs within the wait time or the process
       does not exist, <b>mysql_waitpid </b>returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 1.

       If the kill() system call cannot handle signal 0, <b>mysql_waitpid()</b>
       uses signal 1 instead.

       <b>mysql_waitpid </b>supports the following options:

       •   <b>--help</b>, <b>-?</b>, <b>-I</b>

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   <b>--verbose</b>, <b>-v</b>

           Verbose mode. Display a warning if signal 0 could not be used
           and signal 1 is used instead.

       •   <b>--version</b>, <b>-V</b>

           Display version information and exit.
