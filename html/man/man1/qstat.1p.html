PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       qstat — show status of batch jobs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       qstat <b>[</b>-f<b>] </b><i>job_identifier</i>...

       qstat -Q <b>[</b>-f<b>] </b><i>destination</i>...

       qstat -B <b>[</b>-f<b>] </b><i>server_name</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The status of a batch job, batch queue, or batch server is
       obtained by a request to the server. The <i>qstat</i> utility is a user-
       accessible batch client that requests the status of one or more
       batch jobs, batch queues, or servers, and writes the status
       information to standard output.

       For each successfully processed batch <i>job_identifier</i>, the <i>qstat</i>
       utility shall display information about the corresponding batch
       job.

       For each successfully processed destination, the <i>qstat</i> utility
       shall display information about the corresponding batch queue.

       For each successfully processed server name, the <i>qstat</i> utility
       shall display information about the corresponding server.

       The <i>qstat</i> utility shall acquire batch job status information by
       sending a <i>Job Status Request</i> to a batch server. The <i>qstat</i> utility
       shall acquire batch queue status information by sending a <i>Queue</i>
       <i>Status Request</i> to a batch server. The <i>qstat</i> utility shall acquire
       server status information by sending a <i>Server Status Request</i> to a
       batch server.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qstat</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-f        </b>Specify that a full display is produced.

                 The minimum contents of a full display are specified in
                 the STDOUT section.

                 Additional contents and format of a full display are
                 implementation-defined.

       <b>-Q        </b>Specify that the operand is a destination.

                 The <i>qstat</i> utility shall display information about each
                 batch queue at each destination identified as an
                 operand.

       <b>-B        </b>Specify that the operand is a server name.

                 The <i>qstat</i> utility shall display information about each
                 server identified as an operand.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>-Q </b>option is presented to the <i>qstat</i> utility, the utility
       shall accept one or more operands that conform to the syntax for
       a destination (see <i>Section 3.3.2</i>, <i>Destination</i>).

       If the <b>-B </b>option is presented to the <i>qstat</i> utility, the utility
       shall accept one or more <i>server_name</i> operands.

       If neither the <b>-B </b>nor the <b>-Q </b>option is presented to the <i>qstat</i>
       utility, the utility shall accept one or more operands that
       conform to the syntax for a batch <i>job_identifier</i> (see <i>Section</i>
       <i>3.3.1</i>, <i>Batch Job Identifier</i>).
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>qstat</i>:

       <i>HOME</i>      Determine the pathname of the user's home directory.

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                 elements within regular expressions.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>
                 Determine the locale for selecting the radix character
                 used when writing floating-point formatted output.

STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If an operand presented to the <i>qstat</i> utility is a batch

EXIT STATUS </h2>

</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <i>qstat</i> utility shall not
       be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
       the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
       batch <i>job_identifier</i> does not exist on the server. Whether or not
       the <i>qstat</i> utility waits to output the diagnostic message while
       attempting to locate the batch job on other servers is
       implementation-defined.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qstat</i> utility allows users to display the status of jobs and
       list the batch jobs in queues.

       The operands of the <i>qstat</i> utility may be either job identifiers,
       queues (specified as destination identifiers), or batch server
       names. The <b>-Q </b>and <b>-B </b>options, or absence thereof, indicate the
       nature of the operands.

       The other options of the <i>qstat</i> utility allow the user to control
       the amount of information displayed and the format in which it is
       displayed. Should a user wish to display the status of a set of
       jobs that match a selection criteria, the <i>qselect</i> utility may be
       used to acquire such a list.

       The <b>-f </b>option allows users to request a ``full'' display in an
       implementation-defined format.

       Historically, the <i>qstat</i> utility has been a part of the NQS and
       its derivatives, the existing practice on which it is based.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qstat</i> utility may be removed in a future version.
