NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-architecture - set and determine the architecture for
       package building
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-architecture </b>[<i>option</i>...] [<i>command</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-architecture </b>provides a facility to determine and set the
       build and host architecture for package building.

       The build architecture is always determined by either the
       <b>DEB_BUILD_ARCH </b>variable if set (and <b>--force </b>not being specified)
       or by an external call to <a href="dpkg.1.html">dpkg(1)</a>, and cannot be set at the
       command line.

       You can specify the host architecture by providing one or both of
       the options <b>--host-arch </b>and <b>--host-type</b>, otherwise the
       <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH </b>variable is used if set (and <b>--force </b>not being
       specified).  The default is determined by an external call to
       <a href="gcc.1.html">gcc(1)</a>, or the same as the build architecture if <b>CC </b>or gcc are
       both not available.  One out of <b>--host-arch </b>and <b>--host-type </b>is
       sufficient, the value of the other will be set to a usable
       default.  Indeed, it is often better to only specify one, because
       <b>dpkg-architecture </b>will warn you if your choice does not match the
       default.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
           Print the environment variables, one each line, in the format
           <i>VARIABLE=value</i>.  This is the default action.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--equal </b><i>architecture</i>
           Check for equality of architecture (since dpkg 1.13.13).  It
           compares the current or specified Debian host architecture
           against <i>architecture</i>, to check if they are equal.  This
           action will not expand the architecture wildcards.  Command
           finishes with an exit status of 0 if matched, 1 if not
           matched.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--is </b><i>architecture-wildcard</i>
           Check for identity of architecture (since dpkg 1.13.13).  It
           compares the current or specified Debian host architecture
           against <i>architecture-wildcard</i> after having expanded it as an
           architecture wildcard, to check if they match.  Command
           finishes with an exit status of 0 if matched, 1 if not
           matched.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--query </b><i>variable-name</i>
           Print the value of a single variable.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--print-set</b>
           Print an export command.  This can be used to set the
           environment variables using the POSIX shell or make <b>eval</b>,
           depending on the output format.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--print-unset</b>
           Print a similar command to <b>--print-set </b>but to unset all
           variables.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--command </b><i>command-string</i>
           Execute a <i>command-string</i> in an environment which has all
           variables set to the determined value.

           If the <i>command-string</i> contains shell metacharacters, then it
           will be invoked through the system bourne shell.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--list-known</b>
           Print a list of valid architecture names.  Possibly
           restricted by one or more of the matching options
           <b>--match-wildcard</b>, <b>--match-bits </b>or <b>--match-endian </b>(since dpkg
           1.17.14).

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--host-arch </b><i>architecture</i>
           Set the host Debian architecture.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--host-type </b><i>gnu-system-type</i>
           Set the host GNU system type.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--target-arch </b><i>architecture</i>
           Set the target Debian architecture (since dpkg 1.17.14).

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--target-type </b><i>gnu-system-type</i>
           Set the target GNU system type (since dpkg 1.17.14).

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--match-wildcard </b><i>architecture-wildcard</i>
           Restrict the architectures listed by <b>--list-known </b>to ones
           matching the specified architecture wildcard (since dpkg
           1.17.14).

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--match-bits </b><i>architecture-bits</i>
           Restrict the architectures listed by <b>--list-known </b>to ones
           with the specified CPU bits (since dpkg 1.17.14).  Either <b>32</b>
           or <b>64</b>.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--match-endian </b><i>architecture-endianness</i>
           Restrict the architectures listed by <b>--list-known </b>to ones
           with the specified endianness (since dpkg 1.17.14).  Either
           <b>little </b>or <b>big</b>.

       <b>--print-format </b><i>format</i>
           Sets the output format for <b>--print-set </b>and <b>--print-unset</b>
           (since dpkg 1.20.6), to either <b>shell </b>(default) or <b>make</b>.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
           Values set by existing environment variables with the same
           name as used by the scripts are honored (i.e. used by <b>dpkg-</b>
           <b>architecture</b>), except if this force flag is present.  This
           allows the user to override a value even when the call to
           <b>dpkg-architecture </b>is buried in some other script (for example
           <a href="dpkg-buildpackage.1.html">dpkg-buildpackage(1)</a>).
</pre> <h2>
TERMS </h2>
<pre>
       build machine
           The machine the package is built on.

       host machine
           The machine the package is built for.

       target machine
           The machine the compiler is building for, or the emulator
           will run code for.  This is only needed when building a
           cross-toolchain (or emulator), one that will be built on the
           build architecture, to be run on the host architecture, and
           to build (or run emulated) code for the target architecture.

       Debian architecture
           The Debian architecture string, which specifies the binary
           tree in the FTP archive.  Examples: i386, sparc, hurd-i386.

       Debian architecture tuple
           A Debian architecture tuple is the fully qualified
           architecture with all its components spelled out.  This
           differs with Debian architectures in that at least the <i>cpu</i>
           component does not embed the <i>abi</i>.  The current tuple has the
           form <i>abi</i>-<i>libc</i>-<i>os</i>-<i>cpu</i>.  Examples: base-gnu-linux-amd64,
           eabihf-musl-linux-arm.

       Debian architecture wildcard
           A Debian architecture wildcard is a special architecture
           string that will match any real architecture being part of
           it.  The general form is a Debian architecture tuple with
           four or less elements, and with at least one of them being
           <b>any</b>.  Missing elements of the tuple are prefixed implicitly
           as <b>any</b>, and thus the following pairs are equivalent:

           <b>any</b>-<b>any</b>-<b>any</b>-<b>any </b>= <b>any</b>
           <b>any</b>-<b>any</b>-<i>os</i>-<b>any </b>= <i>os</i>-<b>any</b>
           <b>any</b>-<i>libc</i>-<b>any</b>-<b>any </b>= <i>libc</i>-<b>any</b>-<b>any</b>

           Examples: linux-any, any-i386, hurd-any, eabi-any-any-arm,
           musl-any-any.

       GNU system type
           An architecture specification string consisting of two parts
           separated by a hyphen: cpu and system.  Examples:
           i586-linux-gnu, sparc-linux-gnu, i686-gnu, x86_64-netbsd.

       multiarch triplet
           The clarified GNU system type, used for filesystem paths.
           This triplet does not change even when the baseline ISA gets
           bumped, so that the resulting paths are stable over time.
           The only current difference with the GNU system type is that
           the CPU part for i386 based systems is always i386.
           Examples: i386-linux-gnu, x86_64-linux-gnu.  Example paths:
           /lib/powerpc64le-linux-gnu/, /usr/lib/i386-kfreebsd-gnu/.

</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Architecture tables</b>
       All these files have to be present for <b>dpkg-architecture </b>to work.
       Their location can be overridden at runtime with the environment
       variable <b>DPKG_DATADIR</b>.  These tables contain a format <b>Version</b>
       pseudo-field on their first line to mark their format, so that
       parsers can check if they understand it, such as "# Version=1.0".

       <i>/usr/local/share/dpkg/cputable</i>
           Table of known CPU names and mapping to their GNU name.
           Format version 1.0 (since dpkg 1.13.2).

       <i>/usr/local/share/dpkg/ostable</i>
           Table of known operating system names and mapping to their
           GNU name.  Format version 2.0 (since dpkg 1.18.11).

       <i>/usr/local/share/dpkg/tupletable</i>
           Mapping between Debian architecture tuples and Debian
           architecture names.  Format version 1.0 (since dpkg 1.18.11).

       <i>/usr/local/share/dpkg/abitable</i>
           Table of Debian architecture ABI attribute overrides.  Format
           version 2.0 (since dpkg 1.18.11).

   <b>Packaging support</b>
       <i>/usr/local/share/dpkg/architecture.mk</i>
           Makefile snippet that properly sets and exports all the
           variables that <b>dpkg-architecture </b>outputs (since dpkg 1.16.1).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-buildpackage </b>accepts the <b>-a </b>option and passes it to <b>dpkg-</b>
       <b>architecture</b>.  Other examples:

        CC=i386-gnu-gcc dpkg-architecture -c debian/rules build

        eval $(dpkg-architecture -u)

       Check if the current or specified host architecture is equal to
       an architecture:

        dpkg-architecture -elinux-alpha

        dpkg-architecture -amips -elinux-mips

       Check if the current or specified host architecture is a Linux
       system:

        dpkg-architecture -ilinux-any

        dpkg-architecture -ai386 -ilinux-any

   <b>Usage in debian/rules</b>
       The environment variables set by <b>dpkg-architecture </b>are passed to
       <i>debian/rules</i> as make variables (see make documentation).
       However, you should not rely on them, as this breaks manual
       invocation of the script.  Instead, you should always initialize
       them using <b>dpkg-architecture </b>with the <b>-q </b>option.  Here are some
       examples, which also show how you can improve the cross
       compilation support in your package:

       Retrieving the GNU system type and forwarding it to ./configure:

        DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE ?= $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE)
        DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE ?= $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
        [...]
        ifeq ($(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE), $(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE))
          confflags += --build=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
        else
          confflags += --build=$(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE) \
                       --host=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
        endif
        [...]
        ./configure $(confflags)

       Doing something only for a specific architecture:

        DEB_HOST_ARCH ?= $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH)

        ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH),alpha)
          [...]
        endif

       or if you only need to check the CPU or OS type, use the
       <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU </b>or <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS </b>variables.

       Note that you can also rely on an external Makefile snippet to
       properly set all the variables that <b>dpkg-architecture </b>can
       provide:

        include /usr/local/share/dpkg/architecture.mk

        ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH),alpha)
          [...]
        endif

       In any case, you should never use <b>dpkg --print-architecture </b>to
       get architecture information during a package build.
