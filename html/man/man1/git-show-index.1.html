NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-show-index - Show packed archive index
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git show-index</i> [--object-format=&lt;hash-algorithm&gt;]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Read the <b>.idx </b>file for a Git packfile (created with
       <a href="git-pack-objects.1.html">git-pack-objects(1)</a> or <a href="git-index-pack.1.html">git-index-pack(1)</a>) from the standard
       input, and dump its contents. The output consists of one object
       per line, with each line containing two or three space-separated
       columns:

       •   the first column is the offset in bytes of the object within
           the corresponding packfile

       •   the second column is the object id of the object

       •   if the index version is 2 or higher, the third column
           contains the CRC32 of the object data

       The objects are output in the order in which they are found in
       the index file, which should be (in a correctly constructed file)
       sorted by object id.

       Note that you can get more information on a packfile by calling
       <a href="git-verify-pack.1.html">git-verify-pack(1)</a>. However, as this command considers only the
       index file itself, it’s both faster and more flexible.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --object-format=&lt;hash-algorithm&gt;
           Specify the given object format (hash algorithm) for the
           index file. The valid values are <i>sha1</i> and (if enabled)
           <i>sha256</i>. The default is the algorithm for the current
           repository (set by <b>extensions.objectFormat</b>), or <i>sha1</i> if no
           value is set or outside a repository..

           Note: At present, there is no interoperability between
           SHA-256 repositories and SHA-1 repositories.

       Historically, we warned that SHA-256 repositories may later need
       backward incompatible changes when we introduce such
       interoperability features. Today, we only expect compatible
       changes. Furthermore, if such changes prove to be necessary, it
       can be expected that SHA-256 repositories created with today’s
       Git will be usable by future versions of Git without data loss.
