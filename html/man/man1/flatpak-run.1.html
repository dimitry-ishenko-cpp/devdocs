NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-run - Run an application or open a shell in a runtime
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak run </b>[OPTION...] REF [ARG...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If REF names an installed application, Flatpak runs the
       application in a sandboxed environment. Extra arguments are
       passed on to the application. The current branch and arch of the
       application is used unless otherwise specified with <b>--branch </b>or
       <b>--arch</b>. See <a href="flatpak-make-current.1.html">flatpak-make-current(1)</a>.

       If REF names a runtime, a shell is opened in the runtime. This is
       useful for development and testing. If there is ambiguity about
       which branch to use, you will be prompted to choose. Use <b>--branch</b>
       to avoid this. The primary arch is used unless otherwise
       specified with <b>--arch</b>.

       By default, Flatpak will look for the application or runtime in
       the per-user installation first, then in all system
       installations. This can be overridden with the <b>--user</b>, <b>--system</b>
       and <b>--installation </b>options.

       Flatpak creates a sandboxed environment for the application to
       run in by mounting the right runtime at /usr and a writable
       directory at /var, whose content is preserved between application
       runs. The application itself is mounted at /app.

       The details of the sandboxed environment are controlled by the
       application metadata and various options like <b>--share </b>and
       <b>--socket </b>that are passed to the run command: Access is allowed if
       it was requested either in the application metadata file or with
       an option and the user hasn't overridden it.

       The remaining arguments are passed to the command that gets run
       in the sandboxed environment. See the <b>--file-forwarding </b>option
       for handling of file arguments.

       Environment variables are generally passed on to the sandboxed
       application, with certain exceptions. The application metadata
       can override environment variables, as well as the <b>--env </b>option.
       Apart from that, Flatpak always unsets or overrides the following
       variables, since their session values are likely to interfere
       with the functioning of the sandbox:
           PATH
           LD_LIBRARY_PATH
           LD_PRELOAD
           LD_AUDIT
           XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
           XDG_DATA_DIRS
           XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
           SHELL
           TEMP
           TEMPDIR
           TMP
           TMPDIR
           PYTHONPATH
           PERLLIB
           PERL5LIB
           XCURSOR_PATH
           KRB5CCNAME
           XKB_CONFIG_ROOT
           GIO_EXTRA_MODULES
           GDK_BACKEND
           VK_ADD_DRIVER_FILES
           VK_ADD_LAYER_PATH
           VK_DRIVER_FILES
           VK_ICD_FILENAMES
           VK_LAYER_PATH
           __EGL_EXTERNAL_PLATFORM_CONFIG_DIRS
           __EGL_EXTERNAL_PLATFORM_CONFIG_FILENAMES
           __EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_DIRS
           __EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_FILENAMES

       Also several environment variables with the prefix "GST_" that
       are used by gstreamer are unset (since Flatpak 1.12.5).

       Flatpak also overrides the XDG environment variables to point
       sandboxed applications at their writable filesystem locations
       below ~/.var/app/$APPID/:
           XDG_DATA_HOME
           XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           XDG_CACHE_HOME
           XDG_STATE_HOME (since Flatpak 1.13)

       Apps can use the <b>--persist=.local/state </b>and
       <b>--unset-env=XDG_STATE_HOME </b>options to get a Flatpak
       1.13-compatible ~/.local/state on older versions of Flatpak.

       The host values of these variables are made available inside the
       sandbox via these HOST_-prefixed variables:
           HOST_XDG_DATA_HOME
           HOST_XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           HOST_XDG_CACHE_HOME
           HOST_XDG_STATE_HOME (since Flatpak 1.13)

       Flatpak sets the environment variable <b>FLATPAK_ID </b>to the
       application ID of the running app.

       Flatpak also bind-mounts as read-only the host's /etc/os-release
       (if available, or /usr/lib/os-release as a fallback) to
       /run/host/os-release in accordance with the <b>os-release</b>
       <b>specification</b>[1].

       If parental controls support is enabled, flatpak will check the
       current user’s parental controls settings, and will refuse to run
       an app if it is blocklisted for the current user.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Look for the application and runtime in per-user
           installations.

       <b>--system</b>
           Look for the application and runtime in the default
           system-wide installations.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Look for the application and runtime in the system-wide
           installation specified by NAME among those defined in
           /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using <b>--installation=default</b>
           is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.

       <b>--arch=ARCH</b>
           The architecture to run. See <b>flatpak --supported-arches </b>for
           architectures supported by the host.

       <b>--command=COMMAND</b>
           The command to run instead of the one listed in the
           application metadata.

       <b>--cwd=DIR</b>
           The directory to run the command in. Note that this must be a
           directory inside the sandbox.

       <b>--branch=BRANCH</b>
           The branch to use.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--devel</b>
           Use the devel runtime that is specified in the application
           metadata instead of the regular runtime, and use a seccomp
           profile that is less likely to break development tools.

       <b>--runtime=RUNTIME</b>
           Use this runtime instead of the one that is specified in the
           application metadata. This is a full tuple, like for example
           org.freedesktop.Sdk/x86_64/1.2, but partial tuples are
           allowed. Any empty or missing parts are filled in with the
           corresponding values specified by the app.

       <b>--runtime-version=VERSION</b>
           Use this version of the runtime instead of the one that is
           specified in the application metadata. This overrides any
           version specified with the --runtime option.

       <b>--share=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the
           Context section from the application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM
           must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--unshare=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Don't share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides
           the Context section from the application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM
           must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--socket=SOCKET</b>
           Expose a well known socket to the application. This overrides
           to the Context section from the application metadata.  SOCKET
           must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio,
           system-bus, session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent,
           inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--nosocket=SOCKET</b>
           Don't expose a well known socket to the application. This
           overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11,
           pulseaudio, system-bus, session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups,
           gpg-agent, inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--device=DEVICE</b>
           Expose a device to the application. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata.  DEVICE must
           be one of: dri, input, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--nodevice=DEVICE</b>
           Don't expose a device to the application. This overrides to
           the Context section from the application metadata.  DEVICE
           must be one of: dri, input, kvm, shm, all. This option can be
           used multiple times.

       <b>--allow=FEATURE</b>
           Allow access to a specific feature. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata.  FEATURE must
           be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth. This option can be
           used multiple times.

           See <a href="flatpak-build-finish.1.html">flatpak-build-finish(1)</a> for the meaning of the various
           features.

       <b>--disallow=FEATURE</b>
           Disallow access to a specific feature. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata.  FEATURE must
           be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth. This option can be
           used multiple times.

       <b>--filesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Allow the application access to a subset of the filesystem.
           This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  FILESYSTEM can be one of: home, host, host-os,
           host-etc, xdg-desktop, xdg-documents, xdg-download,
           xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share, xdg-templates,
           xdg-videos, xdg-run, xdg-config, xdg-cache, xdg-data, an
           absolute path, or a homedir-relative path like ~/dir or paths
           relative to the xdg dirs, like xdg-download/subdir. The
           optional :ro suffix indicates that the location will be
           read-only. The optional :create suffix indicates that the
           location will be read-write and created if it doesn't exist.
           This option can be used multiple times. See the "[Context]
           filesystems" list in <a href="../man5/flatpak-metadata.5.html">flatpak-metadata(5)</a> for details of the
           meanings of these filesystems.

       <b>--nofilesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Undo the effect of a previous <b>--filesystem=</b>FILESYSTEM in the
           app's manifest and/or the overrides set up with
           <a href="flatpak-override.1.html">flatpak-override(1)</a>. This overrides the Context section of
           the application metadata.  FILESYSTEM can take the same
           values as for <b>--filesystem</b>, but the :ro and :create suffixes
           are not used here. This option can be used multiple times.

           This option does not prevent access to a more narrowly-scoped
           <b>--filesystem</b>. For example, if an application has the
           equivalent of <b>--filesystem=xdg-config/MyApp </b>in its manifest
           or as a system-wide override, and flatpak override --user
           --nofilesystem=home as a per-user override, then it will be
           prevented from accessing most of the home directory, but it
           will still be allowed to access $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MyApp.

           As a special case, <b>--nofilesystem=host:reset </b>will ignore all
           <b>--filesystem </b>permissions inherited from the app manifest or
           <a href="flatpak-override.1.html">flatpak-override(1)</a>, in addition to having the behaviour of
           <b>--nofilesystem=host</b>.

       <b>--add-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Add generic policy option. For example,
           "--add-policy=subsystem.key=v1 --add-policy=subsystem.key=v2"
           would map to this metadata:

               [Policy subsystem]
               key=v1;v2;

           This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--remove-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Remove generic policy option. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--env=VAR=VALUE</b>
           Set an environment variable in the application. This
           overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--unset-env=VAR</b>
           Unset an environment variable in the application. This
           overrides the unset-environment entry in the [Context] group
           of the metadata, and the [Environment] group. This option can
           be used multiple times.

       <b>--env-fd=</b><i>FD</i>
           Read environment variables from the file descriptor <i>FD</i>, and
           set them as if via <b>--env</b>. This can be used to avoid
           environment variables and their values becoming visible to
           other users.

           Each environment variable is in the form <i>VAR</i>=<i>VALUE</i> followed
           by a zero byte. This is the same format used by env -0 and
           /proc/*/environ.

       <b>--own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well known name NAME on the
           session bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the application
           to own all matching names. This overrides to the Context
           section from the application metadata. This option can be
           used multiple times.

       <b>--talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on
           the session bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
           application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
           the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--no-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Don't allow the application to talk to the well known name
           NAME on the session bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
           application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
           the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well known name NAME on the
           system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the application
           to own all matching names. This overrides to the Context
           section from the application metadata. This option can be
           used multiple times.

       <b>--system-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on
           the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
           application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
           the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-no-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Don't allow the application to talk to the well known name
           NAME on the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it allows the
           application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to
           the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--persist=FILENAME</b>
           If the application doesn't have access to the real homedir,
           make the (homedir-relative) path FILENAME a bind mount to the
           corresponding path in the per-application directory, allowing
           that location to be used for persistent data. This overrides
           to the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--no-session-bus</b>
           Run this instance without the filtered access to the session
           dbus connection. Note, this is the default when run with
           --sandbox.

       <b>--session-bus</b>
           Allow filtered access to the session dbus connection. This is
           the default, except when run with --sandbox.

           In sandbox mode, even if you allow access to the session bus
           the sandbox cannot talk to or own the application ids
           (org.the.App.*) on the bus (unless explicitly added), only
           names in the .Sandboxed subset (org.the.App.Sandboxed.* and
           org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.org.the.App.Sandboxed.*).

       <b>--no-a11y-bus</b>
           Run this instance without the access to the accessibility
           bus. Note, this is the default when run with --sandbox.

       <b>--a11y-bus</b>
           Allow access to the accessibility bus. This is the default,
           except when run with --sandbox.

       <b>--sandbox</b>
           Run the application in sandboxed mode, which means dropping
           all the extra permissions it would otherwise have, as well as
           access to the session/system/a11y busses and document portal.

       <b>--log-session-bus</b>
           Log session bus traffic. This can be useful to see what
           access you need to allow in your D-Bus policy.

       <b>--log-system-bus</b>
           Log system bus traffic. This can be useful to see what access
           you need to allow in your D-Bus policy.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--die-with-parent</b>
           Kill the entire sandbox when the launching process dies.

       <b>--parent-pid=PID</b>
           Specifies the pid of the "parent" flatpak, used by
           --parent-expose-pids and --parent-share-pids.

       <b>--parent-expose-pids</b>
           Make the processes of the new sandbox visible in the sandbox
           of the parent flatpak, as defined by --parent-pid.

       <b>--parent-share-pids</b>
           Use the same process ID namespace for the processes of the
           new sandbox and the sandbox of the parent flatpak, as defined
           by --parent-pid. Implies --parent-expose-pids.

       <b>--instance-id-fd</b>
           Write the instance ID string to the given file descriptor.

       <b>--file-forwarding</b>
           If this option is specified, the remaining arguments are
           scanned, and all arguments that are enclosed between a pair
           of '@@' arguments are interpreted as file paths, exported in
           the document store, and passed to the command in the form of
           the resulting document path. Arguments between "@@u" and "@@"
           are considered URIs, and any "file:" URIs are exported. The
           exports are non-persistent and with read and write
           permissions for the application.

       <b>--app-path=</b><i>PATH</i>
           Instead of mounting the app's content on /app in the sandbox,
           mount <i>PATH</i> on /app, and the app's content on /run/parent/app.
           If the app has extensions, they will also be redirected into
           /run/parent/app, and will not be included in the
           <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH </b>inside the sandbox.

       <b>--app-path=</b>
           As a special case, <b>--app-path= </b>(with an empty <i>PATH</i>) results
           in an empty directory being mounted on /app.

       <b>--usr-path=</b><i>PATH</i>
           Instead of mounting the runtime's files on /usr in the
           sandbox, mount <i>PATH</i> on /usr, and the runtime's normal files
           on /run/parent/usr. If the runtime has extensions, they will
           also be redirected into /run/parent/usr, and will not be
           included in the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH </b>inside the sandbox.

           This option will usually only be useful if it is combined
           with <b>--app-path= </b>and <b>--env=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=</b><i>...</i>.
