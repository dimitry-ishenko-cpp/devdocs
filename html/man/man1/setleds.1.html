NAME </h2>
<pre>
       setleds - set the keyboard leds
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>setleds </b>[<i>-v</i>] [<i>-L</i>] [<i>-D</i>] [<i>-F</i>] [<i>{+|-}num</i>] [<i>{+|-}caps</i>] [<i>{+|-}scroll</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Setleds </b>reports and changes the led flag settings of a VT (namely
       NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock).  Without arguments, <b>setleds</b>
       prints the current settings.  With arguments, it sets or clears
       the indicated flags (and leaves the others unchanged). The
       settings before and after the change are reported if the -v flag
       is given.

       The led flag settings are specific for each VT (and the VT
       corresponding to stdin is used).

       By default (or with option -F), <b>setleds </b>will only change the VT
       flags (and their setting may be reflected by the keyboard leds).

       With option -D, <b>setleds </b>will change both the VT flags and their
       default settings (so that a subsequent reset will not undo the
       change).  This might be useful for people who always want to have
       numlock set.

       With option -L, <b>setleds </b>will not touch the VT flags, but only
       change the leds.  From this moment on, the leds will no longer
       reflect the VT flags (but display whatever is put into them). The
       command <b>setleds -L </b>(without further arguments) will restore the
       situation in which the leds reflect the VT flags.

       One might use <b>setleds </b>in /etc/rc to define the initial and
       default state of NumLock, e.g. by
            INITTY=/dev/tty[1-8]
            for tty in $INITTY; do
                 setleds -D +num &lt; $tty
            done
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -num +num
              Clear or set NumLock.  (At present, the NumLock setting
              influences the interpretation of keypad keys.  Pressing
              the NumLock key complements the NumLock setting.)

       -caps +caps
              Clear or set CapsLock.  (At present, the CapsLock setting
              complements the Shift key when applied to letters.
              Pressing the CapsLock key complements the CapsLock
              setting.)

       -scroll +scroll
              Clear or set ScrollLock.  (At present, pressing the
              ScrollLock key (or ^S/^Q) stops/starts console output.)
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       In keyboard application mode the NumLock key does not influence
       the NumLock flag setting.
