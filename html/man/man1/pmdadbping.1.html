</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdadbping </b>- database response time and availability PMDA
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdadbping </b>is a database response time measurement PMDA.

       <b>pmdadbping </b>runs <a href="dbprobe.1.html">dbprobe(1)</a>, and exports the performance
       measurements it makes available as PCP metrics.

       <a href="dbprobe.1.html">dbprobe(1)</a> should be configured to use the type of DBI
       appropriate for the local database, which includes: RDBMS
       flavour, user/password, delay between "ping" requests, and the
       SQL statement to use.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       Configure <a href="dbprobe.1.html">dbprobe(1)</a> - it uses a configuration file from (in this
       order):

       •   /etc/pcpdbi.conf

       •   $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/dbprobe.conf

       This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the
       settings listed at the start of <i>dbprobe.pl</i>, namely:

       •   database name (see <b>DBI</b>(3) for details)

       •   database user name

       •   database pass word

       •   SQL statement to measure (probe)

       •   delay between probes

       Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
       dbping performance metrics by doing the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, the following must be done as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdadbping </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/dbprobe.conf</b>
           probe configuration file for <i>dbprobe</i>(1), used indirectly by
           <b>pmdadbping</b>

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/Install</b>
           installation script for the <b>pmdadbping </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dbping/Remove</b>
           undo installation script for the <b>pmdadbping </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/dbping.log</b>
           default log file for error messages from <b>pmdadbping</b>
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by <b>PCP</b>. On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
