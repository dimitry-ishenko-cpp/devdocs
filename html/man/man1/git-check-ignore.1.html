</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-check-ignore - Debug gitignore / exclude files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git check-ignore</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;pathname&gt;...
       <i>git check-ignore</i> [&lt;options&gt;] --stdin
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       For each pathname given via the command-line or from a file via
       <b>--stdin</b>, check whether the file is excluded by .gitignore (or
       other input files to the exclude mechanism) and output the path
       if it is excluded.

       By default, tracked files are not shown at all since they are not
       subject to exclude rules; but see ‘--no-index’.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -q, --quiet
           Don’t output anything, just set exit status. This is only
           valid with a single pathname.

       -v, --verbose
           Instead of printing the paths that are excluded, for each
           path that matches an exclude pattern, print the exclude
           pattern together with the path. (Matching an exclude pattern
           usually means the path is excluded, but if the pattern begins
           with "<b>!</b>" then it is a negated pattern and matching it means
           the path is NOT excluded.)

           For precedence rules within and between exclude sources, see
           <a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore(5)</a>.

       --stdin
           Read pathnames from the standard input, one per line, instead
           of from the command-line.

       -z
           The output format is modified to be machine-parsable (see
           below). If <b>--stdin </b>is also given, input paths are separated
           with a NUL character instead of a linefeed character.

       -n, --non-matching
           Show given paths which don’t match any pattern. This only
           makes sense when <b>--verbose </b>is enabled, otherwise it would not
           be possible to distinguish between paths which match a
           pattern and those which don’t.

       --no-index
           Don’t look in the index when undertaking the checks. This can
           be used to debug why a path became tracked by e.g.  <b>git add .</b>
           and was not ignored by the rules as expected by the user or
           when developing patterns including negation to match a path
           previously added with <b>git add -f</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       By default, any of the given pathnames which match an ignore
       pattern will be output, one per line. If no pattern matches a
       given path, nothing will be output for that path; this means that
       path will not be ignored.

       If <b>--verbose </b>is specified, the output is a series of lines of the
       form:

       &lt;source&gt; &lt;COLON&gt; &lt;linenum&gt; &lt;COLON&gt; &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;HT&gt; &lt;pathname&gt;

       &lt;pathname&gt; is the path of a file being queried, &lt;pattern&gt; is the
       matching pattern, &lt;source&gt; is the pattern’s source file, and
       &lt;linenum&gt; is the line number of the pattern within that source.
       If the pattern contained a "<b>!</b>" prefix or "<b>/</b>" suffix, it will be
       preserved in the output. &lt;source&gt; will be an absolute path when
       referring to the file configured by <b>core.excludesFile</b>, or
       relative to the repository root when referring to
       <b>.git/info/exclude </b>or a per-directory exclude file.

       If <b>-z </b>is specified, the pathnames in the output are delimited by
       the null character; if <b>--verbose </b>is also specified then null
       characters are also used instead of colons and hard tabs:

       &lt;source&gt; &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;linenum&gt; &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;NULL&gt; &lt;pathname&gt;
       &lt;NULL&gt;

       If <b>-n </b>or <b>--non-matching </b>are specified, non-matching pathnames
       will also be output, in which case all fields in each output
       record except for &lt;pathname&gt; will be empty. This can be useful
       when running non-interactively, so that files can be
       incrementally streamed to STDIN of a long-running check-ignore
       process, and for each of these files, STDOUT will indicate
       whether that file matched a pattern or not. (Without this option,
       it would be impossible to tell whether the absence of output for
       a given file meant that it didn’t match any pattern, or that the
       output hadn’t been generated yet.)

       Buffering happens as documented under the <b>GIT_FLUSH </b>option in
       <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>. The caller is responsible for avoiding deadlocks caused
       by overfilling an input buffer or reading from an empty output
       buffer.
</pre> <h2>
