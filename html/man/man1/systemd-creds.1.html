       <b>systemd-creds </b>[OPTIONS...] COMMAND [ARGS...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-creds </b>is a tool for listing, showing, encrypting and
       decrypting unit credentials. Credentials are limited-size binary
       or textual objects that may be passed to unit processes. They are
       primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both public and
       private) or certificates, user account information or identity
       information from the host to services.

       Credentials are configured in unit files via the
       <i>ImportCredential=</i>, <i>LoadCredential=</i>, <i>SetCredential=</i>,
       <i>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</i>, and <i>SetCredentialEncrypted=</i> settings,
       see <a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a> for details.

       For further information see <b>System and Service Credentials</b>[1]
       documentation.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>list</b>
           Show a list of credentials passed into the current execution
           context. This command shows the files in the directory
           referenced by the <i>$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</i> environment
           variable, and is intended to be executed from within service
           context.

           Along with each credential name, the size and security state
           is shown. The latter is one of "secure" (in case the
           credential is backed by unswappable memory, i.e.  "ramfs"),
           "weak" (in case it is backed by any other type of memory), or
           "insecure" (if having any access mode that is not 0400, i.e.
           if readable by anyone but the owner).

           Added in version 250.

       <b>cat </b><i>credential...</i>
           Show contents of specified credentials passed into the
           current execution context. Takes one or more credential
           names, whose contents shall be written to standard output.

           When combined with <b>--json= </b>or <b>--transcode= </b>the output is
           transcoded in simple ways before outputting.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>setup</b>
           Generates a host encryption key for credentials, if one has
           not been generated already. This ensures the
           /var/lib/systemd/credential.secret file is initialized with a
           random secret key if it doesn't exist yet. This secret key is
           used when encrypting/decrypting credentials with <b>encrypt </b>or
           <b>decrypt</b>, and is only accessible to the root user. Note that
           there's typically no need to invoke this command explicitly
           as it is implicitly called when <b>encrypt </b>is invoked, and
           credential host key encryption selected.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>encrypt </b><i>input|- output|-</i>
           Loads the specified (unencrypted plaintext) input credential
           file, encrypts it and writes the (encrypted ciphertext)
           output to the specified target credential file. The resulting
           file may be referenced in the <i>LoadCredentialEncrypted=</i>
           setting in unit files, or its contents used literally in
           <i>SetCredentialEncrypted=</i> settings.

           Takes two file system paths. The file name part of the output
           path is embedded as name in the encrypted credential, to
           ensure encrypted credentials cannot be renamed and reused for
           different purposes without this being noticed. The credential
           name to embed may be overridden with the <b>--name= </b>setting. The
           input or output paths may be specified as "-", in which case
           the credential data is read from/written to standard input
           and standard output. If the output path is specified as "-"
           the credential name cannot be derived from the file system
           path, and thus should be specified explicitly via the <b>--name=</b>
           switch.

           The credential data is encrypted and authenticated
           symmetrically with one of the following encryption keys:

            1. A secret key automatically derived from the system's TPM2
               chip. This encryption key is not stored on the host
               system and thus decryption is only possible with access
               to the original TPM2 chip. Or in other words, the
               credential secured in this way can only be decrypted
               again by the local machine.

            2. A secret key stored in the
               /var/lib/systemd/credential.secret file which is only
               accessible to the root user. This "host" encryption key
               is stored on the host file system, and thus decryption is
               possible with access to the host file system and
               sufficient privileges. The key is automatically generated
               when needed, but can also be created explicitly with the
               <b>setup </b>command, see above.

            3. A combination of the above: an encryption key derived
               from both the TPM2 chip and the host file system. This
               means decryption requires both access to the original
               TPM2 chip and the OS installation. This is the default
               mode of operation if a TPM2 chip is available and
               /var/lib/systemd/ resides on persistent media.

           Which of the three keys shall be used for encryption may be
           configured with the <b>--with-key= </b>switch. Depending on the
           use-case for the encrypted credential the key to use may
           differ. For example, for credentials that shall be accessible
           from the initrd, encryption with the host key is not
           appropriate, since access to the host key is typically not
           available from the initrd. Thus, for such credentials only
           the TPM2 key should be used.

           Encrypted credentials are always encoded in Base64.

           Use <b>decrypt </b>(see below) to undo the encryption operation, and
           acquire the decrypted plaintext credential from the encrypted
           ciphertext credential.

           The credential data is encrypted using AES256-GCM, i.e.
           providing both confidentiality and integrity, keyed by a
           SHA256 hash of one or both of the secret keys described
           above.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>decrypt </b><i>input|-</i> [<i>output|-</i>]
           Undoes the effect of the <b>encrypt </b>operation: loads the
           specified (encrypted ciphertext) input credential file,
           decrypts and authenticates it and writes the (decrypted
           plaintext) output to the specified target credential file.

           Takes one or two file system paths. The file name part of the
           input path is compared with the credential name embedded in
           the encrypted file. If it does not match decryption fails.
           This is done in order to ensure that encrypted credentials
           are not re-purposed without this being detected. The
           credential name to compare with the embedded credential name
           may also be overridden with the <b>--name= </b>switch. If the input
           path is specified as "-", the encrypted credential is read
           from standard input. If only one path is specified or the
           output path specified as "-", the decrypted credential is
           written to standard output. In this mode, the expected name
           embedded in the credential cannot be derived from the path
           and should be specified explicitly with <b>--name=</b>.

           Decrypting credentials requires access to the original TPM2
           chip and/or credentials host key, see above. Information
           about which keys are required is embedded in the encrypted
           credential data, and thus decryption is entirely automatic.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>has-tpm2</b>
           Reports whether the system is equipped with a TPM2 device
           usable for protecting credentials. If a TPM2 device has been
           discovered, is supported, and is being used by firmware, by
           the OS kernel drivers and by userspace (i.e. systemd) this
           prints "yes" and exits with exit status zero. If no such
           device is discovered/supported/used, prints "no". Otherwise
           prints "partial". In either of these two cases exits with
           non-zero exit status. It also shows four lines indicating
           separately whether firmware, drivers, the system and the
           kernel discovered/support/use TPM2.

           Combine with <b>--quiet </b>to suppress the output.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--system</b>
           When specified with the <b>list </b>and <b>cat </b>commands operates on the
           credentials passed to system as a whole instead of on those
           passed to the current execution context. This is useful in
           container environments where credentials may be passed in
           from the container manager.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--user</b>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt </b>and <b>decrypt </b>commands encrypts
           a user-scoped (rather than a system-scoped) credential. Use
           <b>--uid= </b>to select which user the credential is from. Such
           credentials may only be decrypted from the specified user's
           context, except if privileges can be acquired. Generally,
           when an encrypted credential shall be used in the per-user
           service manager it should be encrypted with this option set,
           when it shall be used in the system service manager it should
           be encrypted without.

           Internally, this ensures that the selected user's numeric UID
           and username, as well as the system's <a href="../man5/machine-id.5.html">machine-id(5)</a> are
           incorporated into the encryption key.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--uid=</b>
           Specifies the user to encrypt the credential for. Takes a
           user name or numeric UID. If set, implies <b>--user</b>. If set to
           the special string "self" sets the user to the user of the
           calling process. If <b>--user </b>is used without <b>--uid= </b>then
           <b>--uid=self </b>is implied, i.e. the credential is encrypted for
           the calling user.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--transcode=</b>
           When specified with the <b>cat </b>or <b>decrypt </b>commands, transcodes
           the output before showing it. Takes one of "base64",
           "unbase64", "hex" or "unhex" as argument, in order to
           encode/decode the credential data with Base64 or as series of
           hexadecimal values.

           Note that this has no effect on the <b>encrypt </b>command, as
           encrypted credentials are unconditionally encoded in Base64.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--newline=</b>
           When specified with <b>cat </b>or <b>decrypt </b>controls whether to add a
           trailing newline character to the end of the output if it
           doesn't end in one, anyway. Takes one of "auto", "yes" or
           "no". The default mode of "auto" will suffix the output with
           a single newline character only when writing credential data
           to a TTY.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--pretty</b>, <b>-p</b>
           When specified with <b>encrypt </b>controls whether to show the
           encrypted credential as <i>SetCredentialEncrypted=</i> setting that
           may be pasted directly into a unit file. Has effect only when
           used together with <b>--name= </b>and "-" as the output file.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--name=</b><i>name</i>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt </b>command controls the
           credential name to embed in the encrypted credential data. If
           not specified the name is chosen automatically from the
           filename component of the specified output path. If specified
           as empty string no credential name is embedded in the
           encrypted credential, and no verification of credential name
           is done when the credential is decrypted.

           When specified with the <b>decrypt </b>command control the
           credential name to validate the credential name embedded in
           the encrypted credential with. If not specified the name is
           chosen automatically from the filename component of the
           specified input path. If no credential name is embedded in
           the encrypted credential file (i.e. the <b>--name= </b>with an empty
           string was used when encrypted) the specified name has no
           effect as no credential name validation is done.

           Embedding the credential name in the encrypted credential is
           done in order to protect against reuse of credentials for
           purposes they weren't originally intended for, under the
           assumption the credential name is chosen carefully to encode
           its intended purpose.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--timestamp=</b><i>timestamp</i>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt </b>command controls the
           timestamp to embed into the encrypted credential. Defaults to
           the current time. Takes a timestamp specification in the
           format described in <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a>.

           When specified with the <b>decrypt </b>command controls the
           timestamp to use to validate the "not-after" timestamp that
           was configured with <b>--not-after= </b>during encryption. If not
           specified defaults to the current system time.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--not-after=</b><i>timestamp</i>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt </b>command controls the time
           when the credential shall not be used anymore. This embeds
           the specified timestamp in the encrypted credential. During
           decryption the timestamp is checked against the current
           system clock, and if the timestamp is in the past the
           decryption will fail. By default no such timestamp is set.
           Takes a timestamp specification in the format described in
           <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a>.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--with-key=</b>, <b>-H</b>, <b>-T</b>
           When specified with the <b>encrypt </b>command controls the
           encryption/signature key to use. Takes one of "host", "tpm2",
           "host+tpm2", "null", "auto", "auto-initrd". See above for
           details on the three key types. If set to "auto" (which is
           the default) the TPM2 key is used if a TPM2 device is found
           and not running in a container. The host key is used if
           /var/lib/systemd/ is on persistent media. This means on
           typical systems the encryption is by default bound to both
           the TPM2 chip and the OS installation, and both need to be
           available to decrypt the credential again. If "auto" is
           selected but neither TPM2 is available (or running in
           container) nor /var/lib/systemd/ is on persistent media,
           encryption will fail. If set to "null" a fixed zero length
           key is used (thus, in this mode no confidentiality nor
           authenticity are provided!). This logic is useful to cover
           for systems that lack a TPM2 chip but where credentials shall
           be generated. Note that decryption of such credentials is
           refused on systems that have a TPM2 chip and where UEFI
           SecureBoot is enabled (this is done so that such a locked
           down system cannot be tricked into loading a credential
           generated this way that lacks authentication information). If
           set to "auto-initrd" a TPM2 key is used if a TPM2 is found.
           If not a fixed zero length key is used, equivalent to "null"
           mode. This option is particularly useful to generate
           credentials files that are encrypted/authenticated against
           TPM2 where available but still work on systems lacking
           support for this.

           The <b>-H </b>switch is a shortcut for <b>--with-key=host</b>. Similar, <b>-T</b>
           is a shortcut for <b>--with-key=tpm2</b>.

           When encrypting credentials that shall be used in the initrd
           (where /var/lib/systemd/ is typically not available) make
           sure to use <b>--with-key=auto-initrd </b>mode, to disable binding
           against the host secret.

           This switch has no effect on the <b>decrypt </b>command, as
           information on which key to use for decryption is included in
           the encrypted credential already.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--tpm2-device=</b><i>PATH</i>
           Controls the TPM2 device to use. Expects a device node path
           referring to the TPM2 chip (e.g.  /dev/tpmrm0). Alternatively
           the special value "auto" may be specified, in order to
           automatically determine the device node of a suitable TPM2
           device (of which there must be exactly one). The special
           value "list" may be used to enumerate all suitable TPM2
           devices currently discovered.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--tpm2-pcrs=</b><i>PCR[+PCR...]</i>
           Configures the TPM2 PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers)
           to bind the encryption key to. Takes a "+" separated list of
           numeric PCR indexes in the range 0...23. If not used,
           defaults to PCR 7 only. If an empty string is specified,
           binds the encryption key to no PCRs at all. For details about
           the PCRs available, see the documentation of the switch of
           the same name for <a href="systemd-cryptenroll.1.html">systemd-cryptenroll(1)</a>.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--tpm2-public-key=</b><i>PATH</i>, <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</b><i>PCR[+PCR...]</i>
           Configures a TPM2 signed PCR policy to bind encryption to,
           for use with the <b>encrypt </b>command. The <b>--tpm2-public-key=</b>
           option accepts a path to a PEM encoded RSA public key, to
           bind the encryption to. If this is not specified explicitly,
           but a file tpm2-pcr-public-key.pem exists in one of the
           directories /etc/systemd/, /run/systemd/, /usr/lib/systemd/
           (searched in this order), it is automatically used. The
           <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs= </b>option takes a list of TPM2 PCR
           indexes to bind to (same syntax as <b>--tpm2-pcrs= </b>described
           above). If not specified defaults to 11 (i.e. this binds the
           policy to any unified kernel image for which a PCR signature
           can be provided).

           Note the difference between <b>--tpm2-pcrs= </b>and
           <b>--tpm2-public-key-pcrs=</b>: the former binds decryption to the
           current, specific PCR values; the latter binds decryption to
           any set of PCR values for which a signature by the specified
           public key can be provided. The latter is hence more useful
           in scenarios where software updates shall be possible without
           losing access to all previously encrypted secrets.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--tpm2-signature=</b><i>PATH</i>
           Takes a path to a TPM2 PCR signature file as generated by the
           <a href="systemd-measure.1.html">systemd-measure(1)</a> tool and that may be used to allow the
           <b>decrypt </b>command to decrypt credentials that are bound to
           specific signed PCR values. If this is not specified
           explicitly, and a credential with a signed PCR policy is
           attempted to be decrypted, a suitable signature file
           tpm2-pcr-signature.json is searched for in /etc/systemd/,
           /run/systemd/, /usr/lib/systemd/ (in this order) and used.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--allow-null</b>
           Allow decrypting credentials that use an empty key.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--quiet</b>, <b>-q</b>
           When used with <b>has-tpm2 </b>suppresses the output, and only
           returns an exit status indicating support for TPM2.

           Added in version 251.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer
           with hints.

       <b>--json=</b><i>MODE</i>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for
           the shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace
           or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same,
           with indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON
           output, the default).

EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned.

       In case of the <b>has-tpm2 </b>command returns 0 if a TPM2 device is
       discovered, supported and used by firmware, driver, and userspace
       (i.e. systemd). Otherwise returns the OR combination of the value
       1 (in case firmware support is missing), 2 (in case driver
       support is missing) and 4 (in case userspace support is missing).
       If no TPM2 support is available at all, value 7 is hence
       returned.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Example 1. Encrypt a password for use as credential</b>

       The following command line encrypts the specified password
       "hunter2", writing the result to a file password.cred.

           # echo -n hunter2 | systemd-creds encrypt - password.cred

       This decrypts the file password.cred again, revealing the literal
       password:

           # systemd-creds decrypt password.cred
           hunter2

       <b>Example 2. Encrypt a password and include it in a unit file</b>

       The following command line prompts the user for a password and
       generates a <i>SetCredentialEncrypted=</i> line from it for a credential
       named "mysql-password", suitable for inclusion in a unit file.

           # systemd-ask-password -n | systemd-creds encrypt --name=mysql-password -p - -
           🔐 Password: ****
           SetCredentialEncrypted=mysql-password: \

       The generated line can be pasted 1:1 into a unit file, and will
       ensure the acquired password will be made available in the
       <i>$CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY</i>/mysql-password credential file for the
       started service.

       Utilizing the unit file drop-in logic this can be used to
       securely pass a password credential to a unit. A similar, more
       comprehensive set of commands to insert a password into a service
       xyz.service:

           # mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/xyz.service.d
           # systemd-ask-password -n | ( echo "[Service]" &amp;&amp; systemd-creds encrypt --name=mysql-password -p - - ) &gt;/etc/systemd/system/xyz.service.d/50-password.conf
           # systemctl daemon-reload
           # systemctl restart xyz.service
