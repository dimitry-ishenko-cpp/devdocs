       abidw - serialize the ABI of an ELF file

       abidw reads a shared library in <i>ELF</i> format and emits an XML
       representation of its ABI to standard output.  The emitted
       representation format, named <b>ABIXML</b>, includes all the globally
       defined functions and variables, along with a complete
       representation of their types.  It also includes a representation
       of the globally defined ELF symbols of the file.

       When given the <b>--linux-tree </b>option, this program can also handle
       a <i>Linux kernel</i> tree.  That is, a directory tree that contains
       both the vmlinux binary and <i>Linux Kernel</i> modules.  It analyses
       those <i>Linux Kernel</i> binaries and emits an XML representation of
       the interface between the kernel and its module, to standard
       output.  In this case, we don't call it an ABI, but a KMI (Kernel
       Module Interface).  The emitted KMI includes all the globally
       defined functions and variables, along with a complete
       representation of their types.

       To generate either ABI or KMI representation, by default <b>abidw</b>
       uses debug information in the <i>DWARF</i> format, if present, otherwise
       it looks for debug information in <i>CTF</i> or <i>BTF</i> formats, if present.
       Finally, if no debug info in these formats is found, it only
       considers <i>ELF</i> symbols and report about their addition or removal.

       This tool uses the libabigail library to analyze the binary as
       well as its associated debug information.  Here is its general
       mode of operation.

       When instructed to do so, a binary and its associated debug
       information is read and analyzed.  To that effect, libabigail
       analyzes by default the descriptions of the types reachable by
       the interfaces (functions and variables) that are visible outside
       of their translation unit.  Once that analysis is done, an
       Application Binary Interface Corpus is constructed by only
       considering the subset of types reachable from interfaces
       associated to <i>ELF</i> symbols that are defined and exported by the
       binary.  It's that final ABI corpus which libabigail considers as
       representing the ABI of the analyzed binary.

       Libabigail then has capabilities to generate textual
       representations of ABI Corpora, compare them, analyze their
       changes and report about them.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
          • <b>--help | -h</b>

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          • <b>--version | -v</b>

            Display the version of the program and exit.

          • <b>--abixml-version</b>

            Display the version of the ABIXML format emitted by this
            program and exit.

          • <b>--add-binaries </b>&lt;<i>bin1,bin2,...</i>&gt;

            For each of the comma-separated binaries given in argument
            to this option, if the binary is found in the directory
            specified by the <i>--added-binaries-dir</i> option, then load the
            ABI corpus of the binary and add it to a set of ABI corpora
            (called a ABI Corpus Group) made of the binary denoted by
            the Argument of <b>abidw</b>.  That corpus group is then serialized
            out.

          • <b>--follow-dependencies</b>

            For each dependency of the input binary of <b>abidw</b>, if it is
            found in the directory specified by the <b>--added-binaries-dir</b>
            option, then construct an ABI corpus out of the dependency
            and add it to a set of ABI corpora (called an ABI Corpus
            Group) along with the ABI corpus of the input binary of the
            program.  The ABI Corpus Group is then serialized out.

          • <b>--list-dependencies</b>

            For each dependency of the input binary of``abidw``, if it's
            found in the directory specified by the <b>--added-binaries-dir</b>
            option, then the name of the dependency is printed out.

          • <b>--added-binaries-dir | --abd </b>&lt;<i>dir-path</i>&gt;

            This option is to be used in conjunction with the
            <b>--add-binaries</b>, the <b>--follow-dependencies </b>or the
            <b>--list-dependencies </b>option.  Binaries listed as arguments of
            the <b>--add-binaries </b>option or being dependencies of the input
            binary in the case of the <b>--follow-dependencies </b>option and
            found in the directory &lt;<i>dir-path</i>&gt; are going to be loaded as
            ABI corpus and added to the set of ABI corpora (called an
            ABI corpus group) built and serialized.

          • <b>--debug-info-dir | -d </b>&lt;<i>dir-path</i>&gt;

            In cases where the debug info for <i>path-to-elf-file</i> is in a
            separate file that is located in a non-standard place, this
            tells <b>abidw </b>where to look for that debug info file.

            Note that <i>dir-path</i> must point to the root directory under
            which the debug information is arranged in a tree-like
            manner.  Under Red Hat based systems, that directory is
            usually <b>&lt;root&gt;/usr/lib/debug</b>.

            This option can be provided several times with different
            root directories.  In that case, <b>abidw </b>will potentially look
            into all those root directories to find the split debug info
            for the elf file.

            Note that this option is not mandatory for split debug
            information installed by your system's package manager
            because then <b>abidw </b>knows where to find it.

          • <b>--out-file | -o </b>&lt;<i>file-path</i>&gt;

            This option instructs <b>abidw </b>to emit the XML representation
            of <i>path-to-elf-file</i> into the file <i>file-path</i>, rather than
            emitting it to its standard output.

          • <b>--noout</b>

            This option instructs <b>abidw </b>to not emit the XML
            representation of the ABI.  So it only reads the ELF and
            debug information, builds the internal representation of the
            ABI and exits.  This option is usually useful for debugging
            purposes.

          • <b>--no-corpus-path</b>

            Do not emit the path attribute for the ABI corpus.

          • <b>--suppressions | suppr</b>
            &lt;<i>path-to-suppression-specifications-file</i>&gt;

            Use a <i>suppression specification</i> file located at
            <i>path-to-suppression-specifications-file</i>.  Note that this
            option can appear multiple times on the command line.  In
            that case, all of the provided suppression specification
            files are taken into account.  ABI artifacts matched by the
            suppression specifications are suppressed from the output of
            this tool.

          • <b>--kmi-whitelist | -kaw </b>&lt;<i>path-to-whitelist</i>&gt;

            When analyzing a <i>Linux Kernel</i> binary, this option points to
            the white list of names of ELF symbols of functions and
            variables which ABI must be written out.  That white list is
            called a " Kernel Module Interface white list".  This is
            because for the Kernel, we don't talk about the ABI; we
            rather talk about the interface between the Kernel and its
            module. Hence the term <b>KMI </b>rather than <b>ABI</b>

            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not
            present in that white list will not be considered by the KMI
            writing process.

            If this option is not provided -- thus if no white list is
            provided -- then the entire KMI, that is, all publicly
            defined and exported functions and global variables by the
            <i>Linux Kernel</i> binaries is emitted.

          • <b>--linux-tree | --lt</b>

            Make <b>abidw </b>to consider the input path as a path to a
            directory containing the vmlinux binary as several kernel
            modules binaries.  In that case, this program emits the
            representation of the Kernel Module Interface (KMI) on the
            standard output.

            Below is an example of usage of <b>abidw </b>on a <i>Linux Kernel</i>
            tree.

            First, checkout a <i>Linux Kernel</i> source tree and build it.
            Then install the kernel modules in a directory somewhere.
            Copy the vmlinux binary into that directory too.  And then
            serialize the KMI of that kernel to disk, using <b>abidw</b>:

                $ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
                $ cd linux &amp;&amp; git checkout v4.5
                $ make allyesconfig all
                $ mkdir build-output
                $ make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=./build-output modules_install
                $ cp vmlinux build-output/modules/4.5.0
                $ abidw --linux-tree build-output/modules/4.5.0 &gt; build-output/linux-4.5.0.kmi

          • <b>--headers-dir | --hd </b>&lt;headers-directory-path-1&gt;

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the binary
            that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus filter
            out types that are not defined in public headers.

            Note that several public header directories can be specified
            for the binary to consider.  In that case the <b>--header-dir</b>
            option should be present several times on the command line,
            like in the following example:

                $ abidw --header-dir /some/path       \
                        --header-dir /some/other/path \
                        binary &gt; binary.abi

          • <b>--header-file | --hf </b>&lt;header-file-path&gt;

            Specifies where to find one of the public headers of the abi
            file that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus
            filter out types that are not defined in public headers.

          • <b>--drop-private-types</b>

            This option is to be used with the <b>--headers-dir </b>and/or
            <b>header-file </b>options.  With this option, types that are <i>NOT</i>
            defined in the headers are entirely dropped from the
            internal representation build by Libabigail to represent the
            ABI and will not end up in the abi XML file.

          • <b>--no-elf-needed</b>

            Do not include the list of DT_NEEDED dependency names in the
            corpus.

          • <b>--drop-undefined-syms</b>

            With this option functions or variables for which the
            (exported) ELF symbol is undefined are dropped from the
            internal representation build by Libabigail to represent the
            ABI and will not end up in the abi XML file.

          • <b>--exported-interfaces-only</b>

            By default, when looking at the debug information
            accompanying a binary, this tool analyzes the descriptions
            of the types reachable by the interfaces (functions and
            variables) that are visible outside of their translation
            unit.  Once that analysis is done, an ABI corpus is
            constructed by only considering the subset of types
            reachable from interfaces associated to <i>ELF</i> symbols that are
            defined and exported by the binary.  It's that final ABI
            corpus which textual representation is saved as <b>ABIXML</b>.

            The problem with that approach however is that analyzing all
            the interfaces that are visible from outside their
            translation unit can amount to a lot of data, especially
            when those binaries are applications, as opposed to shared
            libraries.  One example of such applications is the <i>Linux</i>
            <i>Kernel</i>.  Analyzing massive ABI corpora like these can be
            extremely slow.

            To mitigate that performance issue, this option allows
            libabigail to only analyze types that are reachable from
            interfaces associated with defined and exported <i>ELF</i> symbols.

            Note that this option is turned on by default when analyzing
            the <i>Linux Kernel</i>.  Otherwise, it's turned off by default.

          • <b>--allow-non-exported-interfaces</b>

            When looking at the debug information accompanying a binary,
            this tool analyzes the descriptions of the types reachable
            by the interfaces (functions and variables) that are visible
            outside of their translation unit.  Once that analysis is
            done, an ABI corpus is constructed by only considering the
            subset of types reachable from interfaces associated to <i>ELF</i>
            symbols that are defined and exported by the binary.  It's
            that final ABI corpus which textual representation is saved
            as <b>ABIXML</b>.

            The problem with that approach however is that analyzing all
            the interfaces that are visible from outside their
            translation unit can amount to a lot of data, especially
            when those binaries are applications, as opposed to shared
            libraries.  One example of such applications is the <i>Linux</i>
            <i>Kernel</i>.  Analyzing massive ABI corpora like these can be
            extremely slow.

            In the presence of an "average sized" binary however one can
            afford having libabigail analyze all interfaces that are
            visible outside of their translation unit, using this
            option.

            Note that this option is turned on by default, unless we are
            in the presence of the <i>Linux Kernel</i>.

          • <b>--no-linux-kernel-mode</b>

            Without this option, if abipkgiff detects that the binaries
            it is looking at are Linux Kernel binaries (either vmlinux
            or modules) then it only considers functions and variables
            which ELF symbols are listed in the __ksymtab and
            __ksymtab_gpl sections.

            With this option, abipkgdiff considers the binary as a
            non-special ELF binary.  It thus considers functions and
            variables which are defined and exported in the ELF sense.

          • <b>--check-alternate-debug-info </b>&lt;<i>elf-path</i>&gt;

            If the debug info for the file <i>elf-path</i> contains a reference
            to an <i>alternate debug info</i> file, <b>abidw </b>checks that it can
            find that alternate debug info file.  In that case, it emits
            a meaningful success message mentioning the full path to the
            alternate debug info file found.  Otherwise, it emits an
            error code.

          • <b>--no-show-locs</b>
              In the emitted ABI representation, do not show file, line
              or column where ABI artifacts are defined.

          • <b>--no-parameter-names</b>

            In the emitted ABI representation, do not show names of
            function parameters, just the types.

          • <b>--no-write-default-sizes</b>

            In the XML ABI representation, do not write the size-in-bits
            for pointer type definitions, reference type definitions,
            function declarations and function types when they are equal
            to the default address size of the translation unit.  Note
            that libabigail before 1.8 will not set the default size and
            will interpret types without a size-in-bits attribute as
            zero sized.

          • <b>--type-id-style </b>&lt;<b>sequence``|``hash</b>&gt;

            This option controls how types are idenfied in the generated
            XML files.  The default <b>sequence </b>style just numbers (with
            <b>type-id- </b>as prefix) the types in the order they are
            encountered.  The <b>hash </b>style uses a (stable, portable) hash
            of libabigail's internal type names and is intended to make
            the XML files easier to diff.

          • <b>--check-alternate-debug-info-base-name </b>&lt;<i>elf-path</i>&gt;

            Like <b>--check-alternate-debug-info</b>, but in the success
            message, only mention the base name of the debug info file;
            not its full path.

          • <b>--load-all-types</b>

            By default, <b>libabigail </b>(and thus <b>abidw</b>) only loads types
            that are reachable from functions and variables declarations
            that are publicly defined and exported by the binary.  So
            only those types are present in the output of <b>abidw</b>.  This
            option however makes <b>abidw </b>load <i>all</i> the types defined in the
            binaries, even those that are not reachable from public
            declarations.

            • <b>--no-load-undefined-interfaces</b>

            By default, <b>libabigail </b>(and thus <b>abidw</b>) loads information
            about undefined function and variable symbols as well as
            functions and variables that are associated with those
            undefined symbols.  Those are called undefined interfaces.
            This option however makes makes <b>abidw </b>avoid loading
            information about undefined interfaces.  The resulting XML
            file thus doesn't contain information about those undefined
            interfaces.

          • <b>--abidiff</b>
              Load the ABI of the ELF binary given in argument, save it
              in libabigail's XML format in a temporary file; read the
              ABI from the temporary XML file and compare the ABI that
              has been read back against the ABI of the ELF binary given
              in argument.  The ABIs should compare equal.  If they
              don't, the program emits a diagnostic and exits with a
              non-zero code.

              This is a debugging and sanity check option.

              • <b>--debug-abidiff</b>

              Same as <b>--abidiff </b>but in debug mode.  In this mode, error
              messages are emitted for types which fail type
              canonicalization.

              This is an optional debugging and sanity check option.  To
              enable it the libabigail package needs to be configured
              with the --enable-debug-self-comparison option.

              • <b>--debug-type-canonicalization | --debug-tc</b>

              Debug the type canonicalization process.  This is done by
              using structural and canonical equality when
              canonicalizing every single type.  Structural and
              canonical equality should yield the same result.  If they
              don't yield the same result for a given type, then it
              means that the canonicalization of that type went wrong.
              In that case, an error message is emitted and the
              execution of the program is aborted.

              This option is available only if the package was
              configured with the --enable-debug-type-canonicalization
              option.

          • <b>--no-assume-odr-for-cplusplus</b>

            When analysing a binary originating from C++ code using
            <i>DWARF</i> debug information, libabigail assumes the <i>One</i>
            <i>Definition Rule</i> to speed-up the analysis.  In that case,
            when several types have the same name in the binary, they
            are assumed to all be equal.

            This option disables that assumption and instructs
            libabigail to actually actually compare the types to
            determine if they are equal.

          • <b>--no-leverage-dwarf-factorization</b>

            When analysing a binary which <i>DWARF</i> debug information was
            processed with the <i>DWZ</i> tool, the type information is
            supposed to be already factorized.  That context is used by
            libabigail to perform some speed optimizations.

            This option disables those optimizations.

          • <b>--ctf</b>

            Extract ABI information from <i>CTF</i> debug information, if
            present in the given object.

          • <b>--annotate</b>
              Annotate the ABIXML output with comments above most
              elements.  The comments are made of the pretty-printed
              form types, declaration or even ELF symbols.  The purpose
              is to make the ABIXML output more human-readable for
              debugging or documenting purposes.

          • <b>--stats</b>

            Emit statistics about various internal things.

          • <b>--verbose</b>

            Emit verbose logs about the progress of miscellaneous
            internal things.

USAGE EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
          1. Emitting an <b>ABIXML </b>representation of a binary:

                 $ abidw binary &gt; binary.abi

          2. Emitting an <b>ABIXML </b>representation of a set of binaries
             specified on the command line:

                 $ abidw --added-binaries=bin1,bin2,bin3  \
                         --added-binaries-dir /some/where \
                         binary &gt; binaries.abi

             Note that the binaries bin1, bin2 and bin3 are to be found
             in the directory <b>/some/where</b>.  A representation of the ABI
             of the set of binaries <b>binary, bin1, bin2 </b>and <b>bin3 </b>called
             an <b>ABI corpus group </b>is serialized in the file binaries.abi.

          3. Emitting an <b>ABIXML </b>representation of a binary and its
             dependencies:

                 $ abidw --follow-dependencies              \
                         --added-binaries-dir /some/where   \
                         binary &gt; binary.abi

             Note that only the dependencies that are found in the
             directory <b>/some/where </b>are analysed.  Their ABIs, along with
             the ABI the binary named <b>binary </b>are represented as an ABI
             corpus group and serialized in the file <b>binary.abi</b>, in the
             ABIXML format.
