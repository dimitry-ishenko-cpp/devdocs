SYNOPSIS </h2>

       <b>fusermount3 </b>[<i>OPTIONS</i>] <i>MOUNTPOINT</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a simple interface for
       userspace programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux
       kernel. It also aims to provide a secure method for non
       privileged users to create and mount their own filesystem
       implementations.

       <b>fusermount3 </b>is a program to mount and unmount FUSE filesystems.
       It should be called directly only for unmounting FUSE file
       systems. To allow mounting and unmounting by unprivileged users,
       <b>fusermount3 </b>needs to be installed set-uid root.
