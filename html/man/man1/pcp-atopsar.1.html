</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pcp-atopsar </b>program can be used to report statistics at the
       system level.

       In the first synopsis line (no sampling interval specified), <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>atopsar </b>extracts data from a raw logfile that has been recorded
       previously by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> (or via the <b>-w </b>option of the <b>pcp-atop</b>
       program).
       You can specify the name of the logfile with the <b>-r </b>option of the
       <b>pcp-atopsar </b>program.  When a <b>pmlogger </b>daily logfile is used,
       named <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/[host]/YYYYMMDD </b>(where YYYYMMDD
       reflects the date), the required date of the form YYYYMMDD can be
       specified with the <b>-r </b>option instead of the filename, or the
       symbolic name 'y' can be used for yesterday's daily logfile (this
       can be repeated so 'yyyy' indicates the logfile of four days
       ago).  If the <b>-r </b>option is not specified at all, today's daily
       logfile is used by default.
       By default, the hostname of the localhost will be used when
       resolving <b>pmlogger </b>archives, however an alternative <i>host</i> can be
       specified using the <b>-h </b>option.
       The starting and ending times of the report can be defined using
       the options <b>-b </b>and <b>-e </b>followed by a time argument of the form
       [YYYYMMDD]hh:mm[ss].

       In the second synopsis line, <b>pcp-atopsar </b>reads actual activity
       counters from the kernel with the specified <i>interval</i> (in seconds)
       and the specified number of <i>samples</i> (optionally).  When <b>pcp-</b>
       <b>atopsar </b>is activated in this way it immediately sends the output
       for every requested report to standard output.  If only one type
       of report is requested, the header is printed once and after
       every <i>interval</i> seconds the statistical counters are shown for
       that period.  If several reports are requested, a header is
       printed per sample followed by the statistical counters for that
       period.

       When invoked via the <a href="pcp.1.html">pcp(1)</a> command, the <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> options
       <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>, <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>, <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>,
       <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>, <b>-Z</b>/<b>--timezone </b>and several other <i>pcp options</i> become
       indirectly available, see <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for their descriptions.

       Some generic flags can be specified to influence the behaviour of
       the <b>pcp-atopsar </b>program:

       <b>-S   </b>By default the timestamp at the beginning of a line is
            suppressed if more lines are shown for one interval. With
            this flag a timestamp is given for every output-line (easier
            for post-processing).

       <b>-a   </b>By default certain resources as disks and network interfaces
            are only shown when they were active during the interval.
            With this flag all resources of a given type are shown, even
            if they were inactive during the interval.

       <b>-x   </b>By default <b>pcp-atopsar </b>only uses colors if output is
            directed to a terminal (window).  These colors might
            indicate that a critical occupation percentage has been
            reached (red) or has been almost reached (cyan) for a
            particular resource.  See the man-page of <b>atop </b>for a
            detailed description of this feature (section COLORS).
            With the flag <b>-x </b>the use of colors is suppressed
            unconditionally.

       <b>-C   </b>By default <b>pcp-atopsar </b>only uses colors if output is
            directed to a terminal (window).  These colors might
            indicate that a critical occupation percentage has been
            reached (red) or has been almost reached (cyan) for a
            particular resource.  See the man-page of <b>atop </b>for a
            detailed description of this feature (section COLORS).
            With the flag <b>-C </b>colors will always be used, even if output
            is not directed to a terminal.

       <b>-M   </b>Use markers at the end of a line to indicate that a critical
            occupation percentage has been reached ('*') or has been
            almost reached ('+') for particular resources. The marker
            '*' is similar to the color red and the marker '+' to the
            color cyan. See the man-page of <b>atop </b>for a detailed
            description of these colors (section COLORS).

       <b>-H   </b>Repeat the header line within a report for every <i>N</i> detail
            lines. The value of <i>N</i> is determined dynamically in case of
            output to a tty/window (depending on the number of lines);
            for output to a file or pipe this value is 23.

       <b>-R   </b>Summarize <i>cnt</i> samples into one sample. When the logfile
            contains e.g. samples of 10 minutes, the use of the flag '-R
            6' shows a report with one sample for every hour.

       Other flags are used to define which reports are required:

       <b>-A   </b>Show all possible reports.

       <b>-c   </b>Report about CPU utilization (in total and per cpu).

       <b>-g   </b>Report about GPU utilization (per GPU).

       <b>-m   </b>Current memory- and swap-occupation.

       <b>-s   </b>Report about paging- and swapping-activity, and
            overcommitment.

            Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
            Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive files identified by the
            argument <i>archive</i>, which is a comma-separated list of names,
            each of which may be the base name of an archive or the name
            of a directory containing one or more archives.

       <b>--finish</b>=<i>endtime</i>
            When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
            restricted to those records logged before or at <i>endtime</i>.
            Refer to <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for a complete description of the

OUTPUT DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Depending on the requested report, a number of columns with
       output values are produced.  The values are mostly presented as a
       number of events per second.

       The output for the flag <b>-c </b>contains the following columns per
       cpu:

       <b>usr%   </b>Percentage of cpu-time consumed in user mode (program
              text) for all active processes running with a nice value
              of zero (default) or a negative nice value (which means a
              higher priority than usual).  The cpu consumption in user
              mode of processes with a nice value larger than zero
              (lower priority) is indicated in the nice%-column.

       <b>nice%  </b>Percentage of cpu time consumed in user mode (i.e. program
              text) for all processes running witn a nice value larger
              than zero (which means with a lower priority than
              average).

       <b>sys%   </b>Percentage of cpu time consumed in system mode (kernel
              text) for all active processes. A high percentage usually
              indicates a lot of system calls being issued.

       <b>irq%   </b>Percentage of cpu time consumed for handling of device
              interrupts.

       <b>softirq%</b>
              Percentage of cpu time consumed for soft interrupt
              handling.

       <b>steal% </b>Percentage of cpu time stolen by other virtual machines
              running on the same hardware.

       <b>guest% </b>Percentage of cpu time used by other virtual machines
              running on the same hardware (overlaps with usr%/nice%).

       <b>wait%  </b>Percentage of unused cpu time while at least one of the
              processes in wait-state awaits completion of disk I/O.

       <b>idle%  </b>Percentage of unused cpu time because all processes are in
              a wait-state but not waiting for disk-I/O.

       The output for the flag <b>-g </b>contains the following columns per
       GPU:

       <b>busaddr</b>

              cpu) enters a wait state or has used its time slice
              completely; another thread will then be chosen to use the
              cpu.

       <b>tidle  </b>Total number of threads present in the system in state
              'idle' (uninterruptible sleeping but not counted in the
              load average).

       The output for the flag <b>-m </b>contains information about the memory-
       and swap-utilization:

       <b>memtotal</b>
              Total usable main memory size.

              Number of packets transmitted to this port per second.

       <b>igbps/s</b>
              Effective number of gigabits received per second.

       <b>ogbps/s</b>
              Effective number of gigabits transmitted per second.

       <b>maxgbps/s</b>
              Maximum rate as number of gigabits per second.

       <b>lanes  </b>Number of lanes.

       The output for the flag <b>-O </b>provides information about the top-3
       of processes with the highest processor consumption:

       <b>pid    </b>Process-id (if zero, the process has exited while the pid
              could not be determined).

       <b>command</b>
              The name of the process.

       <b>cpu%   </b>The percentage of cpu-capacity being consumed.  This value
              can exceed 100% for a multithreaded process running on a
              multiprocessor machine.

       The output for the flag <b>-G </b>provides information about the top-3
       of processes with the highest memory consumption:

       <b>pid    </b>Process-id (if zero, the process has exited while the pid
              could not be determined).

       <b>command</b>
              The name of the process.

       <b>mem%   </b>The percentage of resident memory-utilization by this
              process.

       The output for the flag <b>-D </b>provides information about the top-3
       of processes that issue the most read and write accesses to disk:

       <b>pid    </b>Process-id (if zero, the process has exited while the pid
              could not be determined).

       <b>command</b>
              The name of the process.

       <b>dsk%   </b>The percentage of read and write accesses related to the
              total number of read and write accesses issued on disk by
              all processes, so a high percentage does not imply a high
              disk load on system level.

       The output for the flag <b>-N </b>provides information about the top-3
       of processes that issue the most socket transfers for IPv4/IPv6:

       <b>pid    </b>Process-id (if zero, the process has exited while the pid
              could not be determined).

       <b>command</b>
              The name of the process.

       <b>net%   </b>The percentage of socket transfers related to the total
              number of transfers issued by all processes, so a high
              percentage does not imply a high network load on system
              level.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To see today's cpu-activity so far (supposed that <b>atop </b>is logging
       in the background):

         <b>pcp-atopsar</b>

       To see the memory occupation for June 5, 2018 between 10:00 and
       12:30 (supposed that <b>pmlogger </b>has been logging daily in the
       background on host acme.com):

         <b>pcp-atopsar -m -r $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/acme.com/20180605 -b</b>
       <b>10:00 -e 12:30</b>

              or

         <b>pcp-atopsar -m -r 20180605 -b 10:00 -e 12:30</b>

              or, suppose it is June 8, 2018 at this moment

         <b>pcp-atopsar -m -r yyy -b 10:00 -e 12:30</b>

       Write a logfile with <b>atop </b>to record the system behaviour for 30
       minutes (30 samples of one minute) and produce all available
       reports afterwards:

         <b>pcp-atop -w /tmp/atoplog 60 30</b>

         <b>pcp-atopsar -A -r /tmp/atoplog</b>

       To watch TCP activity evolve for ten minutes (10 samples with
       sixty seconds interval):

         <b>pcp-atopsar -t 60 10</b>

       To watch the header-lines ('_' as last character) of all reports
       with only the detail-lines showing critical resource consumption
       (marker '*' or '+' as last character):

         <b>pcp-atopsar -AM | grep '[_*+]$'</b>
