NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-install - Install an application or runtime
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak install </b>[OPTION...] [REMOTE] REF...

       <b>flatpak install </b>[OPTION...] [--from|--bundle] LOCATION
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Installs an application or runtime. The primary way to install is
       to specify a REMOTE name as the source and one ore more REFs to
       specify the application or runtime to install. If REMOTE is
       omitted, the configured remotes are searched for the first REF
       and the user is asked to confirm the resulting choice.

       Each REF argument is a full or partial identifier in the flatpak
       ref format, which looks like "(app|runtime)/ID/ARCH/BRANCH". All
       elements except ID are optional and can be left out, including
       the slashes, so most of the time you need only specify ID. Any
       part left out will be matched against what is in the remote, and
       if there are multiple matches you will be prompted to choose one
       of them. You will also be prompted with choices if REF doesn't
       match anything in the remote exactly but is similar to one or
       more refs in the remote (e.g. "devhelp" is similar to
       "org.gnome.Devhelp"), but this fuzzy matching behavior is
       disabled if REF contains any slashes or periods.

       By default this looks for both apps and runtimes with the given
       REF in the specified REMOTE, but you can limit this by using the
       <b>--app </b>or <b>--runtime </b>option, or by supplying the initial element in
       the REF.

       If REMOTE is a uri or a path (absolute or relative starting with
       ./) to a local repository, then that repository will be used as
       the source, and a temporary remote will be created for the
       lifetime of the REF.

       If the specified REMOTE has a collection ID configured on it,
       Flatpak will search the sideload-repos directories configured
       either with the <b>--sideload-repo </b>option, or on a per-installation
       or system-wide basis (see <a href="flatpak.1.html">flatpak(1)</a>).

       The alternative form of the command (with <b>--from </b>or <b>--bundle</b>)
       allows to install directly from a source such as a .flatpak
       single-file bundle or a .flatpakref application description. The
       options are optional if the first argument has the expected
       filename extension.

       Note that flatpak allows to have multiple branches of an
       application and runtimes installed and used at the same time.
       However, only one version of an application can be current,
       meaning its exported files (for instance desktop files and icons)
       are visible to the host. The last installed version is made
       current by default, but this can manually changed with flatpak
       make-current.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user </b>or the <b>--installation </b>option,
       this command installs the application or runtime in the default
       system-wide installation.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>--bundle</b>
           Treat LOCATION as a single-bundle file. This is assumed if
           the argument ends with .flatpak.

       <b>--from</b>
           Treat LOCATION as an application description file. This is
           assumed if the argument ends with .flatpakref.

       <b>--reinstall</b>
           Uninstall first if already installed.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Install the application or runtime in a per-user
           installation.

       <b>--system</b>
           Install the application or runtime in the default system-wide
           installation.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Install the application or runtime in a system-wide
           installation specified by NAME among those defined in
           /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using <b>--installation=default</b>
           is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--arch=ARCH</b>
           The default architecture to install for, if not given
           explicitly in the REF. See <b>flatpak --supported-arches </b>for
           architectures supported by the host.

       <b>--subpath=PATH</b>
           Install only a subpath of REF. This is mainly used to install
           a subset of locales. This can be added multiple times to
           install multiple subpaths.

       <b>--gpg-file=FILE</b>
           Check bundle signatures with GPG key from FILE (- for stdin).

       <b>--no-deploy</b>
           Download the latest version, but don't deploy it.

       <b>--no-pull</b>
           Don't download the latest version, deploy whatever is locally
           available.

       <b>--no-related</b>
           Don't download related extensions, such as the locale data.

       <b>--no-deps</b>
           Don't verify runtime dependencies when installing.

       <b>--or-update</b>
           Normally install just ignores things that are already
           installed (printing a warning), but if --or-update is
           specified it silently turns it into an update operation
           instead.

       <b>--app</b>
           Assume that all REFs are apps if not explicitly specified.

       <b>--runtime</b>
           Assume that all REFs are runtimes if not explicitly
           specified.

       <b>--sideload-repo=PATH</b>
           Adds an extra local ostree repo as a source for installation.
           This is equivalent to using the sideload-repos directories
           (see <a href="flatpak.1.html">flatpak(1)</a>), but can be done on a per-command basis. Any
           path added here is used in addition to ones in those
           directories.

       <b>--include-sdk</b>
           For each app being installed, also installs the SDK that was
           used to build it. Implies <b>--or-update</b>; incompatible with
           <b>--no-deps</b>.

       <b>--include-debug</b>
           For each ref being installed, as well as all dependencies,
           also installs its debug info. Implies <b>--or-update</b>;
           incompatible with <b>--no-deps</b>.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--assumeyes</b>
           Automatically answer yes to all questions (or pick the most
           prioritized answer). This is useful for automation.

       <b>--noninteractive</b>
           Produce minimal output and avoid most questions. This is
           suitable for use in non-interactive situations, e.g. in a
           build script.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
