</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_install - install files into package build directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_install </b>[<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [<b>--autodest</b>] [<b>--sourcedir=</b><i>dir</i>]
       [<i>debhelper options</i>] [<i>file|dir</i> ... <i>destdir</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_install </b>is a debhelper program that handles installing files
       into package build directories. There are many <b>dh_install</b><i>*</i>
       commands that handle installing specific types of files such as
       documentation, examples, man pages, and so on, and they should be
       used when possible as they often have extra intelligence for
       those particular tasks. <b>dh_install</b>, then, is useful for
       installing everything else, for which no particular intelligence
       is needed. It is a replacement for the old <b>dh_movefiles </b>command.

       This program may be used in one of two ways. If you just have a
       file or two that the upstream Makefile does not install for you,
       you can run <b>dh_install </b>on them to move them into place. On the
       other hand, maybe you have a large package that builds multiple
       binary packages. You can use the upstream <i>Makefile</i> to install it
       all into <i>debian/tmp</i>, and then use <b>dh_install </b>to copy directories
       and files from there into the proper package build directories.

       From debhelper compatibility level 7 on, <b>dh_install </b>will fall
       back to looking in <i>debian/tmp</i> for files, if it does not find them
       in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look
       using <b>--sourcedir</b>).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.install
           List the files to install into each package and the directory
           they should be installed to. The format is a set of lines,
           where each line lists a file or files to install, and at the
           end of the line tells the directory it should be installed
           in. The name of the files (or directories) to install should
           be given relative to the current directory, while the
           installation directory is given relative to the package build
           directory. You may use wildcards in the names of the files to
           install.

           Note that if you list exactly one filename or wildcard-
           pattern on a line by itself, with no explicit destination,
           then <b>dh_install </b>will automatically guess the destination to
           use, the same as if the --autodest option were used.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
           documented in <a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper(7)</a>.

       debian/not-installed
           Used with the deprecated <b>--list-missing </b>and <b>--fail-missing</b>
           options.  Please refer to <a href="dh_missing.1.html">dh_missing(1)</a> for the documentation
           of this file.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--list-missing</b>
           <b>Deprecated</b>: Please use <b>dh_missing --list-missing </b>instead.  If
           you use this option, <b>dh_install </b>will call <b>dh_missing </b>with
           that option after it has processed all the files.  Please see
           <a href="dh_missing.1.html">dh_missing(1)</a> for the documentation of this option.

           This option is removed in compat 12.

       <b>--fail-missing</b>
           <b>Deprecated</b>: Please use <b>dh_missing --fail-missing </b>instead.  If
           you use this option, <b>dh_install </b>will call <b>dh_missing </b>with
           that option after it has processed all the files.  Please see
           <a href="dh_missing.1.html">dh_missing(1)</a> for the documentation of this option.

           This option is removed in compat 12.

       <b>--sourcedir=</b><i>dir</i>
           Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.

           Note that this is not the same as the <b>--sourcedirectory</b>
           option used by the <b>dh_auto_</b><i>*</i> commands. You rarely need to use
           this option, since <b>dh_install </b>automatically looks for files
           in <i>debian/tmp</i> in debhelper compatibility level 7 and above.

       <b>--autodest</b>
           Guess as the destination directory to install things to. If
           this is specified, you should not list destination
           directories in <i>debian/package.install</i> files or on the command
           line. Instead, <b>dh_install </b>will guess as follows:

           Strip off <i>debian/tmp</i> (or the sourcedir if one is given) from
           the front of the filename, if it is present, and install into
           the dirname of the filename. So if the filename is
           <i>debian/tmp/usr/bin</i>, then that directory will be copied to
           <i>debian/package/usr/</i>. If the filename is
           <i>debian/tmp/etc/passwd</i>, it will be copied to
           <i>debian/package/etc/</i>.

       <i>file|dir</i> ... <i>destdir</i>
           Lists files (or directories) to install and where to install
           them to.  The files will be installed into the first package
           <i>dh_install</i> acts on.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Here are some small examples of configuration files for
       dh_install.

           # Install my-prog into usr/bin (as "usr/bin/my-prog")
           my-prog usr/bin

           # Install a plugins directory into usr/share/my-prog
           # (as "usr/share/my-prog/plugins/")
           plugins usr/share/my-prog

           # Install a file with spaces in into usr/share/my-prog/data
           # (as "usr/share/my-prog/data/my datafile with spaces.txt")
           # ASSUMES COMPAT 13, where substitution patterns are available
           my${Space}datafile${Space}with${Space}spaces.txt usr/share/my-prog/data

           # Install a library into the multi-arch lib directory
           # ASSUMES COMPAT 13, where substitution patterns are available
           build/output/libfrop*.so.* usr/lib/${DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH}
</pre> <h2>
LIMITATIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_install </b>cannot rename files or directories, it can only
       install them with the names they already have into wherever you
       want in the package build tree.

       There is also no way to filter out results based on build
       profiles or architecture. For documentation content, consider
       using <b>dh_installdocs </b>or <b>dh_installexamples </b>as those helpers
       account for the <b>nodoc </b>build profile.

       However, renaming and filtering can be achieved by using <b>dh-exec</b>
       with compatibility level 9 or later.  An example
       debian/<i>package</i>.install file using <b>dh-exec </b>could look like:

        #!/usr/bin/dh-exec
        debian/default.conf =&gt; /etc/my-package/start.conf
        build/foo /usr/bin &lt;!pkg.bar.nofoo&gt;

       Please remember the following three things:

       •   The package must be using compatibility level 9 or later (see
           <a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper(7)</a>)

       •   The package will need a build-dependency on dh-exec.

       •   The install file must be marked as executable.
