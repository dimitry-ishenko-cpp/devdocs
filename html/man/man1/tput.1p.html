PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       tput — change terminal characteristics
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       tput <b>[</b>-T <i>type</i><b>] </b><i>operand</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tput</i> utility shall display terminal-dependent information.
       The manner in which this information is retrieved is unspecified.
       The information displayed shall clear the terminal screen,
       initialize the user's terminal, or reset the user's terminal,
       depending on the operand given. The exact consequences of
       displaying this information are unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>tput</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-T </b><i>type</i>   Indicate the type of terminal. If this option is not
                 supplied and the <i>TERM</i> variable is unset or null, an
                 unspecified default terminal type shall be used. The
                 setting of <i>type</i> shall take precedence over the value in
                 <i>TERM</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following strings shall be supported as operands by the
       implementation in the POSIX locale:

       <b>clear     </b>Display the clear-screen sequence.

       <b>init      </b>Display the sequence that initializes the user's
                 terminal in an implementation-defined manner.

       <b>reset     </b>Display the sequence that resets the user's terminal in
                 an implementation-defined manner.

       If a terminal does not support any of the operations described by
       these operands, this shall not be considered an error condition.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>tput</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TERM</i>      Determine the terminal type. If this variable is unset
                 or null, and if the <b>-T </b>option is not specified, an
                 unspecified default terminal type shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If standard output is a terminal device, it may be used for
       writing the appropriate sequence to clear the screen or reset or
       initialize the terminal. If standard output is not a terminal
       device, undefined results occur.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The requested string was written successfully.

        1    Unspecified.

        2    Usage error.

        3    No information is available about the specified terminal
             type.

        4    The specified operand is invalid.

       &gt;4    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If one of the operands is not available for the terminal, <i>tput</i>
       continues processing the remaining operands.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The difference between resetting and initializing a terminal is
       left unspecified, as they vary greatly based on hardware types.
       In general, resetting is a more severe action.

       Some terminals use control characters to perform the stated
       functions, and on such terminals it might make sense to use <i>tput</i>
       to store the initialization strings in a file or environment
       variable for later use. However, because other terminals might
       rely on system calls to do this work, the standard output cannot
       be used in a portable manner, such as the following non-portable
       constructs:

           ClearVar=`tput clear`
           tput reset | mailx -s "Wake Up" ddg
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. Initialize the terminal according to the type of terminal in
           the environmental variable <i>TERM</i>.  This command can be
           included in a <b>.profile </b>file.

               tput init

        2. Reset a 450 terminal.

               tput -T 450 reset
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The list of operands was reduced to a minimum for the following
       reasons:

        *  The only features chosen were those that were likely to be
           used by human users interacting with a terminal.

        *  Specifying the full <i>terminfo</i> set was not considered
           desirable, but the standard developers did not want to select
           among operands.

        *  This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not attempt to provide
           applications with sophisticated terminal handling
           capabilities, as that falls outside of its assigned scope and
           intersects with the responsibilities of other standards
           bodies.

       The difference between resetting and initializing a terminal is
       left unspecified as this varies greatly based on hardware types.
       In general, resetting is a more severe action.

       The exit status of 1 is historically reserved for finding out if
       a Boolean operand is not set. Although the operands were reduced
       to a minimum, the exit status of 1 should still be reserved for
       the Boolean operands, for those sites that wish to support them.
