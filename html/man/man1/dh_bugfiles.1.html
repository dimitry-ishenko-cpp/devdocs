</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_bugfiles </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing bug reporting customization files (bug scripts and/or
       bug control files and/or presubj files) into package build
       directories.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.bug-script
           This is the script to be run by the bug reporting program for
           generating a bug report template. This file is installed as
           <i>usr/share/bug/package</i> in the package build directory if no
           other types of bug reporting customization files are going to
           be installed for the package in question. Otherwise, this
           file is installed as <i>usr/share/bug/package/script</i>. Finally,
           the installed script is given execute permissions.

       debian/<i>package</i>.bug-control
           It is the bug control file containing some directions for the
           bug reporting tool. This file is installed as
           <i>usr/share/bug/package/control</i> in the package build directory.

       debian/<i>package</i>.bug-presubj
           The contents of this file are displayed to the user by the
           bug reporting tool before allowing the user to write a bug
           report on the package to the Debian Bug Tracking System. This
           file is installed as <i>usr/share/bug/package/presubj</i> in the
           package build directory.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Install <i>debian/bug-*</i> files to ALL packages acted on when
           respective <i>debian/package.bug-*</i> files do not exist. Normally,
