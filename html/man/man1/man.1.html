DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>man </b>is the system's manual pager.  Each <i>page</i> argument given to
       <b>man </b>is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The
       <i>manual page</i> associated with each of these arguments is then found
       and displayed.  A <i>section</i>, if provided, will direct <b>man </b>to look
       only in that <i>section</i> of the manual.  The default action is to
       search in all of the available <i>sections</i> following a pre-defined
       order (see <b>DEFAULTS</b>), and to show only the first <i>page</i> found, even
       if <i>page</i> exists in several <i>sections</i>.

       The table below shows the <i>section</i> numbers of the manual followed
       by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in <i>/dev</i>)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. <i>/etc/passwd</i>
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions),
           e.g. <a href="../man7/man.7.html">man(7)</a>, <a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff(7)</a>, <a href="../man7/man-pages.7.html">man-pages(7)</a>
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual <i>page</i> consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include <b>NAME</b>, <b>SYNOPSIS</b>, <b>CONFIGURATION</b>,
       <b>DESCRIPTION</b>, <b>OPTIONS</b>, <b>EXIT STATUS</b>, <b>RETURN VALUE</b>, <b>ERRORS</b>,
       <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>, <b>FILES</b>, <b>VERSIONS</b>, <b>STANDARDS</b>, <b>NOTES</b>, <b>BUGS</b>, <b>EXAMPLE</b>,
       <b>AUTHORS</b>, and <b>SEE ALSO</b>.

       The following conventions apply to the <b>SYNOPSIS </b>section and can
       be used as a guide in other sections.

       <b>bold text          </b>type exactly as shown.
       <i>italic text</i>        replace with appropriate argument.
       [<b>-abc</b>]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       <b>-a</b>|<b>-b              </b>options delimited by | cannot be used
                          together.
       <i>argument</i> ...       <i>argument</i> is repeatable.
       [<i>expression</i>] ...   entire <i>expression</i> within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For
       instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when
       running in a terminal, and will typically use underlined or
       coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should
       match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to
       illustrate several exclusive invocations as is shown in the
       <b>SYNOPSIS </b>section of this manual page.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>man </b><i>ls</i>
           Display the manual page for the <i>item</i> (program) <i>ls</i>.

       <b>man </b><i>man</i>.<i>7</i>
           Display the manual page for macro package <i>man</i> from section <i>7</i>.
           (This is an alternative spelling of "<b>man </b><i>7 man</i>".)

       <b>man '</b><i>man</i>(<i>7</i>)'
           Display the manual page for macro package <i>man</i> from section <i>7</i>.
           (This is another alternative spelling of "<b>man </b><i>7 man</i>".  It may
           be more convenient when copying and pasting cross-references
           to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be
           quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       <b>man -a </b><i>intro</i>
           Display, in succession, all of the available <i>intro</i> manual
           pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit
           between successive displays or skip any of them.

       <b>man -t </b><i>bash</i> | <i>lpr -Pps</i>
           Format the manual page for <i>bash</i> into the default <b>troff </b>or
           <b>groff </b>format and pipe it to the printer named <i>ps</i>.  The
           default output for <b>groff </b>is usually PostScript.  <b>man --help</b>
           should advise as to which processor is bound to the <b>-t</b>
           option.

       <b>man -l -T</b><i>dvi ./foo.1x.gz</i> <b>&gt; </b><i>./foo.1x.dvi</i>
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source
           manual page <i>./foo.1x.gz</i> into a <b>device independent (dvi) </b>file.
           The redirection is necessary as the <b>-T </b>flag causes output to
           be directed to <b>stdout </b>with no pager.  The output could be
           viewed with a program such as <b>xdvi </b>or further processed into
           PostScript using a program such as <b>dvips</b>.

       <b>man -k </b><i>printf</i>
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the
           keyword <i>printf</i> as regular expression.  Print out any matches.
           Equivalent to <b>apropos </b><i>printf</i><b>.</b>

       <b>man -f </b><i>smail</i>
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by <i>smail</i> and print out the
           short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to <b>whatis </b><i>smail</i><b>.</b>
</pre> <h2>
OVERVIEW </h2>
<pre>
       Many options are available to <b>man </b>in order to give as much
       flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the
       search path, section order, output processor, and other
       behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to
       determine the operation of <b>man</b>.  It is possible to set the
       "catch-all" variable $<b>MANOPT </b>to any string in command line
       format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an
       option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  <b>man</b>
       will parse $<b>MANOPT </b>prior to parsing its own command line.  Those
       options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same
       options found on the command line.  To reset all of the options
       set in $<b>MANOPT</b>, <b>-D </b>can be specified as the initial command line
       option.  This will allow man to "forget" about the options
       specified in $<b>MANOPT</b>, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual pages are normally stored in <a href="nroff.1.html">nroff(1)</a> format under a
       directory such as <i>/usr/share/man</i>.  In some installations, there
       may also be preformatted <i>cat pages</i> to improve performance.  See
       <a href="../man5/manpath.5.html">manpath(5)</a> for details of where these files are stored.

       This package supports manual pages in multiple languages,
       controlled by your <i>locale</i>.  If your system did not set this up
       for you automatically, then you may need to set $<b>LC_MESSAGES</b>,
       $<b>LANG</b>, or another system-dependent environment variable to
       indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the <b>POSIX</b>
       format:

       &lt;<i>language</i>&gt;[<b>_</b>&lt;<i>territory</i>&gt;[<b>.</b>&lt;<i>character-set</i>&gt;[<b>,</b>&lt;<i>version</i>&gt;]]]

       If the desired page is available in your <i>locale</i>, it will be
       displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English)
       page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are
       not available in your native language and you would like to
       supply them, please contact the maintainer who will be
       coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by
       the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that
       they document, and are not included with this package.  If you
       find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report
       that to the maintainers of the package in question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available
       with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with
       the package.
</pre> <h2>
DEFAULTS </h2>
<pre>
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the
       environment variable $<b>MANSECT </b>or by the <b>SECTION </b>directive in
       <i>/usr/local/etc/man_db.conf</i>.  By default it is as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 0 2 3type 5 4 9 6 7

       The formatted manual page is displayed using a <i>pager</i>.  This can
       be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a
       default (see option <b>-P </b>for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the
       command line option <b>-p </b>or the environment variable $<b>MANROFFSEQ </b>is
       interrogated.  If <b>-p </b>was not used and the environment variable
       was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a
       preprocessor string.  To contain a valid preprocessor string, the
       first line must resemble

       <b>'\" </b>&lt;<b>string</b>&gt;

       where <b>string </b>can be any combination of letters described by
       option <b>-p </b>below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a
       default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary
       formatter (<b>nroff </b>or [<b>tg</b>]<b>roff </b>with <b>-t</b>) and executed.
       Alternatively, if an executable program <i>mandb_nfmt</i> (or <i>mandb_tfmt</i>
       with <b>-t</b>) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It
       gets passed the manual source file, the preprocessor string, and
       optionally the device specified with <b>-T </b>or <b>-E </b>as arguments.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command
       line, in $<b>MANOPT</b>, or both, are not harmful.  For options that
       require an argument, each duplication will override the previous
       argument value.

   <b>General options</b>
       <b>-C </b><i>file</i>, <b>--config-file=</b><i>file</i>
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default
              of <i>~/.manpath</i>.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Print debugging information.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--default</b>
              This option is normally issued as the very first option
              and resets <b>man's </b>behaviour to its default.  Its use is to
              reset those options that may have been set in $<b>MANOPT</b>.
              Any options that follow <b>-D </b>will have their usual effect.

       <b>--warnings</b>[=<i>warnings</i>]
              Enable warnings from <i>groff</i>.  This may be used to perform
              sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.
              <i>warnings</i> is a comma-separated list of warning names; if it
              is not supplied, the default is "mac".  To disable a <i>groff</i>
              warning, prefix it with "!": for example,
              <b>--warnings=mac,!break </b>enables warnings in the "mac"
              category and disables warnings in the "break" category.
              See the “Warnings” node in <b>info groff </b>for a list of
              available warning names.

   <b>Main modes of operation</b>
       <b>-f</b>, <b>--whatis</b>
              Approximately equivalent to <b>whatis</b>.  Display a short
              description from the manual page, if available.  See
              <a href="whatis.1.html">whatis(1)</a> for details.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--apropos</b>
              Approximately equivalent to <b>apropos</b>.  Search the short
              manual page descriptions for keywords and display any
              matches.  See <a href="apropos.1.html">apropos(1)</a> for details.

       <b>-K</b>, <b>--global-apropos</b>
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-
              force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can,
              you should specify a section to reduce the number of pages
              that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple
              strings (the default), or regular expressions if the
              <b>--regex </b>option is used.

              Note that this searches the <i>sources</i> of the manual pages,
              not the rendered text, and so may include false positives
              due to things like comments in source files, or false
              negatives due to things like hyphens being written as "\-"
              in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be
              much slower.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--local-file</b>
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual
              files instead of searching through the system's manual
              collection.  Each manual page argument will be interpreted
              as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat
              file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the
              arguments, input will be taken from stdin.

              If this option is not used, then <b>man </b>will also fall back
              to interpreting manual page arguments as local file names
              if the argument contains a "/" character, since that is a
              good indication that the argument refers to a path on the
              file system.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--where</b>, <b>--path</b>, <b>--location</b>
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the
              location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.
              If the <b>-a </b>option is also used, then print the locations of
              all source files that match the search criteria.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--where-cat</b>, <b>--location-cat</b>
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the
              location of the preformatted cat file that would be
              displayed.  If the <b>-a </b>option is also used, then print the
              locations of all preformatted cat files that match the
              search criteria.

              If <b>-w </b>and <b>-W </b>are both used, then print both source file
              and cat file separated by a space.  If all of <b>-w</b>, <b>-W</b>, and
              <b>-a </b>are used, then do this for each possible match.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--catman</b>
              This option is not for general use and should only be used
              by the <b>catman </b>program.

       <b>-R </b><i>encoding</i>, <b>--recode</b>=<i>encoding</i>
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way,
              output its source converted to the specified <i>encoding</i>.  If
              you already know the encoding of the source file, you can
              also use <a href="manconv.1.html">manconv(1)</a> directly.  However, this option allows
              you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding
              without having to explicitly state the encoding of each,
              provided that they were already installed in a structure
              similar to a manual page hierarchy.

              Consider using <a href="man-recode.1.html">man-recode(1)</a> instead for converting
              multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed
              for bulk conversion and so can be much faster.

   <b>Finding manual pages</b>
       <b>-L </b><i>locale</i>, <b>--locale=</b><i>locale</i>
              <b>man </b>will normally determine your current locale by a call
              to the C function <a href="../man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale(3)</a> which interrogates various
              environment variables, possibly including $<b>LC_MESSAGES </b>and
              $<b>LANG</b>.  To temporarily override the determined value, use
              this option to supply a <i>locale</i> string directly to <b>man</b>.
              Note that it will not take effect until the search for
              pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message
              will always be displayed in the initially determined
              locale.

       <b>-m </b><i>system</i>[,...], <b>--systems=</b><i>system</i>[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating systems'
              manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To
              search for a manual page from NewOS's manual page
              collection, use the option <b>-m NewOS</b>.

              The <i>system</i> specified can be a combination of comma
              delimited operating system names.  To include a search of
              the native operating system's manual pages, include the
              system name <b>man </b>in the argument string.  This option will
              override the $<b>SYSTEM </b>environment variable.

       <b>-M </b><i>path</i>, <b>--manpath=</b><i>path</i>
              Specify an alternate manpath to use.  By default, <b>man </b>uses
              <b>manpath </b>derived code to determine the path to search.
              This option overrides the $<b>MANPATH </b>environment variable
              and causes option <b>-m </b>to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual
              page hierarchy structured into sections as described in
              the man-db manual (under "The manual page system").  To
              view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the <b>-l</b>
              option.

       <b>-S </b><i>list</i>, <b>-s </b><i>list</i>, <b>--sections=</b><i>list</i>
              The given <i>list</i> is a colon- or comma-separated list of
              sections, used to determine which manual sections to
              search and in what order.  This option overrides the
              $<b>MANSECT </b>environment variable.  (The <b>-s </b>spelling is for
              compatibility with System V.)

       <b>-e </b><i>sub-extension</i>, <b>--extension=</b><i>sub-extension</i>
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages,
              such as those that accompany the <b>Tcl </b>package, into the
              main manual page hierarchy.  To get around the problem of
              having two manual pages with the same name such as
              <a href="../man3/exit.3.html">exit(3)</a>, the <b>Tcl </b>pages were usually all assigned to
              section <b>l</b>.  As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to
              put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a
              specific "extension" to them, in this case, <b>exit</b>(3tcl).
              Under normal operation, <b>man </b>will display <a href="../man3/exit.3.html">exit(3)</a> in
              preference to <b>exit</b>(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and
              to avoid having to know which section the page you require
              resides in, it is now possible to give <b>man </b>a <i>sub-extension</i>
              string indicating which package the page must belong to.
              Using the above example, supplying the option <b>-e tcl </b>to
              <b>man </b>will restrict the search to pages having an extension
              of <b>*tcl</b>.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-case</b>
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the
              default.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--match-case</b>
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       <b>--regex</b>
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or
              their descriptions matching each <i>page</i> argument as a
              regular expression, as with <a href="apropos.1.html">apropos(1)</a>.  Since there is
              usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when
              searching for a regular expression, this option implies
              <b>-a</b>.

       <b>--wildcard</b>
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or
              their descriptions matching each <i>page</i> argument using
              shell-style wildcards, as with <a href="apropos.1.html">apropos(1)</a> <b>--wildcard</b>.  The
              <i>page</i> argument must match the entire name or description,
              or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since
              there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page
              when searching for a wildcard, this option implies <b>-a</b>.

       <b>--names-only</b>
              If the <b>--regex </b>or <b>--wildcard </b>option is used, match only
              page names, not page descriptions, as with <a href="whatis.1.html">whatis(1)</a>.
              Otherwise, no effect.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              By default, <b>man </b>will exit after displaying the most
              suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces
              <b>man </b>to display all the manual pages with names that match
              the search criteria.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--update</b>
              This option causes <b>man </b>to update its database caches of
              installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare
              situations, and it is normally better to run <a href="../man8/mandb.8.html">mandb(8)</a>
              instead.

       <b>--no-subpages</b>
              By default, <b>man </b>will try to interpret pairs of manual page
              names given on the command line as equivalent to a single
              manual page name containing a hyphen or an underscore.
              This supports the common pattern of programs that
              implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to
              provide manual pages for each that can be accessed using
              similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands
              themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the <b>--no-subpages </b>option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   <b>Controlling formatted output</b>
       <b>-P </b><i>pager</i>, <b>--pager=</b><i>pager</i>
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, <b>man </b>uses
              <b>less</b>, falling back to <b>cat </b>if <b>less </b>is not found or is not
              executable.  This option overrides the $<b>MANPAGER</b>
              environment variable, which in turn overrides the $<b>PAGER</b>
              environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with
              <b>-f </b>or <b>-k</b>.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with
              arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single
              quotes, or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to
              connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper
              script, which may take the file to display either as an
              argument or on standard input.

       <b>-r </b><i>prompt</i>, <b>--prompt=</b><i>prompt</i>
              If a recent version of <b>less </b>is used as the pager, <b>man </b>will
              attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The
              default prompt looks like

               <b>Manual page </b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>sec</i><b>) line </b><i>x</i>

              where <i>name</i> denotes the manual page name, <i>sec</i> denotes the
              section it was found under and <i>x</i> the current line number.
              This is achieved by using the $<b>LESS </b>environment variable.

              Supplying <b>-r </b>with a string will override this default.
              The string may contain the text <b>$MAN_PN </b>which will be
              expanded to the name of the current manual page and its
              section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used
              to produce the default could be expressed as

              <b>\ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:</b>
              <b>byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..</b>
              <b>(press h for help or q to quit)</b>

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of
              readability only.  For its meaning see the <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> manual
              page.  The prompt string is first evaluated by the shell.
              All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the
              prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The
              prompt string may end in an escaped $ which may be
              followed by further options for less.  By default <b>man </b>sets
              the <b>-ix8 </b>options.

              The $<b>MANLESS </b>environment variable described below may be
              used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on
              the command line.

       <b>-7</b>, <b>--ascii</b>
              When viewing a pure <a href="../man7/ascii.7.html">ascii(7)</a> manual page on a 7 bit
              terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not
              display correctly when using the <a href="../man7/latin1.7.html">latin1(7)</a> device
              description with <b>GNU nroff</b>.  This option allows pure <i>ascii</i>
              manual pages to be displayed in <i>ascii</i> with the <i>latin1</i>
              device.  It will not translate any <i>latin1</i> text.  The
              following table shows the translations performed: some
              parts of it may only be displayed properly when using <b>GNU</b>
              <b>nroff</b>'s <a href="../man7/latin1.7.html">latin1(7)</a> device.

              Description      Octal   latin1   ascii

              sign

              If the <i>latin1</i> column displays correctly, your terminal may
              be  set  up  for  <i>latin1</i> characters and this option is not
              necessary.  If the <i>latin1</i> and <i>ascii</i> columns are identical,
              you are reading this page using this option or <b>man </b>did not
              format this page using the <i>latin1</i> device description.   If
              the  <i>latin1</i>  column is missing or corrupt, you may need to
              view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options <b>-t</b>, <b>-H</b>,  <b>-T</b>,  or
              <b>-Z </b>and may be useless for <b>nroff </b>other than <b>GNU's</b>.

       <b>-E </b><i>encoding</i>, <b>--encoding</b>=<i>encoding</i>
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the
              default.  For backward compatibility, <i>encoding</i> may be an
              <b>nroff </b>device such as <b>ascii</b>, <b>latin1</b>, or <b>utf8 </b>as well as a
              true character encoding such as <b>UTF-8</b>.

       <b>--no-hyphenation</b>, <b>--nh</b>
              Normally, <b>nroff </b>will automatically hyphenate text at line
              breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is
              necessary to do so to lay out words on a line without
              excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic
              hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if they
              already contain hyphens.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to
              prevent <b>nroff </b>from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate
              point, do not use this option, but consult the <b>nroff</b>
              documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%"
              inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at
              that point, or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent
              it from being hyphenated.

       <b>--no-justification</b>, <b>--nj</b>
              Normally, <b>nroff </b>will automatically justify text to both
              margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving
              justified only to the left margin, sometimes called
              "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to
              prevent <b>nroff </b>from justifying certain paragraphs, do not
              use this option, but consult the <b>nroff </b>documentation
              instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf",
              ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting
              and filling.

       <b>-p </b><i>string</i>, <b>--preprocessor=</b><i>string</i>
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before <b>nroff</b>
              or <b>troff</b>/<b>groff</b>.  Not all installations will have a full
              set of preprocessors.  Some of the preprocessors and the
              letters used to designate them are: <b>eqn </b>(<b>e</b>), <b>grap </b>(<b>g</b>), <b>pic</b>
              (<b>p</b>), <b>tbl </b>(<b>t</b>), <b>vgrind </b>(<b>v</b>), <b>refer </b>(<b>r</b>).  This option
              overrides the $<b>MANROFFSEQ </b>environment variable.  <b>zsoelim</b>
              is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--troff</b>
              Use <i>groff -mandoc</i> to format the manual page to stdout.
              This option is not required in conjunction with <b>-H</b>, <b>-T</b>, or
              <b>-Z</b>.

       <b>-T</b>[<i>device</i>], <b>--troff-device</b>[=<i>device</i>]
              This option is used to change <b>groff </b>(or possibly <b>troff's</b>)
              output to be suitable for a device other than the default.
              It implies <b>-t</b>.  Examples (as of groff 1.23.0) include <b>dvi</b>,
              <b>latin1</b>, <b>pdf</b>, <b>ps</b>, <b>utf8</b>, <b>X75 </b>and <b>X100</b>.

       <b>-H</b>[<i>browser</i>], <b>--html</b>[=<i>browser</i>]
              This option will cause <b>groff </b>to produce HTML output, and
              will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of
              browser is determined by the optional <i>browser</i> argument if
              one is provided, by the $<b>BROWSER </b>environment variable, or
              by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually <b>lynx</b>).
              This option implies <b>-t</b>, and will only work with <b>GNU troff</b>.

       <b>-X</b>[<i>dpi</i>], <b>--gxditview</b>[=<i>dpi</i>]
              This option displays the output of <b>groff </b>in a graphical
              window using the <b>gxditview </b>program.  The <i>dpi</i> (dots per
              inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or 100-12, defaulting to 75;
              the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option
              implies <b>-T </b>with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device
              respectively.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--ditroff</b>
              <b>groff </b>will run <b>troff </b>and then use an appropriate post-
              processor to produce output suitable for the chosen
              device.  If <i>groff -mandoc</i> is <b>groff</b>, this option is passed
              to <b>groff </b>and will suppress the use of a post-processor.
              It implies <b>-t</b>.

   <b>Getting help</b>
       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a help message and exit.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.
</pre> <h2>

       <b>2      </b>Operational error.

       <b>3      </b>A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       <b>16     </b>At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or

</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>MANPATH</b>
              If $<b>MANPATH </b>is set, its value is used as the path to
              search for manual pages.

              See the <b>SEARCH PATH </b>section of <a href="../man5/manpath.5.html">manpath(5)</a> for the default
              behaviour and details of how this environment variable is
              handled.

       <b>MANROFFOPT</b>
              Every time <b>man </b>invokes the formatter (<b>nroff</b>, <b>troff</b>, or
              <b>groff</b>), it adds the contents of $<b>MANROFFOPT </b>to the
              formatter's command line.

              For example, <b>MANROFFOPT=-P-i </b>tells the formatter to use
              italic text (which is only supported by some terminals)
              rather than underlined text.

       <b>MANROFFSEQ</b>
              If $<b>MANROFFSEQ </b>is set, its value is used to determine the
              set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.
              The default preprocessor list is system dependent.

       <b>MANSECT</b>
              If $<b>MANSECT </b>is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of
              sections and it is used to determine which manual sections
              to search and in what order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 0
              2 3type 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the <b>SECTION</b>
              directive in <i>/usr/local/etc/man_db.conf</i>.

       <b>MANPAGER</b>, <b>PAGER</b>
              If $<b>MANPAGER </b>or $<b>PAGER </b>is set ($<b>MANPAGER </b>is used in
              preference), its value is used as the name of the program
              used to display the manual page.  By default, <b>less </b>is
              used, falling back to <b>cat </b>if <b>less </b>is not found or is not
              executable.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with
              arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single
              quotes, or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to
              connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper
              script, which may take the file to display either as an
              argument or on standard input.

       <b>MANLESS</b>
              If $<b>MANLESS </b>is set, its value will be used as the default
              prompt string for the <b>less </b>pager, as if it had been passed
              using the <b>-r </b>option (so any occurrences of the text
              <b>$MAN_PN </b>will be expanded in the same way).  For example,
              if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to
              “my prompt string”, set $<b>MANLESS </b>to ‘<b>-Psmy prompt string</b>’.
              Using the <b>-r </b>option overrides this environment variable.

       <b>BROWSER</b>
              If $<b>BROWSER </b>is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of
              commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a
              web browser for <b>man --html</b>.  In each command, <i>%s</i> is
              replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from
              <b>groff</b>, <i>%%</i> is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and <i>%c</i>
              is replaced by a colon (:).

       <b>SYSTEM </b>If $<b>SYSTEM </b>is set, it will have the same effect as if it
              had been specified as the argument to the <b>-m </b>option.

       <b>MANOPT </b>If $<b>MANOPT </b>is set, it will be parsed prior to <b>man's</b>
              command line and is expected to be in a similar format.
              As all of the other <b>man </b>specific environment variables can
              be expressed as command line options, and are thus
              candidates for being included in $<b>MANOPT </b>it is expected
              that they will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that
              should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must
              be escaped.

       <b>MANWIDTH</b>
              If $<b>MANWIDTH </b>is set, its value is used as the line length
              for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not
              set, manual pages will be formatted with a line length
              appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of
              $<b>COLUMNS</b>, and <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> if available, or falling back to 80
              characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only
              be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is
              when the terminal line length is between 66 and 80
              characters.

       <b>MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING</b>
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal
              (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are
              discarded to make it easier to read the result without
              special tools.  However, if $<b>MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING </b>is set to
              any non-empty value, these formatting characters are
              retained.  This may be useful for wrappers around <b>man </b>that
              can interpret formatting characters.

       <b>MAN_KEEP_STDERR</b>
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal
              (usually to a pager), any error output from the command
              used to produce formatted versions of manual pages is
              discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.
              Programs such as <b>groff </b>often produce relatively minor
              error messages about typographical problems such as poor
              alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing
              when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some
              users want to see them anyway, so, if $<b>MAN_KEEP_STDERR </b>is
              set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed
              as usual.

       <b>MAN_DISABLE_SECCOMP</b>
              On Linux, <b>man </b>normally confines subprocesses that handle
              untrusted data using a <a href="../man2/seccomp.2.html">seccomp(2)</a> sandbox.  This makes it
              safer to run complex parsing code over arbitrary manual
              pages.  If this goes wrong for some reason unrelated to
              the content of the page being displayed, you can set
              $<b>MAN_DISABLE_SECCOMP </b>to any non-empty value to disable the
              sandbox.

       <b>PIPELINE_DEBUG</b>
              If the $<b>PIPELINE_DEBUG </b>environment variable is set to "1",
              then <b>man </b>will print debugging messages to standard error
              describing each subprocess it runs.

       <b>LANG</b>, <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of
