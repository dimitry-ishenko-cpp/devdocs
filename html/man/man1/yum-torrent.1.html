NAME </h2>
<pre>
       yum-torrent - download packages via http and peer-to-peer
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum-torrent </b>extends the behaviour of yum by downloading then
       seeding packages via BitTorrent.  Once installed and configured,
       the plugin works transparently.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum-torrent </b>makes extensive use of cache files. The BitTorrent
       client's cwd is set to the root of the cache by default.  All
       generated .torrent files are guaranteed to contain files in
       subdirectories.  Once a torrent download is complete the files
       are hard or soft linked to the path in <b>/var/cache/yum </b>where yum
       will look before starting it's own downloads, bypassing it.

       <b>yum-torrent </b>will automatically clean up unused files and
       directories left over from previous runs.
