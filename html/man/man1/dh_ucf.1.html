NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_ucf - register configuration files with ucf
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_ucf </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-A</b>] [<b>-n</b>] [<i>file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_ucf </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating
       the <i>postinst</i> and <i>postrm</i> commands that register files with <b>ucf</b>(1)
       and <b>ucfr</b>(1).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.ucf
           List pairs of source and destination files to register with
           ucf. Each pair should be put on its own line, with the source
           and destination separated by whitespace. Both source and
           destination must be absolute paths. The source should be a
           file that is provided by your package, typically in
           /usr/share/, while the destination is typically a file in
           /etc/.

           A dependency on ucf will be generated in <b>${misc:Depends}</b>.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
           documented in <a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper(7)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL
           packages acted on.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-scripts</b>
           Do not modify <i>postinst</i>/<i>postrm</i> scripts. Turns this command
           into a no-op.

       <i>file</i> ...
           Install these info files into the first package acted on. (Or
           in all packages if <b>-A </b>is specified).
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that this command is not idempotent. <a href="dh_prep.1.html">dh_prep(1)</a> should be
       called between invocations of this command. Otherwise, it may
       cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
       maintainer scripts.
