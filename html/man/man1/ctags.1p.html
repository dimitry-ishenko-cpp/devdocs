PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ctags — create a tags file (<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>, <b>FORTRAN</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ctags <b>[</b>-a<b>] [</b>-f <i>tagsfile</i><b>] </b><i>pathname</i>...

       ctags -x <i>pathname</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ctags</i> utility shall be provided on systems that support the
       the Software Development Utilities option, and either or both of
       the C-Language Development Utilities option and FORTRAN
       Development Utilities option. On other systems, it is optional.

       The <i>ctags</i> utility shall write a <i>tagsfile</i> or an index of objects
       from C-language or FORTRAN source files specified by the <i>pathname</i>
       operands. The <i>tagsfile</i> shall list the locators of language-
       specific objects within the source files. A locator consists of a
       name, pathname, and either a search pattern or a line number that
       can be used in searching for the object definition. The objects
       that shall be recognized are specified in the EXTENDED
       DESCRIPTION section.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ctags</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a        </b>Append to <i>tagsfile</i>.

       <b>-f </b><i>tagsfile</i>
                 Write the object locator lists into <i>tagsfile</i> instead of
                 the default file named <b>tags </b>in the current directory.

       <b>-x        </b>Produce a list of object names, the line number, and
                 filename in which each is defined, as well as the text
                 of that line, and write this to the standard output. A
                 <i>tagsfile</i> shall not be created when <b>-x </b>is specified.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following <i>pathname</i> operands are supported:

       <i>file</i><b>.c    </b>Files with basenames ending with the <b>.c </b>suffix shall be
                 treated as C-language source code. Such files that are
                 not valid input to <i>c99</i> produce unspecified results.

       <i>file</i><b>.h    </b>Files with basenames ending with the <b>.h </b>suffix shall be
                 treated as C-language source code. Such files that are
                 not valid input to <i>c99</i> produce unspecified results.

       <i>file</i><b>.f    </b>Files with basenames ending with the <b>.f </b>suffix shall be
                 treated as FORTRAN-language source code. Such files
                 that are not valid input to <i>fort77</i> produce unspecified
                 results.

       The handling of other files is implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       See the INPUT FILES section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be text files containing source code in the
       language indicated by the operand filename suffixes.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>ctags</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the order in which output is sorted for the
                 <b>-x </b>option. The POSIX locale determines the order in
                 which the <i>tagsfile</i> is written.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files). When
                 processing C-language source code, if the locale is not
                 compatible with the C locale described by the ISO C
                 standard, the results are unspecified.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The list of object name information produced by the <b>-x </b>option
       shall be written to standard output in the following format:

           "%s %d %s %s", &lt;<i>object-name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>line-number</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>text</i>&gt;

       where &lt;<i>text</i>&gt; is the text of line &lt;<i>line-number</i>&gt; of file
       &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       When the <b>-x </b>option is not specified, the format of the output
       file shall be:

           "%s\t%s\t/%s/\n", &lt;<i>identifier</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>pattern</i>&gt;

       where &lt;<i>pattern</i>&gt; is a search pattern that could be used by an
       editor to find the defining instance of &lt;<i>identifier</i>&gt; in
       &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt; (where <i>defining instance</i> is indicated by the
       declarations listed in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION).

       An optional &lt;circumflex&gt; (<b>'^'</b>) can be added as a prefix to
       &lt;<i>pattern</i>&gt;, and an optional &lt;dollar-sign&gt; can be appended to
       &lt;<i>pattern</i>&gt; to indicate that the pattern is anchored to the
       beginning (end) of a line of text. Any &lt;slash&gt; or &lt;backslash&gt;
       characters in &lt;<i>pattern</i>&gt; shall be preceded by a &lt;backslash&gt;
       character. The anchoring &lt;circumflex&gt;, &lt;dollar-sign&gt;, and
       escaping &lt;backslash&gt; characters shall not be considered part of
       the search pattern. All other characters in the search pattern
       shall be considered literal characters.

       An alternative format is:

           "%s\t%s\t?%s?\n", &lt;<i>identifier</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>pattern</i>&gt;

       which is identical to the first format except that &lt;slash&gt;
       characters in &lt;<i>pattern</i>&gt; shall not be preceded by escaping
       &lt;backslash&gt; characters, and &lt;question-mark&gt; characters in
       &lt;<i>pattern</i>&gt; shall be preceded by &lt;backslash&gt; characters.

       A second alternative format is:

           "%s\t%s\t%d\n", &lt;<i>identifier</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>lineno</i>&gt;

       where &lt;<i>lineno</i>&gt; is a decimal line number that could be used by an
       editor to find &lt;<i>identifier</i>&gt; in &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;.

       Neither alternative format shall be produced by <i>ctags</i> when it is
       used as described by POSIX.1‐2008, but the standard utilities
       that process tags files shall be able to process those formats as
       well as the first format.

       In any of these formats, the file shall be sorted by identifier,
       based on the collation sequence in the POSIX locale.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If the operand identifies C-language source, the <i>ctags</i> utility
       shall attempt to produce an output line for each of the following
       objects:

        *  Function definitions

        *  Type definitions

        *  Macros with arguments

       It may also produce output for any of the following objects:

        *  Function prototypes

        *  Structures

        *  Unions

        *  Global variable definitions

        *  Enumeration types

        *  Macros without arguments

        *  <b>#define </b>statements

        *  <b>#line </b>statements

       Any <b>#if </b>and <b>#ifdef </b>statements shall produce no output. The tag
       <b>main </b>is treated specially in C programs. The tag formed shall be
       created by prefixing <b>M </b>to the name of the file, with the trailing
       <b>.c</b>, and leading pathname components (if any) removed.

       On systems that do not support the C-Language Development
       Utilities option, <i>ctags</i> produces unspecified results for C-
       language source code files. It should write to standard error a
       message identifying this condition and cause a non-zero exit
       status to be produced.

       If the operand identifies FORTRAN source, the <i>ctags</i> utility shall
       produce an output line for each function definition. It may also
       produce output for any of the following objects:

        *  Subroutine definitions

        *  COMMON statements

        *  PARAMETER statements

        *  DATA and BLOCK DATA statements

        *  Statement numbers

       On systems that do not support the FORTRAN Development Utilities
       option, <i>ctags</i> produces unspecified results for FORTRAN source
       code files. It should write to standard error a message
       identifying this condition and cause a non-zero exit status to be
       produced.

       It is implementation-defined what other objects (including
       duplicate identifiers) produce output.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The output with <b>-x </b>is meant to be a simple index that can be
       written out as an off-line readable function index. If the input
       files to <i>ctags</i> (such as <b>.c </b>files) were not created using the same
       locale as that in effect when <i>ctags</i> <b>-x </b>is run, results might not
       be as expected.

       The description of C-language processing says ``attempts to''
       because the C language can be greatly confused, especially
       through the use of <b>#define</b>s, and this utility would be of no use
       if the real C preprocessor were run to identify them. The output
       from <i>ctags</i> may be fooled and incorrect for various constructs.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The option list was significantly reduced from that provided by
       historical implementations. The <b>-F </b>option was omitted as
       redundant, since it is the default. The <b>-B </b>option was omitted as
       being of very limited usefulness. The <b>-t </b>option was omitted since
       the recognition of <b>typedef</b>s is now required for C source files.
       The <b>-u </b>option was omitted because the update function was judged
       to be not only inefficient, but also rarely needed.

       An early proposal included a <b>-w </b>option to suppress warning
       diagnostics. Since the types of such diagnostics could not be
       described, the option was omitted as being not useful.

       The text for <i>LC_CTYPE</i> about compatibility with the C locale
       acknowledges that the ISO C standard imposes requirements on the
       locale used to process C source. This could easily be a superset
       of that known as ``the C locale'' by way of implementation
       extensions, or one of a few alternative locales for systems
       supporting different codesets. No statement is made for FORTRAN
       because the ANSI X3.9‐1978 standard (FORTRAN 77) does not (yet)
       define a similar locale concept. However, a general rule in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 is that any time that locales do not match
       (preparing a file for one locale and processing it in another),
       the results are suspect.

       The collation sequence of the tags file is not affected by
       <i>LC_COLLATE</i> because it is typically not used by human readers, but
       only by programs such as <i>vi</i> to locate the tag within the source
       files. Using the POSIX locale eliminates some of the problems of
       coordinating locales between the <i>ctags</i> file creator and the <i>vi</i>
       file reader.

       Historically, the tags file has been used only by <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>.
       However, the format of the tags file has been published to
       encourage other programs to use the tags in new ways. The format
       allows either patterns or line numbers to find the identifiers
       because the historical <i>vi</i> recognizes either. The <i>ctags</i> utility
       does not produce the format using line numbers because it is not
       useful following any source file changes that add or delete
       lines.  The documented search patterns match historical practice.
       It should be noted that literal leading &lt;circumflex&gt; or trailing
       &lt;dollar-sign&gt; characters in the search pattern will only behave
       correctly if anchored to the beginning of the line or end of the
       line by an additional &lt;circumflex&gt; or &lt;dollar-sign&gt; character.

       Historical implementations also understand the objects used by
       the languages Pascal and sometimes LISP, and they understand the
       C source output by <i>lex</i> and <i>yacc</i>.  The <i>ctags</i> utility is not
       required to accommodate these languages, although implementors
       are encouraged to do so.

       The following historical option was not specified, as <i>vgrind</i> is
       not included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017:

       <b>-v        </b>If the <b>-v </b>flag is given, an index of the form expected
                 by <i>vgrind</i> is produced on the standard output. This
                 listing contains the function name, filename, and page
                 number (assuming 64-line pages). Since the output is
                 sorted into lexicographic order, it may be desired to
                 run the output through <i>sort</i> <b>-f</b>.  Sample use:

                     ctags -v files | sort -f &gt; index vgrind -x index

       The special treatment of the tag <b>main </b>makes the use of <i>ctags</i>
       practical in directories with more than one program.
