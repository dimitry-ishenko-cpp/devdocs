NAME </h2>
<pre>
       perf-inject - Filter to augment the events stream with additional
       information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>perf inject &lt;options&gt;</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       perf-inject reads a perf-record event stream and repipes it to
       stdout. At any point the processing code can inject other events
       into the event stream - in this case build-ids (-b option) are
       read and injected as needed into the event stream.

       Build-ids are just the first user of perf-inject - potentially
       anything that needs userspace processing to augment the events
       stream with additional information could make use of this
       facility.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -b, --build-ids
           Inject build-ids of DSOs hit by samples into the output
           stream. This means it needs to process all SAMPLE records to
           find the DSOs.

       --buildid-all
           Inject build-ids of all DSOs into the output stream
           regardless of hits and skip SAMPLE processing.

       --known-build-ids=
           Override build-ids to inject using these comma-separated
           pairs of build-id and path. Understands <b>file://filename </b>to
           read these pairs from a file, which can be generated with
           perf buildid-list.

       -v, --verbose
           Be more verbose.

       -i, --input=
           Input file name. (default: stdin)

       -o, --output=
           Output file name. (default: stdout)

       -s, --sched-stat
           Merge sched_stat and sched_switch for getting events where
           and how long tasks slept. sched_switch contains a callchain
           where a task slept and sched_stat contains a timeslice how
           long a task slept.

       -k, --vmlinux=&lt;file&gt;
           vmlinux pathname

       --ignore-vmlinux
           Ignore vmlinux files.

       --kallsyms=&lt;file&gt;
           kallsyms pathname

       --itrace
           Decode Instruction Tracing data, replacing it with
           synthesized events. Options are:

               i       synthesize instructions events
               y       synthesize cycles events
               b       synthesize branches events (branch misses for Arm SPE)
               c       synthesize branches events (calls only)
               r       synthesize branches events (returns only)
               x       synthesize transactions events
               w       synthesize ptwrite events
               p       synthesize power events (incl. PSB events for Intel PT)
               o       synthesize other events recorded due to the use
                       of aux-output (refer to perf record)
               I       synthesize interrupt or similar (asynchronous) events
                       (e.g. Intel PT Event Trace)
               e       synthesize error events
               d       create a debug log
               f       synthesize first level cache events
               m       synthesize last level cache events
               M       synthesize memory events
               t       synthesize TLB events
               a       synthesize remote access events
               g       synthesize a call chain (use with i or x)
               G       synthesize a call chain on existing event records
               l       synthesize last branch entries (use with i or x)
               L       synthesize last branch entries on existing event records
               s       skip initial number of events
               q       quicker (less detailed) decoding
               A       approximate IPC
               Z       prefer to ignore timestamps (so-called "timeless" decoding)
               T       use the timestamp trace as kernel time

               The default is all events i.e. the same as --itrace=iybxwpe,
               except for perf script where it is --itrace=ce

               In addition, the period (default 100000, except for perf script where it is 1)
               for instructions events can be specified in units of:

               i       instructions
               t       ticks
               ms      milliseconds
               us      microseconds
               ns      nanoseconds (default)

               Also the call chain size (default 16, max. 1024) for instructions or
               transactions events can be specified.

               Also the number of last branch entries (default 64, max. 1024) for
               instructions or transactions events can be specified.

               Similar to options g and l, size may also be specified for options G and L.
               On x86, note that G and L work poorly when data has been recorded with
               large PEBS. Refer linkperf:perf-intel-pt[1] man page for details.

               It is also possible to skip events generated (instructions, branches, transactions,
               ptwrite, power) at the beginning. This is useful to ignore initialization code.

               --itrace=i0nss1000000

               skips the first million instructions.

               The 'e' option may be followed by flags which affect what errors will or
               will not be reported. Each flag must be preceded by either '+' or '-'.
               The flags are:
                       o       overflow
                       l       trace data lost

               If supported, the 'd' option may be followed by flags which affect what
               debug messages will or will not be logged. Each flag must be preceded
               by either '+' or '-'. The flags are:
                       a       all perf events
                       e       output only on errors (size configurable - see linkperf:perf-config[1])
                       o       output to stdout

               If supported, the 'q' option may be repeated to increase the effect.

       --strip
           Use with --itrace to strip out non-synthesized events.

       -j, --jit
           Process jitdump files by injecting the mmap records
           corresponding to jitted functions. This option also generates
           the ELF images for each jitted function found in the jitdumps
           files captured in the input perf.data file. Use this option
           if you are monitoring environment using JIT runtimes, such as
           Java, DART or V8.

       -f, --force
           Don’t complain, do it.

       --vm-time-correlation[=OPTIONS]
           Some architectures may capture AUX area data which contains
           timestamps affected by virtualization. This option will
           update those timestamps in place, to correlate with host
           timestamps. The in-place update means that an output file is
           not specified, and instead the input file is modified. The
           options are architecture specific, except that they may start
           with "dry-run" which will cause the file to be processed but
           without updating it. Currently this option is supported only
           by Intel PT, refer <a href="perf-intel-pt.1.html">perf-intel-pt(1)</a>

       --guest-data=&lt;path&gt;,&lt;pid&gt;[,&lt;time offset&gt;[,&lt;time scale&gt;]]
           Insert events from a perf.data file recorded in a virtual
           machine at the same time as the input perf.data file was
           recorded on the host. The Process ID (PID) of the QEMU
           hypervisor process must be provided, and the time offset and
           time scale (multiplier) will likely be needed to convert
           guest time stamps into host time stamps. For example, for x86
           the TSC Offset and Multiplier could be provided for a virtual
           machine using Linux command line option no-kvmclock.
           Currently only mmap, mmap2, comm, task, context_switch,
           ksymbol, and text_poke events are inserted, as well as build
           ID information. The QEMU option -name debug-threads=on is
           needed so that thread names can be used to determine which
           thread is running which VCPU. Note libvirt seems to use this
           by default. When using perf record in the guest, option
           --sample-identifier should be used, and also --buildid-all
           and --switch-events may be useful.

       --guestmount=&lt;path&gt;
           Guest OS root file system mount directory. Users mount guest
           OS root directories under &lt;path&gt; by a specific filesystem
           access method, typically, sshfs. For example, start 2 guest
           OS, one’s pid is 8888 and the other’s is 9999:

               $ mkdir ~/guestmount
               $ cd ~/guestmount
               $ sshfs -o allow_other,direct_io -p 5551 localhost:/ 8888/
               $ sshfs -o allow_other,direct_io -p 5552 localhost:/ 9999/
               $ perf inject --guestmount=~/guestmount
