Description </h2>
<pre>
       GNU <i>soelim</i> is a preprocessor for the <i>groff</i>(7) document formatting
       system.  <i>soelim</i> works as a filter to eliminate source requests in
       <i>roff</i>(7) input files; that is, it replaces lines of the form “<b>.so</b>
       <i>included-file</i>” within each text <i>input-file</i> with the contents of
       <i>included-file</i>, recursively.  By default, it writes <b>lf </b>requests as
       well to record the name and line number of each <i>input-file</i> and
       <i>included-file</i>, so that any diagnostics produced by later
       processing can be accurately traced to the original input.
       Options allow this information to be suppressed (<b>-r</b>) or supplied
       in TeX comments instead (<b>-t</b>).  In the absence of <i>input-file</i>
       arguments, <i>soelim</i> reads the standard input stream.  The program
       writes to the standard output stream.

       If the name of a <i>included-file</i> contains a backslash, use <b>\\ </b>or <b>\e</b>
       to embed it.  To embed a space, write “<b>\ </b>” (backslash followed by
       a space).  Any other escape sequence in <i>included-file</i>, including
       “<b>\[rs]</b>”, prevents <i>soelim</i> from replacing the source request.

       The dot must be at the beginning of a line and must be followed
       by “<b>so</b>” without intervening spaces or tabs for <i>soelim</i> to handle
       it.  This convention allows source requests to be “protected”
       from processing by <i>soelim</i>, for instance as part of macro
       definitions or “<b>if</b>” requests.

       There must also be at least one space between “<b>so</b>” and its
       <i>included-file</i> argument.  The <b>-C </b>option overrides this
       requirement.

       The foregoing is the limit of <i>soelim</i>'s understanding of the <i>roff</i>
       language; it does not, for example, replace the input line
              .if 1 .so otherfile
       with the contents of <i>otherfile</i>.  With its <b>-r </b>option, therefore,
       <i>soelim</i> can be used to process text files in general, to flatten a
       tree of input documents.

       <i>soelim</i> was designed to handle situations where the target of a
       <i>roff</i> source request requires a preprocessor such as <i>eqn</i>(1),
       <i>pic</i>(1), <i>refer</i>(1), or <i>tbl</i>(1).  The usual processing sequence of
       <i>groff</i>(1) is as follows.

                 input        sourced
                 file          file
                   ⎪             ⎪
                   ↓             ↓
               preprocessor ⎯→ troff ⎯→ postprocessor
                                             ⎪
                                             ↓
                                          output
                                           file

       That is, files sourced with “<b>so</b>” are normally read <i>only</i> by the
       formatter, <i>troff</i>.  <i>soelim</i> is <i>not</i> required for <i>troff</i> to source
       files.

       If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must
       already be read <i>before</i> the input file passes through the
       preprocessor.  <i>soelim</i>, normally invoked via <i>groff</i>'s <b>-s </b>option,
       handles this.

                 input
                 file
                   ⎪
                   ↓
                 soelim ⎯→ preprocessor ⎯→ troff ⎯→ postprocessor
                   ↑                                     ⎪
                   ⎪                                     ↓
                sourced                               output
                 file                                  file
</pre> <h2>
Options </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b>displays a usage message, while <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>show
       version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-C     </b>Recognize an input line starting with <b>.so </b>even if a
              character other than a space or newline follows.

       <b>-I </b><i>dir</i> Search the directory <i>dir</i> for <i>input-</i> and <i>included-files.</i>
              If specified more than once, each <i>dir</i> is searched in the
              given order.  To search the current working directory
              before others, add “<b>-I .</b>” at the desired place; it is
              otherwise searched last.

       <b>-r     </b>Write files “raw”; do not add <b>lf </b>requests.

       <b>-t     </b>Emit TeX comment lines starting with “<b>%</b>” indicating the
              current file and line number, rather than <b>lf </b>requests for
              the same purpose.

       If both <b>-r </b>and <b>-t </b>are given, the last one specified controls.
