Description </h2>
<pre>
       The GNU implementation of <i>pic</i> is part of the <i>groff</i>(1) document
       formatting system.  <i>pic</i> is a <i>troff</i>(1) preprocessor that
       translates descriptions of diagrammatic pictures embedded in
       <i>roff</i>(7) or TeX input files into the language understood by TeX or
       <i>troff</i>.  It copies each <i>file</i>'s contents to the standard output
       stream, except for lines between <b>.PS </b>and any of <b>.PE</b>, <b>.PF</b>, or <b>.PY</b>
       which it interprets as picture descriptions.  End a <i>pic</i> picture
       with <b>.PE </b>to leave the drawing position at the bottom of the
       picture, and with <b>.PF </b>or <b>.PY </b>to leave it at the top.  Normally,
       <i>pic</i> is not executed directly by the user, but invoked by
       specifying the <b>-p </b>option to <i>groff</i>(1).  If no <i>file</i> operands are
       present, or if <i>file</i> is “<b>-</b>”, <i>pic</i> reads the standard input stream.

       It is the user's responsibility to provide appropriate
       definitions of the <b>PS</b>, <b>PE</b>, and one or both of the <b>PF </b>and <b>PY</b>
       macros.  When a macro package does not supply these, obtain
       simple definitions with the <i>groff</i> option <b>-mpic</b>; these
       horizontally center each picture.

       GNU <i>pic</i> supports <b>PY </b>as a synonym of <b>PF </b>to work around a name
       space collision with the <i>mm</i> macro package, which defines <b>PF </b>as a
       page footer management macro.  Use <b>PF </b>preferentially unless a
       similar problem faces your document.

Options </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b>displays a usage message, while <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>show
       version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-c     </b>Be more compatible with <i>tpic</i>; implies <b>-t</b>.  Lines beginning
              with <b>\ </b>are not passed through transparently.  Lines
              beginning with <b>. </b>are passed through with the initial <b>.</b>
              changed to <b>\</b>.  A line beginning with <b>.ps </b>is given special
              treatment: it takes an optional integer argument
              specifying the line thickness (pen size) in milliinches; a
              missing argument restores the previous line thickness; the
              default line thickness is 8 milliinches.  The line
              thickness thus specified takes effect only when a non-
              negative line thickness has not been specified by use of
              the <b>thickness </b>attribute or by setting the <b>linethick</b>
              variable.

       <b>-C     </b>Recognize <b>.PS</b>, <b>.PE</b>, <b>.PF</b>, and <b>.PY </b>even when followed by a
              character other than space or newline.

       <b>-n     </b>Don't use <i>groff</i> extensions to the <i>troff</i> drawing commands.
              Specify this option if a postprocessor you're using
              doesn't support these extensions, described in
              <i>groff_out</i>(5).  This option also causes <i>pic</i> not to use
              zero-length lines to draw dots in <i>troff</i> mode.

       <b>-S     </b>Operate in <i>safer mode;</i> <b>sh </b>commands are ignored.  This
              mode, enabled by default, can be useful when operating on
              untrustworthy input.

       <b>-t     </b>Produce TeX output.

       <b>-U     </b>Operate in <i>unsafe mode;</i> <b>sh </b>commands are interpreted.

       <b>-z     </b>In TeX mode, draw dots using zero-length lines.

       The following options supported by other versions of <i>pic</i> are
       ignored.

       <b>-D     </b>Draw all lines using the \D escape sequence.  GNU <i>pic</i>
              always does this.

       <b>-T </b><i>dev</i> Generate output for the <i>troff</i> device <i>dev</i>.  This is
              unnecessary because the <i>troff</i> output generated by GNU <i>pic</i>
              is device-independent.
</pre> <h2>
Usage </h2>
<pre>
       This section primarily discusses the differences between GNU <i>pic</i>
       and the Eighth Edition Unix version of AT&amp;T <i>pic</i> (1985).  Many of
       these differences also apply to later versions of AT&amp;T <i>pic</i>.

   <b>TeX mode</b>
       TeX-compatible output is produced when the <b>-t </b>option is
       specified.  You must use a TeX driver that supports <i>tpic</i> version
       2 specials.  (<i>tpic</i> was a fork of AT&amp;T <i>pic</i> by Tim Morgan of the
       University of California at Irvine that diverged from its source
       around 1984.  It is best known today for lending its name to a
       group of <b>\special </b>commands it produced for TeX.)

       Lines beginning with <b>\ </b>are passed through unaltered except for a
       <b>% </b>suffix to avoid unwanted spaces.  Use this feature to change
       fonts or the value of <b>\baselineskip</b>.  Other applications may
       produce undesirable results; use at your own risk.  By default,
       lines beginning with a dot are not treated specially—but see the
       <b>-c </b>option.

       In TeX mode, <i>pic</i> will define a vbox called <b>\graph </b>for each
       picture.  Use GNU <i>pic</i>'s <b>figname </b>command to change the name of the
       vbox.  You must print that vbox yourself using the command
              \centerline{\box\graph}
       for instance.  Since the vbox has a height of zero—it is defined
       with <b>\vtop</b>—this will produce slightly more vertical space above
       the picture than below it;
              \centerline{\raise 1em\box\graph}
       would avoid this.  To give the vbox a positive height and a depth
       of zero (as used by LaTeX's <i>graphics.sty</i>, for example), define
       the following macro in your document.
              \def\gpicbox#1{%
                \vbox{\unvbox\csname #1\endcsname\kern 0pt}}
       You can then simply say <b>\gpicbox{graph} </b>instead of <b>\box\graph</b>.

   <b>Commands</b>
       Several commands new to GNU <i>pic</i> accept delimiters, shown in their
       synopses as braces <b>{ }</b>.  Nesting of braces is supported.  Any
       other characters (except a space, tab, or newline) may be used as
       alternative delimiters, in which case the members of a given pair
       must be identical.  Strings are recognized within delimiters of
       either kind; they may contain the delimiter character or
       unbalanced braces.

       <b>for </b><i>variable</i> <b>= </b><i>expr1</i> <b>to </b><i>expr2</i> [<b>by </b>[<b>*</b>]<i>expr3</i>] <b>do </b><i>X body X</i>
              Set <i>variable</i> to <i>expr1</i>.  While the value of <i>variable</i> is
              less than or equal to <i>expr2</i>, do <i>body</i> and increment
              <i>variable</i> by <i>expr3</i>; if <b>by </b>is not given, increment <i>variable</i>
              by 1.  <i>expr3</i> can be negative, in which case <i>variable</i> is
              then tested whether it is greater than or equal to <i>expr2</i>.
              A <b>* </b>prefix on <i>variable</i> multiplies it by <i>expr3</i> (which must
              be greater than zero) at each iteration rather than
              incrementing it.  If the range constraint on <i>expr3</i> isn't
              met, the loop will not execute.  <i>X</i> can be any character
              not in <i>body</i>.

       <b>if </b><i>expr</i> <b>then </b><i>X if-true X</i> [<b>else </b><i>Y if-false Y</i>]
              Evaluate <i>expr</i>; if it is non-zero then do <i>if-true</i>,
              otherwise do <i>if-false</i>.  <i>X</i> can be any character not in <i>if-</i>
              <i>true</i>.  <i>Y</i> can be any character not in <i>if-false</i>.

       <b>print </b><i>arg</i> ...
              Concatenate and write arguments to the standard error
              stream followed by a newline.  Each <i>arg</i> must be an
              expression, a position, or text.  This feature is useful
              for debugging.

       <b>command </b><i>arg</i> ...
              Concatenate arguments and pass them as a line to <i>troff</i> or
              TeX.  Each <i>arg</i> must be an expression, a position, or text.
              <b>command </b>allows the values of <i>pic</i> variables to be passed to
              the formatter.  Thus,
                     .PS
                     x = 14
                     command ".ds string x is " x "."
                     .PE
                     \*[string]
              produces
                     x is 14.
              when formatted with <i>troff</i>.

       <b>sh </b><i>X command X</i>
              Pass <i>command</i> to a shell.

       <b>copy "</b><i>filename</i><b>"</b>
              Include <i>filename</i> at this point in the file.

       <b>copy </b>[<b>"</b><i>filename</i><b>"</b>] <b>thru </b><i>X body X</i> [<b>until </b>"<i>word</i><b>"</b>]
       <b>copy </b>[<b>"</b><i>filename</i><b>"</b>] <b>thru </b><i>macro</i> [<b>until </b>"<i>word</i><b>"</b>]
              This construct does <i>body</i> once for each line of <i>filename</i>;
              the line is split into blank-delimited words, and
              occurrences of <b>$</b><i>i</i> in <i>body</i>, for <i>i</i> between 1 and 9, are
              replaced by the <i>i</i>-th word of the line.  If <i>filename</i> is not
              given, lines are taken from the current input up to <b>.PE</b>.
              If an <b>until </b>clause is specified, lines will be read only
              until a line the first word of which is <i>word</i>; that line
              will then be discarded.  <i>X</i> can be any character not in
              <i>body</i>.  For example,
                     .PS
                     copy thru % circle at ($1,$2) % until "END"
                     1 2
                     3 4
                     5 6
                     END
                     box
                     .PE
              and
                     .PS
                     circle at (1,2)
                     circle at (3,4)
                     circle at (5,6)
                     box
                     .PE
              are equivalent.  The commands to be performed for each
              line can also be taken from a macro defined earlier by
              giving the name of the macro as the argument to <b>thru</b>.  The
              argument after <b>thru </b>is looked up as a macro name first; if
              not defined, its first character is interpreted as a
              delimiter.

       <b>reset</b>
       <b>reset </b><i>pvar1</i>[<b>,</b>] <i>pvar2</i> ...
              Reset predefined variables <i>pvar1</i>, <i>pvar2</i> ... to their
              default values; if no arguments are given, reset all
              predefined variables to their default values.  Variable
              names may be separated by commas, spaces, or both.
              Assigning a value to <b>scale </b>also causes all predefined
              variables that control dimensions to be reset to their
              default values times the new value of <b>scale</b>.

       <b>plot </b><i>expr</i> ["<i>text</i>"]
              Create a text object by using <i>text</i> as a format string for
              <i>sprintf</i>(3) with an argument of <i>expr</i>.  If <i>text</i> is omitted,
              <b>"%g" </b>is implied.  Attributes can be specified in the same
              way as for a normal text object.  <b>Caution: </b>be very careful
              that you specify an appropriate format string in <i>text;</i>
              <i>pic</i>'s validation of it is limited.  <b>plot </b>is deprecated in
              favour of <b>sprintf</b>.

       <i>var</i> <b>:= </b><i>expr</i>
              Update an existing variable.  <i>var</i> must already be defined,
              and <i>expr</i> will be assigned to <i>var</i> without creating a
              variable local to the current block.  (By contrast, <b>=</b>
              defines <i>var</i> in the current block if it is not already
              defined there, and then changes the value in the current
              block only.)  For example,
                     <b>.PS</b>
                     <b>x = 3</b>
                     <b>y = 3</b>
                     <b>[</b>
                     <b>x := 5</b>
                     <b>y = 5</b>
                     <b>]</b>
                     <b>print x   y</b>
                     <b>.PE</b>
              writes
                     5 3
              to the standard error stream.

   <b>Expressions</b>
       The syntax for expressions has been significantly extended.

       <i>x</i> <b>^ </b><i>y</i> (exponentiation)
       <b>sin(</b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
       <b>cos(</b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
       <b>atan2(</b><i>y</i><b>, </b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
       <b>log(</b><i>x</i><b>) </b>(base 10)
       <b>exp(</b><i>x</i><b>) </b>(base 10, i.e. 10^<i>x</i>)
       <b>sqrt(</b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
       <b>int(</b><i>x</i><b>)</b>
       <b>rand() </b>(return a random number between 0 and 1)
       <b>rand(</b><i>x</i><b>) </b>(return a random number between 1 and <i>x</i>; deprecated)
       <b>srand(</b><i>x</i><b>) </b>(set the random number seed)
       <b>max(</b><i>e1</i><b>, </b><i>e2</i><b>)</b>
       <b>min(</b><i>e1</i><b>, </b><i>e2</i><b>)</b>
       <b>!</b><i>e</i>
       <i>e1</i> <b>&amp;&amp; </b><i>e2</i>
       <i>e1</i> <b>|| </b><i>e2</i>
       <i>e1</i> <b>== </b><i>e2</i>
       <i>e1</i> <b>!= </b><i>e2</i>
       <i>e1</i> <b>&gt;= </b><i>e2</i>
       <i>e1</i> <b>&gt; </b><i>e2</i>
       <i>e1</i> <b>&lt;= </b><i>e2</i>
       <i>e1</i> <b>&lt; </b><i>e2</i>
       <b>"</b><i>str1</i><b>" == "</b><i>str2</i><b>"</b>
       <b>"</b><i>str1</i><b>" != "</b><i>str2</i><b>"</b>

       String comparison expressions must be parenthesised in some
       contexts to avoid ambiguity.

   <b>Other changes</b>
       A bare expression, <i>expr</i>, is acceptable as an attribute; it is
       equivalent to “<i>dir expr</i>”, where <i>dir</i> is the current direction.
       For example, “<b>line 2i</b>” draws a line 2 inches long in the current
       direction.  The ‘i’ (or ‘I’) character is ignored; to use another
       measurement unit, set the <b>scale </b>variable to an appropriate value.

       The maximum width and height of the picture are taken from the
       variables <b>maxpswid </b>and <b>maxpsht</b>.  Initially, these have values 8.5
       and 11, respectively.

       Scientific notation is allowed for numbers, as with “<b>x = 5e-2</b>”.

       Text attributes can be compounded.  For example, “<b>"foo" above</b>
       <b>ljust</b>” is valid.

       There is no limit to the depth to which blocks can be nested.
       For example,

              [A: [B: [C: box ]]] with .A.B.C.sw at 1,2
              circle at last [].A.B.C

       is acceptable.

       Arcs have compass points determined by the circle of which the
       arc is a part.

       Circles, ellipses, and arcs can be dotted or dashed.  In TeX
       mode, splines can be dotted or dashed as well.

       Boxes can have rounded corners.  The <b>rad </b>attribute specifies the
       radius of the quarter-circles at each corner.  If no <b>rad </b>or <b>diam</b>
       attribute is given, a radius of <b>boxrad </b>is used.  Initially,
       <b>boxrad </b>has a value of 0.  A box with rounded corners can be
       dotted or dashed.

       Boxes can have slanted sides, generalizing them from rectangles
       to parallelograms.  The <b>xslanted </b>and <b>yslanted </b>attributes specify
       the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> offsets of the box's upper right corner from its
       default position.

       The <b>.PS </b>line accepts a second argument specifying a maximum
       height for the picture.  If a width of zero is specified, it will
       be ignored when computing the scaling factor for the picture.
       GNU <i>pic</i> will always scale a picture by the same amount vertically
       as well as horizontally.  This is different from DWB 2.0 <i>pic</i>,
       which may scale a picture by a different amount vertically than
       horizontally if a height is specified.

       Each text object has an associated invisible box that determines
       its compass points and implicit motion.  The dimensions of the
       box are taken from its width and height attributes.  If the width
       attribute is not supplied, the value of <b>textwid </b>is assumed.  If
       the height attribute is not supplied, the height will default to
       the number of text strings associated with the object times
       <b>textht</b>.  Initially, <b>textwid </b>and <b>textht </b>have values of 0.

       In (almost all) places where a quoted text string can be used, an
       expression of the form

              <b>sprintf("</b><i>format</i><b>", </b><i>arg</i><b>, </b>...<b>)</b>

       can be used instead; this will produce the arguments per the
       <i>format</i>, which should be a string as described in <i>printf</i>(3), and
       appropriate to the quantity of arguments supplied.  Only the
       modifiers “<b>#</b>”, “<b>-</b>”, “<b>+</b>”, and “ ” [space]), a minimum field width,
       an optional precision, and the conversion specifiers <b>%e</b>, <b>%E</b>, <b>%f</b>,
       <b>%g</b>, <b>%G</b>, and <b>%% </b>are supported.

       The thickness of the lines used to draw objects is controlled by
       the <b>linethick </b>variable, which is measured in points.  A negative
       value indicates the default thickness.  In TeX output mode when
       the <b>-c </b>option is not given, this means 8 milliinches.  In <i>troff</i>
       and TeX <b>-c </b>output modes, the default thickness corresponds to the
       type size.  (Thus, if the type size is 10 points, a line is 10
       points thick.)  A <b>linethick </b>value of zero draws the thinnest
       possible line supported by the output device.  Initially,
       <b>linethick </b>has a value of -1.  A <b>thick</b>[<b>ness</b>] attribute is also
       available.  For example, “<b>circle thickness 1.5</b>” draws a circle
       with a line thickness of 1.5 points.  The thickness of lines is
       not affected by the value of the <b>scale </b>variable, nor by the width
       or height given in the <b>.PS </b>line.

       Boxes (including boxes with rounded corners or slanted sides),
       circles, and ellipses can be filled by giving them an attribute
       of <b>fill</b>[<b>ed</b>], which takes an optional expression argument with a
       value between 0 and 1; 0 will fill it with white, 1 with black,
       values in between with a proportionally gray shade.  A value
       greater than 1 is interpreted as the shade of gray that is being
       used for text and lines.  Normally this will be black, but output
       devices may provide a mechanism for changing this.  Without an
       argument, the value of the variable <b>fillval </b>is used.  Initially,
       <b>fillval </b>has a value of 0.5.  The <b>invisible </b>attribute does not
       affect the filling of objects.  Text associated with a filled
       object is added after the object is filled, so that the text is
       not obscured by the filling.

       Additional modifiers are available to draw colored objects:
       <b>outline</b>[<b>d</b>] sets the color of the outline, <b>shaded </b>the fill color,
       and <b>colo</b>[<b>u</b>]<b>r</b>[<b>ed</b>] sets both.  All expect a subsequent string
       argument specifying the color.
              circle shaded "green" outline "black"
       Color is not yet supported in TeX mode.  Device macro files like
       <i>ps.tmac</i> declare color names; you can define additional ones with
       the <b>defcolor </b>request (see <i>groff</i>(7)).  <i>pic</i> assumes at the
       beginning of each picture that the stroke and fill colors are set
       to the device defaults.

       To change the name of the vbox in TeX mode, set the pseudo-
       variable <b>figname </b>(which is actually a specially parsed command)
       within a picture.  For example,
              .PS
              figname = foobar;
              circle "dig here";
              .PE
       makes the picture available in the box <b>\foobar</b>.

       Arrow heads are drawn as solid triangles if the variable
       <b>arrowhead </b>is non-zero and either TeX mode is enabled or the <b>-n</b>
       option is not used.  Initially, <b>arrowhead </b>has a value of 1.
       Solid arrow heads are always filled with the current outline
       (stroke) color.

       The <i>troff</i> output of <i>pic</i> is device-independent.  The <b>-T </b>option is
       therefore redundant.  Except where noted, all measurements and
       dimensions use inches implicitly; they are never interpreted as
       <i>troff</i> basic units.

       Objects can have an <b>aligned </b>attribute, but it is supported only
       by the <i>grops</i>(1) and <i>gropdf</i>(1) output drivers.  Any text
       associated with an <b>aligned </b>object is rotated about the object's
       center such that it is oriented along a line connecting the start
       and end points of the object.  <b>aligned </b>has no effect on objects
       whose start and end points are coincident.

       In places where <i>n</i><b>th </b>is allowed, <b>'</b><i>expr</i><b>'th </b>is also allowed.  “<b>'th</b>“
       is a single token: no space is allowed between the apostrophe and
       the “<b>th</b>”.  For example,

              for i = 1 to 4 do {
                 line from 'i'th box.nw to 'i+1'th box.se
              }

   <b>Converting <i>pic</i> to other image formats</b>
       To create a stand-alone graphics file from a <i>pic</i> file, first
       compose the picture.  Bracket your <i>pic</i> code with <b>.PS </b>and <b>.PE</b>
       tokens.  <i>groff</i> requests that don't produce formatted output may
       precede <b>.PS</b>, but no text should be formatted.  That restriction
       applies to the injection of text by macro packages, which may
       include a page number even on the first page, as <i>mm</i> does by
       default.  Writing a “raw” <i>roff</i> document that uses no macro
       package is an economical approach.

       Next, convert the <i>roff</i>/<i>pic</i> input into the desired format.  <i>groff</i>
       distributes a simple utility, <i>pic2graph</i>(1), for this purpose.
       Other possibilities exist, particularly if you first transform
       your picture into PostScript format with “<b>groff -T ps</b>”.  However,
       such a PostScript file will lack bounding box information; <i>roff</i>
       formatters produce page-sized output.  Several tools with names
       beginning “psto” or “ps2” exist that can infer the bounding box
       and perform a format conversion.  One of these is the PostScript
       interpreter Ghostscript (<i>gs</i>(1)), which exposes format converters
       via its <b>-sDEVICE= </b>option.  “<b>gs --help</b>” lists available devices.

       Alternatively, produce a PDF with “<b>groff -T pdf</b>”; <i>gropdf</i>(1)'s <b>-p</b>
       option will set the MediaBox of the file.

       The Encapsulated PostScript File (EPS) format is still sometimes
       seen.  The aforementioned Ghostscript offers <i>ps2epsi</i>(1), and a
       standalone package and command <i>ps2eps</i>(1) is also available.

       For raster image formats, use <i>pstopnm</i>(1); the resulting <i>pnm</i>(5)
       file can be then converted to virtually any image format using
       the <i>netpbm</i> tools.

Bugs </h2>
<pre>
       Characters that are invalid as input to GNU <i>troff</i> (see the <i>groff</i>
       Texinfo manual or <i>groff_char</i>(7) for a list) are rejected even in
       TeX mode.

       The interpretation of <b>fillval </b>is incompatible with the <i>pic</i> in
       Research Tenth Edition Unix, which interprets 0 as black and 1 as
       white.
