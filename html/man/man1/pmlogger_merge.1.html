NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogger_merge </b>- helper script to merge Performance Co-Pilot
       archives
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_merge </b>[<b>-fNVE?</b>]  [<i>input-basename</i> ...
       <i>output-name</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogger_merge </b>is a helper script that is used by
       <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> when merging all of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) archives for a single host on a single day into a combined
       PCP archive.

       <b>pmlogger_merge </b>is a wrapper script for <a href="pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a> that
       merges all of the archives matching the <i>input-basename</i> arguments,
       and creates a new archive using <i>output-name</i> as the base name for
       the physical files that constitute an archive.  The <i>input-</i>
       <i>basename</i> arguments may contain meta characters in the style of
       <b>sh</b>(1).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
            This option causes all of the input files to be removed once
            the output archive has been created.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--showme</b>
            Runs <b>pmlogger_merge </b>in a ``show me'' or ``dry run'' mode
            where the tasks that would be performed are reported, but no
            changes are made.  This is typically used for debugging in
            combination with one (verbose) or two (very verbose) <b>-V</b>
            options.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            Increase verbosity in the output progress report.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--expunge</b>
            When metric metadata differences are encountered between
            archives to be merged, the default behaviour is for
            <b>pmlogger_merge </b>to fail with a fatal error and the <i>output-</i>
            <i>name</i> archive is not created.  The <b>-E </b>flag instead issues a
            warning and excludes the affected metrics from the merged
            output archive.  This is intended for automated daily
            archive rotation where it is highly desirable for unattended
            daily archive merging, rewriting and compression to succeed.
            See also <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> and the <b>-x </b>flag to
            <a href="pmlogextract.1.html">pmlogextract(1)</a>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
