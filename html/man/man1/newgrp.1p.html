NAME </h2>
<pre>
       newgrp — change to a new group
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       newgrp <b>[</b>-l<b>] [</b><i>group</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>newgrp</i> utility shall create a new shell execution environment
       with a new real and effective group identification. Of the
       attributes listed in <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>,
       the new shell execution environment shall retain the working
       directory, file creation mask, and exported variables from the
       previous environment (that is, open files, traps, unexported
       variables, alias definitions, shell functions, and <i>set</i> options
       may be lost). All other aspects of the process environment that
       are preserved by the <i>exec</i> family of functions defined in the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall also be preserved
       by <i>newgrp</i>; whether other aspects are preserved is unspecified.

       A failure to assign the new group identifications (for example,
       for security or password-related reasons) shall not prevent the
       new shell execution environment from being created.

       The <i>newgrp</i> utility shall affect the supplemental groups for the
       process as follows:

        *  On systems where the effective group ID is normally in the
           supplementary group list (or whenever the old effective group
           ID actually is in the supplementary group list):

           --  If the new effective group ID is also in the
               supplementary group list, <i>newgrp</i> shall change the
               effective group ID.

           --  If the new effective group ID is not in the supplementary
               group list, <i>newgrp</i> shall add the new effective group ID
               to the list, if there is room to add it.

        *  On systems where the effective group ID is not normally in
           the supplementary group list (or whenever the old effective
           group ID is not in the supplementary group list):

           --  If the new effective group ID is in the supplementary
               group list, <i>newgrp</i> shall delete it.

           --  If the old effective group ID is not in the supplementary
               list, <i>newgrp</i> shall add it if there is room.

       <b>Note:</b>
           The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify
           whether the effective group ID of a process is included in
           its supplementary group list.

       With no operands, <i>newgrp</i> shall change the effective group back to
       the groups identified in the user's user entry, and shall set the
       list of supplementary groups to that set in the user's group
       database entries.

       If the first argument is <b>'-'</b>, the results are unspecified.

       If a password is required for the specified group, and the user
       is not listed as a member of that group in the group database,
       the user shall be prompted to enter the correct password for that
       group. If the user is listed as a member of that group, no
       password shall be requested.  If no password is required for the
       specified group, it is implementation-defined whether users not
       listed as members of that group can change to that group. Whether
       or not a password is required, implementation-defined system
       accounting or security mechanisms may impose additional
       authorization restrictions that may cause <i>newgrp</i> to write a
       diagnostic message and suppress the changing of the group
       identification.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>newgrp</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       for the unspecified usage of <b>'-'</b>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-l        </b>(The letter ell.) Change the environment to what would
                 be expected if the user actually logged in again.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>group</i>     A group name from the group database or a non-negative
                 numeric group ID. Specifies the group ID to which the
                 real and effective group IDs shall be set. If <i>group</i> is
                 a non-negative numeric string and exists in the group
                 database as a group name (see <i>getgrnam</i>()), the numeric
                 group ID associated with that group name shall be used
                 as the group ID.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The file <b>/dev/tty </b>shall be used to read a single line of text for
       password checking, when one is required.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>newgrp</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and a
       prompt string for a password, if one is required. Diagnostic
       messages may be written in cases where the exit status is not
       available. See the EXIT STATUS section.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>newgrp</i> succeeds in creating a new shell execution environment,
       whether or not the group identification was changed successfully,
       the exit status shall be the exit status of the shell. Otherwise,
       the following exit value shall be returned:

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The invoking shell may terminate.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       There is no convenient way to enter a password into the group
       database. Use of group passwords is not encouraged, because by
       their very nature they encourage poor security practices. Group
       passwords may disappear in the future.

       A common implementation of <i>newgrp</i> is that the current shell uses
       <i>exec</i> to overlay itself with <i>newgrp</i>, which in turn overlays itself
       with a new shell after changing group.  On some implementations,
       however, this may not occur and <i>newgrp</i> may be invoked as a
       subprocess.

       The <i>newgrp</i> command is intended only for use from an interactive
       terminal. It does not offer a useful interface for the support of
       applications.

       The exit status of <i>newgrp</i> is generally inapplicable. If <i>newgrp</i> is
       used in a script, in most cases it successfully invokes a new
       shell and the rest of the original shell script is bypassed when
       the new shell exits. Used interactively, <i>newgrp</i> displays
       diagnostic messages to indicate problems. But usage such as:

           newgrp foo
           echo $?

       is not useful because the new shell might not have access to any
       status <i>newgrp</i> may have generated (and most historical systems do
       not provide this status). A zero status echoed here does not
       necessarily indicate that the user has changed to the new group
       successfully. Following <i>newgrp</i> with the <i>id</i> command provides a
       portable means of determining whether the group change was
       successful or not.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Most historical implementations use one of the <i>exec</i> functions to
       implement the behavior of <i>newgrp</i>.  Errors detected before the
       <i>exec</i> leave the environment unchanged, while errors detected after
       the <i>exec</i> leave the user in a changed environment. While it would
       be useful to have <i>newgrp</i> issue a diagnostic message to tell the
       user that the environment changed, it would be inappropriate to
       require this change to some historical implementations.

       The password mechanism is allowed in the group database, but how
       this would be implemented is not specified.

       The <i>newgrp</i> utility was retained in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       even given the existence of the multiple group permissions
       feature in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, for
       several reasons. First, in some implementations, the group
       ownership of a newly created file is determined by the group of
       the directory in which the file is created, as allowed by the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017; on other
       implementations, the group ownership of a newly created file is
       determined by the effective group ID. On implementations of the
       latter type, <i>newgrp</i> allows files to be created with a specific
       group ownership. Finally, many implementations use the real group
       ID in accounting, and on such systems, <i>newgrp</i> allows the
       accounting identity of the user to be changed.
