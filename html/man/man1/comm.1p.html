PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       comm — select or reject lines common to two files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       comm <b>[</b>-123<b>] </b><i>file1 file2</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>comm</i> utility shall read <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i>, which should be
       ordered in the current collating sequence, and produce three text
       columns as output: lines only in <i>file1</i>, lines only in <i>file2</i>, and
       lines in both files.

       If the lines in both files are not ordered according to the
       collating sequence of the current locale, the results are
       unspecified.

       If the collating sequence of the current locale does not have a
       total ordering of all characters (see the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 7.3.2</i>, <i>LC_COLLATE</i>) and any lines from
       the input files collate equally but are not identical, <i>comm</i>
       should treat them as different lines but may treat them as being
       the same. If it treats them as different, <i>comm</i> should expect them
       to be ordered according to a further byte-by-byte comparison
       using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale and if they are
       not ordered in this way, the output of <i>comm</i> can identify such
       lines as being both unique to <i>file1</i> and unique to <i>file2</i> instead
       of being in both files.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>comm</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-1        </b>Suppress the output column of lines unique to <i>file1</i>.

       <b>-2        </b>Suppress the output column of lines unique to <i>file2</i>.

       <b>-3        </b>Suppress the output column of lines duplicated in <i>file1</i>
                 and <i>file2</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>file1</i>     A pathname of the first file to be compared. If <i>file1</i>
                 is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be used.

       <i>file2</i>     A pathname of the second file to be compared. If <i>file2</i>
                 is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be used.

       If both <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> refer to standard input or to the same
       FIFO special, block special, or character special file, the
       results are undefined.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if one of the <i>file1</i> or
       <i>file2</i> operands refers to standard input. See the INPUT FILES
       section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be text files.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>comm</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the collating sequence <i>comm</i>
                 expects to have been used when the input files were
                 sorted.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>comm</i> utility shall produce output depending on the options
       selected. If the <b>-1</b>, <b>-2</b>, and <b>-3 </b>options are all selected, <i>comm</i>
       shall write nothing to standard output.

       If the <b>-1 </b>option is not selected, lines contained only in <i>file1</i>
       shall be written using the format:

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>line in file1</i>&gt;

       If the <b>-2 </b>option is not selected, lines contained only in <i>file2</i>
       are written using the format:

           "%s%s\n", &lt;<i>lead</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>line in file2</i>&gt;

       where the string &lt;<i>lead</i>&gt; is as follows:

       &lt;tab&gt;     The <b>-1 </b>option is not selected.

       null string
                 The <b>-1 </b>option is selected.

       If the <b>-3 </b>option is not selected, lines contained in both files
       shall be written using the format:

           "%s%s\n", &lt;<i>lead</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>line in both</i>&gt;

       where the string &lt;<i>lead</i>&gt; is as follows:

       &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;
                 Neither the <b>-1 </b>nor the <b>-2 </b>option is selected.

       &lt;tab&gt;     Exactly one of the <b>-1 </b>and <b>-2 </b>options is selected.

       null string
                 Both the <b>-1 </b>and <b>-2 </b>options are selected.

       If the input files were ordered according to the collating
       sequence of the current locale, the lines written shall be in the
       collating sequence of the current locale. If the input files
       contained any lines that collated equally but were not identical
       and within each file those lines were ordered according to a
       further byte-by-byte comparison using the collating sequence for
       the POSIX locale, and <i>comm</i> treated them as different lines, then
       lines written that collate equally but are not identical should
       be ordered according to a further byte-by-byte comparison using
       the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>

       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were successfully output as specified.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the input files are not properly presorted, the output of <i>comm</i>
       might not be useful.

       When using <i>comm</i> to process pathnames, it is recommended that
       LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or
       C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences
       that do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case
       the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale
       each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this
       problem is avoided.

       If the collating sequence of the current locale does not have a
       total ordering of all characters, this can affect the behavior of
       <i>comm</i> in the following ways:

        *  If <i>comm</i> treats lines as being the same only if they are
           identical, some lines can be misleadingly identified as being
           both unique to <i>file1</i> and unique to <i>file2</i>.

        *  If <i>comm</i> treats lines as being the same if they collate
           equally and a line from <i>file1</i> collates equally with a line
           from <i>file2</i> but is not identical to it, one of the lines is
           misleadingly identified as being in both files and the other
           is not written to the output at all.

       Such problems can be avoided by forcing the use of the POSIX
       locale; for example, the following identifies lines in both <i>file1</i>
       and <i>file2</i>:

           LC_ALL=POSIX sort file1 &gt; file1.posix
           LC_ALL=POSIX sort file2 &gt; file2.posix
           LC_ALL=POSIX comm -12 file1.posix file2.posix | sort

       The final <i>sort</i> re-sorts the output of <i>comm</i> according to the
       collating sequence of the original locale. Doing this might be
       difficult if more than one column is output and leading &lt;blank&gt;s
       cannot be ignored.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       If a file named <b>xcu </b>contains a sorted list of the utilities in
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, a file named <b>xpg3 </b>contains a sorted
       list of the utilities specified in the X/Open Portability Guide,
       Issue 3, and a file named <b>svid89 </b>contains a sorted list of the
       utilities in the System V Interface Definition Third Edition:

           comm -23 xcu xpg3 | comm -23 - svid89

       would print a list of utilities in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       not specified by either of the other documents:

           comm -12 xcu xpg3 | comm -12 - svid89

       would print a list of utilities specified by all three documents,
       and:

           comm -12 xpg3 svid89 | comm -23 - xcu

       would print a list of utilities specified by both XPG3 and the
       SVID, but not specified in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version of this standard may require that if any lines
       from the input files collate equally but are not identical, then
       <i>comm</i> treats them as different lines and expects them to be
       ordered according to a further byte-by-byte comparison using the
       collating sequence for the POSIX locale.

       A future version of this standard may require that if the input
       files contained any lines that collated equally but were not
       identical and within each file those lines were ordered according
       to a further byte-by-byte comparison using the collating sequence
       for the POSIX locale, then lines written that collate equally but
       are not identical are ordered according to a further byte-by-byte
       comparison using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
