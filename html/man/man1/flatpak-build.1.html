</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-build - Build in a directory
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak build </b>[OPTION...] DIRECTORY [COMMAND [ARG...]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Runs a build command in a directory.  DIRECTORY must have been
       initialized with <b>flatpak build-init</b>.

       The sdk that is specified in the metadata file in the directory
       is mounted at /usr and the files and var subdirectories are
       mounted at /app and /var, respectively. They are writable, and
       their contents are preserved between build commands, to allow
       accumulating build artifacts there.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--runtime</b>
           Use the non-devel runtime that is specified in the
           application metadata instead of the devel runtime.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--die-with-parent</b>
           Kill the build process and all children when the launching
           process dies.

       <b>--bind-mount=DEST=SOURCE</b>
           Add a custom bind mount in the build namespace. Can be
           specified multiple times.

       <b>--build-dir=PATH</b>
           Start the build in this directory (default is in the current
           directory).

       <b>--share=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the
           Context section from the application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM
           must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--unshare=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Don't share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides
           the Context section from the application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM
           must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--socket=SOCKET</b>
           Expose a well-known socket to the application. This overrides
           to the Context section from the application metadata.  SOCKET
           must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio,
           system-bus, session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent,
           inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--nosocket=SOCKET</b>
           Don't expose a well-known socket to the application. This
           overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11,
           pulseaudio, system-bus, session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups,
           gpg-agent, inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--device=DEVICE</b>
           Expose a device to the application. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata.  DEVICE must
           be one of: dri, input, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--nodevice=DEVICE</b>

           used multiple times.

       <b>--allow=FEATURE</b>
           Allow access to a specific feature. This updates the
           [Context] group in the metadata.  FEATURE must be one of:
           devel, multiarch, bluetooth, canbus, per-app-dev-shm. This
           option can be used multiple times.

           See <a href="flatpak-build-finish.1.html">flatpak-build-finish(1)</a> for the meaning of the various
           features.

       <b>--disallow=FEATURE</b>
           Disallow access to a specific feature. This updates the
           [Context] group in the metadata.  FEATURE must be one of:
           devel, multiarch, bluetooth, canbus, per-app-dev-shm. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--filesystem=FILESYSTEM[:ro|:create]</b>
           Allow the application access to a subset of the filesystem.
           This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  FILESYSTEM can be one of: home, host, host-os,
           host-etc, xdg-desktop, xdg-documents, xdg-download,
           xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share, xdg-templates,
           xdg-videos, xdg-run, xdg-config, xdg-cache, xdg-data, an
           absolute path, or a homedir-relative path like ~/dir or paths
           relative to the xdg dirs, like xdg-download/subdir. The
           optional :ro suffix indicates that the location will be
           read-only. The optional :create suffix indicates that the
           location will be read-write and created if it doesn't exist.
           This option can be used multiple times. See the "[Context]
           filesystems" list in <a href="../man5/flatpak-metadata.5.html">flatpak-metadata(5)</a> for details of the
           meanings of these filesystems.

       <b>--nofilesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Remove access to the specified subset of the filesystem from
           the application. This overrides to the Context section from
           the application metadata.  FILESYSTEM can be one of: home,
           host, host-os, host-etc, xdg-desktop, xdg-documents,
           xdg-download, xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share,
           xdg-templates, xdg-videos, an absolute path, or a
           homedir-relative path like ~/dir. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--with-appdir</b>
           Expose and configure access to the per-app storage directory
           in $HOME/.var/app. This is not normally useful when building,
           but helps when testing built apps.

       <b>--add-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Add generic policy option. For example,
           "--add-policy=subsystem.key=v1 --add-policy=subsystem.key=v2"
           would map to this metadata:

               [Policy subsystem]
               key=v1;v2;

           This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--remove-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Remove generic policy option. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--env=VAR=VALUE</b>
           Set an environment variable in the application. This
           overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--unset-env=VAR</b>
           Unset an environment variable in the application. This
           overrides the unset-environment entry in the [Context] group
           of the metadata, and the [Environment] group. This option can
           be used multiple times.

       <b>--env-fd=</b><i>FD</i>
           Read environment variables from the file descriptor <i>FD</i>, and
           set them as if via <b>--env</b>. This can be used to avoid
           environment variables and their values becoming visible to
           other users.

           Each environment variable is in the form <i>VAR</i>=<i>VALUE</i> followed
           by a zero byte. This is the same format used by env -0 and
           /proc/*/environ.

       <b>--own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well-known name NAME on the
           session bus. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well-known name NAME on
           the session bus. This overrides to the Context section from
           the application metadata. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--system-own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well-known name NAME on the
           system bus. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well-known name NAME on
           the system bus. This overrides to the Context section from
           the application metadata. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--persist=FILENAME</b>
           If the application doesn't have access to the real homedir,
           make the (homedir-relative) path FILENAME a bind mount to the
           corresponding path in the per-application directory, allowing
           that location to be used for persistent data. This overrides
           to the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--sdk-dir=DIR</b>
           Normally if there is a usr directory in the build dir, this
           is used for the runtime files (this can be created by
           <b>--writable-sdk </b>or <b>--type=runtime </b>arguments to build-init). If
           you specify <b>--sdk-dir</b>, this directory will be used instead.
           Use this if you passed <b>--sdk-dir </b>to build-init.

       <b>--readonly</b>
           Mount the normally writable destination directories
           read-only. This can be useful if you want to run something in
           the sandbox but guarantee that it doesn't affect the build
           results. For example tests.

       <b>--metadata=FILE</b>
           Use the specified filename as metadata in the exported app
           instead of the default file (called metadata). This is useful
           if you build multiple things from a single build tree (such
           as both a platform and a sdk).

       <b>--log-session-bus</b>
           Log session bus traffic. This can be useful to see what
           access you need to allow in your D-Bus policy.

       <b>--log-system-bus</b>
           Log system bus traffic. This can be useful to see what access
           you need to allow in your D-Bus policy.
