PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sort — sort, merge, or sequence check text files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       sort <b>[</b>-m<b>] [</b>-o <i>output</i><b>] [</b>-bdfinru<b>] [</b>-t <i>char</i><b>] [</b>-k <i>keydef</i><b>]</b>... <b>[</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>

       sort <b>[</b>-c|-C<b>] [</b>-bdfinru<b>] [</b>-t <i>char</i><b>] [</b>-k <i>keydef</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sort</i> utility shall perform one of the following functions:

        1. Sort lines of all the named files together and write the
           result to the specified output.

        2. Merge lines of all the named (presorted) files together and
           write the result to the specified output.

        3. Check that a single input file is correctly presorted.

       Comparisons shall be based on one or more sort keys extracted
       from each line of input (or, if no sort keys are specified, the
       entire line up to, but not including, the terminating &lt;newline&gt;),
       and shall be performed using the collating sequence of the
       current locale. If this collating sequence does not have a total
       ordering of all characters (see the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 7.3.2</i>, <i>LC_COLLATE</i>), any lines of input that
       collate equally should be further compared byte-by-byte using the
       collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sort</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except for
       Guideline 9, and the <b>-k </b><i>keydef</i> option should follow the <b>-b</b>, <b>-d</b>,
       <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-r </b>options. In addition, <b>'+' </b>may be recognized as
       an option delimiter as well as <b>'-'</b>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c        </b>Check that the single input file is ordered as
                 specified by the arguments and the collating sequence
                 of the current locale. Output shall not be sent to
                 standard output. The exit code shall indicate whether
                 or not disorder was detected or an error occurred. If
                 disorder (or, with <b>-u</b>, a duplicate key) is detected, a
                 warning message shall be sent to standard error
                 indicating where the disorder or duplicate key was
                 found.

       <b>-C        </b>Same as <b>-c</b>, except that a warning message shall not be
                 sent to standard error if disorder or, with <b>-u</b>, a
                 duplicate key is detected.

       <b>-m        </b>Merge only; the input file shall be assumed to be
                 already sorted.

       <b>-o </b><i>output</i> Specify the name of an output file to be used instead
                 of the standard output. This file can be the same as
                 one of the input <i>file</i>s.

       <b>-u        </b>Unique: suppress all but one in each set of lines
                 having equal keys.  If used with the <b>-c </b>option, check
                 that there are no lines with duplicate keys, in
                 addition to checking that the input file is sorted.

       The following options shall override the default ordering rules.
       When ordering options appear independent of any key field
       specifications, the requested field ordering rules shall be
       applied globally to all sort keys. When attached to a specific
       key (see <b>-k</b>), the specified ordering options shall override all
       global ordering options for that key.

       <b>-d        </b>Specify that only &lt;blank&gt; characters and alphanumeric
                 characters, according to the current setting of
                 <i>LC_CTYPE</i>, shall be significant in comparisons. The
                 behavior is undefined for a sort key to which <b>-i </b>or <b>-n</b>
                 also applies.

       <b>-f        </b>Consider all lowercase characters that have uppercase
                 equivalents, according to the current setting of
                 <i>LC_CTYPE</i>, to be the uppercase equivalent for the
                 purposes of comparison.

       <b>-i        </b>Ignore all characters that are non-printable, according
                 to the current setting of <i>LC_CTYPE</i>.  The behavior is
                 undefined for a sort key for which <b>-n </b>also applies.

       <b>-n        </b>Restrict the sort key to an initial numeric string,
                 consisting of optional &lt;blank&gt; characters, optional
                 &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character, and zero or more digits with
                 an optional radix character and thousands separators
                 (as defined in the current locale), which shall be
                 sorted by arithmetic value. An empty digit string shall
                 be treated as zero. Leading zeros and signs on zeros
                 shall not affect ordering.

       <b>-r        </b>Reverse the sense of comparisons.

       The treatment of field separators can be altered using the
       options:

       <b>-b        </b>Ignore leading &lt;blank&gt; characters when determining the
                 starting and ending positions of a restricted sort key.
                 If the <b>-b </b>option is specified before the first <b>-k</b>
                 option, it shall be applied to all <b>-k </b>options.
                 Otherwise, the <b>-b </b>option can be attached independently
                 to each <b>-k </b><i>field_start</i> or <i>field_end</i> option-argument
                 (see below).

       <b>-t </b><i>char</i>   Use <i>char</i> as the field separator character; <i>char</i> shall
                 not be considered to be part of a field (although it
                 can be included in a sort key). Each occurrence of <i>char</i>
                 shall be significant (for example, &lt;<i>char</i>&gt;&lt;<i>char</i>&gt;
                 delimits an empty field). If <b>-t </b>is not specified,
                 &lt;blank&gt; characters shall be used as default field
                 separators; each maximal non-empty sequence of &lt;blank&gt;
                 characters that follows a non-&lt;blank&gt; shall be a field
                 separator.

       Sort keys can be specified using the options:

       <b>-k </b><i>keydef</i> The <i>keydef</i> argument is a restricted sort key field
                 definition. The format of this definition is:

                     <i>field_start</i><b>[</b><i>type</i><b>][</b>,<i>field_end</i><b>[</b><i>type</i><b>]]</b>

                 where <i>field_start</i> and <i>field_end</i> define a key field
                 restricted to a portion of the line (see the EXTENDED
                 DESCRIPTION section), and <i>type</i> is one or more modifiers
                 from the list of characters <b>'b'</b>, <b>'d'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, <b>'i'</b>, <b>'n'</b>,
                 <b>'r'</b>.  The <b>'b' </b>modifier shall behave like the <b>-b </b>option,
                 but shall apply only to the <i>field_start</i> or <i>field_end</i> to
                 which it is attached. The other modifiers shall behave
                 like the corresponding options, but shall apply only to
                 the key field to which they are attached; they shall
                 have this effect if specified with <i>field_start</i>,
                 <i>field_end</i>, or both. If any modifier is attached to a
                 <i>field_start</i> or to a <i>field_end</i>, no option shall apply to
                 either. Implementations shall support at least nine
                 occurrences of the <b>-k </b>option, which shall be
                 significant in command line order. If no <b>-k </b>option is
                 specified, a default sort key of the entire line shall
                 be used.

                 When there are multiple key fields, later keys shall be
                 compared only after all earlier keys compare equal.
                 Except when the <b>-u </b>option is specified, lines that
                 otherwise compare equal shall be ordered as if none of
                 the options <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-n</b>, or <b>-k </b>were present (but
                 with <b>-r </b>still in effect, if it was specified) and with
                 all bytes in the lines significant to the comparison.
                 The order in which lines that still compare equal are
                 written is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file to be sorted, merged, or checked.
                 If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, or if a <i>file</i> operand
                 is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be used. If <i>sort</i>
                 encounters an error when opening or reading a <i>file</i>
                 operand, it may exit without writing any output to
                 standard output or processing later operands.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <i>file</i> operands are
       specified, or if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-'</b>.  See the INPUT FILES
       section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be text files, except that the <i>sort</i> utility
       shall add a &lt;newline&gt; to the end of a file ending with an
       incomplete last line.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>sort</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for ordering rules.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files) and the
                 behavior of character classification for the <b>-b</b>, <b>-d</b>,
                 <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, and <b>-n </b>options.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>
                 Determine the locale for the definition of the radix
                 character and thousands separator for the <b>-n </b>option.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Unless the <b>-o </b>or <b>-c </b>options are in effect, the standard output
       shall contain the sorted input.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages. When <b>-c</b>
       is specified, if disorder is detected (or if <b>-u </b>is also specified
       and a duplicate key is detected), a message shall be written to
       the standard error which identifies the input line at which
       disorder (or a duplicate key) was detected. A warning message
       about correcting an incomplete last line of an input file may be
       generated, but need not affect the final exit status.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>-o </b>option is in effect, the sorted input shall be written
       to the file <i>output</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The notation:

           -k <i>field_start</i><b>[</b><i>type</i><b>][</b>,<i>field_end</i><b>[</b><i>type</i><b>]]</b>

       shall define a key field that begins at <i>field_start</i> and ends at
       <i>field_end</i> inclusive, unless <i>field_start</i> falls beyond the end of
       the line or after <i>field_end</i>, in which case the key field is
       empty. A missing <i>field_end</i> shall mean the last character of the
       line.

       A field comprises a maximal sequence of non-separating characters
       and, in the absence of option <b>-t</b>, any preceding field separator.

       The <i>field_start</i> portion of the <i>keydef</i> option-argument shall have
       the form:

           <i>field_number</i><b>[</b>.<i>first_character</i><b>]</b>

       Fields and characters within fields shall be numbered starting
       with 1.  The <i>field_number</i> and <i>first_character</i> pieces, interpreted
       as positive decimal integers, shall specify the first character
       to be used as part of a sort key. If <i>.first_character</i> is omitted,
       it shall refer to the first character of the field.

       The <i>field_end</i> portion of the <i>keydef</i> option-argument shall have
       the form:

           <i>field_number</i><b>[</b>.<i>last_character</i><b>]</b>

       The <i>field_number</i> shall be as described above for <i>field_start.</i>
       The <i>last_character</i> piece, interpreted as a non-negative decimal
       integer, shall specify the last character to be used as part of
       the sort key. If <i>last_character</i> evaluates to zero or
       <i>.last_character</i> is omitted, it shall refer to the last character
       of the field specified by <i>field_number</i>.

       If the <b>-b </b>option or <b>b </b>type modifier is in effect, characters
       within a field shall be counted from the first non-&lt;blank&gt; in the
       field. (This shall apply separately to <i>first_character</i> and
       <i>last_character</i>.)
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were output successfully, or <b>-c </b>was
             specified and the input file was correctly sorted.

        1    Under the <b>-c </b>option, the file was not ordered as specified,
             or if the <b>-c </b>and <b>-u </b>options were both specified, two input
             lines were found with equal keys.

       &gt;1    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The default requirements shall apply, except that if <i>sort</i>
       encounters an error when opening or reading a <i>file</i> operand, it
       may exit without writing any output to standard output or
       processing later operands.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The default value for <b>-t</b>, &lt;blank&gt;, has different properties from,
       for example, <b>-t</b>"&lt;space&gt;". If a line contains:

           &lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo

       the following treatment would occur with default separation as
       opposed to specifically selecting a &lt;space&gt;:
                 ┌───────┬───────────────────┬──────────────┐
                 │ <b>Field </b>│      <b>Default      </b>│ <b>-t "&lt;space&gt;" </b>│
                 ├───────┼───────────────────┼──────────────┤
                 │   1   │ &lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;foo │ <i>empty</i>        │
                 │   2   │ <i>empty</i>             │ <i>empty</i>        │
                 │   3   │ <i>empty</i>             │ foo          │
                 └───────┴───────────────────┴──────────────┘

       The leading field separator itself is included in a field when <b>-t</b>
       is not used. For example, this command returns an exit status of
       zero, meaning the input was already sorted:

           sort -c -k 2 &lt;&lt;eof
           y&lt;tab&gt;b
           x&lt;space&gt;a
           eof

       (assuming that a &lt;tab&gt; precedes the &lt;space&gt; in the current
       collating sequence). The field separator is not included in a
       field when it is explicitly set via <b>-t</b>.  This is historical
       practice and allows usage such as:

           sort -t "|" -k 2n &lt;&lt;eof
           Atlanta|425022|Georgia
           Birmingham|284413|Alabama
           Columbia|100385|South Carolina
           eof

       where the second field can be correctly sorted numerically
       without regard to the non-numeric field separator.

       The wording in the OPTIONS section clarifies that the <b>-b</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>,
       <b>-i</b>, <b>-n</b>, and <b>-r </b>options have to come before the first sort key
       specified if they are intended to apply to all specified keys.
       The way it is described in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 matches
       historical practice, not historical documentation.  The results
       are unspecified if these options are specified after a <b>-k </b>option.

       The <b>-f </b>option might not work as expected in locales where there
       is not a one-to-one mapping between an uppercase and a lowercase
       letter.

       When using <i>sort</i> to process pathnames, it is recommended that
       LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or
       C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences
       that do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case
       the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale
       each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this
       problem is avoided.

       If the collating sequence of the current locale does not have a
       total ordering of all characters, this can affect the behavior of
       <i>sort</i> in the following ways:

        *  As <i>sort</i> <b>-u </b>suppresses lines with duplicate keys, it
           suppresses lines that collate equally but are not identical.

        *  The output of <i>sort</i> (without <b>-u</b>) can contain identical lines
           that are not adjacent, if it does not implement the
           recommended further byte-by-byte comparison of lines that
           collate equally. This affects the use of <i>sort</i> with <i>comm</i> and
           <i>uniq</i>; see the APPLICATION USAGE for those utilities.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. The following command sorts the contents of <b>infile </b>with the
           second field as the sort key:

               sort -k 2,2 infile

        2. The following command sorts, in reverse order, the contents
           of <b>infile1 </b>and <b>infile2</b>, placing the output in <b>outfile </b>and
           using the second character of the second field as the sort
           key (assuming that the first character of the second field is
           the field separator):

               sort -r -o outfile -k 2.2,2.2 infile1 infile2

        3. The following command sorts the contents of <b>infile1 </b>and
           <b>infile2 </b>using the second non-&lt;blank&gt; of the second field as
           the sort key:

               sort -k 2.2b,2.2b infile1 infile2

        4. The following command prints the System V password file (user
           database) sorted by the numeric user ID (the third
           &lt;colon&gt;-separated field):

               sort -t : -k 3,3n /etc/passwd

        5. The following command prints the lines of the already sorted
           file <b>infile</b>, suppressing all but one occurrence of lines
           having the same third field:

               sort -um -k 3.1,3.0 infile
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Examples in some historical documentation state that options <b>-um</b>
       with one input file keep the first in each set of lines with
       equal keys. This behavior was deemed to be an implementation
       artifact and was not standardized.

       The <b>-z </b>option was omitted; it is not standard practice on most
       systems and is inconsistent with using <i>sort</i> to sort several files
       individually and then merge them together. The text concerning <b>-z</b>
       in historical documentation appeared to require implementations
       to determine the proper buffer length during the sort phase of
       operation, but not during the merge.

       The <b>-y </b>option was omitted because of non-portability. The <b>-M</b>
       option, present in System V, was omitted because of non-
       portability in international usage.

       An undocumented <b>-T </b>option exists in some implementations. It is
       used to specify a directory for intermediate files.
       Implementations are encouraged to support the use of the <i>TMPDIR</i>
       environment variable instead of adding an option to support this
       functionality.

       The <b>-k </b>option was added to satisfy two objections. First, the
       zero-based counting used by <i>sort</i> is not consistent with other
       utility conventions. Second, it did not meet syntax guideline
       requirements.

       Historical documentation indicates that ``setting <b>-n </b>implies
       <b>-b</b>''.  The description of <b>-n </b>already states that optional leading
       &lt;blank&gt;s are tolerated in doing the comparison. If <b>-b </b>is enabled,
       rather than implied, by <b>-n</b>, this has unusual side-effects. When a
       character offset is used in a column of numbers (for example, to
       sort modulo 100), that offset is measured relative to the most
       significant digit, not to the column.  Based upon a
       recommendation from the author of the original <i>sort</i> utility, the
       <b>-b </b>implication has been omitted from this volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       and an application wishing to achieve the previously mentioned
       side-effects has to code the <b>-b </b>flag explicitly.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed the <b>-o </b>option to appear
       after operands. Historical practice allowed all options to be
       interspersed with operands. This version of the standard allows
       implementations to accept options after operands but conforming
       applications should not use this form.

       Earlier versions of this standard also allowed the <b>-</b><i>number</i> and
       <b>+</b><i>number</i> options. These options are no longer specified by
       POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some implementations.

       Historical implementations produced a message on standard error
       when <b>-c </b>was specified and disorder was detected, and when <b>-c </b>and
       <b>-u </b>were specified and a duplicate key was detected. An earlier
       version of this standard contained wording that did not make it
       clear that this message was allowed and some implementations
       removed this message to be sure that they conformed to the
       standard's requirements. Confronted with this difference in
       behavior, interactive users that wanted to be sure that they got
       visual feedback instead of just exit code 1 could have used a
       command like:

           sort -c file || echo disorder

       whether or not the <i>sort</i> utility provided a message in this case.
       But, it was not easy for a user to find where the disorder or
       duplicate key occurred on implementations that do not produce a
       message, especially when some parts of the input line were not
       part of the key and when one or more of the <b>-b</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-n</b>,
       or <b>-</b>r options or <i>keydef</i> type modifiers were in use. POSIX.1‐2008
       requires a message to be produced in this case. POSIX.1‐2008 also
       contains the <b>-C </b>option giving users the ability to choose either
       behavior.

       When a disorder or duplicate is found when the <b>-c </b>option is
       specified, some implementations print a message containing the
       first line that is out of order or contains a duplicate key;
       others print a message specifying the line number of the
       offending line. This standard allows either type of message.

       Implementations are encouraged to perform the recommended further
       byte-by-byte comparison of lines that collate equally, even
       though this may affect efficiency. The impact on efficiency can
       be mitigated by only performing the additional comparison if the
       current locale's collating sequence does not have a total
       ordering of all characters (if the implementation provides a way
       to query this) or by only performing the additional comparison if
       the locale name associated with the LC_COLLATE category has an
       <b>'@' </b>modifier in the name (since locales without an <b>'@' </b>modifier
       should have a total ordering of all characters — see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 7.3.2</i>, <i>LC_COLLATE</i>).
       Note that if the implementation provides a <i>stable sort</i> option as
       an extension (usually <b>-s</b>), the additional comparison should not
       be performed when this option has been specified.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version of this standard may require that if the
       collating sequence of the current locale does not have a total
       ordering of all characters, any lines of input that collate
       equally when comparing them as whole lines are further compared
       byte-by-byte using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.
