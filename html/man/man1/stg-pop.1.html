NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-pop - Pop (unapply) one or more applied patches
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg pop</i> [OPTIONS] [patch]...
       <i>stg pop</i> [OPTIONS] --all

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Pop (unapply) one or more applied patches.

       By default, the topmost applied patch is popped.

       If ranges of patches are specified, pop and push operations are
       performed such that only the patches specified on the command
       line are unapplied at the end of the operation. It is possible
       for some of these intermediate push operations to fail due to
       conflicts if patches are popped out of last-pushed first-popped
       order.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -a, --all
           Pop all applied patches

       -n &lt;number&gt;, --number=&lt;number&gt;
           Pop the specified &lt;number&gt; of patches.

           A negative number indicates to pop all but that number of
           patches

       -s, --spill
           Keep patches' modifications in index and worktree after
           popping

       -k, --keep
           Keep the local changes
