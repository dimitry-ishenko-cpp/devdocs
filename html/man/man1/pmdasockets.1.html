</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdasockets </b>- sockets statistics PMDA
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdasockets </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metric values for current sockets on the local system.

       This PMDA currently collects its data through the <a href="../man8/ss.8.html">ss(8)</a> utility
       and requires that the program is installed in order to function.
       This dependency may change in the future.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       To install (enable) the <b>sockets </b>PMDA, do the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sockets</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall (disable), do the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sockets</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdasockets </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
FILTER CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The string valued metric <b>network.persocket.filter </b>specifies the
       <b>ss</b>(1) filter to be applied to optionally select socket states, IP
       addresses and other options that <b>pmdasockets </b>will collect (to
       populate it's instance domain).  This is loaded on PMDA startup
       from the file <b>$(PCP_SYSCONF_DIR)/sockets/filter.conf </b>(typically
       <b>/etc/pcp/sockets/filter.conf</b>) and defaults to <b>state connected</b>
       meaning only sockets in the <b>connected </b>state will be included.
       This can be changed persistently by editing <b>filter.conf </b>as the
       root user.  The filter can also be changed dynamically after the
       PMDA has started by using <a href="pmstore.1.html">pmstore(1)</a> to store a new filter string
       in the <b>network.persocket.filter </b>metric.  E.g.

           <b># pmstore network.persocket.filter "state all"</b>

       will change the filter to include sockets in all states.  Note a
       dynamically stored filter is not persisted across PMDA restarts
       or reboots (edit the config file for a persistent change).  For
       further details of the filter syntax and options, consult <a href="../man8/ss.8.html">ss(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
LOGGING CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The <a href="pmlogconf.1.html">pmlogconf(1)</a> configuration file for <b>pmdasockets </b>is
       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmlogconf/networking/persocket-linux </b>(where
       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR </b>is typically <b>/var/lib/pcp</b>) which specifies to log
       all metrics below <b>network.persocket </b>in the PCP namespace with a
       default sampling interval of 60 seconds.  The logging interval
       and metrics to be logged can be changed by editing that file and
       then restarting the <b>pmlogger </b>service.  For details of the syntax,
       see <a href="pmlogconf.1.html">pmlogconf(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
METRICS </h2>
<pre>
       The metrics and metadata supported by <b>pmdasockets </b>correspond to
       fields reported by <b>ss -noemitauOH </b>and are also available as help
       text provided by the PMDA, e.g. to list all metrics, metadata
       descriptors and help text:

           <b># pminfo -fmdtT network.persocket</b>

       Note that the PMDA must be installed (enabled) for this command
       to work correctly, see above.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by <b>PCP</b>. On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
