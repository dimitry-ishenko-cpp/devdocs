PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       uname — return system name
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       uname <b>[</b>-amnrsv<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       By default, the <i>uname</i> utility shall write the operating system
       name to standard output. When options are specified, symbols
       representing one or more system characteristics shall be written
       to the standard output. The format and contents of the symbols
       are implementation-defined. On systems conforming to the System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the symbols written shall be
       those supported by the <i>uname</i>() function as defined in the System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>uname</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a        </b>Behave as though all of the options <b>-mnrsv </b>were
                 specified.

       <b>-m        </b>Write the name of the hardware type on which the system
                 is running to standard output.

       <b>-n        </b>Write the name of this node within an implementation-
                 defined communications network.

       <b>-r        </b>Write the current release level of the operating system
                 implementation.

       <b>-s        </b>Write the name of the implementation of the operating
                 system.

       <b>-v        </b>Write the current version level of this release of the
                 operating system implementation.

       If no options are specified, the <i>uname</i> utility shall write the
       operating system name, as if the <b>-s </b>option had been specified.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>uname</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       By default, the output shall be a single line of the following
       form:

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>sysname</i>&gt;

       If the <b>-a </b>option is specified, the output shall be a single line
       of the following form:

           "%s %s %s %s %s\n", &lt;<i>sysname</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>nodename</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>release</i>&gt;,
               &lt;<i>version</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>machine</i>&gt;

       Additional implementation-defined symbols may be written; all
       such symbols shall be written at the end of the line of output
       before the &lt;newline&gt;.

       If options are specified to select different combinations of the
       symbols, only those symbols shall be written, in the order shown
       above for the <b>-a </b>option. If a symbol is not selected for writing,
       its corresponding trailing &lt;blank&gt; characters also shall not be
       written.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The requested information was successfully written.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Note that any of the symbols could include embedded &lt;space&gt;
       characters, which may affect parsing algorithms if multiple
       options are selected for output.

       The node name is typically a name that the system uses to
       identify itself for inter-system communication addressing.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following command:

           uname -sr

       writes the operating system name and release level, separated by
       one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       It was suggested that this utility cannot be used portably since
       the format of the symbols is implementation-defined. The POSIX.1
       working group could not achieve consensus on defining these
       formats in the underlying <i>uname</i>() function, and there was no
       expectation that this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 would be any more
       successful. Some applications may still find this historical
       utility of value. For example, the symbols could be used for
       system log entries or for comparison with operator or user input.
