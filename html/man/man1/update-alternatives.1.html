NAME </h2>
<pre>
       update-alternatives - maintain symbolic links determining default
       commands
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>update-alternatives </b>[<i>option</i>...] <i>command</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>update-alternatives </b>creates, removes, maintains and displays
       information about the symbolic links comprising the alternatives
       system.

       It is possible for several programs fulfilling the same or
       similar functions to be installed on a single system at the same
       time.  For example, many systems have several text editors
       installed at once.  This gives choice to the users of a system,
       allowing each to use a different editor, if desired, but makes it
       difficult for a program to make a good choice for an editor to
       invoke if the user has not specified a particular preference.

       The alternatives system aims to solve this problem.  A generic
       name in the filesystem is shared by all files providing
       interchangeable functionality.  The alternatives system and the
       system administrator together determine which actual file is
       referenced by this generic name.  For example, if the text
       editors <b>ed</b>(1) and <b>nvi</b>(1) are both installed on the system, the
       alternatives system will cause the generic name <i>/usr/bin/editor</i>
       to refer to <i>/usr/bin/nvi</i> by default.  The system administrator
       can override this and cause it to refer to <i>/usr/bin/ed</i> instead,
       and the alternatives system will not alter this setting until
       explicitly requested to do so.

       The generic name is not a direct symbolic link to the selected
       alternative.  Instead, it is a symbolic link to a name in the
       <i>alternatives directory</i>, which in turn is a symbolic link to the
       actual file referenced.  This is done so that the system
       administrator's changes can be confined within the <i>/usr/local/etc</i>
       directory: the FHS (q.v.) gives reasons why this is a Good Thing.

       When each package providing a file with a particular
       functionality is installed, changed or removed, <b>update-</b>
       <b>alternatives </b>is called to update information about that file in
       the alternatives system.  <b>update-alternatives </b>is usually called
       from the following Debian package maintainer scripts, <b>postinst</b>
       (configure) to install the alternative and from <b>prerm </b>and <b>postrm</b>
       (remove) to remove the alternative.  <b>Note</b>: in most (if not all)
       cases no other maintainer script actions should call <b>update-</b>
       <b>alternatives</b>, in particular neither of <b>upgrade </b>nor <b>disappear</b>, as
       any other such action can lose the manual state of an
       alternative, or make the alternative temporarily flip-flop, or
       completely switch when several of them have the same priority.

       It is often useful for a number of alternatives to be
       synchronized, so that they are changed as a group; for example,
       when several versions of the <b>vi</b>(1) editor are installed, the
       manual page referenced by <i>/usr/share/man/man1/vi.1</i> should
       correspond to the executable referenced by <i>/usr/bin/vi</i>.  <b>update-</b>
       <b>alternatives </b>handles this by means of <i>master</i> and <i>slave</i> links;
       when the master is changed, any associated slaves are changed
       too.  A master link and its associated slaves make up a <i>link</i>
       <i>group</i>.

       Each link group is, at any given time, in one of two modes:
       automatic or manual.  When a group is in automatic mode, the
       alternatives system will automatically decide, as packages are
       installed and removed, whether and how to update the links.  In
       manual mode, the alternatives system will retain the choice of
       the administrator and avoid changing the links (except when
       something is broken).

       Link groups are in automatic mode when they are first introduced
       to the system.  If the system administrator makes changes to the
       system's automatic settings, this will be noticed the next time
       <b>update-alternatives </b>is run on the changed link's group, and the
       group will automatically be switched to manual mode.

       Each alternative has a <i>priority</i> associated with it.  When a link
       group is in automatic mode, the alternatives pointed to by
       members of the group will be those which have the highest
       priority.

       When using the <b>--config </b>option, <b>update-alternatives </b>will list all
       of the choices for the link group of which given <i>name</i> is the
       master alternative name.  The current choice is marked with a
       ‘*’.  You will then be prompted for your choice regarding this
       link group.  Depending on the choice made, the link group might
       no longer be in <i>auto</i> mode.  You will need to use the <b>--auto</b>
       option in order to return to the automatic mode (or you can rerun
       <b>--config </b>and select the entry marked as automatic).

       If you want to configure non-interactively you can use the <b>--set</b>
       option instead (see below).

       Different packages providing the same file need to do so
       <b>cooperatively</b>.  In other words, the usage of <b>update-alternatives</b>
       is <b>mandatory </b>for all involved packages in such case.  It is not
       possible to override some file in a package that does not employ
       the <b>update-alternatives </b>mechanism.
</pre> <h2>
TERMINOLOGY </h2>
<pre>
       Since the activities of <b>update-alternatives </b>are quite involved,
       some specific terms will help to explain its operation.

       generic name (or alternative link)
           A name, like <i>/usr/bin/editor</i>, which refers, via the
           alternatives system, to one of a number of files of similar
           function.

       alternative name
           The name of a symbolic link in the alternatives directory.

       alternative (or alternative path)
           The name of a specific file in the filesystem, which may be
           made accessible via a generic name using the alternatives
           system.

       alternatives directory
           A directory, by default <i>/usr/local/etc/alternatives</i>,
           containing the symlinks.

       administrative directory
           A directory, by default <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/alternatives</i>,
           containing <b>update-alternatives</b>' state information.

       link group
           A set of related symlinks, intended to be updated as a group.

       master link
           The alternative link in a link group which determines how the
           other links in the group are configured.

       slave link
           An alternative link in a link group which is controlled by
           the setting of the master link.

       automatic mode
           When a link group is in automatic mode, the alternatives
           system ensures that the links in the group point to the
           highest priority alternative appropriate for the group.

       manual mode
           When a link group is in manual mode, the alternatives system
           will not make any changes to the system administrator's
           settings.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--install </b><i>link name path priority</i> [<b>--slave </b><i>link name path</i>]...
           Add a group of alternatives to the system.  <i>link</i> is the
           generic name for the master link, <i>name</i> is the name of its
           symlink in the alternatives directory, and <i>path</i> is the
           alternative being introduced for the master link.  The
           arguments after <b>--slave </b>are the generic name, symlink name in
           the alternatives directory and the alternative path for a
           slave link.  Zero or more <b>--slave </b>options, each followed by
           three arguments, may be specified.  Note that the master
           alternative must exist or the call will fail.  However if a
           slave alternative doesn't exist, the corresponding slave
           alternative link will simply not be installed (a warning will
           still be displayed).  If some real file is installed where an
           alternative link has to be installed, it is kept unless
           <b>--force </b>is used.

           If the alternative name specified exists already in the
           alternatives system's records, the information supplied will
           be added as a new set of alternatives for the group.
           Otherwise, a new group, set to automatic mode, will be added
           with this information.  If the group is in automatic mode,
           and the newly added alternatives' priority is higher than any
           other installed alternatives for this group, the symlinks
           will be updated to point to the newly added alternatives.

       <b>--set </b><i>name path</i>
           Set the program <i>path</i> as alternative for <i>name</i>.  This is
           equivalent to <b>--config </b>but is non-interactive and thus
           scriptable.

       <b>--remove </b><i>name path</i>
           Remove an alternative and all of its associated slave links.
           <i>name</i> is a name in the alternatives directory, and <i>path</i> is an
           absolute filename to which <i>name</i> could be linked.  If <i>name</i> is
           indeed linked to <i>path</i>, <i>name</i> will be updated to point to
           another appropriate alternative (and the group is put back in
           automatic mode), or removed if there is no such alternative
           left.  Associated slave links will be updated or removed,
           correspondingly.  If the link is not currently pointing to
           <i>path</i>, no links are changed; only the information about the
           alternative is removed.

       <b>--remove-all </b><i>name</i>
           Remove all alternatives and all of their associated slave
           links.  <i>name</i> is a name in the alternatives directory.

       <b>--all</b>
           Call <b>--config </b>on all alternatives.  It can be usefully
           combined with <b>--skip-auto </b>to review and configure all
           alternatives which are not configured in automatic mode.
           Broken alternatives are also displayed.  Thus a simple way to
           fix all broken alternatives is to call <b>yes '' | update-</b>
           <b>alternatives --force --all</b>.

       <b>--auto </b><i>name</i>
           Switch the link group behind the alternative for <i>name</i> to
           automatic mode.  In the process, the master symlink and its
           slaves are updated to point to the highest priority installed
           alternatives.

       <b>--display </b><i>name</i>
           Display information about the link group.  Information
           displayed includes the group's mode (auto or manual), the
           master and slave links, which alternative the master link
           currently points to, what other alternatives are available
           (and their corresponding slave alternatives), and the highest
           priority alternative currently installed.

       <b>--get-selections</b>
           List all master alternative names (those controlling a link
           group) and their status (since version 1.15.0).  Each line
           contains up to 3 fields (separated by one or more spaces).
           The first field is the alternative name, the second one is
           the status (either <b>auto </b>or <b>manual</b>), and the last one contains
           the current choice in the alternative (beware: it's a
           filename and thus might contain spaces).

       <b>--set-selections</b>
           Read configuration of alternatives on standard input in the
           format generated by <b>--get-selections </b>and reconfigure them
           accordingly (since version 1.15.0).

       <b>--query </b><i>name</i>
           Display information about the link group like <b>--display </b>does,
           but in a machine parseable way (since version 1.15.0, see
           section "QUERY FORMAT" below).

       <b>--list </b><i>name</i>
           Display all targets of the link group.

       <b>--config </b><i>name</i>
           Show available alternatives for a link group and allow the
           user to interactively select which one to use.  The link
           group is updated.

       <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.

</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0   </b>The requested action was successfully performed.

       <b>2   </b>Problems were encountered whilst parsing the command line or
           performing the action.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
           If set and the <b>--instdir </b>or <b>--root </b>options have not been

       <i>/usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/alternatives/</i>
           The default administration directory.  Can be overridden by
           the <b>--admindir </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
QUERY FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>--query </b>format is using an RFC822-like flat format.  It's
       made of <i>n</i> + 1 stanzas where <i>n</i> is the number of alternatives
       available in the queried link group.  The first stanza contains
       the following fields:

       <b>Name: </b><i>name</i>
           The alternative name in the alternative directory.

       <b>Link: </b><i>link</i>
           The generic name of the alternative.

       <b>Slaves: </b><i>list-of-slaves</i>
           When this field is present, the <b>next </b>lines hold all slave
           links associated to the master link of the alternative.
           There is one slave per line.  Each line contains one space,
           the generic name of the slave alternative, another space, and
           the path to the slave link.

       <b>Status: </b><i>status</i>
           The status of the alternative (<b>auto </b>or <b>manual</b>).

       <b>Best: </b><i>best-choice</i>
           The path of the best alternative for this link group.  Not
           present if there is no alternatives available.

       <b>Value: </b><i>currently-selected-alternative</i>
           The path of the currently selected alternative.  It can also
           take the magic value <b>none</b>.  It is used if the link doesn't
           exist.

       The other stanzas describe the available alternatives in the
       queried link group:

       <b>Alternative: </b><i>path-of-this-alternative</i>
           Path to this stanza's alternative.

       <b>Priority: </b><i>priority-value</i>
           Value of the priority of this alternative.

       <b>Slaves: </b><i>list-of-slaves</i>
           When this field is present, the <b>next </b>lines hold all slave
           alternatives associated to the master link of the
           alternative.  There is one slave per line.  Each line
           contains one space, the generic name of the slave
           alternative, another space, and the path to the slave
           alternative.

   <b>Example</b>
        $ update-alternatives --query editor
        Name: editor
        Link: /usr/bin/editor
        Slaves:

         editor.ru.1.gz /usr/share/man/ru/man1/vim.1.gz
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       With <b>--verbose update-alternatives </b>chatters incessantly about its
       activities on its standard output channel.  If problems occur,
       <b>update-alternatives </b>outputs error messages on its standard error
       channel and returns an exit status of 2.  These diagnostics
       should be self-explanatory; if you do not find them so, please
       report this as a bug.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       There are several packages which provide a text editor compatible
       with <b>vi</b>, for example <b>nvi </b>and <b>vim</b>.  Which one is used is
       controlled by the link group <b>vi</b>, which includes links for the
       program itself and the associated manual page.

       To display the available packages which provide <b>vi </b>and the
       current setting for it, use the <b>--display </b>action:

        update-alternatives --display vi

       To choose a particular <b>vi </b>implementation, use this command as
       root and then select a number from the list:

        update-alternatives --config vi

       To go back to having the <b>vi </b>implementation chosen automatically,
       do this as root:

        update-alternatives --auto vi
