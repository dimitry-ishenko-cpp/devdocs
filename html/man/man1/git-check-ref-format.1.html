SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git check-ref-format</i> [--normalize]
              [--[no-]allow-onelevel] [--refspec-pattern]
              &lt;refname&gt;
       <i>git check-ref-format</i> --branch &lt;branchname-shorthand&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Checks if a given <i>refname</i> is acceptable, and exits with a
       non-zero status if it is not.

       A reference is used in Git to specify branches and tags. A branch
       head is stored in the <b>refs/heads </b>hierarchy, while a tag is stored
       in the <b>refs/tags </b>hierarchy of the ref namespace (typically in
       <b>$GIT_DIR/refs/heads </b>and <b>$GIT_DIR/refs/tags </b>directories or, as
       entries in file <b>$GIT_DIR/packed-refs </b>if refs are packed by <b>git</b>
       <b>gc</b>).

       Git imposes the following rules on how references are named:

        1. They can include slash <b>/ </b>for hierarchical (directory)
           grouping, but no slash-separated component can begin with a
           dot <b>.  </b>or end with the sequence <b>.lock</b>.

        2. They must contain at least one <b>/</b>. This enforces the presence
           of a category like <b>heads/</b>, <b>tags/ </b>etc. but the actual names
           are not restricted. If the <b>--allow-onelevel </b>option is used,
           this rule is waived.

        3. They cannot have two consecutive dots <b>..  </b>anywhere.

        4. They cannot have ASCII control characters (i.e. bytes whose
           values are lower than \040, or \177 <b>DEL</b>), space, tilde <b>~</b>,
           caret <b>^</b>, or colon <b>: </b>anywhere.

        5. They cannot have question-mark <b>?</b>, asterisk <b>*</b>, or open bracket
           <b>[ </b>anywhere. See the <b>--refspec-pattern </b>option below for an
           exception to this rule.

        6. They cannot begin or end with a slash <b>/ </b>or contain multiple
           consecutive slashes (see the <b>--normalize </b>option below for an
           exception to this rule).

        7. They cannot end with a dot <b>.</b>.

        8. They cannot contain a sequence <b>@{</b>.

        9. They cannot be the single character <b>@</b>.

       10. They cannot contain a <b>\</b>.

       These rules make it easy for shell script based tools to parse
       reference names, pathname expansion by the shell when a reference
       name is used unquoted (by mistake), and also avoid ambiguities in
       certain reference name expressions (see <a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>):

        1. A double-dot <b>..  </b>is often used as in <b>ref1..ref2</b>, and in some
           contexts this notation means <b>^ref1 ref2 </b>(i.e. not in <b>ref1 </b>and
           in <b>ref2</b>).

        2. A tilde <b>~ </b>and caret <b>^ </b>are used to introduce the postfix <i>nth</i>
           <i>parent</i> and <i>peel onion</i> operation.

        3. A colon <b>: </b>is used as in <b>srcref:dstref </b>to mean "use srcref’s
           value and store it in dstref" in fetch and push operations.
           It may also be used to select a specific object such as with
           <i>git cat-file</i>: "git cat-file blob v1.3.3:refs.c".

        4. at-open-brace <b>@{ </b>is used as a notation to access a reflog
           entry.

       With the <b>--branch </b>option, the command takes a name and checks if
       it can be used as a valid branch name (e.g. when creating a new
       branch). But be cautious when using the previous checkout syntax
       that may refer to a detached HEAD state. The rule <b>git</b>
       <b>check-ref-format --branch $name </b>implements may be stricter than
       what <b>git check-ref-format refs/heads/$name </b>says (e.g. a dash may
       appear at the beginning of a ref component, but it is explicitly
       forbidden at the beginning of a branch name). When run with the
       <b>--branch </b>option in a repository, the input is first expanded for
       the “previous checkout syntax” <b>@{-n}</b>. For example, <b>@{-1} </b>is a way
       to refer the last thing that was checked out using "git switch"
       or "git checkout" operation. This option should be used by
       porcelains to accept this syntax anywhere a branch name is
       expected, so they can act as if you typed the branch name. As an
       exception note that, the “previous checkout operation” might
       result in a commit object name when the N-th last thing checked
       out was not a branch.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --[no-]allow-onelevel
           Controls whether one-level refnames are accepted (i.e.,
           refnames that do not contain multiple <b>/</b>-separated
           components). The default is <b>--no-allow-onelevel</b>.

       --refspec-pattern
           Interpret &lt;refname&gt; as a reference name pattern for a refspec
           (as used with remote repositories). If this option is
           enabled, &lt;refname&gt; is allowed to contain a single <b>* </b>in the
           refspec (e.g., <b>foo/bar*/baz </b>or <b>foo/bar*baz/ </b>but not
           <b>foo/bar*/baz*</b>).

       --normalize
           Normalize <i>refname</i> by removing any leading slash (<b>/</b>)
           characters and collapsing runs of adjacent slashes between
           name components into a single slash. If the normalized
           refname is valid then print it to standard output and exit
           with a status of 0, otherwise exit with a non-zero status.
           (<b>--print </b>is a deprecated way to spell <b>--normalize</b>.)
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       •   Print the name of the previous thing checked out:

               $ git check-ref-format --branch @{-1}

       •   Determine the reference name to use for a new branch:

               $ ref=$(git check-ref-format --normalize "refs/heads/$newbranch")||
               { echo "we do not like '$newbranch' as a branch name." &gt;&amp;2 ; exit 1 ; }
