NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-gui - A portable graphical interface to Git
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git gui</i> [&lt;command&gt;] [&lt;arguments&gt;]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A Tcl/Tk based graphical user interface to Git. <i>git gui</i> focuses
       on allowing users to make changes to their repository by making
       new commits, amending existing ones, creating branches,
       performing local merges, and fetching/pushing to remote
       repositories.

       Unlike <i>gitk</i>, <i>git gui</i> focuses on commit generation and single file
       annotation and does not show project history. It does however
       supply menu actions to start a <i>gitk</i> session from within <i>git gui</i>.

       <i>git gui</i> is known to work on all popular UNIX systems, Mac OS X,
       and Windows (under both Cygwin and MSYS). To the extent possible
       OS specific user interface guidelines are followed, making <i>git</i>
       <i>gui</i> a fairly native interface for users.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       blame
           Start a blame viewer on the specified file on the given
           version (or working directory if not specified).

       browser
           Start a tree browser showing all files in the specified
           commit. Files selected through the browser are opened in the
           blame viewer.

       citool
           Start <i>git gui</i> and arrange to make exactly one commit before
           exiting and returning to the shell. The interface is limited
           to only commit actions, slightly reducing the application’s
           startup time and simplifying the menubar.

       version
           Display the currently running version of <i>git gui</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git gui blame Makefile</b>
           Show the contents of the file <i>Makefile</i> in the current working
           directory, and provide annotations for both the original
           author of each line, and who moved the line to its current
           location. The uncommitted file is annotated, and uncommitted
           changes (if any) are explicitly attributed to <i>Not Yet</i>
           <i>Committed</i>.

       <b>git gui blame v0.99.8 Makefile</b>
           Show the contents of <i>Makefile</i> in revision <i>v0.99.8</i> and provide
           annotations for each line. Unlike the above example the file
           is read from the object database and not the working
           directory.

       <b>git gui blame --line=100 Makefile</b>
           Loads annotations as described above and automatically
           scrolls the view to center on line <i>100</i>.

       <b>git gui citool</b>
           Make one commit and return to the shell when it is complete.
           This command returns a non-zero exit code if the window was
           closed in any way other than by making a commit.

       <b>git gui citool --amend</b>
           Automatically enter the <i>Amend Last Commit</i> mode of the
           interface.

       <b>git gui citool --nocommit</b>
           Behave as normal citool, but instead of making a commit
           simply terminate with a zero exit code. It still checks that
           the index does not contain any unmerged entries, so you can
           use it as a GUI version of <a href="git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool(1)</a>

       <b>git citool</b>
           Same as <b>git gui citool </b>(above).

       <b>git gui browser maint</b>
           Show a browser for the tree of the <i>maint</i> branch. Files
           selected in the browser can be viewed with the internal blame
           viewer.

SEE ALSO </h2>
<pre>
       <a href="gitk.1.html">gitk(1)</a>
           The Git repository browser. Shows branches, commit history
           and file differences. gitk is the utility started by <i>git</i>
           <i>gui</i>'s Repository Visualize actions.
</pre> <h2>
