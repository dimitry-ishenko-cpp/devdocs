</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmproxy </b>acts as a protocol proxy, allowing Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) monitoring clients to connect to one or more <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and/or
       <b>redis-server</b>(1) instances via <b>pmproxy</b>.

       In its default mode of operation <b>pmproxy </b>provides the REST API
       for PCP services (see <a href="../man3/pmwebapi.3.html">PMWEBAPI(3)</a> for details).  This includes
       provision of an Open Metrics - <i><a href="https://openmetrics.io">https://openmetrics.io</a> </i> - text
       interface for PCP metrics at <i>/metrics</i>, real-time access to PCP
       metrics through the <i>/pmapi</i> interfaces, and access to the fast,
       scalable PCP time series query capabilities offered in
       conjunction with a <b>redis-server</b>(1) (see <a href="pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a> for details)
       via the <i>/query</i> REST interfaces.

       <b>pmproxy </b>can be deployed in a firewall domain, or on a cluster
       ``head'' node where the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the
       hosts where <b>pmcd </b>and/or <b>redis-server </b>are running may be unknown
       to the PCP monitoring clients, but where the IP address of the
       host running <b>pmproxy </b>is known to these clients.  Similarly, the
       clients may have network connectivity only to the host where
       <b>pmproxy </b>is running, while there is network connectivity from that
       host to the hosts of interest where <b>pmcd </b>and/or <b>redis-server </b>are
       running.

       The behaviour of the PCP monitoring clients is controlled by
       either the <b>PMPROXY_HOST </b>environment variable or through the
       extended hostname specification (see <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for details).
       If neither of these mechanisms is used, clients will make their
       <a href="../man3/pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> connections directly to <b>pmcd</b>.  If the proxy hostname
       syntax is used or <b>PMPROXY_HOST </b>is set, then this should be the
       hostname or IP address of the system where <b>pmproxy </b>is running,
       and the clients will connect to <b>pmcd </b>or <b>redis-server </b>indirectly
       through the protocol proxy services of <b>pmproxy.</b>
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-A   </b>Disable service advertisement.  By default, <b>pmproxy </b>will
            advertise its presence on the network using any available
            mechanisms (such as Avahi/DNS-SD), assisting remote
            monitoring tools with finding it.  These mechanisms are
            disabled with this option.

       <b>-c </b><i>conffile</i>, <b>--config</b>=<i>conffile</i>
            Specify the path to an optional configuration <i>conffile</i>, with
            format as described in the ``CONFIGURATION'' section.  This
            option implies <b>pmproxy </b>is running in <b>timeseries </b>mode.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--deprecated</b>
            By default <b>pmproxy </b>prefers to run in the new <b>timeseries</b>
            mode, providing REST APIs, asynchronous network I/O,
            scalable time series, and secure connections using OpenSSL.
            However, legacy deployments may wish to use the original
            synchronous <b>pmproxy </b>implementation using libpcp networking;
            this can be achieved using this option.  Note that the <b>-d</b>
            and <b>-t </b>options are mutually exclusive.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--foreground</b>
            By default <b>pmproxy </b>is started as a daemon.  The <b>-f </b>option
            indicates that it should run in the foreground.  This is
            most useful when trying to diagnose problems with
            establishing connections.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--systemd</b>
            Like <b>-f</b>, the <b>-F </b>option runs <b>pmproxy </b>in the foreground, but
            also does some housekeeping (like create a ``pid'' file and
            change user id).  This is intended for use when <b>pmproxy </b>is
            launched from <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> and the daemonising has already
            been done by <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> and does not need to be done again
            by <b>pmproxy</b>, which is the case when neither <b>-f </b>nor <b>-F </b>is
            specified.

            At most one of <b>-f </b>and <b>-F </b>may be specified.

       <b>-h </b><i>host</i>, <b>--redishost</b>=<i>host</i>
            Specify an alternate Redis <i>host</i> to connect to for time
            series querying, overriding any configuration file settings.
            This option implies <b>pmproxy </b>is running in <b>timeseries </b>mode.

       <b>-i </b><i>ipaddress</i>, <b>--interface</b>=<i>ipaddress</i>
            This option is usually only used on hosts with more than one
            network interface (very common for firewall and ``head''
            node hosts where <b>pmproxy </b>is likely to be deployed to
            arbitrate access to an internal network).  If no <b>-i </b>options
            are specified <b>pmproxy </b>accepts PCP client connections on any
            of its host's IP addresses.  The <b>-i </b>option is used to
            specify explicitly an IP address that PCP client connections
            should be accepted on.  <i>ipaddress</i> should be in the standard
            dotted form (e.g. 100.23.45.6).  The <b>-i </b>option may be used
            multiple times to define a list of IP addresses.  When one
            or more <b>-i </b>options is specified, attempted connections made
            on any other IP addresses will be refused.

       <b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>, <b>--log</b>=<i>logfile</i>
            By default a log file named <i>pmproxy.log</i> is written in the
            current directory.  The <b>-l </b>option causes the log file to be
            written to a given <i>logfile</i> instead of the default.  If this
            <i>logfile</i> cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-L </b><i>bytes</i>
            <i>PDU</i>s received by <b>pmproxy </b>from PCP monitoring clients are
            restricted to a maximum size of 65536 bytes by default to
            defend against Denial of Service attacks.  The <b>-L </b>option may
            be used to change the maximum incoming <i>PDU</i> size.

       <b>-p </b><i>port</i>, <b>--port</b>=<i>port</i>
            Specify an alternate <i>port</i> number to listen on for client
            connections.  The default value is 44322.

       <b>-r </b><i>port</i>, <b>--redisport</b>=<i>port</i>
            Specify an alternate Redis <i>port</i> number to connect to for
            time series querying, overriding any configuration file
            settings.  This option implies <b>pmproxy </b>is running in
            <b>timeseries </b>mode.

       <b>-s </b><i>sockname</i>, <b>--socket</b>=<i>sockname</i>
            Specify the path to a local unix domain socket (for
            platforms supporting this socket family only).  The default
            value is <i>$PCP_RUN_DIR/pmproxy.socket</i>.  This option implies
            <b>pmproxy </b>is running in <b>timeseries </b>mode.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timeseries</b>
            Operate in automatic archive timeseries discovery mode.
            This mode of operation will enable the <a href="../man3/pmwebapi.3.html">PMWEBAPI(3)</a> REST
            APIs, dynamically and automatically detect active system
            archives being written by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> and import them into a
            <b>redis-server</b>(1), for fast, scalable time series querying
            described in <a href="pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a>.  Note that in this mode of
            operation, <b>pmproxy </b>only "log-tails" and ingests actively
            growing archives, e.g. as written by one or more <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
            instances.  When an archive is first discovered (usually but
            not limited to <b>pmproxy </b>startup), all metadata is loaded and
            sent to the configured <b>redis-server</b>(1) however note that
            only <b>new </b>archive metric value data from the tail end of each
            archive is ingested.  Compressed archives never grow and so
            are ignored.  See the <b>--load </b>option to <a href="pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a> for a
            supported mechanism for manually loading all of the metric
            value data from previously collected (inactive) archives,
            whether compressed or not.  It would be normal, though not
            mandated, for a set of archives being manually loaded to
            cover the same time period, e.g. archive data for a
            particular week for one or more hosts in the same data-
            centre.

       <b>-U </b><i>username</i>, <b>--username</b>=<i>username</i>
            Assume the identity of the given <i>username</i> before starting to
            accept incoming packets from PCP monitoring clients.

       <b>-x </b><i>outfile</i>
            Before the <b>pmproxy </b><i>logfile</i> can be opened, <b>pmproxy </b>may
            encounter a fatal error which prevents it from starting.  By
            default the output describing this error is sent to <b>/dev/tty</b>
            but it may redirected to <i>outfile</i>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       When running in the <b>timeseries </b>mode of operation, runtime
       configuration is relatively complex and typically handled via the
       <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmproxy/pmproxy.conf</i> file.  This file is in the
       common ``ini'' format, with section headers and individual
       variables and values with each section.  The configuration file
       installed as part of PCP documents every available section and
       option.

       At a high level, the <i>[pmproxy]</i> section can be used to explicitly
       enable or disable each of the different protocols.

       The <i>[redis]</i> section allows connection information for one or more
       backing <b>redis-server </b>processes to be configured (hostnames and
       ports).  Note to access multiple (scalable) Redis servers, the
       <i>servers</i> variable in this section can be a comma-separated list of
       hostname:port pairs.  Alternatively, it can be a single <b>redis-</b>
       <b>server </b>host that will be queried using the "CLUSTER INFO" command
       to automatically configure multiple backing hosts, described at
       <b><a href="https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec">https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec</a> </b>.

       In earlier versions of PCP (before 6) an alternative
       configuration setting section was used for this purpose - Redis
       <i>servers</i> were specified in the <i>[pmseries]</i> section and this is
       still accepted as a fallback for backwards compatibility.
</pre> <h2>
STARTING AND STOPPING PMPROXY </h2>
<pre>
       Normally, <b>pmproxy </b>is started automatically at boot time and
       stopped when the system is being brought down.  Under certain
       circumstances it is necessary to start or stop <b>pmproxy </b>manually.
       To do this one must become superuser and type

       # $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy start

       to start <b>pmproxy</b>, or

       # $PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy stop

       to stop <b>pmproxy</b>.  Starting <b>pmproxy </b>when it is already running is
       the same as stopping it and then starting it again.

       Normally <b>pmproxy </b>listens for PCP client connections on TCP/IP
       port number 44322 (as well as 44323 with <b>timeseries </b>enabled)
       registered at <b><a href="https://www.iana.org/">https://www.iana.org/</a> </b>.  Either the environment
       variable <b>PMPROXY_PORT </b>or the <b>-p </b>command line option may be used
       to specify alternative port number(s) when <b>pmproxy </b>is started; in
       each case, the specification is a comma-separated list of one or
       more numerical port numbers.  Should both methods be used or
       multiple <b>-p </b>options appear on the command line, <b>pmproxy </b>will
       listen on the union of the set of ports specified via all <b>-p</b>
       options and the <b>PMPROXY_PORT </b>environment variable.  If non-
       default ports are used with <b>pmproxy </b>care should be taken to
       ensure that <b>PMPROXY_PORT </b>is also set in the environment of any
       client application that will connect to <b>pmproxy</b>, or that the
       extended host specification syntax is used (see <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for
       details).
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       If <b>pmproxy </b>is already running the message "Error:
       OpenRequestSocket bind: Address already in use" will appear.
       This may also appear if <b>pmproxy </b>was shutdown with an outstanding
       request from a client.  In this case, a request socket has been
       left in the TIME_WAIT state and until the system closes it down
       (after some timeout period) it will not be possible to run
       <b>pmproxy</b>.

       In addition to the standard <b>PCP </b>debugging options, see <a href="pmdbg.1.html">pmdbg(1)</a>,
       <b>pmproxy </b>currently supports the debugging option <b>context </b>for
       tracing client connections and disconnections.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$PCP_PMPROXYOPTIONS_PATH</i>
            command line options for <b>pmproxy </b>when launched from
            <b>$PCP_RC_DIR/pmproxy </b>All the command line option lines should
            start with a hyphen as the first character.

       <i>$PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmproxy</i>
            Environment variables that will be set when <b>pmproxy</b>
            executes.  Only settings of the form
            "PMPROXY_VARIABLE=value" will be honoured.

       <i>./pmproxy.log</i>
            (or <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmproxy/pmproxy.log </b>when started
            automatically)
            All messages and diagnostics are directed here

       <i>/etc/pki/tls</i>
            default OpenSSL certificate database directory, optionally
            used for Secure Socket Layer connection in <b>timeseries </b>mode
            of operation.  These certificates can be created and queried
            using the <b>openssl </b>tool, amongst others.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to the PCP environment variables described in the <b>PCP</b>
       <b>ENVIRONMENT </b>section below, there are several environment
       variables that influence the interactions between a PCP
       monitoring client, <b>pmproxy </b>and <b>pmcd</b>.

       <b>PMCD_PORT</b>
              For the PCP monitoring client this (or the default port
              number) is passed to <b>pmproxy </b>and used to connect to <b>pmcd</b>.
              In the environment of <b>pmproxy PMCD_PORT is not used.</b>

       <b>PMPROXY_HOST</b>
              For the PCP monitoring client this is the hostname or IP
              address of the host where <b>pmproxy </b>is running.  In recent
              versions of PCP (since version 3) this has been superseded
              by the extended hostname syntax (see <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for
              details).

       <b>PMPROXY_PORT</b>
              For the PCP monitoring client this is the port on which
              <b>pmproxy </b>will accept connections.  The default is 44322, as
              well as 44323 with <b>timeseries </b>enabled.

       <b>PMCD_CONNECT_TIMEOUT</b>, <b>PMCD_RECONNECT_TIMEOUT </b>and
       <b>PMCD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT</b>
              (see <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) For the PCP monitoring client, setting
              these environment variables will modify the timeouts used
              for interactions between the client and <b>pmproxy</b>
              (independent of which <b>pmcd </b>is being used).  For <b>pmproxy</b>
              these same environment variables control the timeouts
              between <b>pmproxy </b>and all <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> instances (independent of
              which monitoring client is involved).

       If set to the value 1, the <b>PMPROXY_LOCAL </b>environment variable
       will cause <b>pmproxy </b>to run in a localhost-only mode of operation,
       where it binds only to the loopback interface.

       The <b>PMPROXY_MAXPENDING </b>variable can be set to indicate the
       maximum length to which the queue of pending client connections
       may grow.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
       <a href="../man3/pmgetoptions.3.html">pmGetOptions(3)</a>.
