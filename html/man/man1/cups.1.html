DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>CUPS </b>is the software you use to print from applications like word
       processors, email readers, photo editors, and web browsers. It
       converts the page descriptions produced by your application (put
       a paragraph here, draw a line there, and so forth) into something
       your printer can understand and then sends the information to the
       printer for printing.

       Now, since every printer manufacturer does things differently,
       printing can be very complicated.  <b>CUPS </b>does its best to hide
       this from you and your application so that you can concentrate on
       printing and less on how to print. Generally, the only time you
       need to know anything about your printer is when you use it for
       the first time, and even then <b>CUPS </b>can often figure things out on
       its own.

   <b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b>
       The first time you print to a printer, <b>CUPS </b>creates a queue to
       keep track of the current status of the printer (everything OK,
       out of paper, etc.) and any pages you have printed. Most of the
       time the queue points to a printer connected directly to your
       computer via a USB port, however it can also point to a printer
       on your network, a printer on the Internet, or multiple printers
       depending on the configuration. Regardless of where the queue
       points, it will look like any other printer to you and your
       applications.

       Every time you print something, <b>CUPS </b>creates a job which contains
       the queue you are sending the print to, the name of the document
       you are printing, and the page descriptions. Job are numbered
       (queue-1, queue-2, and so forth) so you can monitor the job as it
       is printed or cancel it if you see a mistake. When <b>CUPS </b>gets a
       job for printing, it determines the best programs (filters,
       printer drivers, port monitors, and backends) to convert the
       pages into a printable format and then runs them to actually
       print the job.

       When the print job is completely printed, <b>CUPS </b>removes the job
       from the queue and moves on to any other jobs you have submitted.
       You can also be notified when the job is finished, or if there
       are any errors during printing, in several different ways.

   <b>WHERE DO I BEGIN?</b>
       The easiest way to start is by using the web interface to
       configure your printer. Go to "http://localhost:631" and choose
       the Administration tab at the top of the page. Click/press on the
       Add Printer button and follow the prompts.

       When you are asked for a username and password, enter your login
       username and password or the "root" username and password.

       After the printer is added you will be asked to set the default
       printer options (paper size, output mode, etc.) for the printer.
       Make any changes as needed and then click/press on the Set
       Default Options button to save them. Some printers also support
       auto-configuration - click/press on the Query Printer for Default
       Options button to update the options automatically.

       Once you have added the printer, you can print to it from any
       application. You can also choose Print Test Page from the
       maintenance menu to print a simple test page and verify that
       everything is working properly.

       You can also use the <a href="../man8/lpadmin.8.html">lpadmin(8)</a> and <a href="../man8/lpinfo.8.html">lpinfo(8)</a> commands to add
       printers to <b>CUPS</b>.  Additionally, your operating system may
       include graphical user interfaces or automatically create printer
       queues when you connect a printer to your computer.

   <b>HOW DO I GET HELP?</b>
       The <b>CUPS </b>web site (<a href="http://www.CUPS.org">http://www.CUPS.org</a>) provides access to the
       <i>cups</i> and <i>cups-devel</i> mailing lists, additional documentation and
       resources, and a bug report database. Most vendors also provide
       online discussion forums to ask printing questions for your
       operating system of choice.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>CUPS </b>commands use the following environment variables to override

       programs:

            scheduler (hostname:port or ipaddress:port).

       <b>CUPS_SERVERBIN</b>
            The directory where server helper programs, filters,
            backend, etc. can be found.
