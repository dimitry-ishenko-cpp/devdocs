NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-notify - Notify service manager about start-up completion
       and other daemon status changes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>systemd-notify </b>[OPTIONS...] [VARIABLE=VALUE...]

       <b>systemd-notify </b>[--exec] [OPTIONS...] [VARIABLE=VALUE...] [;]
                      [CMDLINE...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-notify </b>may be called by service scripts to notify the
       invoking service manager about status changes. It can be used to
       send arbitrary information, encoded in an environment-block-like
       list of strings. Most importantly, it can be used for start-up
       completion notification.

       This is mostly just a wrapper around <b>sd_notify() </b>and makes this
       functionality available to shell scripts. For details see
       <a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a>.

       The command line may carry a list of environment variables to
       send as part of the status update.

       Note that systemd will refuse reception of status updates from
       this command unless <i>NotifyAccess=</i> is appropriately set for the
       service unit this command is called from. See <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>
       for details.

       Note that <b>sd_notify() </b>notifications may be attributed to units
       correctly only if either the sending process is still around at
       the time the service manager processes the message, or if the
       sending process is explicitly runtime-tracked by the service
       manager. The latter is the case if the service manager originally
       forked off the process, i.e. on all processes that match
       <i>NotifyAccess=</i><b>main </b>or <i>NotifyAccess=</i><b>exec</b>. Conversely, if an
       auxiliary process of the unit sends an <b>sd_notify() </b>message and
       immediately exits, the service manager might not be able to
       properly attribute the message to the unit, and thus will ignore
       it, even if <i>NotifyAccess=</i><b>all </b>is set for it. To address this
       <b>systemd-notify </b>will wait until the notification message has been
       processed by the service manager. When <b>--no-block </b>is used, this
       synchronization for reception of notifications is disabled, and
       hence the aforementioned race may occur if the invoking process
       is not the service manager or spawned by the service manager.

       <b>systemd-notify </b>will first attempt to invoke <b>sd_notify()</b>
       pretending to have the PID of the parent process of
       <b>systemd-notify </b>(i.e. the invoking process). This will only
       succeed when invoked with sufficient privileges. On failure, it
       will then fall back to invoking it under its own PID. This
       behaviour is useful in order that when the tool is invoked from a
       shell script the shell process — and not the <b>systemd-notify</b>
       process — appears as sender of the message, which in turn is
       helpful if the shell process is the main process of a service,
       due to the limitations of <i>NotifyAccess=</i><b>all</b>. Use the <b>--pid= </b>switch
       to tweak this behaviour.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--ready</b>
           Inform the invoking service manager about service start-up or
           configuration reload completion. This is equivalent to
           <b>systemd-notify READY=1</b>. For details about the semantics of
           this option see <a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a>.

       <b>--reloading</b>
           Inform the invoking service manager about the beginning of a
           configuration reload cycle. This is equivalent to
           <b>systemd-notify RELOADING=1 </b>(but implicitly also sets a
           <i>MONOTONIC_USEC=</i> field as required for <i>Type=notify-reload</i>
           services, see <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a> for details). For details
           about the semantics of this option see <a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a>.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--stopping</b>
           Inform the invoking service manager about the beginning of
           the shutdown phase of the service. This is equivalent to
           <b>systemd-notify STOPPING=1</b>. For details about the semantics of
           this option see <a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a>.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--pid=</b>
           Inform the service manager about the main PID of the service.
           Takes a PID as argument. If the argument is specified as
           "auto" or omitted, the PID of the process that invoked
           <b>systemd-notify </b>is used, except if that's the service manager.
           If the argument is specified as "self", the PID of the
           <b>systemd-notify </b>command itself is used, and if "parent" is
           specified the calling process' PID is used — even if it is
           the service manager.  <b>--pid=auto </b>is equivalent to
           <b>systemd-notify MAINPID=$PID</b>. For details about the semantics
           of this option see <a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a>.

           If this switch is used in an <b>systemd-notify </b>invocation from a
           process that shall become the new main process of a service —
           and which is not the process forked off by the service
           manager (or the current main process) —, then it is essential
           to set <i>NotifyAccess=all</i> in the service unit file, or
           otherwise the notification will be ignored for security
           reasons. See <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a> for details.

       <b>--uid=</b><i>USER</i>
           Set the user ID to send the notification from. Takes a UNIX
           user name or numeric UID. When specified the notification
           message will be sent with the specified UID as sender, in
           place of the user the command was invoked as. This option
           requires sufficient privileges in order to be able manipulate
           the user identity of the process.

           Added in version 237.

       <b>--status=</b>
           Send a free-form human readable status string for the daemon
           to the service manager. This option takes the status string
           as argument. This is equivalent to <b>systemd-notify STATUS=...</b>.
           For details about the semantics of this option see
           <a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify(3)</a>. This information is shown in <a href="systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a>'s
           <b>status </b>output, among other places.

       <b>--booted</b>
           Returns 0 if the system was booted up with systemd, non-zero
           otherwise. If this option is passed, no message is sent. This
           option is hence unrelated to the other options. For details
           about the semantics of this option, see <a href="../man3/sd_booted.3.html">sd_booted(3)</a>. An
           alternate way to check for this state is to call <a href="systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a>
           with the <b>is-system-running </b>command. It will return "offline"
           if the system was not booted with systemd.

       <b>--no-block</b>
           Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to
           finish. Use of this option is only recommended when
           <b>systemd-notify </b>is spawned by the service manager, or when the
           invoking process is directly spawned by the service manager
           and has enough privileges to allow <b>systemd-notify </b>to send the
           notification on its behalf. Sending notifications with this
           option set is prone to race conditions in all other cases.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>--exec</b>
           If specified <b>systemd-notify </b>will execute another command line
           after it completed its operation, replacing its own process.
           If used, the list of assignments to include in the message
           sent must be followed by a ";" character (as separate
           argument), followed by the command line to execute. This
           permits "chaining" of commands, i.e. issuing one operation,
           followed immediately by another, without changing PIDs.

           Note that many shells interpret ";" as their own separator
           for command lines, hence when <b>systemd-notify </b>is invoked from
           a shell the semicolon must usually be escaped as "\;".

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--fd=</b>
           Send a file descriptor along with the notification message.
           This is useful when invoked in services that have the
           <i>FileDescriptorStoreMax=</i> setting enabled, see
           <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a> for details. The specified file descriptor
           must be passed to <b>systemd-notify </b>when invoked. This option
           may be used multiple times to pass multiple file descriptors
           in a single notification message.

           To use this functionality from a <a href="bash.1.html">bash(1)</a> shell, use an
           expression like the following:

               systemd-notify --fd=4 --fd=5 4&lt;/some/file 5&lt;/some/other/file

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--fdname=</b>
           Set a name to assign to the file descriptors passed via <b>--fd=</b>
           (see above). This controls the "FDNAME=" field. This setting
           may only be specified once, and applies to all file
           descriptors passed. Invoke this tool multiple times in case
           multiple file descriptors with different file descriptor
           names shall be submitted.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Example 1. Start-up Notification and Status Updates</b>

       A simple shell daemon that sends start-up notifications after
       having set up its communication channel. During runtime it sends
       further status updates to the init system:

           #!/bin/sh

           mkfifo /tmp/waldo
           systemd-notify --ready --status="Waiting for data..."

           while : ; do
                   read -r a &lt; /tmp/waldo
                   systemd-notify --status="Processing $a"

                   # Do something with $a ...

                   systemd-notify --status="Waiting for data..."
           done
