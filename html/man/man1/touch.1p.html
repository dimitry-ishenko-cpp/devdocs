       touch — change file access and modification times
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       touch <b>[</b>-acm<b>] [</b>-r <i>ref_file</i>|-t <i>time</i>|-d <i>date_time</i><b>] </b><i>file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>touch</i> utility shall change the last data modification
       timestamps, the last data access timestamps, or both.

       The time used can be specified by the <b>-t </b><i>time</i> option-argument,
       the corresponding <i>time</i> fields of the file referenced by the <b>-r</b>
       <i>ref_file</i> option-argument, or the <b>-d </b><i>date_time</i> option-argument, as
       specified in the following sections. If none of these are
       specified, <i>touch</i> shall use the current time.

       For each <i>file</i> operand, <i>touch</i> shall perform actions equivalent to
       the following functions defined in the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017:

        1. If <i>file</i> does not exist:

            a. The <i>creat</i>() function is called with the following
               arguments:

               --  The <i>file</i> operand is used as the <i>path</i> argument.

               --  The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRUSR,
                   S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH is
                   used as the <i>mode</i> argument.

            b. The <i>futimens</i>() function is called with the following
               arguments:

               --  The file descriptor opened in step 1a.

               --  The access time and the modification time, set as
                   described in the OPTIONS section, are used as the
                   first and second elements of the <i>times</i> array
                   argument, respectively.

        2. If <i>file</i> exists, the <i>utimensat</i>() function is called with the
           following arguments:

            a. The AT_FDCWD special value is used as the <i>fd</i> argument.

            b. The <i>file</i> operand is used as the <i>path</i> argument.

            c. The access time and the modification time, set as
               described in the OPTIONS section, are used as the first
               and second elements of the <i>times</i> array argument,
               respectively.

            d. The <i>flag</i> argument is set to zero.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>touch</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a        </b>Change the access time of <i>file</i>.  Do not change the
                 modification time unless <b>-m </b>is also specified.

       <b>-c        </b>Do not create a specified <i>file</i> if it does not exist. Do
                 not write any diagnostic messages concerning this
                 condition.

       <b>-d </b><i>date_time</i>
                 Use the specified <i>date_time</i> instead of the current
                 time. The option-argument shall be a string of the
                 form:

                     <i>YYYY</i>-<i>MM</i>-<i>DD</i>T<i>hh</i>:<i>mm</i>:<i>SS</i><b>[</b>.<i>frac</i><b>][</b><i>tz</i><b>]</b>

                 or:

                     <i>YYYY</i>-<i>MM</i>-<i>DD</i>T<i>hh</i>:<i>mm</i>:<i>SS</i><b>[</b>,<i>frac</i><b>][</b><i>tz</i><b>]</b>

                 where:

                  *  <i>YYYY</i> are at least four decimal digits giving the
                     year.

                  *  <i>MM</i>, <i>DD</i>, <i>hh</i>, <i>mm</i>, and <i>SS</i> are as with <b>-t </b><i>time</i>.

                  *  T is the time designator, and can be replaced by a
                     single &lt;space&gt;.

                  *  [.<i>frac</i>] and [,<i>frac</i>] are either empty, or a &lt;period&gt;
                     (<b>'.'</b>)  or a &lt;comma&gt; (<b>','</b>) respectively, followed by
                     one or more decimal digits, specifying a fractional
                     second.

                  *  [<i>tz</i>] is either empty, signifying local time, or the
                     letter <b>'Z'</b>, signifying UTC. If [<i>tz</i>] is empty, the
                     resulting time shall be affected by the value of
                     the <i>TZ</i> environment variable.

                 If the resulting time precedes the Epoch, the behavior
                 is implementation-defined. If the time cannot be
                 represented as the file's timestamp, <i>touch</i> shall exit
                 immediately with an error status.

       <b>-m        </b>Change the modification time of <i>file</i>.  Do not change
                 the access time unless <b>-a </b>is also specified.

       <b>-r </b><i>ref_file</i>
                 Use the corresponding time of the file named by the
                 pathname <i>ref_file</i> instead of the current time.

       <b>-t </b><i>time</i>   Use the specified <i>time</i> instead of the current time. The
                 option-argument shall be a decimal number of the form:

                     <b>[[</b><i>CC</i><b>]</b><i>YY</i><b>]</b><i>MMDDhhmm</i><b>[</b>.<i>SS</i><b>]</b>

                 where each two digits represents the following:

                 <i>MM</i>      The month of the year [01,12].

                 <i>DD</i>      The day of the month [01,31].

                 <i>hh</i>      The hour of the day [00,23].

                 <i>mm</i>      The minute of the hour [00,59].

                 <i>CC</i>      The first two digits of the year (the century).

                 <i>YY</i>      The second two digits of the year.

                 <i>SS</i>      The second of the minute [00,60].

                 Both <i>CC</i> and <i>YY</i> shall be optional. If neither is given,
                 the current year shall be assumed. If <i>YY</i> is specified,
                 but <i>CC</i> is not, <i>CC</i> shall be derived as follows:
                              ┌───────────┬─────────────┐
                              │ <b>If </b><i>YY</i> <b>is: </b>│ <i>CC</i> <b>becomes: </b>│
                              ├───────────┼─────────────┤
                              │  [69,99]  │     19      │
                              │  [00,68]  │     20      │
                              └───────────┴─────────────┘

                 <b>Note:  </b>It is expected that in a future version of this
                        standard the default century inferred from a
                        2-digit year will change. (This would apply to
                        all commands accepting a 2-digit year as input.)

                 The resulting time shall be affected by the value of
                 the <i>TZ</i> environment variable. If the resulting time
                 value precedes the Epoch, the behavior is
                 implementation-defined. If the time is out of range for
                 the file's timestamp, <i>touch</i> shall exit immediately with
                 an error status. The range of valid times past the
                 Epoch is implementation-defined, but it shall extend to
                 at least the time 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds,
                 January 1, 2038, Coordinated Universal Time. Some
                 implementations may not be able to represent dates
                 beyond January 18, 2038, because they use <b>signed int </b>as
                 a time holder.

                 The range for <i>SS</i> is [00,60] rather than [00,59] because
                 of leap seconds. If <i>SS</i> is 60, and the resulting time,
                 as affected by the <i>TZ</i> environment variable, does not
                 refer to a leap second, the resulting time shall be one
                 second after a time where <i>SS</i> is 59. If <i>SS</i> is not given
                 a value, it is assumed to be zero.

       If neither the <b>-a </b>nor <b>-m </b>options were specified, <i>touch</i> shall
       behave as if both the <b>-a </b>and <b>-m </b>options were specified.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file whose times shall be modified.
</pre> <h2>

<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>touch</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone to be used for interpreting the
                 <i>time</i> option-argument. If <i>TZ</i> is unset or null, an
                 unspecified default timezone shall be used.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The interpretation of time is taken to be <i>seconds since the Epoch</i>
       (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 4.16</i>,
       <i>Seconds Since the Epoch</i>).  It should be noted that
       implementations conforming to the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 do not take leap seconds into account when computing
       seconds since the Epoch. When <i>SS</i>=60 is used, the resulting time
       always refers to 1 plus <i>seconds since the Epoch</i> for a time when
       <i>SS</i>=59.

       Although the <b>-t </b><i>time</i> option-argument specifies values in 1969,
       the access time and modification time fields are defined in terms
       of seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 on 1 January 1970 UTC).
       Therefore, depending on the value of <i>TZ</i> when <i>touch</i> is run, there
       is never more than a few valid hours in 1969 and there need not
       be any valid times in 1969.

       If the <i>T</i> time designator is replaced by a &lt;space&gt; for the <b>-d</b>
       <i>date_time</i> option-argument, the &lt;space&gt; must be quoted to prevent
       the shell from splitting the argument.

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The functionality of <i>touch</i> is described almost entirely through
       references to functions in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. In this way, there is no duplication of effort
       required for describing such side-effects as the relationship of
       user IDs to the user database, permissions, and so on.

       There are some significant differences between the <i>touch</i> utility
       in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 and those in System V and BSD
       systems. They are upwards-compatible for historical applications
       from both implementations:

        1. In System V, an ambiguity exists when a pathname that is a
           decimal number leads the operands; it is treated as a time
           value. In BSD, no <i>time</i> value is allowed; files may only be
           <i>touch</i>ed to the current time. The <b>-t </b><i>time</i> construct solves
           these problems for future conforming applications (note that
           the <b>-t </b>option is not historical practice).

        2. The inclusion of the century digits, <i>CC</i>, is also new. Note
           that a ten-digit <i>time</i> value is treated as if <i>YY</i>, and not <i>CC</i>,
           were specified. The caveat about the range of dates following
           the Epoch was included as recognition that some
           implementations are not able to represent dates beyond 18
           January 2038 because they use <b>signed int </b>as a time holder.

       The <b>-r </b>option was added because several comments requested this
       capability.  This option was named <b>-f </b>in an early proposal, but
       was changed because the <b>-f </b>option is used in the BSD version of
       <i>touch</i> with a different meaning.

       At least one historical implementation of <i>touch</i> incremented the
       exit code if <b>-c </b>was specified and the file did not exist. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires exit status zero if no errors
       occur.

       In previous version of the standard, if at least two operands are
       specified, and the first operand is an eight or ten-digit decimal
       integer, the first operand was assumed to be a <i>date_time</i> operand.
       This usage was removed in this version of the standard since it
       had been marked obsolescent previously.

       The <b>-d </b><i>date_time</i> format is an ISO 8601:2004 standard complete
       representation of date and time extended format with an optional
       decimal point or &lt;comma&gt; followed by a string of digits following
       the seconds portion to specify fractions of a second. It is not
       necessary to recognize <b>"[+/-]hh:mm" </b>and <b>"[+/-]hh" </b>to specify
       timezones other than local time and UTC. The <i>T</i> time designator in
       the ISO 8601:2004 standard extended format may be replaced by
       &lt;space&gt;.
