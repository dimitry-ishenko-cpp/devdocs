PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       find — find files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       find <b>[</b>-H|-L<b>] </b><i>path</i>... <b>[</b><i>operand_expression</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>find</i> utility shall recursively descend the directory
       hierarchy from each file specified by <i>path</i>, evaluating a Boolean
       expression composed of the primaries described in the OPERANDS
       section for each file encountered. Each <i>path</i> operand shall be
       evaluated unaltered as it was provided, including all trailing
       &lt;slash&gt; characters; all pathnames for other files encountered in
       the hierarchy shall consist of the concatenation of the current
       <i>path</i> operand, a &lt;slash&gt; if the current <i>path</i> operand did not end
       in one, and the filename relative to the <i>path</i> operand. The
       relative portion shall contain no dot or dot-dot components, no
       trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters, and only single &lt;slash&gt; characters
       between pathname components.

       The <i>find</i> utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths in
       a file hierarchy and shall not fail due to path length
       limitations (unless a <i>path</i> operand specified by the application
       exceeds {PATH_MAX} requirements).

       The <i>find</i> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
       previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
       encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, <i>find</i> shall write
       a diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover
       its position in the hierarchy or terminate.

       If a file is removed from or added to the directory hierarchy
       being searched it is unspecified whether or not <i>find</i> includes
       that file in its search.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>find</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-H        </b>Cause the file information and file type evaluated for
                 each symbolic link encountered as a <i>path</i> operand on the
                 command line to be those of the file referenced by the
                 link, and not the link itself. If the referenced file
                 does not exist, the file information and type shall be
                 for the link itself. File information and type for
                 symbolic links encountered during the traversal of a
                 file hierarchy shall be that of the link itself.

       <b>-L        </b>Cause the file information and file type evaluated for
                 each symbolic link encountered as a <i>path</i> operand on the
                 command line or encountered during the traversal of a
                 file hierarchy to be those of the file referenced by
                 the link, and not the link itself. If the referenced
                 file does not exist, the file information and type
                 shall be for the link itself.

       Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <b>-H </b>and
       <b>-L </b>shall not be considered an error. The last option specified
       shall determine the behavior of the utility. If neither the <b>-H</b>
       nor the <b>-L </b>option is specified, then the file information and
       type for symbolic links encountered as a <i>path</i> operand on the
       command line or encountered during the traversal of a file
       hierarchy shall be that of the link itself.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       The first operand and subsequent operands up to but not including
       the first operand that starts with a <b>'-'</b>, or is a <b>'!'  </b>or a <b>'('</b>,
       shall be interpreted as <i>path</i> operands. If the first operand
       starts with a <b>'-'</b>, or is a <b>'!'  </b>or a <b>'('</b>, the behavior is
       unspecified. Each <i>path</i> operand is a pathname of a starting point
       in the file hierarchy.

       The first operand that starts with a <b>'-'</b>, or is a <b>'!'  </b>or a <b>'('</b>,
       and all subsequent arguments shall be interpreted as an
       <i>expression</i> made up of the following primaries and operators. In
       the descriptions, wherever <i>n</i> is used as a primary argument, it
       shall be interpreted as a decimal integer optionally preceded by
       a &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) or &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (<b>'-'</b>), as follows:

       +<i>n</i>        More than <i>n</i>.

       <i>n</i>         Exactly <i>n</i>.

       -<i>n</i>        Less than <i>n</i>.

       The following primaries shall be supported:

       <b>-name </b><i>pattern</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the basename of
                 the current pathname matches <i>pattern</i> using the pattern
                 matching notation described in <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Pattern</i>
                 <i>Matching Notation</i>.  The additional rules in <i>Section</i>
                 <i>2.13.3</i>, <i>Patterns Used for Filename Expansion</i> do not
                 apply as this is a matching operation, not an
                 expansion.

       <b>-path </b><i>pattern</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the current
                 pathname matches <i>pattern</i> using the pattern matching
                 notation described in <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Pattern Matching</i>
                 <i>Notation</i>.  The additional rules in <i>Section 2.13.3</i>,
                 <i>Patterns Used for Filename Expansion</i> do not apply as
                 this is a matching operation, not an expansion.

       <b>-nouser   </b>The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs
                 to a user ID for which the <i>getpwuid</i>() function defined
                 in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 (or
                 equivalent) returns NULL.

       <b>-nogroup  </b>The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs
                 to a group ID for which the <i>getgrgid</i>() function defined
                 in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 (or
                 equivalent) returns NULL.

       <b>-xdev     </b>The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall
                 cause <i>find</i> not to continue descending past directories
                 that have a different device ID (<i>st_dev</i>, see the <i>stat</i>()
                 function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017). If any <b>-xdev </b>primary is specified, it
                 shall apply to the entire expression even if the <b>-xdev</b>
                 primary would not normally be evaluated.

       <b>-prune    </b>The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall
                 cause <i>find</i> not to descend the current pathname if it is
                 a directory. If the <b>-depth </b>primary is specified, the
                 <b>-prune </b>primary shall have no effect.

       <b>-perm [-]</b><i>mode</i>
                 The <i>mode</i> argument is used to represent file mode bits.
                 It shall be identical in format to the <i>symbolic_mode</i>
                 operand described in <i>chmod</i>, and shall be interpreted as
                 follows. To start, a template shall be assumed with all
                 file mode bits cleared. An <i>op</i> symbol of <b>'+' </b>shall set
                 the appropriate mode bits in the template; <b>'-' </b>shall
                 clear the appropriate bits; <b>'=' </b>shall set the
                 appropriate mode bits, without regard to the contents
                 of the file mode creation mask of the process. The <i>op</i>
                 symbol of <b>'-' </b>cannot be the first character of <i>mode</i>;
                 this avoids ambiguity with the optional leading
                 &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;.  Since the initial mode is all bits
                 off, there are not any symbolic modes that need to use
                 <b>'-' </b>as the first character.

                 If the &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; is omitted, the primary shall
                 evaluate as true when the file permission bits exactly
                 match the value of the resulting template.

                 Otherwise, if <i>mode</i> is prefixed by a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;, the
                 primary shall evaluate as true if at least all the bits
                 in the resulting template are set in the file
                 permission bits.

       <b>-perm [-]</b><i>onum</i>
                 If the &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; is omitted, the primary shall
                 evaluate as true when the file mode bits exactly match
                 the value of the octal number <i>onum</i> (see the description
                 of the octal <i>mode</i> in <i>chmod</i>).  Otherwise, if <i>onum</i> is
                 prefixed by a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;, the primary shall
                 evaluate as true if at least all of the bits specified
                 in <i>onum</i> are set. In both cases, the behavior is
                 unspecified when <i>onum</i> exceeds 07777.

       <b>-type </b><i>c</i>   The primary shall evaluate as true if the type of the
                 file is <i>c</i>, where <i>c</i> is <b>'b'</b>, <b>'c'</b>, <b>'d'</b>, <b>'l'</b>, <b>'p'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, or
                 <b>'s' </b>for block special file, character special file,
                 directory, symbolic link, FIFO, regular file, or
                 socket, respectively.

       <b>-links </b><i>n</i>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the file has <i>n</i>
                 links.

       <b>-user </b><i>uname</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs
                 to the user <i>uname.</i>  If <i>uname</i> is a decimal integer and
                 the <i>getpwnam</i>() (or equivalent) function does not return
                 a valid user name, <i>uname</i> shall be interpreted as a user
                 ID.

       <b>-group </b><i>gname</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the file belongs
                 to the group <i>gname</i>.  If <i>gname</i> is a decimal integer and
                 the <i>getgrnam</i>() (or equivalent) function does not return
                 a valid group name, <i>gname</i> shall be interpreted as a
                 group ID.

       <b>-size </b><i>n</i><b>[c]</b>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the file size in
                 bytes, divided by 512 and rounded up to the next
                 integer, is <i>n</i>.  If <i>n</i> is followed by the character <b>'c'</b>,
                 the size shall be in bytes.

       <b>-atime </b><i>n</i>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the file access
                 time subtracted from the initialization time, divided
                 by 86400 (with any remainder discarded), is <i>n</i>.

       <b>-ctime </b><i>n</i>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the time of last
                 change of file status information subtracted from the
                 initialization time, divided by 86400 (with any
                 remainder discarded), is <i>n</i>.

       <b>-mtime </b><i>n</i>  The primary shall evaluate as true if the file
                 modification time subtracted from the initialization
                 time, divided by 86400 (with any remainder discarded),
                 is <i>n</i>.

       <b>-exec </b><i>utility_name</i> <b>[</b><i>argument</i> ...<b>] ;</b>

       <b>-exec </b><i>utility_name</i> <b>[</b><i>argument</i> ...<b>]  </b>{} +
                 The end of the primary expression shall be punctuated
                 by a &lt;semicolon&gt; or by a &lt;plus-sign&gt;.  Only a &lt;plus-
                 sign&gt; that immediately follows an argument containing
                 only the two characters <b>"{}" </b>shall punctuate the end of
                 the primary expression. Other uses of the &lt;plus-sign&gt;
                 shall not be treated as special.

                 If the primary expression is punctuated by a
                 &lt;semicolon&gt;, the utility <i>utility_name</i> shall be invoked
                 once for each pathname and the primary shall evaluate
                 as true if the utility returns a zero value as exit
                 status. A <i>utility_name</i> or <i>argument</i> containing only the
                 two characters <b>"{}" </b>shall be replaced by the current
                 pathname. If a <i>utility_name</i> or <i>argument</i> string contains
                 the two characters <b>"{}"</b>, but not just the two
                 characters <b>"{}"</b>, it is implementation-defined whether
                 <i>find</i> replaces those two characters or uses the string
                 without change.

                 If the primary expression is punctuated by a &lt;plus-
                 sign&gt;, the primary shall always evaluate as true, and
                 the pathnames for which the primary is evaluated shall
                 be aggregated into sets. The utility <i>utility_name</i> shall
                 be invoked once for each set of aggregated pathnames.
                 Each invocation shall begin after the last pathname in
                 the set is aggregated, and shall be completed before
                 the <i>find</i> utility exits and before the first pathname in
                 the next set (if any) is aggregated for this primary,
                 but it is otherwise unspecified whether the invocation
                 occurs before, during, or after the evaluations of
                 other primaries. If any invocation returns a non-zero
                 value as exit status, the <i>find</i> utility shall return a
                 non-zero exit status. An argument containing only the
                 two characters <b>"{}" </b>shall be replaced by the set of
                 aggregated pathnames, with each pathname passed as a
                 separate argument to the invoked utility in the same
                 order that it was aggregated. The size of any set of
                 two or more pathnames shall be limited such that
                 execution of the utility does not cause the system's
                 {ARG_MAX} limit to be exceeded. If more than one
                 argument containing the two characters <b>"{}" </b>is present,
                 the behavior is unspecified.

                 The current directory for the invocation of
                 <i>utility_name</i> shall be the same as the current directory
                 when the <i>find</i> utility was started. If the <i>utility_name</i>
                 names any of the special built-in utilities (see
                 <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>Special Built-In Utilities</i>), the results
                 are undefined.

       <b>-ok </b><i>utility_name</i> <b>[</b><i>argument</i> ...<b>] ;</b>
                 The <b>-ok </b>primary shall be equivalent to <b>-exec</b>, except
                 that the use of a &lt;plus-sign&gt; to punctuate the end of
                 the primary expression need not be supported, and <i>find</i>
                 shall request affirmation of the invocation of
                 <i>utility_name</i> using the current file as an argument by
                 writing to standard error as described in the STDERR
                 section. If the response on standard input is
                 affirmative, the utility shall be invoked. Otherwise,
                 the command shall not be invoked and the value of the
                 <b>-ok </b>operand shall be false.

       <b>-print    </b>The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall
                 cause the current pathname to be written to standard
                 output.

       <b>-newer </b><i>file</i>
                 The primary shall evaluate as true if the modification
                 time of the current file is more recent than the
                 modification time of the file named by the pathname
                 <i>file</i>.

       <b>-depth    </b>The primary shall always evaluate as true; it shall
                 cause descent of the directory hierarchy to be done so
                 that all entries in a directory are acted on before the
                 directory itself. If a <b>-depth </b>primary is not specified,
                 all entries in a directory shall be acted on after the
                 directory itself. If any <b>-depth </b>primary is specified,
                 it shall apply to the entire expression even if the
                 <b>-depth </b>primary would not normally be evaluated.

       The primaries can be combined using the following operators (in
       order of decreasing precedence):

       ( <i>expression</i> )
                 True if <i>expression</i> is true.

       <b>! </b><i>expression</i>
                 Negation of a primary; the unary NOT operator.

       <i>expression</i> <b>[-a] </b><i>expression</i>
                 Conjunction of primaries; the AND operator is implied
                 by the juxtaposition of two primaries or made explicit
                 by the optional <b>-a </b>operator. The second expression
                 shall not be evaluated if the first expression is
                 false.

       <i>expression</i> <b>-o </b><i>expression</i>
                 Alternation of primaries; the OR operator. The second
                 expression shall not be evaluated if the first
                 expression is true.

       If no <i>expression</i> is present, <b>-print </b>shall be used as the
       expression. Otherwise, if the given expression does not contain
       any of the primaries <b>-exec</b>, <b>-ok</b>, or <b>-print</b>, the given expression
       shall be effectively replaced by:

           ( <i>given_expression</i> ) -print

       The <b>-user</b>, <b>-group</b>, and <b>-newer </b>primaries each shall evaluate their
       respective arguments only once.

       When the file type evaluated for the current file is a symbolic
       link, the results of evaluating the <b>-perm </b>primary are
       implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>-ok </b>primary is used, the response shall be read from the
       standard input.  An entire line shall be read as the response.
       Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>find</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                 elements used in the pattern matching notation for the
                 <b>-n </b>option and in the extended regular expression
                 defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale keyword in the
                 <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  This variable determines the locale for the
                 interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as
                 characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to
                 multi-byte characters in arguments), the behavior of
                 character classes within the pattern matching notation
                 used for the <b>-n </b>option, and the behavior of character
                 classes within regular expressions used in the extended
                 regular expression defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale
                 keyword in the <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale used to process affirmative
                 responses, and the locale used to affect the format and
                 contents of diagnostic messages and prompts written to
                 standard error.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       When used in operands, pattern matching notation, &lt;semicolon&gt;,
       &lt;left-parenthesis&gt;, and &lt;right-parenthesis&gt; characters are
       special to the shell and must be quoted (see <i>Section 2.2</i>,
       <i>Quoting</i>).

       The bit that is traditionally used for sticky (historically
       01000) is specified in the <b>-perm </b>primary using the octal number
       argument form. Since this bit is not defined by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, applications must not assume that it actually
       refers to the traditional sticky bit.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. The following commands are equivalent:

               find .
               find . -print

           They both write out the entire directory hierarchy from the
           current directory.

        2. The following command:

               find / \( -name tmp -o -name '*.xx' \) -atime +7 -exec rm {} \;

           removes all files named <b>tmp </b>or ending in <b>.xx </b>that have not
           been accessed for seven or more 24-hour periods.

        3. The following command:

               find . -perm -o+w,+s

           prints (<b>-print </b>is assumed) the names of all files in or below
           the current directory, with all of the file permission bits
           S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_IWOTH set.

        4. The following command:

               find . -name SCCS -prune -o -print

           recursively prints pathnames of all files in the current
           directory and below, but skips directories named SCCS and
           files in them.

        5. The following command:

               find . -print -name SCCS -prune

           behaves as in the previous example, but prints the names of
           the SCCS directories.

        6. The following command is roughly equivalent to the <b>-nt</b>
           extension to <i>test</i>:

               if [ -n "$(find file1 -prune -newer file2)" ]; then
                   printf %s\\n "file1 is newer than file2"
               fi

        7. The descriptions of <b>-atime</b>, <b>-ctime</b>, and <b>-mtime </b>use the
           terminology <i>n</i> ``86400 second periods (days)''. For example, a
           file accessed at 23:59 is selected by:

               find . -atime -1 -print

           at 00:01 the next day (less than 24 hours later, not more
           than one day ago); the midnight boundary between days has no
           effect on the 24-hour calculation.

        8. The following command:

               find . ! -name . -prune -name '*.old' -exec \
                   sh -c 'mv "$@" ../old/' sh {} +

           performs the same task as:

               mv ./*.old ./.old ./.*.old ../old/

           while avoiding an ``Argument list too long'' error if there
           are a large number of files ending with <b>.old </b>and without
           running <i>mv</i> if there are no such files (and avoiding ``No such
           file or directory'' errors if <b>./.old </b>does not exist or no
           files match <b>./*.old </b>or <b>./.*.old</b>).

           The alternative:

               find . ! -name . -prune -name '*.old' -exec mv {} ../old/ \;

           is less efficient if there are many files to move because it
           executes one <i>mv</i> command per file.

        9. On systems configured to mount removable media on directories
           under <b>/media</b>, the following command searches the file
           hierarchy for files larger than 100000 KB without searching
           any mounted removable media:

               find / -path /media -prune -o -size +200000 -print

       10. Except for the root directory, and <b>"//" </b>on implementations
           where <b>"//" </b>does not refer to the root directory, no pattern
           given to <b>-name </b>will match a &lt;slash&gt;, because trailing &lt;slash&gt;
           characters are ignored when computing the basename of the
           file under evaluation. Given two empty directories named <b>foo</b>
           and <b>bar</b>, the following command:

               find foo/// bar/// -name foo -o -name 'bar?*'

           prints only the line <b>"foo///"</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-a </b>operator was retained as an optional operator for
       compatibility with historical shell scripts, even though it is
       redundant with expression concatenation.

       The descriptions of the <b>'-' </b>modifier on the <i>mode</i> and <i>onum</i>
       arguments to the <b>-perm </b>primary agree with historical practice on
       BSD and System V implementations. System V and BSD documentation
       both describe it in terms of checking additional bits; in fact,
       it uses the same bits, but checks for having at least all of the
       matching bits set instead of having exactly the matching bits
       set.

       The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only
       the general nature of the contents of prompts are specified
       because:

        *  Implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than
           those used on historical implementations.

        *  Since the historical prompt strings do not terminate with
           &lt;newline&gt; characters, there is no portable way for another
           program to interact with the prompts of this utility via
           pipes.

       Therefore, an application using this prompting option relies on
       the system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the
       user, based on the general guidelines specified.

       The <b>-name </b><i>file</i> operand was changed to use the shell pattern
       matching notation so that <i>find</i> is consistent with other utilities
       using pattern matching.

       The <b>-size </b>operand refers to the size of a file, rather than the
       number of blocks it may occupy in the file system. The intent is
       that the <i>st_size</i> field defined in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 should be used, not the <i>st_blocks</i> found in
       historical implementations. There are at least two reasons for
       this:

        1. In both System V and BSD, <i>find</i> only uses <i>st_size</i> in size
           calculations for the operands specified by this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017. (BSD uses <i>st_blocks</i> only when processing the
           <b>-ls </b>primary.)

        2. Users usually think of file size in terms of bytes, which is
           also the unit used by the <i>ls</i> utility for the output from the
           <b>-l </b>option. (In both System V and BSD, <i>ls</i> uses <i>st_size</i> for the
           <b>-l </b>option size field and uses <i>st_blocks</i> for the <i>ls</i> <b>-s</b>
           calculations. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify <i>ls</i>
           <b>-s</b>.)

       The descriptions of <b>-atime</b>, <b>-ctime</b>, and <b>-mtime </b>were changed from
       the SVID description of <i>n</i> ``days'' to <i>n</i> being the result of the
       integer division of the time difference in seconds by 86400. The
       description is also different in terms of the exact timeframe for
       the <i>n</i> case (<i>versus</i> the <i>+n</i> or <i>-n</i>), but it matches all known
       historical implementations. It refers to one 86400 second period
       in the past, not any time from the beginning of that period to
       the current time. For example, <b>-atime </b>2 is true if the file was
       accessed any time in the period from 72 hours to 48 hours ago.

       Historical implementations do not modify <b>"{}" </b>when it appears as
       a substring of an <b>-exec </b>or <b>-ok </b><i>utility_name</i> or argument string.
       There have been numerous user requests for this extension, so
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 allows the desired behavior. At least
       one recent implementation does support this feature, but
       encountered several problems in managing memory allocation and
       dealing with multiple occurrences of <b>"{}" </b>in a string while it
       was being developed, so it is not yet required behavior.

       Assuming the presence of <b>-print </b>was added to correct a historical
       pitfall that plagues novice users, it is entirely upwards-
       compatible from the historical System V <i>find</i> utility. In its
       simplest form (<i>find directory</i>), it could be confused with the
       historical BSD fast <i>find</i>.  The BSD developers agreed that adding
       <b>-print </b>as a default expression was the correct decision and have
       added the fast <i>find</i> functionality within a new utility called
       <i>locate</i>.

       Historically, the <b>-L </b>option was implemented using the primary
       <b>-follow</b>.  The <b>-H </b>and <b>-L </b>options were added for two reasons.
       First, they offer a finer granularity of control and consistency
       with other programs that walk file hierarchies. Second, the
       <b>-follow </b>primary always evaluated to true. As they were
       historically really global variables that took effect before the
       traversal began, some valid expressions had unexpected results.
       An example is the expression <b>-print -o -follow</b>.  Because <b>-print</b>
       always evaluates to true, the standard order of evaluation
       implies that <b>-follow </b>would never be evaluated. This was never the
       case. Historical practice for the <b>-follow </b>primary, however, is
       not consistent. Some implementations always follow symbolic links
       on the command line whether <b>-follow </b>is specified or not. Others
       follow symbolic links on the command line only if <b>-follow </b>is
       specified. Both behaviors are provided by the <b>-H </b>and <b>-L </b>options,
       but scripts using the current <b>-follow </b>primary would be broken if
       the <b>-follow </b>option is specified to work either way.

       Since the <b>-L </b>option resolves all symbolic links and the <b>-type </b><i>l</i>
       primary is true for symbolic links that still exist after
       symbolic links have been resolved, the command:

           find -L . -type l

       prints a list of symbolic links reachable from the current
       directory that do not resolve to accessible files.

       A feature of SVR4's <i>find</i> utility was the <b>-exec </b>primary's <b>+</b>
       terminator. This allowed filenames containing special characters
       (especially &lt;newline&gt; characters) to be grouped together without
       the problems that occur if such filenames are piped to <i>xargs</i>.
       Other implementations have added other ways to get around this
       problem, notably a <b>-print0 </b>primary that wrote filenames with a
       null byte terminator. This was considered here, but not adopted.
       Using a null terminator meant that any utility that was going to
       process <i>find</i>'s <b>-print0 </b>output had to add a new option to parse
       the null terminators it would now be reading.

       The <b>"-exec</b>...<b>{}</b>+" syntax adopted was a result of IEEE PASC
       Interpretation 1003.2 #210. It should be noted that this is an
       incompatible change to IEEE Std 1003.2‐1992. For example, the
       following command printed all files with a <b>'-' </b>after their name
       if they are regular files, and a <b>'+' </b>otherwise:

           find / -type f -exec echo {} - ';' -o -exec echo {} + ';'

       The change invalidates usage like this. Even though the previous
       standard stated that this usage would work, in practice many did
       not support it and the standard developers felt it better to now
       state that this was not allowable.
