DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ssh </b>(SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine
       and for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended
       to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
       hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP
       ports and Unix-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the
       secure channel.

       <b>ssh </b>connects and logs into the specified <i>destination</i>, which may
       be specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form
       ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove their identity
       to the remote machine using one of several methods (see below).

       If a <i>command</i> is specified, it will be executed on the remote host
       instead of a login shell.  A complete command line may be
       specified as <i>command</i>, or it may have additional arguments.  If
       supplied, the arguments will be appended to the command,
       separated by spaces, before it is sent to the server to be
       executed.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-4      </b>Forces <b>ssh </b>to use IPv4 addresses only.

       <b>-6      </b>Forces <b>ssh </b>to use IPv6 addresses only.

       <b>-A      </b>Enables forwarding of connections from an authentication
               agent such as <i>ssh-agent</i>(1).  This can also be specified
               on a per-host basis in a configuration file.

               Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users
               with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote
               host (for the agent's Unix-domain socket) can access the
               local agent through the forwarded connection.  An
               attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent,
               however they can perform operations on the keys that
               enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded
               into the agent.  A safer alternative may be to use a jump
               host (see <b>-J</b>).

       <b>-a      </b>Disables forwarding of the authentication agent
               connection.

       <b>-B </b><i>bind_interface</i>
               Bind to the address of <i>bind_interface</i> before attempting
               to connect to the destination host.  This is only useful
               on systems with more than one address.

       <b>-b </b><i>bind_address</i>
               Use <i>bind_address</i> on the local machine as the source
               address of the connection.  Only useful on systems with
               more than one address.

       <b>-C      </b>Requests compression of all data (including stdin,
               stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and
               Unix-domain connections).  The compression algorithm is
               the same used by <i>gzip</i>(1).  Compression is desirable on
               modem lines and other slow connections, but will only
               slow down things on fast networks.  The default value can
               be set on a host-by-host basis in the configuration
               files; see the <b>Compression </b>option in <i>ssh_config</i>(5).

       <b>-c </b><i>cipher_spec</i>
               Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the
               session.  <i>cipher_spec</i> is a comma-separated list of
               ciphers listed in order of preference.  See the <b>Ciphers</b>
               keyword in <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for more information.

       <b>-D </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>
               Specifies a local “dynamic” application-level port
               forwarding.  This works by allocating a socket to listen
               to <i>port</i> on the local side, optionally bound to the
               specified <i>bind_address</i>.  Whenever a connection is made to
               this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure
               channel, and the application protocol is then used to
               determine where to connect to from the remote machine.
               Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported,
               and <b>ssh </b>will act as a SOCKS server.  Only root can
               forward privileged ports.  Dynamic port forwardings can
               also be specified in the configuration file.

               IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address
               in square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward
               privileged ports.  By default, the local port is bound in
               accordance with the <b>GatewayPorts </b>setting.  However, an
               explicit <i>bind_address</i> may be used to bind the connection
               to a specific address.  The <i>bind_address</i> of “localhost”
               indicates that the listening port be bound for local use
               only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the
               port should be available from all interfaces.

       <b>-E </b><i>log_file</i>
               Append debug logs to <i>log_file</i> instead of standard error.

       <b>-e </b><i>escape_char</i>
               Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty
               (default: ‘~’).  The escape character is only recognized
               at the beginning of a line.  The escape character
               followed by a dot (‘.’) closes the connection; followed
               by control-Z suspends the connection; and followed by
               itself sends the escape character once.  Setting the
               character to “none” disables any escapes and makes the
               session fully transparent.

       <b>-F </b><i>configfile</i>
               Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file.  If
               a configuration file is given on the command line, the
               system-wide configuration file (<i>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</i>) will
               be ignored.  The default for the per-user configuration
               file is <i>~/.ssh/config</i>.  If set to “none”, no
               configuration files will be read.

       <b>-f      </b>Requests <b>ssh </b>to go to background just before command
               execution.  This is useful if <b>ssh </b>is going to ask for
               passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the
               background.  This implies <b>-n</b>.  The recommended way to
               start X11 programs at a remote site is with something
               like <b>ssh -f host xterm</b>.

               If the <b>ExitOnForwardFailure </b>configuration option is set
               to “yes”, then a client started with <b>-f </b>will wait for all
               remote port forwards to be successfully established
               before placing itself in the background.  Refer to the
               description of <b>ForkAfterAuthentication </b>in <i>ssh_config</i>(5)
               for details.

       <b>-G      </b>Causes <b>ssh </b>to print its configuration after evaluating
               <b>Host </b>and <b>Match </b>blocks and exit.

       <b>-g      </b>Allows remote hosts to connect to local forwarded ports.
               If used on a multiplexed connection, then this option
               must be specified on the master process.

       <b>-I </b><i>pkcs11</i>
               Specify the PKCS#11 shared library <b>ssh </b>should use to
               communicate with a PKCS#11 token providing keys for user
               authentication.

       <b>-i </b><i>identity_file</i>
               Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for
               public key authentication is read.  You can also specify
               a public key file to use the corresponding private key
               that is loaded in <i>ssh-agent</i>(1) when the private key file
               is not present locally.  The default is <i>~/.ssh/id_rsa</i>,
               <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</i>, <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk</i>, <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</i>,
               <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk</i> and <i>~/.ssh/id_dsa</i>.  Identity files
               may also be specified on a per-host basis in the
               configuration file.  It is possible to have multiple <b>-i</b>
               options (and multiple identities specified in
               configuration files).  If no certificates have been
               explicitly specified by the <b>CertificateFile </b>directive,
               <b>ssh </b>will also try to load certificate information from
               the filename obtained by appending <i>-cert.pub</i> to identity
               filenames.

       <b>-J </b><i>destination</i>
               Connect to the target host by first making an <b>ssh</b>
               connection to the jump host described by <i>destination</i> and
               then establishing a TCP forwarding to the ultimate
               destination from there.  Multiple jump hops may be
               specified separated by comma characters.  This is a
               shortcut to specify a <b>ProxyJump </b>configuration directive.
               Note that configuration directives supplied on the
               command-line generally apply to the destination host and
               not any specified jump hosts.  Use <i>~/.ssh/config</i> to
               specify configuration for jump hosts.

       <b>-K      </b>Enables GSSAPI-based authentication and forwarding
               (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to the server.

       <b>-k      </b>Disables forwarding (delegation) of GSSAPI credentials to
               the server.

       <b>-L </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>:<i>host</i>:<i>hostport</i>
       <b>-L </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>:<i>remote_socket</i>
       <b>-L </b><i>local_socket</i>:<i>host</i>:<i>hostport</i>
       <b>-L </b><i>local_socket</i>:<i>remote_socket</i>
               Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix
               socket on the local (client) host are to be forwarded to
               the given host and port, or Unix socket, on the remote
               side.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to
               either a TCP <i>port</i> on the local side, optionally bound to
               the specified <i>bind_address</i>, or to a Unix socket.
               Whenever a connection is made to the local port or
               socket, the connection is forwarded over the secure
               channel, and a connection is made to either <i>host</i> port
               <i>hostport</i>, or the Unix socket <i>remote_socket</i>, from the
               remote machine.

               Port forwardings can also be specified in the
               configuration file.  Only the superuser can forward
               privileged ports.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by
               enclosing the address in square brackets.

               By default, the local port is bound in accordance with
               the <b>GatewayPorts </b>setting.  However, an explicit
               <i>bind_address</i> may be used to bind the connection to a
               specific address.  The <i>bind_address</i> of “localhost”
               indicates that the listening port be bound for local use
               only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the
               port should be available from all interfaces.

       <b>-l </b><i>login_name</i>
               Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine.
               This also may be specified on a per-host basis in the
               configuration file.

       <b>-M      </b>Places the <b>ssh </b>client into “master” mode for connection
               sharing.  Multiple <b>-M </b>options places <b>ssh </b>into “master”
               mode but with confirmation required using <i>ssh-askpass</i>(1)
               before each operation that changes the multiplexing state
               (e.g. opening a new session).  Refer to the description
               of <b>ControlMaster </b>in <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for details.

       <b>-m </b><i>mac_spec</i>
               A comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication
               code) algorithms, specified in order of preference.  See
               the <b>MACs </b>keyword in <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for more information.

       <b>-N      </b>Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just
               forwarding ports.  Refer to the description of
               <b>SessionType </b>in <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for details.

       <b>-n      </b>Redirects stdin from <i>/dev/null</i> (actually, prevents
               reading from stdin).  This must be used when <b>ssh </b>is run
               in the background.  A common trick is to use this to run
               X11 programs on a remote machine.  For example, <b>ssh -n</b>
               <b>shadows.cs.hut.fi emacs &amp; </b>will start an emacs on
               shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will be
               automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel.  The
               <b>ssh </b>program will be put in the background.  (This does
               not work if <b>ssh </b>needs to ask for a password or
               passphrase; see also the <b>-f </b>option.)  Refer to the
               description of <b>StdinNull </b>in <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for details.

       <b>-O </b><i>ctl_cmd</i>
               Control an active connection multiplexing master process.
               When the <b>-O </b>option is specified, the <i>ctl_cmd</i> argument is
               interpreted and passed to the master process.  Valid
               commands are: “check” (check that the master process is
               running), “forward” (request forwardings without command
               execution), “cancel” (cancel forwardings), “exit”
               (request the master to exit), and “stop” (request the
               master to stop accepting further multiplexing requests).

       <b>-o </b><i>option</i>
               Can be used to give options in the format used in the
               configuration file.  This is useful for specifying
               options for which there is no separate command-line flag.
               For full details of the options listed below, and their
               possible values, see <i>ssh_config</i>(5).

       <b>-Q </b><i>query_option</i>
               Queries for the algorithms supported by one of the

               <i>ssh_config</i>(5) or <i>sshd_config</i>(5) that takes an algorithm
               list may be used as an alias for the corresponding
               query_option.

       <b>-q      </b>Quiet mode.  Causes most warning and diagnostic messages
               to be suppressed.

       <b>-R </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>:<i>host</i>:<i>hostport</i>
       <b>-R </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>:<i>local_socket</i>
       <b>-R </b><i>remote_socket</i>:<i>host</i>:<i>hostport</i>
       <b>-R </b><i>remote_socket</i>:<i>local_socket</i>
       <b>-R </b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i>
               Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix
               socket on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded to
               the local side.

               This works by allocating a socket to listen to either a
               TCP <i>port</i> or to a Unix socket on the remote side.
               Whenever a connection is made to this port or Unix
               socket, the connection is forwarded over the secure
               channel, and a connection is made from the local machine
               to either an explicit destination specified by <i>host</i> port
               <i>hostport</i>, or <i>local_socket</i>, or, if no explicit destination
               was specified, <b>ssh </b>will act as a SOCKS 4/5 proxy and
               forward connections to the destinations requested by the
               remote SOCKS client.

               Port forwardings can also be specified in the
               configuration file.  Privileged ports can be forwarded
               only when logging in as root on the remote machine.  IPv6
               addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in
               square brackets.

               By default, TCP listening sockets on the server will be
               bound to the loopback interface only.  This may be
               overridden by specifying a <i>bind_address</i>.  An empty
               <i>bind_address</i>, or the address ‘*’, indicates that the
               remote socket should listen on all interfaces.
               Specifying a remote <i>bind_address</i> will only succeed if the
               server's <b>GatewayPorts </b>option is enabled (see
               <i>sshd_config</i>(5)).

               If the <i>port</i> argument is ‘0’, the listen port will be
               dynamically allocated on the server and reported to the
               client at run time.  When used together with <b>-O forward</b>,
               the allocated port will be printed to the standard
               output.

       <b>-S </b><i>ctl_path</i>
               Specifies the location of a control socket for connection
               sharing, or the string “none” to disable connection
               sharing.  Refer to the description of <b>ControlPath </b>and
               <b>ControlMaster </b>in <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for details.

       <b>-s      </b>May be used to request invocation of a subsystem on the
               remote system.  Subsystems facilitate the use of SSH as a
               secure transport for other applications (e.g. <i>sftp</i>(1)).
               The subsystem is specified as the remote command.  Refer
               to the description of <b>SessionType </b>in <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for
               details.

       <b>-T      </b>Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

       <b>-t      </b>Force pseudo-terminal allocation.  This can be used to
               execute arbitrary screen-based programs on a remote
               machine, which can be very useful, e.g. when implementing
               menu services.  Multiple <b>-t </b>options force tty allocation,
               even if <b>ssh </b>has no local tty.

       <b>-V      </b>Display the version number and exit.

       <b>-v      </b>Verbose mode.  Causes <b>ssh </b>to print debugging messages
               about its progress.  This is helpful in debugging
               connection, authentication, and configuration problems.
               Multiple <b>-v </b>options increase the verbosity.  The maximum
               is 3.

       <b>-W </b><i>host</i>:<i>port</i>
               Requests that standard input and output on the client be
               forwarded to <i>host</i> on <i>port</i> over the secure channel.
               Implies <b>-N</b>, <b>-T</b>, <b>ExitOnForwardFailure </b>and
               <b>ClearAllForwardings</b>, though these can be overridden in
               the configuration file or using <b>-o </b>command line options.

       <b>-w </b><i>local_tun</i>[:<i>remote_tun</i>]
               Requests tunnel device forwarding with the specified
               <i>tun</i>(4) devices between the client (<i>local_tun</i>) and the
               server (<i>remote_tun</i>).

               The devices may be specified by numerical ID or the
               keyword “any”, which uses the next available tunnel
               device.  If <i>remote_tun</i> is not specified, it defaults to
               “any”.  See also the <b>Tunnel </b>and <b>TunnelDevice </b>directives
               in <i>ssh_config</i>(5).

               If the <b>Tunnel </b>directive is unset, it will be set to the
               default tunnel mode, which is “point-to-point”.  If a
               different <b>Tunnel </b>forwarding mode it desired, then it
               should be specified before <b>-w</b>.

       <b>-X      </b>Enables X11 forwarding.  This can also be specified on a
               per-host basis in a configuration file.

               X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution.  Users
               with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote
               host (for the user's X authorization database) can access
               the local X11 display through the forwarded connection.
               An attacker may then be able to perform activities such
               as keystroke monitoring.

               For this reason, X11 forwarding is subjected to X11
               SECURITY extension restrictions by default.  Refer to the
               <b>ssh -Y </b>option and the <b>ForwardX11Trusted </b>directive in
               <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for more information.

       <b>-x      </b>Disables X11 forwarding.

       <b>-Y      </b>Enables trusted X11 forwarding.  Trusted X11 forwardings
               are not subjected to the X11 SECURITY extension controls.

       <b>-y      </b>Send log information using the <i>syslog</i>(3) system module.
               By default this information is sent to stderr.

       <b>ssh </b>may additionally obtain configuration data from a per-user
       configuration file and a system-wide configuration file.  The
       file format and configuration options are described in
       <i>ssh_config</i>(5).
</pre> <h2>
AUTHENTICATION </h2>
<pre>
       The OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocol 2.

       The methods available for authentication are: GSSAPI-based
       authentication, host-based authentication, public key
       authentication, keyboard-interactive authentication, and password
       authentication.  Authentication methods are tried in the order
       specified above, though <b>PreferredAuthentications </b>can be used to
       change the default order.

       Host-based authentication works as follows: If the machine the
       user logs in from is listed in <i>/etc/hosts.equiv</i> or
       <i>/etc/shosts.equiv</i> on the remote machine, the user is non-root and
       the user names are the same on both sides, or if the files
       <i>~/.rhosts</i> or <i>~/.shosts</i> exist in the user's home directory on the
       remote machine and contain a line containing the name of the
       client machine and the name of the user on that machine, the user
       is considered for login.  Additionally, the server <i>must</i> be able
       to verify the client's host key (see the description of
       <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</i> and <i>~/.ssh/known_hosts</i>, below) for login
       to be permitted.  This authentication method closes security
       holes due to IP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and routing spoofing.
       [Note to the administrator: <i>/etc/hosts.equiv</i>, <i>~/.rhosts</i>, and the
       rlogin/rsh protocol in general, are inherently insecure and
       should be disabled if security is desired.]

       Public key authentication works as follows: The scheme is based
       on public-key cryptography, using cryptosystems where encryption
       and decryption are done using separate keys, and it is unfeasible
       to derive the decryption key from the encryption key.  The idea
       is that each user creates a public/private key pair for
       authentication purposes.  The server knows the public key, and
       only the user knows the private key.  <b>ssh </b>implements public key
       authentication protocol automatically, using one of the DSA,
       ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA algorithms.  The HISTORY section of <i>ssl</i>(8)
       contains a brief discussion of the DSA and RSA algorithms.

       The file <i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> lists the public keys that are
       permitted for logging in.  When the user logs in, the <b>ssh </b>program
       tells the server which key pair it would like to use for
       authentication.  The client proves that it has access to the
       private key and the server checks that the corresponding public
       key is authorized to accept the account.

       The server may inform the client of errors that prevented public
       key authentication from succeeding after authentication completes
       using a different method.  These may be viewed by increasing the
       <b>LogLevel </b>to <b>DEBUG </b>or higher (e.g. by using the <b>-v </b>flag).

       The user creates their key pair by running <i>ssh-keygen</i>(1).  This
       stores the private key in <i>~/.ssh/id_dsa</i> (DSA), <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</i>
       (ECDSA), <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk</i> (authenticator-hosted ECDSA),
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</i> (Ed25519), <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk</i> (authenticator-
       hosted Ed25519), or <i>~/.ssh/id_rsa</i> (RSA) and stores the public key
       in <i>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</i> (DSA), <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub</i> (ECDSA),
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub</i> (authenticator-hosted ECDSA),
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</i> (Ed25519), <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.pub</i>
       (authenticator-hosted Ed25519), or <i>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</i> (RSA) in the
       user's home directory.  The user should then copy the public key
       to <i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> in their home directory on the remote
       machine.  The <i>authorized_keys</i> file corresponds to the
       conventional <i>~/.rhosts</i> file, and has one key per line, though the
       lines can be very long.  After this, the user can log in without
       giving the password.

       A variation on public key authentication is available in the form
       of certificate authentication: instead of a set of public/private
       keys, signed certificates are used.  This has the advantage that
       a single trusted certification authority can be used in place of
       many public/private keys.  See the CERTIFICATES section of
       <i>ssh-keygen</i>(1) for more information.

       The most convenient way to use public key or certificate
       authentication may be with an authentication agent.  See
       <i>ssh-agent</i>(1) and (optionally) the <b>AddKeysToAgent </b>directive in
       <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for more information.

       Keyboard-interactive authentication works as follows: The server
       sends an arbitrary "challenge" text and prompts for a response,
       possibly multiple times.  Examples of keyboard-interactive
       authentication include BSD Authentication (see <i>login.conf</i>(5)) and
       PAM (some non-OpenBSD systems).

       Finally, if other authentication methods fail, <b>ssh </b>prompts the
       user for a password.  The password is sent to the remote host for
       checking; however, since all communications are encrypted, the
       password cannot be seen by someone listening on the network.

       <b>ssh </b>automatically maintains and checks a database containing
       identification for all hosts it has ever been used with.  Host
       keys are stored in <i>~/.ssh/known_hosts</i> in the user's home
       directory.  Additionally, the file <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</i> is
       automatically checked for known hosts.  Any new hosts are
       automatically added to the user's file.  If a host's
       identification ever changes, <b>ssh </b>warns about this and disables
       password authentication to prevent server spoofing or man-in-the-
       middle attacks, which could otherwise be used to circumvent the
       encryption.  The <b>StrictHostKeyChecking </b>option can be used to
       control logins to machines whose host key is not known or has
       changed.

       When the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the
       server either executes the given command in a non-interactive
       session or, if no command has been specified, logs into the
       machine and gives the user a normal shell as an interactive
       session.  All communication with the remote command or shell will
       be automatically encrypted.

       If an interactive session is requested, <b>ssh </b>by default will only
       request a pseudo-terminal (pty) for interactive sessions when the
       client has one.  The flags <b>-T </b>and <b>-t </b>can be used to override this
       behaviour.

       If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the user may use the
       escape characters noted below.

       If no pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the session is
       transparent and can be used to reliably transfer binary data.  On
       most systems, setting the escape character to “none” will also
       make the session transparent even if a tty is used.

       The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote
       machine exits and all X11 and TCP connections have been closed.
</pre> <h2>
ESCAPE CHARACTERS </h2>
<pre>
       When a pseudo-terminal has been requested, <b>ssh </b>supports a number
       of functions through the use of an escape character.

       A single tilde character can be sent as <b>~~ </b>or by following the
       tilde by a character other than those described below.  The
       escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted
       as special.  The escape character can be changed in configuration
       files using the <b>EscapeChar </b>configuration directive or on the
       command line by the <b>-e </b>option.

       The supported escapes (assuming the default ‘~’) are:

       <b>~.      </b>Disconnect.

       <b>~^Z     </b>Background <b>ssh</b>.

       <b>~#      </b>List forwarded connections.

       <b>~&amp;      </b>Background <b>ssh </b>at logout when waiting for forwarded
               connection / X11 sessions to terminate.

       <b>~?      </b>Display a list of escape characters.

       <b>~B      </b>Send a BREAK to the remote system (only useful if the
               peer supports it).

       <b>~C      </b>Open command line.  Currently this allows the addition of
               port forwardings using the <b>-L</b>, <b>-R </b>and <b>-D </b>options (see
               above).  It also allows the cancellation of existing
               port-forwardings with <b>-KL</b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i> for local,
               <b>-KR</b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i> for remote and
               <b>-KD</b>[<i>bind_address</i>:]<i>port</i> for dynamic port-forwardings.
               <b>!</b><i>command</i> allows the user to execute a local command if
               the <b>PermitLocalCommand </b>option is enabled in
               <i>ssh_config</i>(5).  Basic help is available, using the <b>-h</b>
               option.

       <b>~R      </b>Request rekeying of the connection (only useful if the
               peer supports it).

       <b>~V      </b>Decrease the verbosity (<b>LogLevel</b>) when errors are being
               written to stderr.

       <b>~v      </b>Increase the verbosity (<b>LogLevel</b>) when errors are being
               written to stderr.
</pre> <h2>
TCP FORWARDING </h2>
<pre>
       Forwarding of arbitrary TCP connections over a secure channel can
       be specified either on the command line or in a configuration
       file.  One possible application of TCP forwarding is a secure
       connection to a mail server; another is going through firewalls.

       In the example below, we look at encrypting communication for an
       IRC client, even though the IRC server it connects to does not
       directly support encrypted communication.  This works as follows:
       the user connects to the remote host using <b>ssh</b>, specifying the
       ports to be used to forward the connection.  After that it is
       possible to start the program locally, and <b>ssh </b>will encrypt and
       forward the connection to the remote server.

       The following example tunnels an IRC session from the client to
       an IRC server at “server.example.com”, joining channel “#users”,
       nickname “pinky”, using the standard IRC port, 6667:

           $ ssh -f -L 6667:localhost:6667 server.example.com sleep 10
           $ irc -c '#users' pinky IRC/127.0.0.1

       The <b>-f </b>option backgrounds <b>ssh </b>and the remote command “sleep 10”
       is specified to allow an amount of time (10 seconds, in the
       example) to start the program which is going to use the tunnel.
       If no connections are made within the time specified, <b>ssh </b>will
       exit.
</pre> <h2>
X11 FORWARDING </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>ForwardX11 </b>variable is set to “yes” (or see the
       description of the <b>-X</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-Y </b>options above) and the user is
       using X11 (the DISPLAY environment variable is set), the
       connection to the X11 display is automatically forwarded to the
       remote side in such a way that any X11 programs started from the
       shell (or command) will go through the encrypted channel, and the
       connection to the real X server will be made from the local
       machine.  The user should not manually set DISPLAY.  Forwarding
       of X11 connections can be configured on the command line or in
       configuration files.

       The DISPLAY value set by <b>ssh </b>will point to the server machine,
       but with a display number greater than zero.  This is normal, and
       happens because <b>ssh </b>creates a “proxy” X server on the server
       machine for forwarding the connections over the encrypted
       channel.

       <b>ssh </b>will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server
       machine.  For this purpose, it will generate a random
       authorization cookie, store it in Xauthority on the server, and
       verify that any forwarded connections carry this cookie and
       replace it by the real cookie when the connection is opened.  The
       real authentication cookie is never sent to the server machine
       (and no cookies are sent in the plain).

       If the <b>ForwardAgent </b>variable is set to “yes” (or see the
       description of the <b>-A </b>and <b>-a </b>options above) and the user is using
       an authentication agent, the connection to the agent is
       automatically forwarded to the remote side.
</pre> <h2>
VERIFYING HOST KEYS </h2>
<pre>
       When connecting to a server for the first time, a fingerprint of
       the server's public key is presented to the user (unless the
       option <b>StrictHostKeyChecking </b>has been disabled).  Fingerprints
       can be determined using <i>ssh-keygen</i>(1):

             <b>$ ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</b>

       If the fingerprint is already known, it can be matched and the
       key can be accepted or rejected.  If only legacy (MD5)
       fingerprints for the server are available, the <i>ssh-keygen</i>(1) <b>-E</b>
       option may be used to downgrade the fingerprint algorithm to
       match.

       Because of the difficulty of comparing host keys just by looking
       at fingerprint strings, there is also support to compare host
       keys visually, using <i>random art</i>.  By setting the <b>VisualHostKey</b>
       option to “yes”, a small ASCII graphic gets displayed on every
       login to a server, no matter if the session itself is interactive
       or not.  By learning the pattern a known server produces, a user
       can easily find out that the host key has changed when a
       completely different pattern is displayed.  Because these
       patterns are not unambiguous however, a pattern that looks
       similar to the pattern remembered only gives a good probability
       that the host key is the same, not guaranteed proof.

       To get a listing of the fingerprints along with their random art
       for all known hosts, the following command line can be used:

             <b>$ ssh-keygen -lv -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts</b>

       If the fingerprint is unknown, an alternative method of
       verification is available: SSH fingerprints verified by DNS.  An
       additional resource record (RR), SSHFP, is added to a zonefile
       and the connecting client is able to match the fingerprint with
       that of the key presented.

       In this example, we are connecting a client to a server,
       “host.example.com”.  The SSHFP resource records should first be
       added to the zonefile for host.example.com:

             $ ssh-keygen -r host.example.com.

       The output lines will have to be added to the zonefile.  To check
       that the zone is answering fingerprint queries:

             <b>$ dig -t SSHFP host.example.com</b>

       Finally the client connects:

             $ ssh -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS ask" host.example.com
             [...]
             Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS.
             Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

       See the <b>VerifyHostKeyDNS </b>option in <i>ssh_config</i>(5) for more
       information.
</pre> <h2>
SSH-BASED VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ssh </b>contains support for Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnelling
       using the <i>tun</i>(4) network pseudo-device, allowing two networks to
       be joined securely.  The <i>sshd_config</i>(5) configuration option
       <b>PermitTunnel </b>controls whether the server supports this, and at
       what level (layer 2 or 3 traffic).

       The following example would connect client network 10.0.50.0/24
       with remote network 10.0.99.0/24 using a point-to-point
       connection from 10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.2, provided that the SSH
       server running on the gateway to the remote network, at
       192.168.1.15, allows it.

       On the client:

             # ssh -f -w 0:1 192.168.1.15 true
             # ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252
             # route add 10.0.99.0/24 10.1.1.2

       On the server:

             # ifconfig tun1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252
             # route add 10.0.50.0/24 10.1.1.1

       Client access may be more finely tuned via the
       <i>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> file (see below) and the
       <b>PermitRootLogin </b>server option.  The following entry would permit
       connections on <i>tun</i>(4) device 1 from user “jane” and on tun device
       2 from user “john”, if <b>PermitRootLogin </b>is set to
       “forced-commands-only”:

         tunnel="1",command="sh /etc/netstart tun1" ssh-rsa ... jane
         tunnel="2",command="sh /etc/netstart tun2" ssh-rsa ... john

       Since an SSH-based setup entails a fair amount of overhead, it
       may be more suited to temporary setups, such as for wireless
       VPNs.  More permanent VPNs are better provided by tools such as
       <i>ipsecctl</i>(8) and <i>isakmpd</i>(8).
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ssh </b>will normally set the following environment variables:

       DISPLAY               The DISPLAY variable indicates the location
                             of the X11 server.  It is automatically set
                             by <b>ssh </b>to point to a value of the form
                             “hostname:n”, where “hostname” indicates
                             the host where the shell runs, and ‘n’ is
                             an integer ≥ 1.  <b>ssh </b>uses this special
                             value to forward X11 connections over the
                             secure channel.  The user should normally
                             not set DISPLAY explicitly, as that will
                             render the X11 connection insecure (and
                             will require the user to manually copy any
                             required authorization cookies).

       HOME                  Set to the path of the user's home
                             directory.

       LOGNAME               Synonym for USER; set for compatibility
                             with systems that use this variable.

       MAIL                  Set to the path of the user's mailbox.

       PATH                  Set to the default PATH, as specified when
                             compiling <b>ssh</b>.

       SSH_ASKPASS           If <b>ssh </b>needs a passphrase, it will read the
                             passphrase from the current terminal if it
                             was run from a terminal.  If <b>ssh </b>does not
                             have a terminal associated with it but
                             DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPASS are set, it will
                             execute the program specified by
                             SSH_ASKPASS and open an X11 window to read
                             the passphrase.  This is particularly
                             useful when calling <b>ssh </b>from a <i>.xsession</i> or
                             related script.  (Note that on some
                             machines it may be necessary to redirect
                             the input from <i>/dev/null</i> to make this
                             work.)

       SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE   Allows further control over the use of an
                             askpass program.  If this variable is set
                             to “never” then <b>ssh </b>will never attempt to
                             use one.  If it is set to “prefer”, then
                             <b>ssh </b>will prefer to use the askpass program
                             instead of the TTY when requesting
                             passwords.  Finally, if the variable is set
                             to “force”, then the askpass program will
                             be used for all passphrase input regardless
                             of whether DISPLAY is set.

       SSH_AUTH_SOCK         Identifies the path of a Unix-domain socket
                             used to communicate with the agent.

       SSH_CONNECTION        Identifies the client and server ends of
                             the connection.  The variable contains four
                             space-separated values: client IP address,
                             client port number, server IP address, and
                             server port number.

       SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND  This variable contains the original command
                             line if a forced command is executed.  It
                             can be used to extract the original
                             arguments.

       SSH_TTY               This is set to the name of the tty (path to
                             the device) associated with the current
                             shell or command.  If the current session
                             has no tty, this variable is not set.

       SSH_TUNNEL            Optionally set by <i>sshd</i>(8) to contain the
                             interface names assigned if tunnel
                             forwarding was requested by the client.

       SSH_USER_AUTH         Optionally set by <i>sshd</i>(8), this variable
                             may contain a pathname to a file that lists
                             the authentication methods successfully
                             used when the session was established,
                             including any public keys that were used.

       TZ                    This variable is set to indicate the
                             present time zone if it was set when the
                             daemon was started (i.e. the daemon passes
                             the value on to new connections).

       USER                  Set to the name of the user logging in.

       Additionally, <b>ssh </b>reads <i>~/.ssh/environment</i>, and adds lines of the
       format “VARNAME=value” to the environment if the file exists and
       users are allowed to change their environment.  For more
       information, see the <b>PermitUserEnvironment </b>option in
       <i>sshd_config</i>(5).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>~/.rhosts</i>
               This file is used for host-based authentication (see
               above).  On some machines this file may need to be world-
               readable if the user's home directory is on an NFS
               partition, because <i>sshd</i>(8) reads it as root.
               Additionally, this file must be owned by the user, and
               must not have write permissions for anyone else.  The
               recommended permission for most machines is read/write
               for the user, and not accessible by others.

       <i>~/.shosts</i>
               This file is used in exactly the same way as <i>.rhosts</i>, but
               allows host-based authentication without permitting login
               with rlogin/rsh.

       <i>~/.ssh/</i>
               This directory is the default location for all user-
               specific configuration and authentication information.
               There is no general requirement to keep the entire
               contents of this directory secret, but the recommended
               permissions are read/write/execute for the user, and not
               accessible by others.

       <i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i>
               Lists the public keys (DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA) that can
               be used for logging in as this user.  The format of this
               file is described in the <i>sshd</i>(8) manual page.  This file
               is not highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions
               are read/write for the user, and not accessible by
               others.

       <i>~/.ssh/config</i>
               This is the per-user configuration file.  The file format
               and configuration options are described in <i>ssh_config</i>(5).
               Because of the potential for abuse, this file must have
               strict permissions: read/write for the user, and not
               writable by others.

       <i>~/.ssh/environment</i>
               Contains additional definitions for environment
               variables; see “ENVIRONMENT”, above.

       <i>~/.ssh/id_dsa</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_rsa</i>
               Contains the private key for authentication.  These files
               contain sensitive data and should be readable by the user
               but not accessible by others (read/write/execute).  <b>ssh</b>
               will simply ignore a private key file if it is accessible
               by others.  It is possible to specify a passphrase when
               generating the key which will be used to encrypt the
               sensitive part of this file using AES-128.

       <i>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.pub</i>
       <i>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</i>
               Contains the public key for authentication.  These files
               are not sensitive and can (but need not) be readable by
               anyone.

       <i>~/.ssh/known_hosts</i>
               Contains a list of host keys for all hosts the user has
               logged into that are not already in the systemwide list
               of known host keys.  See <i>sshd</i>(8) for further details of
               the format of this file.

       <i>~/.ssh/rc</i>
               Commands in this file are executed by <b>ssh </b>when the user
               logs in, just before the user's shell (or command) is
               started.  See the <i>sshd</i>(8) manual page for more
               information.

       <i>/etc/hosts.equiv</i>
               This file is for host-based authentication (see above).
               It should only be writable by root.

       <i>/etc/shosts.equiv</i>
               This file is used in exactly the same way as <i>hosts.equiv</i>,
               but allows host-based authentication without permitting
               login with rlogin/rsh.

       <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</i>
               Systemwide configuration file.  The file format and
               configuration options are described in <i>ssh_config</i>(5).

       <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_key</i>
       <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key</i>
       <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key</i>
       <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key</i>
       <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</i>
               These files contain the private parts of the host keys
               and are used for host-based authentication.

       <i>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</i>
               Systemwide list of known host keys.  This file should be
               prepared by the system administrator to contain the
               public host keys of all machines in the organization.  It
               should be world-readable.  See <i>sshd</i>(8) for further
               details of the format of this file.

       <i>/etc/ssh/sshrc</i>
               Commands in this file are executed by <b>ssh </b>when the user
               logs in, just before the user's shell (or command) is
               started.  See the <i>sshd</i>(8) manual page for more
               information.

       Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed many bugs, re-
       added newer features and created OpenSSH.  Markus Friedl
       contributed the support for SSH protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.
