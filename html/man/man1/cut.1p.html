NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cut — cut out selected fields of each line of a file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       cut -b <i>list</i> <b>[</b>-n<b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>

       cut -c <i>list</i> <b>[</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>

       cut -f <i>list</i> <b>[</b>-d <i>delim</i><b>] [</b>-s<b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cut</i> utility shall cut out bytes (<b>-b </b>option), characters (<b>-c</b>
       option), or character-delimited fields (<b>-f </b>option) from each line
       in one or more files, concatenate them, and write them to
       standard output.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cut</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The application shall ensure that the option-argument <i>list</i> (see
       options <b>-b</b>, <b>-c</b>, and <b>-f </b>below) is a &lt;comma&gt;-separated list or
       &lt;blank&gt;-separated list of positive numbers and ranges. Ranges can
       be in three forms. The first is two positive numbers separated by
       a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (<i>low</i>-<i>high</i>), which represents all fields from the
       first number to the second number. The second is a positive
       number preceded by a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (-<i>high</i>), which represents all
       fields from field number 1 to that number. The third is a
       positive number followed by a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (<i>low</i>-), which
       represents that number to the last field, inclusive. The elements
       in <i>list</i> can be repeated, can overlap, and can be specified in any
       order, but the bytes, characters, or fields selected shall be
       written in the order of the input data. If an element appears in
       the selection list more than once, it shall be written exactly
       once.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-b </b><i>list</i>   Cut based on a <i>list</i> of bytes. Each selected byte shall
                 be output unless the <b>-n </b>option is also specified. It
                 shall not be an error to select bytes not present in
                 the input line.

       <b>-c </b><i>list</i>   Cut based on a <i>list</i> of characters. Each selected
                 character shall be output. It shall not be an error to
                 select characters not present in the input line.

       <b>-d </b><i>delim</i>  Set the field delimiter to the character <i>delim</i>.  The
                 default is the &lt;tab&gt;.

       <b>-f </b><i>list</i>   Cut based on a <i>list</i> of fields, assumed to be separated
                 in the file by a delimiter character (see <b>-d</b>).  Each
                 selected field shall be output. Output fields shall be
                 separated by a single occurrence of the field delimiter
                 character. Lines with no field delimiters shall be
                 passed through intact, unless <b>-s </b>is specified. It shall
                 not be an error to select fields not present in the
                 input line.

       <b>-n        </b>Do not split characters. When specified with the <b>-b</b>
                 option, each element in <i>list</i> of the form <i>low</i>-<i>high</i>
                 (&lt;hyphen-minus&gt;-separated numbers) shall be modified as
                 follows:

                  *  If the byte selected by <i>low</i> is not the first byte
                     of a character, <i>low</i> shall be decremented to select
                     the first byte of the character originally selected
                     by <i>low</i>.  If the byte selected by <i>high</i> is not the
                     last byte of a character, <i>high</i> shall be decremented
                     to select the last byte of the character prior to
                     the character originally selected by <i>high</i>, or zero
                     if there is no prior character. If the resulting
                     range element has <i>high</i> equal to zero or <i>low</i> greater
                     than <i>high</i>, the list element shall be dropped from
                     <i>list</i> for that input line without causing an error.

                 Each element in <i>list</i> of the form <i>low</i>- shall be treated
                 as above with <i>high</i> set to the number of bytes in the
                 current line, not including the terminating &lt;newline&gt;.
                 Each element in <i>list</i> of the form -<i>high</i> shall be treated
                 as above with <i>low</i> set to 1. Each element in <i>list</i> of the
                 form <i>num</i> (a single number) shall be treated as above
                 with <i>low</i> set to <i>num</i> and <i>high</i> set to <i>num</i>.

       <b>-s        </b>Suppress lines with no delimiter characters, when used
                 with the <b>-f </b>option. Unless specified, lines with no
                 delimiters shall be passed through untouched.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of an input file. If no <i>file</i> operands are
                 specified, or if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-'</b>, the standard
                 input shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <i>file</i> operands are
       specified, or if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-'</b>.  See the INPUT FILES
       section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be text files, except that line lengths
       shall be unlimited.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>cut</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cut</i> utility output shall be a concatenation of the selected
       bytes, characters, or fields (one of the following):

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>concatenation of bytes</i>&gt;

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>concatenation of characters</i>&gt;

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>concatenation of fields and field delimiters</i>&gt;
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were output successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cut</i> and <i>fold</i> utilities can be used to create text files out
       of files with arbitrary line lengths. The <i>cut</i> utility should be
       used when the number of lines (or records) needs to remain
       constant. The <i>fold</i> utility should be used when the contents of
       long lines need to be kept contiguous.

       Earlier versions of the <i>cut</i> utility worked in an environment
       where bytes and characters were considered equivalent (modulo
       &lt;backspace&gt; and &lt;tab&gt; processing in some implementations). In the
       extended world of multi-byte characters, the new <b>-b </b>option has
       been added. The <b>-n </b>option (used with <b>-b</b>) allows it to be used to
       act on bytes rounded to character boundaries.  The algorithm
       specified for <b>-n </b>guarantees that:

           cut -b 1-500 -n file &gt; file1
           cut -b 501- -n file &gt; file2

       ends up with all the characters in <b>file </b>appearing exactly once in
       <b>file1 </b>or <b>file2</b>.  (There is, however, a &lt;newline&gt; in both <b>file1</b>
       and <b>file2 </b>for each &lt;newline&gt; in <b>file</b>.)
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Examples of the option qualifier list:

       1,4,7   Select the first, fourth, and seventh bytes, characters,
               or fields and field delimiters.

       1-3,8   Equivalent to 1,2,3,8.

       -5,10   Equivalent to 1,2,3,4,5,10.

       3-      Equivalent to third to last, inclusive.

       The <i>low</i>-<i>high</i> forms are not always equivalent when used with <b>-b</b>
       and <b>-n </b>and multi-byte characters; see the description of <b>-n</b>.

       The following command:

           cut -d : -f 1,6 /etc/passwd

       reads the System V password file (user database) and produces
       lines of the form:

           &lt;<i>user ID</i>&gt;:&lt;<i>home directory</i>&gt;

       Most utilities in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 work on text files.
       The <i>cut</i> utility can be used to turn files with arbitrary line
       lengths into a set of text files containing the same data. The
       <i>paste</i> utility can be used to create (or recreate) files with
       arbitrary line lengths. For example, if <b>file </b>contains long lines:

           cut -b 1-500 -n file &gt; file1
           cut -b 501- -n file &gt; file2

       creates <b>file1 </b>(a text file) with lines no longer than 500 bytes
       (plus the &lt;newline&gt;) and <b>file2 </b>that contains the remainder of the
       data from <b>file</b>.  (Note that <b>file2 </b>is not a text file if there are
       lines in <b>file </b>that are longer than 500 + {LINE_MAX} bytes.) The
       original file can be recreated from <b>file1 </b>and <b>file2 </b>using the
       command:

           paste -d "\0" file1 file2 &gt; file
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Some historical implementations do not count &lt;backspace&gt;
       characters in determining character counts with the <b>-c </b>option.
       This may be useful for using <i>cut</i> for processing <i>nroff</i> output. It
       was deliberately decided not to have the <b>-c </b>option treat either
       &lt;backspace&gt; or &lt;tab&gt; characters in any special fashion. The <i>fold</i>
       utility does treat these characters specially.

       Unlike other utilities, some historical implementations of <i>cut</i>
       exit after not finding an input file, rather than continuing to
       process the remaining <i>file</i> operands. This behavior is prohibited
       by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, where only the exit status is
       affected by this problem.

       The behavior of <i>cut</i> when provided with either mutually-exclusive
       options or options that do not work logically together has been
       deliberately left unspecified in favor of global wording in
       <i>Section 1.4</i>, <i>Utility Description Defaults</i>.

       The OPTIONS section was changed in response to IEEE PASC
       Interpretation 1003.2 #149. The change represents historical
       practice on all known systems. The original standard was
       ambiguous on the nature of the output.

       The <i>list</i> option-arguments are historically used to select the
       portions of the line to be written, but do not affect the order
       of the data. For example:

           echo abcdefghi | cut -c6,2,4-7,1

       yields <b>"abdefg"</b>.

       A proposal to enhance <i>cut</i> with the following option:

       <b>-o    </b>Preserve the selected field order. When this option is
             specified, each byte, character, or field (or ranges of
             such) shall be written in the order specified by the <i>list</i>
             option-argument, even if this requires multiple outputs of
             the same bytes, characters, or fields.

       was rejected because this type of enhancement is outside the
       scope of the IEEE P1003.2b draft standard.
