</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_installexamples - install example files into package build
       directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installexamples </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-A</b>] [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [<i>file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installexamples </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing examples into <i>usr/share/doc/package/examples</i> in
       package build directories.

       From debhelper compatibility level 11 on, <b>dh_install </b>will fall
       back to looking in <i>debian/tmp</i> for files, if it does not find them
       in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look
       using <b>--sourcedir</b>).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.examples
           Lists example files or directories to be installed.

           If upstream provides an <i>examples</i> directory, you will often
           want to use <b>examples/* </b>rather than <b>examples </b>in this file.
           The latter would create
           <i>/usr/share/doc/package/examples/examples</i>, which is rarely
           what you want.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
           documented in <a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper(7)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Install any files specified by command line parameters in ALL
           packages acted on.

       <b>--sourcedir=</b><i>dir</i>
           Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.
           This option requires compat 11 or later (it is silently
           ignored in compat 10 or earlier).

           Note that this is not the same as the <b>--sourcedirectory</b>
           option used by the <b>dh_auto_</b><i>*</i> commands. You rarely need to use
           this option, since <b>dh_installexamples </b>automatically looks for
           files in <i>debian/tmp</i> in debhelper compatibility level 11 and
           above.

       <b>--doc-main-package=</b><i>main-package</i>
           Set the main package for a documentation package.  This is
           used to install the documentation of the documentation
           package in <i>/usr/share/doc/main-package</i> as recommended by the
           Debian policy manual 3.9.7 in §12.3.

           In compat 11 (or later), this option is only useful if
           debhelper's auto-detection of the main package is wrong.  The
           option can also be used to silence a warning from debhelper
           when the auto-detection fails but the default happens to be
           correct.

           This option cannot be used when <b>dh_installexamples </b>is
           instructed to act on multiple packages.  If you need this
           option, you will generally need to combine it with <b>-p </b>to
           ensure exactly one package is acted on.

       <b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude files that contain <i>item</i> anywhere in their filename
           from being installed.

       <i>file</i> ...
           Install these files (or directories) as examples into the
           first package acted on. (Or into all packages if <b>-A </b>is
           specified.)
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that <b>dh_installexamples </b>will happily copy entire directory
       hierarchies if you ask it to (similar to <b>cp -a</b>). If it is asked
       to install a directory, it will install the complete contents of
       the directory.
