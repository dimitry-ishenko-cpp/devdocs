NAME </h2>

       ln — link files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       ln <b>[</b>-fs<b>] [</b>-L|-P<b>] </b><i>source_file target_file</i>

       ln <b>[</b>-fs<b>] [</b>-L|-P<b>] </b><i>source_file</i>... <i>target_dir</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       In the first synopsis form, the <i>ln</i> utility shall create a new
       directory entry (link) at the destination path specified by the
       <i>target_file</i> operand. If the <b>-s </b>option is specified, a symbolic
       link shall be created for the file specified by the <i>source_file</i>
       operand. This first synopsis form shall be assumed when the final
       operand does not name an existing directory; if more than two
       operands are specified and the final is not an existing
       directory, an error shall result.

       In the second synopsis form, the <i>ln</i> utility shall create a new
       directory entry (link), or if the <b>-s </b>option is specified a
       symbolic link, for each file specified by a <i>source_file</i> operand,
       at a destination path in the existing directory named by
       <i>target_dir</i>.

       If the last operand specifies an existing file of a type not
       specified by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the
       behavior is implementation-defined.

       The corresponding destination path for each <i>source_file</i> shall be
       the concatenation of the target directory pathname, a &lt;slash&gt;
       character if the target directory pathname did not end in a
       &lt;slash&gt;, and the last pathname component of the <i>source_file</i>.  The
       second synopsis form shall be assumed when the final operand
       names an existing directory.

       For each <i>source_file</i>:

        1. If the destination path exists and was created by a previous
           step, it is unspecified whether <i>ln</i> shall write a diagnostic
           message to standard error, do nothing more with the current
           <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining <i>source_file</i>s; or will
           continue processing the current <i>source_file</i>.  If the
           destination path exists:

            a. If the <b>-f </b>option is not specified, <i>ln</i> shall write a
               diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more
               with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining
               <i>source_file</i>s.

            b. If the destination path names the same directory entry as
               the current <i>source_file ln</i> shall write a diagnostic
               message to standard error, do nothing more with the
               current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining
               <i>source_file</i>s<i>.</i>

            c. Actions shall be performed equivalent to the <i>unlink</i>()
               function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
               POSIX.1‐2017, called using the destination path as the
               <i>path</i> argument. If this fails for any reason, <i>ln</i> shall
               write a diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing
               more with the current <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any
               remaining <i>source_file</i>s.

        2. If the <b>-s </b>option is specified, actions shall be performed
           equivalent to the <i>symlink</i>() function with <i>source_file</i> as the
           <i>path1</i> argument and the destination path as the <i>path2</i>
           argument. The <i>ln</i> utility shall do nothing more with
           <i>source_file</i> and shall go on to any remaining files.

        3. If <i>source_file</i> is a symbolic link:

            a. If the <b>-P </b>option is in effect, actions shall be performed
               equivalent to the <i>linkat</i>() function with <i>source_file</i> as
               the <i>path1</i> argument, the destination path as the <i>path2</i>
               argument, AT_FDCWD as the <i>fd1</i> and <i>fd2</i> arguments, and zero
               as the <i>flag</i> argument.

            b. If the <b>-L </b>option is in effect, actions shall be performed
               equivalent to the <i>linkat</i>() function with <i>source_file</i> as
               the <i>path1</i> argument, the destination path as the <i>path2</i>
               argument, AT_FDCWD as the <i>fd1</i> and <i>fd2</i> arguments, and
               AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW as the <i>flag</i> argument.

           The <i>ln</i> utility shall do nothing more with <i>source_file</i> and
           shall go on to any remaining files.

        4. Actions shall be performed equivalent to the <i>link</i>() function
           defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 using
           <i>source_file</i> as the <i>path1</i> argument, and the destination path
           as the <i>path2</i> argument.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>ln</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-f        </b>Force existing destination pathnames to be removed to
                 allow the link.

       <b>-L        </b>For each <i>source_file</i> operand that names a file of type
                 symbolic link, create a (hard) link to the file
                 referenced by the symbolic link.

       <b>-P        </b>For each <i>source_file</i> operand that names a file of type
                 symbolic link, create a (hard) link to the symbolic
                 link itself.

       <b>-s        </b>Create symbolic links instead of hard links. If the <b>-s</b>
                 option is specified, the <b>-L </b>and <b>-P </b>options shall be
                 silently ignored.

       Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <b>-L </b>and
       <b>-P </b>shall not be considered an error. The last option specified
       shall determine the behavior of the utility (unless the <b>-s </b>option
       causes it to be ignored).

       If the <b>-s </b>option is not specified and neither a <b>-L </b>nor a <b>-P</b>
       option is specified, it is implementation-defined which of the <b>-L</b>
       and <b>-P </b>options will be used as the default.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>source_file</i>
                 A pathname of a file to be linked. If the <b>-s </b>option is
                 specified, no restrictions on the type of file or on
                 its existence shall be made. If the <b>-s </b>option is not
                 specified, whether a directory can be linked is
                 implementation-defined.

       <i>target_file</i>
                 The pathname of the new directory entry to be created.

       <i>target_dir</i>
                 A pathname of an existing directory in which the new
                 directory entries are created.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>ln</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section does not require <i>ln</i> <b>-f </b><i>a b</i> to
       remove <i>b</i> if a subsequent link operation would fail.

       Some historic versions of <i>ln</i> (including the one specified by the
       SVID) unlink the destination file, if it exists, by default. If
       the mode does not permit writing, these versions prompt for
       confirmation before attempting the unlink. In these versions the
       <b>-f </b>option causes <i>ln</i> not to attempt to prompt for confirmation.

       This allows <i>ln</i> to succeed in creating links when the target file
       already exists, even if the file itself is not writable (although
       the directory must be).  Early proposals specified this
       functionality.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not allow the <i>ln</i> utility to
       unlink existing destination paths by default for the following
       reasons:

        *  The <i>ln</i> utility has historically been used to provide locking
           for shell applications, a usage that is incompatible with <i>ln</i>
           unlinking the destination path by default. There was no
           corresponding technical advantage to adding this
           functionality.

        *  This functionality gave <i>ln</i> the ability to destroy the link
           structure of files, which changes the historical behavior of
           <i>ln</i>.

        *  This functionality is easily replicated with a combination of
           <i>rm</i> and <i>ln</i>.

        *  It is not historical practice in many systems; BSD and BSD-
           derived systems do not support this behavior. Unfortunately,
           whichever behavior is selected can cause scripts written
           expecting the other behavior to fail.

        *  It is preferable that <i>ln</i> perform in the same manner as the
           <i>link</i>() function, which does not permit the target to exist
           already.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 retains the <b>-f </b>option to provide
       support for shell scripts depending on the SVID semantics. It
       seems likely that shell scripts would not be written to handle
       prompting by <i>ln</i> and would therefore have specified the <b>-f </b>option.

       The <b>-f </b>option is an undocumented feature of many historical
       versions of the <i>ln</i> utility, allowing linking to directories.
       These versions require modification.

       Early proposals of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 also required a <b>-i</b>
       option, which behaved like the <b>-i </b>options in <i>cp</i> and <i>mv</i>, prompting
       for confirmation before unlinking existing files. This was not
       historical practice for the <i>ln</i> utility and has been omitted.

       The <b>-L </b>and <b>-P </b>options allow for implementing both common
       behaviors of the <i>ln</i> utility. Earlier versions of this standard
       did not specify these options and required the behavior now
       described for the <b>-L </b>option. Many systems by default or as an
       alternative provided a non-conforming <i>ln</i> utility with the
       behavior now described for the <b>-P </b>option. Since applications
       could not rely on <i>ln</i> following links in practice, the <b>-L </b>and <b>-P</b>
       options were added to specify the desired behavior for the
       application.

       The <b>-L </b>and <b>-P </b>options are ignored when <b>-s </b>is specified in order
       to allow an alias to be created to alter the default behavior
       when creating hard links (for example, <i>alias ln</i>='<i>ln</i> <b>-L</b>').  They
       serve no purpose when <b>-s </b>is specified, since <i>source_file</i> is then
       just a string to be used as the contents of the created symbolic
       link and need not exist as a file.

       The specification ensures that <i>ln</i> <b>a a </b>with or without the <b>-f</b>
       option will not unlink the file <b>a</b>.  Earlier versions of this
       standard were unclear in this case.
