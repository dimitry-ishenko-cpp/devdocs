NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-checkout-index - Copy files from the index to the working
       tree
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git checkout-index</i> [-u] [-q] [-a] [-f] [-n] [--prefix=&lt;string&gt;]
                          [--stage=&lt;number&gt;|all]
                          [--temp]
                          [--ignore-skip-worktree-bits]
                          [-z] [--stdin]
                          [--] [&lt;file&gt;...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Copies all listed files from the index to the working directory
       (not overwriting existing files).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -u, --index
           update stat information for the checked out entries in the
           index file.

       -q, --quiet
           be quiet if files exist or are not in the index

       -f, --force
           forces overwrite of existing files

       -a, --all
           checks out all files in the index except for those with the
           skip-worktree bit set (see <b>--ignore-skip-worktree-bits</b>).
           Cannot be used together with explicit filenames.

       -n, --no-create
           Don’t checkout new files, only refresh files already checked
           out.

       --prefix=&lt;string&gt;
           When creating files, prepend &lt;string&gt; (usually a directory
           including a trailing /)

       --stage=&lt;number&gt;|all
           Instead of checking out unmerged entries, copy out the files
           from the named stage. &lt;number&gt; must be between 1 and 3. Note:
           --stage=all automatically implies --temp.

       --temp
           Instead of copying the files to the working directory, write
           the content to temporary files. The temporary name
           associations will be written to stdout.

       --ignore-skip-worktree-bits
           Check out all files, including those with the skip-worktree
           bit set.

       --stdin
           Instead of taking a list of paths from the command line, read
           the list of paths from the standard input. Paths are
           separated by LF (i.e. one path per line) by default.

       -z
           Only meaningful with <b>--stdin</b>; paths are separated with NUL
           character instead of LF.

       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       The order of the flags used to matter, but not anymore.

       Just doing <b>git checkout-index </b>does nothing. You probably meant
       <b>git checkout-index -a</b>. And if you want to force it, you want <b>git</b>
       <b>checkout-index -f -a</b>.

       Intuitiveness is not the goal here. Repeatability is. The reason
       for the "no arguments means no work" behavior is that from
       scripts you are supposed to be able to do:

           $ find . -name '*.h' -print0 | xargs -0 git checkout-index -f --

       which will force all existing <b>*.h </b>files to be replaced with their
       cached copies. If an empty command line implied "all", then this
       would force-refresh everything in the index, which was not the
       point. But since <i>git checkout-index</i> accepts --stdin it would be
       faster to use:

           $ find . -name '*.h' -print0 | git checkout-index -f -z --stdin

       The <b>-- </b>is just a good idea when you know the rest will be
       filenames; it will prevent problems with a filename of, for
       example, <b>-a</b>. Using <b>-- </b>is probably a good policy in scripts.
</pre> <h2>
USING --TEMP OR --STAGE=ALL </h2>
<pre>
       When <b>--temp </b>is used (or implied by <b>--stage=all</b>) <i>git</i>
       <i>checkout-index</i> will create a temporary file for each index entry
       being checked out. The index will not be updated with stat
       information. These options can be useful if the caller needs all
       stages of all unmerged entries so that the unmerged files can be
       processed by an external merge tool.

       A listing will be written to stdout providing the association of
       temporary file names to tracked path names. The listing format
       has two variations:

        1. tempname TAB path RS

           The first format is what gets used when <b>--stage </b>is omitted or
           is not <b>--stage=all</b>. The field tempname is the temporary file
           name holding the file content and path is the tracked path
           name in the index. Only the requested entries are output.

        2. stage1temp SP stage2temp SP stage3tmp TAB path RS

           The second format is what gets used when <b>--stage=all</b>. The
           three stage temporary fields (stage1temp, stage2temp,
           stage3temp) list the name of the temporary file if there is a
           stage entry in the index or <b>.  </b>if there is no stage entry.
           Paths which only have a stage 0 entry will always be omitted
           from the output.

       In both formats RS (the record separator) is newline by default
       but will be the null byte if -z was passed on the command line.
       The temporary file names are always safe strings; they will never
       contain directory separators or whitespace characters. The path
       field is always relative to the current directory and the
       temporary file names are always relative to the top level
       directory.

       If the object being copied out to a temporary file is a symbolic
       link the content of the link will be written to a normal file. It
       is up to the end-user or the Porcelain to make use of this
       information.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To update and refresh only the files already checked out

               $ git checkout-index -n -f -a &amp;&amp; git update-index --ignore-missing --refresh

       Using <i>git checkout-index</i> to "export an entire tree"
           The prefix ability basically makes it trivial to use <i>git</i>
           <i>checkout-index</i> as an "export as tree" function. Just read the
           desired tree into the index, and do:

               $ git checkout-index --prefix=git-export-dir/ -a

           <b>git checkout-index </b>will "export" the index into the specified
           directory.

           The final "/" is important. The exported name is literally
           just prefixed with the specified string. Contrast this with
           the following example.

       Export files with a prefix

               $ git checkout-index --prefix=.merged- Makefile

           This will check out the currently cached copy of <b>Makefile</b>
           into the file <b>.merged-Makefile</b>.
