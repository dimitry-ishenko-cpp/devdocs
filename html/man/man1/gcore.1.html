NAME </h2>
<pre>
       gcore - Generate a core file of a running program
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       gcore [-a] [-o <i>prefix</i>] <i>pid1</i> [<i>pid2</i>...<i>pidN</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Generate core dumps of one or more running programs with process
       IDs <i>pid1</i>, <i>pid2</i>, etc.  A core file produced by <b>gcore </b>is equivalent
       to one produced by the kernel when the process crashes (and when
       "ulimit -c" was used to set up an appropriate core dump limit).
       However, unlike after a crash, after <b>gcore </b>finishes its job the
       program remains running without any change.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a  </b>Dump all memory mappings.  The actual effect of this option
           depends on the Operating System.  On GNU/Linux, it will
           disable "use-coredump-filter" and enable
           "dump-excluded-mappings".

       <b>-o </b><i>prefix</i>
           The optional argument <i>prefix</i> specifies the prefix to be used
           when composing the file names of the core dumps.  The file
           name is composed as <i>prefix.pid</i>, where <i>pid</i> is the process ID
           of the running program being analyzed by <b>gcore</b>.  If not
           specified, <i>prefix</i> defaults to <i>gcore</i>.

SEE ALSO </h2>
<pre>
       The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
       If the "info" and "gdb" programs and GDB's Texinfo documentation
       are properly installed at your site, the command

               info gdb

       should give you access to the complete manual.
