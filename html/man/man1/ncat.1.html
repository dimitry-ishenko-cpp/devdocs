       ncat - Concatenate and redirect sockets
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>ncat </b>[<i>OPTIONS</i>...] [<i>hostname</i>] [<i>port</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and
       writes data across networks from the command line. Ncat was
       written for the Nmap Project and is the culmination of the
       currently splintered family of Netcat incarnations. It is
       designed to be a reliable back-end tool to instantly provide
       network connectivity to other applications and users. Ncat will
       not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a
       virtually limitless number of potential uses.

       Among Ncat's vast number of features there is the ability to
       chain Ncats together; redirection of TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports to
       other sites; SSL support; and proxy connections via SOCKS4,
       SOCKS5 or HTTP proxies (with optional proxy authentication as
       well). Some general principles apply to most applications and
       thus give you the capability of instantly adding networking
       support to software that would normally never support it.

</pre> <h2>
CONNECT MODE AND LISTEN MODE </h2>
<pre>
       Ncat operates in one of two primary modes: connect mode and
       listen mode. Other modes, such as the HTTP proxy server, act as
       special cases of these two. In connect mode, Ncat works as a
       client. In listen mode it is a server.

       In connect mode, the <i>hostname</i> and <i>port</i> arguments tell what to
       connect to.  <i>hostname</i> is required, and may be a hostname or IP
       address. If <i>port</i> is supplied, it must be a decimal port number.
       If omitted, it defaults to 31337.

       In listen mode, <i>hostname</i> and <i>port</i> control the address the server
       will bind to. Both arguments are optional in listen mode. If
       <i>hostname</i> is omitted, it defaults to listening on all available
       addresses over IPv4 and IPv6. If <i>port</i> is omitted, it defaults to
       31337.
</pre> <h2>
PROTOCOL OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-4 </b>(IPv4 only)
           Force the use of IPv4 only.

       <b>-6 </b>(IPv6 only)
           Force the use of IPv6 only.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--unixsock </b>(Use Unix domain sockets)
           Use Unix domain sockets rather than network sockets. This
           option may be used on its own for stream sockets, or combined
           with <b>--udp </b>for datagram sockets. A description of <b>-U </b>mode is
           in the section called “UNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS”.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--udp </b>(Use UDP)
           Use UDP for the connection (the default is TCP).

       <b>--sctp </b>(Use SCTP)
           Use SCTP for the connection (the default is TCP). SCTP
           support is implemented in TCP-compatible mode.

       <b>--vsock </b>(Use AF_VSOCK sockets)
           Use AF_VSOCK sockets rather than the default TCP sockets
           (Linux only). This option may be used on its own for stream
           sockets or combined with <b>--udp </b>for datagram sockets. A
           description of <b>--vsock </b>mode is in the section called
           “AF_VSOCK SOCKETS”.
</pre> <h2>
CONNECT MODE OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-g </b><i>hop1</i><b>[,</b><i>hop2</i>,...] (Loose source routing)
           Sets hops for IPv4 loose source routing. You can use <b>-g </b>once
           with a comma-separated list of hops, use <b>-g </b>multiple times
           with single hops to build the list, or combine the two. Hops
           can be given as IP addresses or hostnames.

       <b>-G </b><i>ptr</i> (Set source routing pointer)
           Sets the IPv4 source route “pointer” for use with <b>-g</b>. The
           argument must be a multiple of 4 and no more than 28. Not all
           operating systems support setting this pointer to anything
           other than four.

       <b>-p </b><i>port</i>, <b>--source-port </b><i>port</i> (Specify source port)
           Set the port number for Ncat to bind to.

       <b>-s </b><i>host</i>, <b>--source </b><i>host</i> (Specify source address)
           Set the address for Ncat to bind to.
</pre> <h2>
LISTEN MODE OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       See the section called “ACCESS CONTROL OPTIONS” for information
       on limiting the hosts that may connect to the listening Ncat
       process.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--listen </b>(Listen for connections)
           Listen for connections rather than connecting to a remote
           machine

       <b>-m </b><i>numconns</i>, <b>--max-conns </b><i>numconns</i> (Specify maximum number of
       connections)
           The maximum number of simultaneous connections accepted by an
           Ncat instance. 100 is the default (60 on Windows).

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-open </b>(Accept multiple connections)
           Normally a listening server accepts only one connection and
           then quits when the connection is closed. This option makes
           it accept multiple simultaneous connections and wait for more
           connections after they have all been closed. It must be
           combined with <b>--listen</b>. In this mode there is no way for Ncat
           to know when its network input is finished, so it will keep
           running until interrupted. This also means that it will never
           close its output stream, so any program reading from Ncat and
           looking for end-of-file will also hang.

       <b>--broker </b>(Connection brokering)
           Allow multiple parties to connect to a centralised Ncat
           server and communicate with each other. Ncat can broker
           communication between systems that are behind a NAT or
           otherwise unable to directly connect. This option is used in
           conjunction with <b>--listen</b>, which causes the <b>--listen </b>port to
           have broker mode enabled.

       <b>--chat </b>(Ad-hoc “chat server”)
           The <b>--chat </b>option enables chat mode, intended for the
           exchange of text between several users. In chat mode,
           connection brokering is turned on. Ncat prefixes each message
           received with an ID before relaying it to the other
           connections. The ID is unique for each connected client. This
           helps distinguish who sent what. Additionally, non-printing
           characters such as control characters are escaped to keep
           them from doing damage to a terminal.
</pre> <h2>
SSL OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--ssl </b>(Use SSL)
           In connect mode, this option transparently negotiates an SSL
           session with an SSL server to securely encrypt the
           connection. This is particularly handy for talking to SSL
           enabled HTTP servers, etc.

           In server mode, this option listens for incoming SSL
           connections, rather than plain untunneled traffic.

           In UDP mode, this option enables Datagram TLS (DTLS).

       <b>--ssl-verify </b>(Verify server certificates)
           In client mode, <b>--ssl-verify </b>is like <b>--ssl </b>except that it
           also requires verification of the server certificate. Ncat
           comes with a default set of trusted certificates in the file
           ca-bundle.crt.  Some operating systems provide a default list
           of trusted certificates; these will also be used if
           available. Use <b>--ssl-trustfile </b>to give a custom list. Use <b>-v</b>
           one or more times to get details about verification failures.
           Ncat does not check for revoked certificates.

           This option has no effect in server mode.

       <b>--ssl-cert </b><i>certfile.pem</i> (Specify SSL certificate)
           This option gives the location of a PEM-encoded certificate
           files used to authenticate the server (in listen mode) or the
           client (in connect mode). Use it in combination with
           <b>--ssl-key</b>.

       <b>--ssl-key </b><i>keyfile.pem</i> (Specify SSL private key)
           This option gives the location of the PEM-encoded private key
           file that goes with the certificate named with <b>--ssl-cert</b>.

       <b>--ssl-trustfile </b><i>cert.pem</i> (List trusted certificates)
           This option sets a list of certificates that are trusted for
           purposes of certificate verification. It has no effect unless
           combined with <b>--ssl-verify</b>. The argument to this option is
           the name of a PEM file containing trusted certificates.
           Typically, the file will contain certificates of
           certification authorities, though it may also contain server
           certificates directly. When this option is used, Ncat does
           not use its default certificates.

       <b>--ssl-ciphers </b><i>cipherlist</i> (Specify SSL ciphersuites)
           This option sets the list of ciphersuites that Ncat will use
           when connecting to servers or when accepting SSL connections
           from clients. The syntax is described in the OpenSSL
           ciphers(1) man page, and defaults to
           ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!EXP:!RC4:!MD5:@STRENGTH

       <b>--ssl-servername </b><i>name</i> (Request distinct server name)
           In client mode, this option sets the TLS SNI (Server Name
           Indication) extension, which tells the server the name of the
           logical server Ncat is contacting. This is important when the
           target server hosts multiple virtual servers at a single
           underlying network address. If the option is not provided,
           the TLS SNI extension will be populated with the target
           server hostname.

       <b>--ssl-alpn </b><i>ALPN list</i> (Specify ALPN protocol list)
           This option allows you to specify a comma-separated list of
           protocols to send via the Application-Layer Protocol
           Negotiation (ALPN) TLS extension. Not supported by all
           versions of OpenSSL.
</pre> <h2>
PROXY OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--proxy </b><i>host</i><b>[:</b><i>port</i>] (Specify proxy address)
           Requests proxying through <i>host</i>:<i>port</i>, using the protocol
           specified by <b>--proxy-type</b>.

           If no port is specified, the proxy protocol's well-known port
           is used (1080 for SOCKS and 3128 for HTTP). When specifying
           an IPv6 HTTP proxy server using the IP address rather than
           the hostname, the square-bracket notation (for example
           [2001:db8::1]:8080) MUST be used to separate the port from
           the IPv6 address. If the proxy requires authentication, use
           <b>--proxy-auth</b>.

       <b>--proxy-type </b><i>proto</i> (Specify proxy protocol)
           In connect mode, this option requests the protocol <i>proto</i> to
           connect through the proxy host specified by <b>--proxy</b>. In
           listen mode, this option has Ncat act as a proxy server using
           the specified protocol.

           The currently available protocols in connect mode are http
           (CONNECT), socks4 (SOCKSv4), and socks5 (SOCKSv5). The only
           server currently supported is http. If this option is not
           used, the default protocol is http.

       <b>--proxy-auth </b><i>user</i><b>[:</b><i>pass</i>] (Specify proxy credentials)
           In connect mode, gives the credentials that will be used to
           connect to the proxy server. In listen mode, gives the
           credentials that will be required of connecting clients. For
           use with <b>--proxy-type http </b>or <b>--proxy-type socks5</b>, the form
           should be username:password. For <b>--proxy-type socks4</b>, it
           should be a username only.

           These credentials can be alternatively passed onto Ncat by
           setting environment variable <b>NCAT_PROXY_AUTH</b>, which reduces
           the risk of the credentials being captured in process logs.
           (Option <b>--proxy-auth </b>takes precedence.)

       <b>--proxy-dns </b><i>type</i> (Specify where to resolve proxy destination)
           In connect mode, it provides control over whether proxy
           destination hostnames are resolved by the remote proxy server
           or locally, by Ncat itself. Possible values for <i>type</i> are:

           local - Hostnames are resolved locally on the Ncat host. Ncat
           exits with error if the hostname cannot be resolved.

           remote - Hostnames are passed directly onto the remote proxy
           server. This is the default behavior.

           both - Hostname resolution is first attempted on the Ncat
           host. Unresolvable hostnames are passed onto the remote proxy
           server.

           none - Hostname resolution is completely disabled. Only a
           literal IPv4 or IPv6 address can be used as the proxy
           destination.

           Local hostname resolution generally respects IP version
           specified with options <b>-4 </b>or <b>-6</b>, except for SOCKS4, which is
           incompatible with IPv6.
</pre> <h2>
COMMAND EXECUTION OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-e </b><i>command</i>, <b>--exec </b><i>command</i> (Execute command)
           Execute the specified command after a connection has been
           established. The command must be specified as a full
           pathname. All input from the remote client will be sent to
           the application and responses sent back to the remote client
           over the socket, thus making your command-line application
           interactive over a socket. Combined with <b>--keep-open</b>, Ncat
           will handle multiple simultaneous connections to your
           specified port/application like inetd. Ncat will only accept
           a maximum, definable, number of simultaneous connections
           controlled by the <b>-m </b>option. By default this is set to 100
           (60 on Windows).

       <b>-c </b><i>command</i>, <b>--sh-exec </b><i>command</i> (Execute command via sh)
           Same as <b>-e</b>, except it tries to execute the command via
           /bin/sh. This means you don't have to specify the full path
           for the command, and shell facilities like environment
           variables are available.

       <b>--lua-exec </b><i>file</i> (Execute a .lua script)
           Runs the specified file as a Lua script after a connection
           has been established, using a built-in interpreter. Both the
           script's standard input and the standard output are
           redirected to the connection data streams.

       All exec options add the following variables to the child's
       environment:

       <b>NCAT_REMOTE_ADDR</b>, <b>NCAT_REMOTE_PORT</b>
           The IP address and port number of the remote host. In connect
           mode, it's the target's address; in listen mode, it's the
           client's address.

       <b>NCAT_LOCAL_ADDR</b>, <b>NCAT_LOCAL_PORT</b>
           The IP address and port number of the local end of the
           connection.

       <b>NCAT_PROTO</b>
           The protocol in use: one of TCP, UDP, and SCTP.
</pre> <h2>
ACCESS CONTROL OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--allow </b><i>host</i><b>[,</b><i>host</i>,...] (Allow connections)
           The list of hosts specified will be the only hosts allowed to
           connect to the Ncat process. All other connection attempts
           will be disconnected. In case of a conflict between <b>--allow</b>
           and <b>--deny</b>, <b>--allow </b>takes precedence. Host specifications
           follow the same syntax used by Nmap.

       <b>--allowfile </b><i>file</i> (Allow connections from file)
           This has the same functionality as <b>--allow</b>, except that the
           allowed hosts are provided in a new-line delimited allow
           file, rather than directly on the command line.

       <b>--deny </b><i>host</i><b>[,</b><i>host</i>,...] (Deny connections)
           Issue Ncat with a list of hosts that will not be allowed to
           connect to the listening Ncat process. Specified hosts will
           have their session silently terminated if they try to
           connect. In case of a conflict between <b>--allow </b>and <b>--deny</b>,
           <b>--allow </b>takes precedence. Host specifications follow the same
           syntax used by Nmap.

       <b>--denyfile </b><i>file</i> (Deny connections from file)
           This is the same functionality as <b>--deny</b>, except that
           excluded hosts are provided in a new-line delimited deny
           file, rather than directly on the command line.
</pre> <h2>
TIMING OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       These options accept a time parameter. This is specified in
       seconds by default, though you can append ms, s, m, or h to the
       value to specify milliseconds, seconds, minutes, or hours.

       <b>-d </b><i>time</i>, <b>--delay </b><i>time</i> (Specify line delay)
           Set the delay interval for lines sent. This effectively
           limits the number of lines that Ncat will send in the
           specified period. This may be useful for low-bandwidth sites,
           or have other uses such as coping with annoying <b>iptables</b>
           <b>--limit </b>options.

       <b>-i </b><i>time</i>, <b>--idle-timeout </b><i>time</i> (Specify idle timeout)
           Set a fixed timeout for idle connections. If the idle timeout
           is reached, the connection is terminated.

       <b>-w </b><i>time</i>, <b>--wait </b><i>time</i> (Specify connect timeout)
           Set a fixed timeout for connection attempts.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-o </b><i>file</i>, <b>--output </b><i>file</i> (Save session data)
           Dump session data to a file

       <b>-x </b><i>file</i>, <b>--hex-dump </b><i>file</i> (Save session data in hex)
           Dump session data in hex to a file.

       <b>--append-output </b>(Append output)
           Issue Ncat with <b>--append-ouput </b>along with <b>-o </b>and/or <b>-x </b>and it
           will append the resulted output rather than truncating the
           specified output files.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose </b>(Be verbose)
           Issue Ncat with <b>-v </b>and it will be verbose and display all
           kinds of useful connection based information. Use more than
           once (<b>-vv</b>, <b>-vvv</b>...) for greater verbosity.
</pre> <h2>
MISC OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-C</b>, <b>--crlf </b>(Use CRLF as EOL)
           This option tells Ncat to convert LF line endings to CRLF
           when taking input from standard input.  This is useful for
           talking to some stringent servers directly from a terminal in
           one of the many common plain-text protocols that use CRLF for
           end-of-line.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help </b>(Help screen)
           Displays a short help screen with common options and
           parameters, and then exits.

       <b>--recv-only </b>(Only receive data)
           If this option is passed, Ncat will only receive data and
           will not try to send anything.

       <b>--send-only </b>(Only send data)
           If this option is passed, then Ncat will only send data and
           will ignore anything received. This option also causes Ncat
           to close the network connection and terminate after EOF is
           received on standard input.

       <b>--no-shutdown </b>(Do not shutdown into half-duplex mode)
           If this option is passed, Ncat will not invoke shutdown on a
           socket after seeing EOF on stdin. This is provided for
           backward-compatibility with OpenBSD netcat, which exhibits
           this behavior when executed with its '-d' option.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nodns </b>(Do not resolve hostnames)
           Completely disable hostname resolution across all Ncat
           options, such as the destination, source address, source
           routing hops, and the proxy. All addresses must be specified
           numerically. (Note that resolution of proxy destinations is
           controlled separately via option <b>--proxy-dns</b>.)

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--telnet </b>(Answer Telnet negotiations)
           Handle DO/DONT WILL/WONT Telnet negotiations. This makes it
           possible to script Telnet sessions with Ncat.

       <b>--version </b>(Display version)
           Displays the Ncat version number and exits.
</pre> <h2>
UNIX DOMAIN SOCKETS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-U </b>option (same as <b>--unixsock</b>) causes Ncat to use Unix domain
       sockets rather than network sockets. Unix domain sockets exist as
       an entry in the filesystem. You must give the name of a socket to
       connect to or to listen on. For example, to make a connection,

       <b>ncat -U ~/unixsock</b>

       To listen on a socket:

       <b>ncat -l -U ~/unixsock</b>

       Listen mode will create the socket if it doesn't exist. The
       socket will continue to exist after the program ends.

       Both stream and datagram domain sockets are supported. Use <b>-U </b>on
       its own for stream sockets, or combine it with <b>--udp </b>for datagram
       sockets. Datagram sockets require a source socket to connect
       from. By default, a source socket with a random filename will be
       created as needed, and deleted when the program ends. Use the
       <b>--source </b>with a path to use a source socket with a specific name.
</pre> <h2>
AF_VSOCK SOCKETS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>--vsock </b>option causes Ncat to use AF_VSOCK sockets rather
       than network sockets. A CID must be given instead of a hostname
       or IP address. For example, to make a connection to the host,

       <b>ncat --vsock 2 1234</b>

       To listen on a socket:

       <b>ncat -l --vsock 1234</b>

       Both stream and datagram domain sockets are supported, but socket
       type availability depends on the hypervisor. Use <b>--vsock </b>on its
       own for stream sockets, or combine it with <b>--udp </b>for datagram
       sockets.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Connect to example.org on TCP port 8080.
           <b>ncat example.org 8080</b>

       Listen for connections on TCP port 8080.
           <b>ncat -l 8080</b>

       Redirect TCP port 8080 on the local machine to host on port 80.
           <b>ncat --sh-exec "ncat example.org 80" -l 8080 --keep-open</b>

       Bind to TCP port 8081 and attach /bin/bash for the world to
       access freely.
           <b>ncat --exec "/bin/bash" -l 8081 --keep-open</b>

       Bind a shell to TCP port 8081, limit access to hosts on a local
       network, and limit the maximum number of simultaneous connections
       to 3.
           <b>ncat --exec "/bin/bash" --max-conns 3 --allow 192.168.0.0/24</b>
           <b>-l 8081 --keep-open</b>

       Connect to smtphost:25 through a SOCKS4 server on port 1080.
           <b>ncat --proxy socks4host --proxy-type socks4 --proxy-auth joe</b>
           <b>smtphost 25</b>

       Connect to smtphost:25 through a SOCKS5 server on port 1080.
           <b>ncat --proxy socks5host --proxy-type socks5 --proxy-auth</b>
           <b>joe:secret smtphost 25</b>

       Create an HTTP proxy server on localhost port 8888.
           <b>ncat -l --proxy-type http localhost 8888</b>

       Send a file over TCP port 9899 from host2 (client) to host1
       (server).
           HOST1$ <b>ncat -l 9899 &gt; outputfile</b>

           HOST2$ <b>ncat HOST1 9899 &lt; inputfile</b>

       Transfer in the other direction, turning Ncat into a “one file”
       server.
           HOST1$ <b>ncat -l 9899 &lt; inputfile</b>

           HOST2$ <b>ncat HOST1 9899 &gt; outputfile</b>
</pre> <h2>
EXIT CODE </h2>
<pre>
       The exit code reflects whether a connection was made and
       completed successfully. 0 means there was no error. 1 means there
       was a network error of some kind, for example “Connection
       refused” or “Connection reset”. 2 is reserved for all other
       errors, like an invalid option or a nonexistent file.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Like its authors, Ncat isn't perfect. But you can help make it
       better by sending bug reports or even writing patches. If Ncat
       doesn't behave the way you expect, first upgrade to the latest
       version available from <b><a href="https://nmap.org">https://nmap.org</a> </b>. If the problem persists,
       do some research to determine whether it has already been
       discovered and addressed. Try Googling the error message or
       browsing the nmap-dev archives at <b><a href="https://seclists.org/">https://seclists.org/</a> </b>.

       Read this full manual page as well. If nothing comes of this,
       mail a bug report to &lt;dev@nmap.org&gt;. Please include everything
       you have learned about the problem, as well as what version of
       Ncat you are running and what operating system version it is
       running on. Problem reports and Ncat usage questions sent to
       dev@nmap.org are far more likely to be answered than those sent
       to Fyodor directly.

       Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports. Basic
       instructions for creating patch files with your changes are
       available at <b><a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING</a> </b>. Patches may be
       sent to nmap-dev (recommended) or to Fyodor directly.

       falling under the same license as Ncat itself (discussed
       previously).

   <b>Source Code Availability and Community Contributions</b>
       Source is provided to this software because we believe users have
       a right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they
       run it. This also allows you to audit the software for security
       holes (none have been found so far).

       Source code also allows you to port Nmap (which includes Ncat) to
       new platforms, fix bugs, and add new features. You are highly
       encouraged to send your changes to &lt;dev@nmap.org&gt; for possible
       incorporation into the main distribution. By sending these
       changes to Fyodor or one of the Insecure.Org development mailing
       lists, it is assumed that you are offering the Nmap Project (Nmap
       Software LLC) the unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse,
       modify, and relicense the code. Nmap will always be available
       open source, but this is important because the inability to
       relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free
       Software projects (such as KDE and NASM). We also occasionally
       relicense the code to third parties as discussed in the Nmap man
       page. If you wish to specify special license conditions of your
       contributions, just say so when you send them.

   <b>Inappropriate Usage</b>
       Ncat should never be installed with special privileges (e.g. suid
       root).  That would open up a major security vulnerability as
       other users on the system (or attackers) could use it for
       privilege escalation.

   <b>Third-Party Software</b>
       This product includes software developed by the <b>Apache Software</b>
       <b>Foundation</b>[2]. A modified version of the <b>Libpcap portable packet</b>
       <b>capture library</b>[3] is distributed along with Ncat. The Windows
       version of Ncat utilized the Libpcap-derived <b>Npcap library</b>[4]
       instead. Certain raw networking functions use the <b>Libdnet</b>[5]
       networking library, which was written by Dug Song.  A modified
       version is distributed with Ncat. Ncat can optionally link with
       the <b>OpenSSL cryptography toolkit</b>[6] for SSL version detection
       support. All of the third-party software described in this
       paragraph is freely redistributable under BSD-style software
       licenses.
