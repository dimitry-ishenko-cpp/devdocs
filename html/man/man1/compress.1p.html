PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       compress — compress data
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       compress <b>[</b>-fv<b>] [</b>-b <i>bits</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>

       compress <b>[</b>-cfv<b>] [</b>-b <i>bits</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>compress</i> utility shall attempt to reduce the size of the
       named files by using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding algorithm.

       <b>Note:  </b>Lempel-Ziv is US Patent 4464650, issued to William
              Eastman, Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, Martin Cohn on August
              7th, 1984, and assigned to Sperry Corporation.

                 Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression is covered by US Patent
                 4558302, issued to Terry A. Welch on December 10th,
                 1985, and assigned to Sperry Corporation.

       On systems not supporting adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding algorithm,
       the input files shall not be changed and an error value greater
       than two shall be returned. Except when the output is to the
       standard output, each file shall be replaced by one with the
       extension <b>.Z</b>.  If the invoking process has appropriate
       privileges, the ownership, modes, access time, and modification
       time of the original file are preserved. If appending the <b>.Z </b>to
       the filename would make the name exceed {NAME_MAX} bytes, the
       command shall fail. If no files are specified, the standard input
       shall be compressed to the standard output.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>compress</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-b </b><i>bits</i>   Specify the maximum number of bits to use in a code.
                 For a conforming application, the <i>bits</i> argument shall
                 be:

                     9 &lt;= <i>bits</i> &lt;= 14

                 The implementation may allow <i>bits</i> values of greater
                 than 14. The default is 14, 15, or 16.

       <b>-c        </b>Cause <i>compress</i> to write to the standard output; the
                 input file is not changed, and no <b>.Z </b>files are created.

       <b>-f        </b>Force compression of <i>file</i>, even if it does not actually
                 reduce the size of the file, or if the corresponding
                 <i>file</i><b>.Z </b>file already exists. If the <b>-f </b>option is not
                 given, and the process is not running in the
                 background, the user is prompted as to whether an
                 existing <i>file</i><b>.Z </b>file should be overwritten. If the
                 response is affirmative, the existing file will be
                 overwritten.

       <b>-v        </b>Write the percentage reduction of each file to standard
                 error.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file to be compressed.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <i>file</i> operands are
       specified, or if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-'</b>.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>file</i> operands are specified, the input files contain the data
       to be compressed.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>compress</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                 elements used in the extended regular expression
                 defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale keyword in the
                 <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments), the behavior of character
                 classes used in the extended regular expression defined
                 for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale keyword in the <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 category.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale used to process affirmative
                 responses, and the locale used to affect the format and
                 contents of diagnostic messages, prompts, and the
                 output from the <b>-v </b>option written to standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, or if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-'</b>,
       or if the <b>-c </b>option is specified, the standard output contains
       the compressed output.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic and prompt
       messages and the output from <b>-v</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The output files shall contain the compressed output. The format
       of compressed files is unspecified and interchange of such files
       between implementations (including access via unspecified file
       sharing mechanisms) is not required by POSIX.1‐2008.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

        1    An error occurred.

        2    One or more files were not compressed because they would
             have increased in size (and the <b>-f </b>option was not
             specified).

       &gt;2    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The input file shall remain unmodified.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the
       input, the number of <i>bits</i> per code, and the distribution of
       common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English
       is reduced by 50‐60%. Compression is generally much better than
       that achieved by Huffman coding or adaptive Huffman coding
       (<i>compact</i>), and takes less time to compute.

       Although <i>compress</i> strictly follows the default actions upon
       receipt of a signal or when an error occurs, some unexpected
       results may occur. In some implementations it is likely that a
       partially compressed file is left in place, alongside its
       uncompressed input file. Since the general operation of <i>compress</i>
       is to delete the uncompressed file only after the <b>.Z </b>file has
       been successfully filled, an application should always carefully
       check the exit status of <i>compress</i> before arbitrarily deleting
       files that have like-named neighbors with <b>.Z </b>suffixes.

       The limit of 14 on the <i>bits</i> option-argument is to achieve
       portability to all systems (within the restrictions imposed by
       the lack of an explicit published file format). Some
       implementations based on 16-bit architectures cannot support 15
       or 16-bit uncompression.
