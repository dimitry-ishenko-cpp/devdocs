       cp <b>[</b>-Pfip<b>] </b><i>source_file target_file</i>

       cp <b>[</b>-Pfip<b>] </b><i>source_file</i>... <i>target</i>

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The first synopsis form is denoted by two operands, neither of
       which are existing files of type directory. The <i>cp</i> utility shall
       copy the contents of <i>source_file</i> (or, if <i>source_file</i> is a file of
       type symbolic link, the contents of the file referenced by
       <i>source_file</i>) to the destination path named by <i>target_file.</i>

       The second synopsis form is denoted by two or more operands where
       the <b>-R </b>option is not specified and the first synopsis form is not
       applicable. It shall be an error if any <i>source_file</i> is a file of
       type directory, if <i>target</i> does not exist, or if <i>target</i> does not
       name a directory. The <i>cp</i> utility shall copy the contents of each
       <i>source_file</i> (or, if <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link,
       the contents of the file referenced by <i>source_file</i>) to the
       destination path named by the concatenation of <i>target</i>, a single
       &lt;slash&gt; character if <i>target</i> did not end in a &lt;slash&gt;, and the
       last component of <i>source_file</i>.

       The third synopsis form is denoted by two or more operands where
       the <b>-R </b>option is specified. The <i>cp</i> utility shall copy each file
       in the file hierarchy rooted in each <i>source_file</i> to a destination
       path named as follows:

        *  If <i>target</i> exists and names an existing directory, the name of
           the corresponding destination path for each file in the file
           hierarchy shall be the concatenation of <i>target</i>, a single
           &lt;slash&gt; character if <i>target</i> did not end in a &lt;slash&gt;, and the
           pathname of the file relative to the directory containing
           <i>source_file</i>.

        *  If <i>target</i> does not exist and two operands are specified, the
           name of the corresponding destination path for <i>source_file</i>
           shall be <i>target</i>; the name of the corresponding destination
           path for all other files in the file hierarchy shall be the
           concatenation of <i>target</i>, a &lt;slash&gt; character, and the
           pathname of the file relative to <i>source_file</i>.

       It shall be an error if <i>target</i> does not exist and more than two
       operands are specified, or if <i>target</i> exists and does not name a
       directory.

       In the following description, the term <i>dest_file</i> refers to the
       file named by the destination path. The term <i>source_file</i> refers
       to the file that is being copied, whether specified as an operand
       or a file in a file hierarchy rooted in a <i>source_file</i> operand. If
       <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link:

        *  If the <b>-R </b>option was not specified, <i>cp</i> shall take actions
           based on the type and contents of the file referenced by the
           symbolic link, and not by the symbolic link itself, unless
           the <b>-P </b>option was specified.

        *  If the <b>-R </b>option was specified:

           --  If none of the options <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, nor <b>-P </b>were specified, it
               is unspecified which of <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, or <b>-P </b>will be used as a
               default.

           --  If the <b>-H </b>option was specified, <i>cp</i> shall take actions
               based on the type and contents of the file referenced by
               any symbolic link specified as a <i>source_file</i> operand.

           --  If the <b>-L </b>option was specified, <i>cp</i> shall take actions
               based on the type and contents of the file referenced by
               any symbolic link specified as a <i>source_file</i> operand or
               any symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file
               hierarchy.

           --  If the <b>-P </b>option was specified, <i>cp</i> shall copy any
               symbolic link specified as a <i>source_file</i> operand and any
               symbolic links encountered during traversal of a file
               hierarchy, and shall not follow any symbolic links.

       For each <i>source_file</i>, the following steps shall be taken:

        1. If <i>source_file</i> references the same file as <i>dest_file</i>, <i>cp</i> may
           write a diagnostic message to standard error; it shall do
           nothing more with <i>source_file</i> and shall go on to any
           remaining files.

        2. If <i>source_file</i> is of type directory, the following steps
           shall be taken:

            a. If the <b>-R </b>option was not specified, <i>cp</i> shall write a
               diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more
               with <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining files.

            b. If <i>source_file</i> was not specified as an operand and
               <i>source_file</i> is dot or dot-dot, <i>cp</i> shall do nothing more
               with <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining files.

            c. If <i>dest_file</i> exists and it is a file type not specified
               by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the
               behavior is implementation-defined.

            d. If <i>dest_file</i> exists and it is not of type directory, <i>cp</i>
               shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
               nothing more with <i>source_file</i> or any files below
               <i>source_file</i> in the file hierarchy, and go on to any
               remaining files.

            e. If the directory <i>dest_file</i> does not exist, it shall be
               created with file permission bits set to the same value
               as those of <i>source_file</i>, modified by the file creation
               mask of the user if the <b>-p </b>option was not specified, and
               then bitwise-inclusively OR'ed with S_IRWXU. If <i>dest_file</i>
               cannot be created, <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic message to
               standard error, do nothing more with <i>source_file</i>, and go
               on to any remaining files. It is unspecified if <i>cp</i>
               attempts to copy files in the file hierarchy rooted in
               <i>source_file</i>.

            f. The files in the directory <i>source_file</i> shall be copied to
               the directory <i>dest_file</i>, taking the four steps (1 to 4)
               listed here with the files as <i>source_file</i>s.

            g. If <i>dest_file</i> was created, its file permission bits shall
               be changed (if necessary) to be the same as those of
               <i>source_file</i>, modified by the file creation mask of the
               user if the <b>-p </b>option was not specified.

            h. The <i>cp</i> utility shall do nothing more with <i>source_file</i> and
               go on to any remaining files.

        3. If <i>source_file</i> is of type regular file, the following steps
           shall be taken:

            a. The behavior is unspecified if <i>dest_file</i> exists and was
               written by a previous step. Otherwise, if <i>dest_file</i>
               exists, the following steps shall be taken:

                i.  If the <b>-i </b>option is in effect, the <i>cp</i> utility shall
                    write a prompt to the standard error and read a line
                    from the standard input. If the response is not
                    affirmative, <i>cp</i> shall do nothing more with
                    <i>source_file</i> and go on to any remaining files.

               ii.  A file descriptor for <i>dest_file</i> shall be obtained by
                    performing actions equivalent to the <i>open</i>() function
                    defined in the System Interfaces volume of
                    POSIX.1‐2017 called using <i>dest_file</i> as the <i>path</i>
                    argument, and the bitwise-inclusive OR of O_WRONLY
                    and O_TRUNC as the <i>oflag</i> argument.

               iii. If the attempt to obtain a file descriptor fails and
                    the <b>-f </b>option is in effect, <i>cp</i> shall attempt to
                    remove the file by performing actions equivalent to
                    the <i>unlink</i>() function defined in the System
                    Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 called using
                    <i>dest_file</i> as the <i>path</i> argument. If this attempt
                    succeeds, <i>cp</i> shall continue with step 3b.

            b. If <i>dest_file</i> does not exist, a file descriptor shall be
               obtained by performing actions equivalent to the <i>open</i>()
               function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
               POSIX.1‐2017 called using <i>dest_file</i> as the <i>path</i> argument,
               and the bitwise-inclusive OR of O_WRONLY and O_CREAT as
               the <i>oflag</i> argument. The file permission bits of
               <i>source_file</i> shall be the <i>mode</i> argument.

            c. If the attempt to obtain a file descriptor fails, <i>cp</i>
               shall write a diagnostic message to standard error, do
               nothing more with <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining
               files.

            d. The contents of <i>source_file</i> shall be written to the file
               descriptor. Any write errors shall cause <i>cp</i> to write a
               diagnostic message to standard error and continue to step
               3e.

            e. The file descriptor shall be closed.

            f. The <i>cp</i> utility shall do nothing more with <i>source_file</i>.
               If a write error occurred in step 3d, it is unspecified
               if <i>cp</i> continues with any remaining files. If no write
               error occurred in step 3d, <i>cp</i> shall go on to any
               remaining files.

        4. Otherwise, the <b>-R </b>option was specified, and the following
           steps shall be taken:

            a. The <i>dest_file</i> shall be created with the same file type as
               <i>source_file</i>.

            b. If <i>source_file</i> is a file of type FIFO, the file
               permission bits shall be the same as those of
               <i>source_file,</i> modified by the file creation mask of the
               user if the <b>-p </b>option was not specified. Otherwise, the
               permissions, owner ID, and group ID of <i>dest_file</i> are
               implementation-defined.

               If this creation fails for any reason, <i>cp</i> shall write a
               diagnostic message to standard error, do nothing more
               with <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining files.

            c. If <i>source_file</i> is a file of type symbolic link, and the
               options require the symbolic link itself to be acted
               upon, the pathname contained in <i>dest_file</i> shall be the
               same as the pathname contained in <i>source_file</i>.

               If this fails for any reason, <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic
               message to standard error, do nothing more with
               <i>source_file</i>, and go on to any remaining files.

       If the implementation provides additional or alternate access
       control mechanisms (see the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 4.5</i>, <i>File Access Permissions</i>), their effect
       on copies of files is implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cp</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-f        </b>If a file descriptor for a destination file cannot be
                 obtained, as described in step 3.a.ii., attempt to
                 unlink the destination file and proceed.

       <b>-H        </b>Take actions based on the type and contents of the file
                 referenced by any symbolic link specified as a
                 <i>source_file</i> operand.

       <b>-i        </b>Write a prompt to standard error before copying to any
                 existing non-directory destination file. If the
                 response from the standard input is affirmative, the
                 copy shall be attempted; otherwise, it shall not.

       <b>-L        </b>Take actions based on the type and contents of the file
                 referenced by any symbolic link specified as a
                 <i>source_file</i> operand or any symbolic links encountered
                 during traversal of a file hierarchy.

       <b>-P        </b>Take actions on any symbolic link specified as a
                 <i>source_file</i> operand or any symbolic link encountered
                 during traversal of a file hierarchy.

       <b>-p        </b>Duplicate the following characteristics of each source
                 file in the corresponding destination file:

                  1. The time of last data modification and time of last
                     access. If this duplication fails for any reason,
                     <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic message to standard
                     error.

                  2. The user ID and group ID. If this duplication fails
                     for any reason, it is unspecified whether <i>cp</i> writes
                     a diagnostic message to standard error.

                  3. The file permission bits and the S_ISUID and
                     S_ISGID bits. Other, implementation-defined, bits
                     may be duplicated as well. If this duplication
                     fails for any reason, <i>cp</i> shall write a diagnostic
                     message to standard error.

                 If the user ID or the group ID cannot be duplicated,
                 the file permission bits S_ISUID and S_ISGID shall be
                 cleared. If these bits are present in the source file
                 but are not duplicated in the destination file, it is
                 unspecified whether <i>cp</i> writes a diagnostic message to
                 standard error.

                 The order in which the preceding characteristics are
                 duplicated is unspecified. The <i>dest_file</i> shall not be
                 deleted if these characteristics cannot be preserved.

       <b>-R        </b>Copy file hierarchies.

       Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <b>-H</b>,
       <b>-L</b>, and <b>-P </b>shall not be considered an error. The last option
       specified shall determine the behavior of the utility.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>source_file</i>
                 A pathname of a file to be copied. If a <i>source_file</i>
                 operand is <b>'-'</b>, it shall refer to a file named <b>-</b>;
                 implementations shall not treat it as meaning standard
                 input.

       <i>target_file</i>
                 A pathname of an existing or nonexistent file, used for
                 the output when a single file is copied. If a
                 <i>target_file</i> operand is <b>'-'</b>, it shall refer to a file
                 named <b>-</b>; implementations shall not treat it as meaning
                 standard output.

       <i>target</i>    A pathname of a directory to contain the copied files.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used to read an input line in
       response to each prompt specified in the STDERR section.
       Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files specified as operands may be of any file type.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>cp</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                 elements used in the extended regular expression
                 defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale keyword in the
                 <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files) and the
                 behavior of character classes used in the extended
                 regular expression defined for the <b>yesexpr </b>locale
                 keyword in the <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> category.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale used to process affirmative
                 responses, and the locale used to affect the format and
                 contents of diagnostic messages and prompts written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       A prompt shall be written to standard error under the conditions
       specified in the DESCRIPTION section. The prompt shall contain
       the destination pathname, but its format is otherwise
       unspecified.  Otherwise, the standard error shall be used only
       for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The output files may be of any type.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All files were copied successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If <i>cp</i> is prematurely terminated by a signal or error, files or
       file hierarchies may be only partially copied and files and
       directories may have incorrect permissions or access and
       modification times.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are explicitly cleared when
       files are created. This is to prevent users from creating
       programs that are set-user-ID or set-group-ID to them when
       copying files or to make set-user-ID or set-group-ID files
       accessible to new groups of users.  For example, if a file is
       set-user-ID and the copy has a different group ID than the
       source, a new group of users has execute permission to a set-
       user-ID program than did previously. In particular, this is a
       problem for superusers copying users' trees.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-i </b>option exists on BSD systems, giving applications and
       users a way to avoid accidentally removing files when copying.
       Although the 4.3 BSD version does not prompt if the standard
       input is not a terminal, the standard developers decided that use
       of <b>-i </b>is a request for interaction, so when the destination path
       exists, the utility takes instructions from whatever responds on
       standard input.

       The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only
       the general nature of the contents of prompts are specified
       because implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than
       those used on historical implementations. Therefore, an
       application using the <b>-i </b>option relies on the system to provide
       the most suitable dialog directly with the user, based on the
       behavior specified.

       The <b>-p </b>option is historical practice on BSD systems, duplicating
       the time of last data modification and time of last access. This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 extends it to preserve the user and group
       IDs, as well as the file permissions. This requirement has
       obvious problems in that the directories are almost certainly
       modified after being copied. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires
       that the modification times be preserved. The statement that the
       order in which the characteristics are duplicated is unspecified
       is to permit implementations to provide the maximum amount of
       security for the user.  Implementations should take into account
       the obvious security issues involved in setting the owner, group,
       and mode in the wrong order or creating files with an owner,
       group, or mode different from the final value.

       It is unspecified whether <i>cp</i> writes diagnostic messages when the
       user and group IDs cannot be set due to the widespread practice
       of users using <b>-p </b>to duplicate some portion of the file
       characteristics, indifferent to the duplication of others.
       Historic implementations only write diagnostic messages on errors
       other than <b>[EPERM]</b>.

       Earlier versions of this standard included support for the <b>-r</b>
       option to copy file hierarchies. The <b>-r </b>option is historical
       practice on BSD and BSD-derived systems. This option is no longer
       specified by POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some
       implementations. The <b>-R </b>option was added as a close synonym to
       the <b>-r </b>option, selected for consistency with all other options in
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 that do recursive directory descent.

       The difference between <b>-R </b>and the removed <b>-r </b>option is in the
       treatment by <i>cp</i> of file types other than regular and directory.
       It was implementation-defined how the <b>- </b>option treated special
       files to allow both historical implementations and those that
       chose to support <b>-r </b>with the same abilities as <b>-R </b>defined by this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017. The original <b>-r </b>flag, for historic
       reasons, did not handle special files any differently from
       regular files, but always read the file and copied its contents.
       This had obvious problems in the presence of special file types;
       for example, character devices, FIFOs, and sockets.

       When a failure occurs during the copying of a file hierarchy, <i>cp</i>
       is required to attempt to copy files that are on the same level
       in the hierarchy or above the file where the failure occurred. It
       is unspecified if <i>cp</i> shall attempt to copy files below the file
       where the failure occurred (which cannot succeed in any case).

       Permissions, owners, and groups of created special file types
       have been deliberately left as implementation-defined. This is to
       allow systems to satisfy special requirements (for example,
       allowing users to create character special devices, but requiring
       them to be owned by a certain group). In general, it is strongly
       suggested that the permissions, owner, and group be the same as
       if the user had run the historical <i>mknod</i>, <i>ln</i>, or other utility to
       create the file. It is also probable that additional privileges
       are required to create block, character, or other implementation-
       defined special file types.

       Additionally, the <b>-p </b>option explicitly requires that all set-
       user-ID and set-group-ID permissions be discarded if any of the
       owner or group IDs cannot be set. This is to keep users from
       unintentionally giving away special privilege when copying
       programs.

       When creating regular files, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use the
       mode of the source file as modified by the file mode creation
       mask. Other choices would have been to use the mode of the source
       file unmodified by the creation mask or to use the same mode as
       would be given to a new file created by the user (plus the
       execution bits of the source file) and then modify it by the file
       mode creation mask. In the absence of any strong reason to change
       historic practice, it was in large part retained.

       When creating directories, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use the mode
       of the source directory, plus read, write, and search bits for
       the owner, as modified by the file mode creation mask. This is
       done so that <i>cp</i> can copy trees where the user has read
       permission, but the owner does not. A side-effect is that if the
       file creation mask denies the owner permissions, <i>cp</i> fails. Also,
       once the copy is done, historical versions of <i>cp</i> set the
       permissions on the created directory to be the same as the source
       directory, unmodified by the file creation mask.

       This behavior has been modified so that <i>cp</i> is always able to
       create the contents of the directory, regardless of the file
       creation mask. After the copy is done, the permissions are set to
       be the same as the source directory, as modified by the file
       creation mask. This latter change from historical behavior is to
       prevent users from accidentally creating directories with
       permissions beyond those they would normally set and for
       consistency with the behavior of <i>cp</i> in creating files.

       It is not a requirement that <i>cp</i> detect attempts to copy a file to
       itself; however, implementations are strongly encouraged to do
       so. Historical implementations have detected the attempt in most
       cases.

       There are two methods of copying subtrees in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. The other method is described as part of the <i>pax</i>
       utility (see <a href="pax.1p.html">pax(1p)</a>).  Both methods are historical practice. The
       <i>cp</i> utility provides a simpler, more intuitive interface, while
       <i>pax</i> offers a finer granularity of control. Each provides
       additional functionality to the other; in particular, <i>pax</i>
       maintains the hard-link structure of the hierarchy, while <i>cp</i> does
       not. It is the intention of the standard developers that the
       results be similar (using appropriate option combinations in both
       utilities). The results are not required to be identical; there
       seemed insufficient gain to applications to balance the
       difficulty of implementations having to guarantee that the
       results would be exactly identical.

       The wording allowing <i>cp</i> to copy a directory to implementation-
       defined file types not specified by the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 is provided so that implementations supporting
       symbolic links are not required to prohibit copying directories
       to symbolic links. Other extensions to the System Interfaces
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 file types may need to use this loophole
       as well.
