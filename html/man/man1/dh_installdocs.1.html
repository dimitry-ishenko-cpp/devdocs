NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_installdocs - install documentation into package build
       directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installdocs </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-A</b>] [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [<i>file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installdocs </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing documentation into <i>usr/share/doc/package</i> in package
       build directories.

       In compat 10 and earlier, <a href="dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a> may be a better tool for
       handling the upstream documentation, when upstream's own build
       system installs all the desired documentation correctly.  In this
       case, <b>dh_installdocs </b>is still useful for installing packaging
       related documentation (e.g. the <i>debian/copyright</i> file).

       From debhelper compatibility level 11 on, <b>dh_install </b>will fall
       back to looking in <i>debian/tmp</i> for files, if it does not find them
       in the current directory (or wherever you've told it to look
       using <b>--sourcedir</b>).

       In compat 11 and later, <b>dh_installdocs </b>offers many of the
       features that <a href="dh_install.1.html">dh_install(1)</a> also has.  Furthermore,
       <b>dh_installdocs </b>also supports the <b>nodoc </b>build profile to exclude
       documentation (regardless of compat level).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.docs
           List documentation files to be installed into <i>package</i>.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
           documented in <a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper(7)</a>.

       <i>debian/copyright</i>
           The copyright file is installed into all packages, unless a
           more specific copyright file is available.

       debian/<i>package</i>.copyright
       debian/<i>package</i>.README.Debian
       debian/<i>package</i>.TODO
           Each of these files is automatically installed if present for
           a <i>package</i>.

       <i>debian/README.Debian</i>
       <i>debian/TODO</i>
           These files are installed into the first binary package
           listed in debian/control.

           Note that <i>README.debian</i> files are also installed as
           <i>README.Debian</i>, and <i>TODO</i> files will be installed as
           <i>TODO.Debian</i> in non-native packages.

       debian/<i>package</i>.doc-base
           Installed as doc-base control files. Note that the doc-id
           will be determined from the <b>Document: </b>entry in the doc-base
           control file in question. In the event that multiple doc-base
           files in a single source package share the same doc-id, they
           will be installed to usr/share/doc-base/package instead of
           usr/share/doc-base/doc-id.

       debian/<i>package</i>.doc-base.*
           If your package needs to register more than one document, you
           need multiple doc-base files, and can name them like this. In
           the event that multiple doc-base files of this style in a
           single source package share the same doc-id, they will be
           installed to usr/share/doc-base/package-* instead of
           usr/share/doc-base/doc-id.

           Please be aware that this deduplication is currently done in
           memory only, so for now it requires <b>dh_installdocs </b>to be
           called no more than once during the package build. Calling
           <b>dh_installdocs -p</b><i>package</i> in combination with using
           <i>debian/package.doc-base.*</i> files can lead to uninstallable
           packages. See &lt;<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/980903">https://bugs.debian.org/980903</a>&gt; for details.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL
           packages acted on.

       <b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude files that contain <i>item</i> anywhere in their filename
           from being installed. Note that this includes doc-base files.

       <b>--sourcedir=</b><i>dir</i>
           Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.
           This option requires compat 11 or later (it is silently
           ignored in compat 10 or earlier).

           Note that this is not the same as the <b>--sourcedirectory</b>
           option used by the <b>dh_auto_</b><i>*</i> commands. You rarely need to use
           this option, since <b>dh_installman </b>automatically looks for
           files in <i>debian/tmp</i> in debhelper compatibility level 11 and
           above.

       <b>--doc-main-package=</b><i>main-package</i>
           Set the main package for a documentation package.  This is
           used to install the documentation of the documentation
           package in <i>/usr/share/doc/main-package</i> as recommended by the
           Debian policy manual 3.9.7 in §12.3.

           In compat 11 (or later), this option is only useful if
           debhelper's auto-detection of the main package is wrong.  The
           option can also be used to silence a warning from debhelper
           when the auto-detection fails but the default happens to be
           correct.

           This option cannot be used when <b>dh_installdocs </b>is instructed
           to act on multiple packages.  If you need this option, you
           will generally need to combine it with <b>-p </b>to ensure exactly
           one package is acted on.

           Please keep in mind that some documentation (the copyright
           file, README.Debian, etc.) will be unaffected by this option.

       <b>--link-doc=</b><i>package</i>
           Make the documentation directory of all packages acted on be
           a symlink to the documentation directory of <i>package</i>. This has
           no effect when acting on <i>package</i> itself, or if the
           documentation directory to be created already exists when
           <b>dh_installdocs </b>is run. To comply with policy, <i>package</i> must be
           a binary package that comes from the same source package.

           debhelper will try to avoid installing files into linked
           documentation directories that would cause conflicts with the
           linked package. The <b>-A </b>option will have no effect on packages
           with linked documentation directories, and <i>copyright</i>,
           <i>changelog</i>, <i>README.Debian</i>, and <i>TODO</i> files will not be
           installed.

           (An older method to accomplish the same thing, which is still
           supported, is to make the documentation directory of a
           package be a dangling symlink, before calling
           <b>dh_installdocs</b>.)

           Please note that this option only applies to the
           documentation directory for the package itself.  When the
           package ships documentation for another package (e.g. see
           <b>--doc-main-package</b>), it will not use a symlink for the
           documentation of the other package.

           <b>CAVEAT 1</b>: If a previous version of the package was built
           without this option and is now built with it (or vice-versa),
           it requires a "dir to symlink" (or "symlink to dir")
           migration.  Since debhelper has no knowledge of previous
           versions, you have to enable this migration itself.

           This can be done by providing a "debian/<i>package</i>.maintscript"
           file and using <a href="dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a> to provide the relevant
           maintainer script snippets.

           <b>CAVEAT 2</b>: The use of <b>--link-doc </b>should only be done when the
           packages have same "architecture" type.  A link from an
           architecture independent package to an architecture dependent
           package (or vice versa) will not work.  Since compat 10,
           debhelper will actively reject unsupported combinations.

       <i>file</i> ...
           Install these files as documentation into the first package
           acted on. (Or in all packages if <b>-A </b>is specified).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       This is an example of a <i>debian/package.docs</i> file:

         README
         TODO
         debian/notes-for-maintainers.txt
         docs/manual.txt
         docs/manual.pdf
         docs/manual-html/
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that <b>dh_installdocs </b>will happily copy entire directory
       hierarchies if you ask it to (similar to <b>cp -a</b>). If it is asked
       to install a directory, it will install the complete contents of
       the directory.
