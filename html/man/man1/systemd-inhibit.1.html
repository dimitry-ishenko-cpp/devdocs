NAME </h2>
<pre>
       systemd-inhibit - Execute a program with an inhibition lock taken
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>systemd-inhibit </b>[OPTIONS...] [COMMAND] [ARGUMENTS...]

       <b>systemd-inhibit </b>[OPTIONS...] [--list]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-inhibit </b>may be used to execute a program with a shutdown,
       sleep, or idle inhibitor lock taken. The lock will be acquired
       before the specified command line is executed and released
       afterwards.

       Inhibitor locks may be used to block or delay system sleep and
       shutdown requests from the user, as well as automatic idle
       handling of the OS. This is useful to avoid system suspends while
       an optical disc is being recorded, or similar operations that
       should not be interrupted.

       For more information see <b>Inhibitor Locks</b>[1].
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--what=</b>
           Takes a colon-separated list of one or more operations to
           inhibit: "shutdown", "sleep", "idle", "handle-power-key",
           "handle-suspend-key", "handle-hibernate-key",
           "handle-lid-switch", for inhibiting
           reboot/power-off/halt/kexec/soft-reboot,
           suspending/hibernating, the automatic idle detection, or the
           low-level handling of the power/sleep key and the lid switch,
           respectively. If omitted, defaults to "idle:sleep:shutdown".

       <b>--who=</b>
           Takes a short, human-readable descriptive string for the
           program taking the lock. If not passed, defaults to the
           command line string.

       <b>--why=</b>
           Takes a short, human-readable descriptive string for the
           reason for taking the lock. Defaults to "Unknown reason".

       <b>--mode=</b>
           Takes either "block" or "delay" and describes how the lock is
           applied. If "block" is used (the default), the lock prohibits
           any of the requested operations without time limit, and only
           privileged users may override it. If "delay" is used, the
           lock can only delay the requested operations for a limited
           time. If the time elapses, the lock is ignored and the
           operation executed. The time limit may be specified in
           <a href="../man5/logind.conf.5.html">logind.conf(5)</a>. Note that "delay" is only available for
           "sleep" and "shutdown".

       <b>--list</b>
           Lists all active inhibition locks instead of acquiring one.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer
           with hints.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       Returns the exit status of the executed program.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLE </h2>
<pre>
           # systemd-inhibit wodim foobar.iso

       This burns the ISO image foobar.iso on a CD using <b>wodim</b>(1), and
       inhibits system sleeping, shutdown and idle while doing so.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</i>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a
           higher log level, i.e. less important ones, will be
           suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value
           may be either one of (in order of decreasing importance)
           <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an
           integer in the range 0...7. See <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a> for more
           information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with one
           of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg </b>or <b>journal </b>followed by a colon to
           set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.
           <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info </b>specifies to log at
           debug level except when logging to the console which should
           be at info level). Note that the global maximum log level
           takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be
           colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and other
           tools that display logs will color messages based on the log
           level on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</i>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed
           with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal or a file, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and
           other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on
           the entry metadata on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename
           and line number in the source code where the message
           originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to
           journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
           text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the
           current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to
           journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
           text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</i>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console </b>(log to the
           attached tty), <b>console-prefixed </b>(log to the attached tty but
           with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see
           <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>, <b>kmsg </b>(log to the kernel circular log buffer),
           <b>journal </b>(log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg </b>(log to the
           journal if available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto </b>(determine
           the appropriate log target automatically, the default), <b>null</b>
           (disable log output).

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</i>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults
           to "true". If disabled, systemd will not ratelimit messages
           written to kmsg.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager </b>is not given; overrides <i>$PAGER</i>.
           If neither <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> nor <i>$PAGER</i> are set, a set of
           well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including
           <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> and <a href="more.1.html">more(1)</a>, until one is found. If no pager
           implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting
           this environment variable to an empty string or the value
           "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> (as
           well as <i>$PAGER</i>) will be silently ignored.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i>
           Override the options passed to <b>less </b>(by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when
               Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less </b>to handle Ctrl+C itself
               to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this
               option.

               If the value of <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i> does not include "K", and
               the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C will be ignored
               by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap
               initialization and deinitialization strings to the
               terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to
               remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
               exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager
               functionality from working, in particular paged output
               cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESS</i> environment variable has
           no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

           See <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> for more discussion.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</i>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less </b>(by default "utf-8", if
           the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESSCHARSET</i> environment
           variable has no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the
           pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective
           UID is not the same as the owner of the login session, see
           <a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid(2)</a> and <a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid(3)</a>. In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1 </b>will be set when invoking the pager, and the
           pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or
           start new subprocesses. When <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set
           at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode
           will not be used. (Currently only <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for
           example under <a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo(8)</a> or <b>pkexec</b>(1), care must be taken to
           ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled.
           "Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as
           describe above. Setting <i>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</i> or not removing
           it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke
           arbitrary commands. Note that if the <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> or <i>$PAGER</i>
           variables are to be honoured, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> must be
           set too. It might be reasonable to completely disable the
           pager using <b>--no-pager </b>instead.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd </b>and related
           utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the
           output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can
           take one of the following special values: "16", "256" to
           restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic
           decision based on <i>$TERM</i> and what the console is connected to.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</i>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links
           should be generated in the output for terminal emulators
           supporting this. This can be specified to override the
           decision that <b>systemd </b>makes based on <i>$TERM</i> and other
           conditions.
