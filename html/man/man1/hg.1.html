COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Repository creation</b>
   <b>clone</b>
       make a copy of an existing repository:

       hg clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]

       Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.

       If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
       basename of the source.

       The location of the source is added to the new repository's
       <b>.hg/hgrc </b>file, as the default to be used for future pulls.

       Only local paths and <b>ssh:// </b>URLs are supported as destinations.
       For <b>ssh:// </b>destinations, no working directory or <b>.hg/hgrc </b>will be
       created on the remote side.

       If the source repository has a bookmark called '@' set, that
       revision will be checked out in the new repository by default.

       To check out a particular version, use -u/--update, or
       -U/--noupdate to create a clone with no working directory.

       To pull only a subset of changesets, specify one or more
       revisions identifiers with -r/--rev or branches with -b/--branch.
       The resulting clone will contain only the specified changesets
       and their ancestors. These options (or 'clone src#rev dest')
       imply --pull, even for local source repositories.

       In normal clone mode, the remote normalizes repository data into
       a common exchange format and the receiving end translates this
       data into its local storage format. --stream activates a
       different clone mode that essentially copies repository files
       from the remote with minimal data processing. This significantly
       reduces the CPU cost of a clone both remotely and locally.
       However, it often increases the transferred data size by 30-40%.
       This can result in substantially faster clones where I/O
       throughput is plentiful, especially for larger repositories. A
       side-effect of --stream clones is that storage settings and
       requirements on the remote are applied locally: a modern client
       may inherit legacy or inefficient storage used by the remote or a
       legacy Mercurial client may not be able to clone from a modern
       Mercurial remote.

       Note   Specifying a tag will include the tagged changeset but not
              the changeset containing the tag.

       For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the
       source and destination are on the same filesystem (note this
       applies only to the repository data, not to the working
       directory). Some filesystems, such as AFS, implement hardlinking
       incorrectly, but do not report errors. In these cases, use the
       --pull option to avoid hardlinking.

       Mercurial will update the working directory to the first
       applicable revision from this list:

       a. null if -U or the source repository has no changesets

       b. if -u . and the source repository is local, the first parent
          of the source repository's working directory

       c. the changeset specified with -u (if a branch name, this means
          the latest head of that branch)

       d. the changeset specified with -r

       e. the tipmost head specified with -b

       f. the tipmost head specified with the url#branch source syntax

       g. the revision marked with the '@' bookmark, if present

       h. the tipmost head of the default branch

       i. tip

       When cloning from servers that support it, Mercurial may fetch
       pre-generated data from a server-advertised URL or inline from
       the same stream. When this is done, hooks operating on incoming
       changesets and changegroups may fire more than once, once for
       each pre-generated bundle and as well as for any additional
       remaining data. In addition, if an error occurs, the repository
       may be rolled back to a partial clone. This behavior may change
       in future releases.  See <b>hg help -e clonebundles </b>for more.

       Examples:

       • clone a remote repository to a new directory named hg/:

         hg clone <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/</a>

       • create a lightweight local clone:

         hg clone project/ project-feature/

       • clone from an absolute path on an ssh server (note
         double-slash):

         hg clone ssh://user@server//home/projects/alpha/

       • do a streaming clone while checking out a specified version:

         hg clone --stream <a href="http://server/repo">http://server/repo</a> -u 1.5

       • create a repository without changesets after a particular
         revision:

         hg clone -r 04e544 experimental/ good/

       • clone (and track) a particular named branch:

         hg clone <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/#stable">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/#stable</a>

       See <b>hg help urls </b>for details on specifying URLs.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-U, --noupdate</b>
              the clone will include an empty working directory (only a
              repository)

       <b>-u,</b><i>--updaterev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              revision, tag, or branch to check out

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              do not clone everything, but include this changeset and
              its ancestors

       <b>-b,</b><i>--branch</i> <b>&lt;BRANCH[+]&gt;</b>
              do not clone everything, but include this branch's
              changesets and their ancestors

       <b>--pull </b>use pull protocol to copy metadata

       <b>--uncompressed</b>
              an alias to --stream (DEPRECATED)

       <b>--stream</b>
              clone with minimal data processing

       <b>-e,</b><i>--ssh</i> <b>&lt;CMD&gt;</b>
              specify ssh command to use

       <b>--remotecmd </b><i>&lt;CMD&gt;</i>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       <b>--insecure</b>
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts
              config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>init</b>
       create a new repository in the given directory:

       hg init [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]

       Initialize a new repository in the given directory. If the given
       directory does not exist, it will be created.

       If no directory is given, the current directory is used.

       It is possible to specify an <b>ssh:// </b>URL as the destination.  See
       <b>hg help urls </b>for more information.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-e,</b><i>--ssh</i> <b>&lt;CMD&gt;</b>
              specify ssh command to use

       <b>--remotecmd </b><i>&lt;CMD&gt;</i>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       <b>--insecure</b>
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts
              config)

   <b>Remote repository management</b>
   <b>incoming</b>
       show new changesets found in source:

       hg incoming [-p] [-n] [-M] [-f] [-r REV]... [--bundle FILENAME] [SOURCE]

       Show new changesets found in the specified path/URL or the
       default pull location. These are the changesets that would have
       been pulled by <b>hg pull </b>at the time you issued this command.

       See pull for valid source format details.

       With -B/--bookmarks, the result of bookmark comparison between
       local and remote repositories is displayed. With -v/--verbose,
       status is also displayed for each bookmark like below:

       BM1               01234567890a added
       BM2               1234567890ab advanced
       BM3               234567890abc diverged
       BM4               34567890abcd changed

       The action taken locally when pulling depends on the status of
       each bookmark:

       <b>added</b>

              pull will create it

       <b>advanced</b>

              pull will update it

       <b>diverged</b>

              pull will create a divergent bookmark

       <b>changed</b>

              result depends on remote changesets

       From the point of view of pulling behavior, bookmark existing
       only in the remote repository are treated as <b>added</b>, even if it is
       in fact locally deleted.

       For remote repository, using --bundle avoids downloading the
       changesets twice if the incoming is followed by a pull.

       Examples:

       • show incoming changes with patches and full description:

         hg incoming -vp

       • show incoming changes excluding merges, store a bundle:

         hg in -vpM --bundle incoming.hg
         hg pull incoming.hg

       • briefly list changes inside a bundle:

         hg in changes.hg -T "{desc|firstline}\n"

       Returns 0 if there are incoming changes, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              run even if remote repository is unrelated

       <b>-n, --newest-first</b>

              file to store the bundles into

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              a remote changeset intended to be added

       <b>-B, --bookmarks</b>
              compare bookmarks

              config)

       <b>-S, --subrepos</b>
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: in

   <b>outgoing</b>
       show changesets not found in the destination:

       hg outgoing [-M] [-p] [-n] [-f] [-r REV]... [DEST]...

       Show changesets not found in the specified destination repository
       or the default push location. These are the changesets that would
       be pushed if a push was requested.

       See pull for details of valid destination formats.

       With -B/--bookmarks, the result of bookmark comparison between
       local and remote repositories is displayed. With -v/--verbose,
       status is also displayed for each bookmark like below:

       BM1               01234567890a added
       BM2                            deleted
       BM3               234567890abc advanced
       BM4               34567890abcd diverged
       BM5               4567890abcde changed

       The action taken when pushing depends on the status of each
       bookmark:

       <b>added</b>

              push with <b>-B </b>will create it

       <b>deleted</b>

              push with <b>-B </b>will delete it

       <b>advanced</b>

              push will update it

       <b>diverged</b>

              push with <b>-B </b>will update it

       <b>changed</b>

              push with <b>-B </b>will update it

       From the point of view of pushing behavior, bookmarks existing
       only in the remote repository are treated as <b>deleted</b>, even if it
       is in fact added remotely.

       Returns 0 if there are outgoing changes, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              run even when the destination is unrelated

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: out

   <b>paths</b>
       show aliases for remote repositories:

       hg paths [NAME]

       Show definition of symbolic path name NAME. If no name is given,
       show definition of all available names.

       Option -q/--quiet suppresses all output when searching for NAME
       and shows only the path names when listing all definitions.

       Path names are defined in the [paths] section of your
       configuration file and in <b>/etc/mercurial/hgrc</b>. If run inside a
       repository, <b>.hg/hgrc </b>is used, too.

       The path names <b>default </b>and <b>default-push </b>have a special meaning.
       When performing a push or pull operation, they are used as
       fallbacks if no location is specified on the command-line.  When
       <b>default-push </b>is set, it will be used for push and <b>default </b>will be
       used for pull; otherwise <b>default </b>is used as the fallback for
       both.  When cloning a repository, the clone source is written as
       <b>default </b>in <b>.hg/hgrc</b>.

       Note   <b>default </b>and <b>default-push </b>apply to all inbound (e.g.  <b>hg</b>
              <b>incoming</b>) and outbound (e.g. <b>hg outgoing</b>, <b>hg email </b>and <b>hg</b>
              <b>bundle</b>) operations.

       See <b>hg help urls </b>for more information.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

       <b>name   </b>String. Symbolic name of the path alias.

       <b>pushurl</b>
              String. URL for push operations.

       <b>url    </b>String. URL or directory path for the other operations.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

   <b>pull</b>
       pull changes from the specified source:

       hg pull [-u] [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]...

       Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.

       This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path
       or URL and adds them to a local repository (the current one
       unless -R is specified). By default, this does not update the
       copy of the project in the working directory.

       When cloning from servers that support it, Mercurial may fetch
       pre-generated data. When this is done, hooks operating on
       incoming changesets and changegroups may fire more than once,
       once for each pre-generated bundle and as well as for any
       additional remaining data. See <b>hg help -e clonebundles </b>for more.

       Use <b>hg incoming </b>if you want to see what would have been added by
       a pull at the time you issued this command. If you then decide to
       add those changes to the repository, you should use <b>hg pull -r X</b>
       where <b>X </b>is the last changeset listed by <b>hg incoming</b>.

       If SOURCE is omitted, the 'default' path will be used.  See <b>hg</b>
       <b>help urls </b>for more information.

       If multiple sources are specified, they will be pulled
       sequentially as if the command was run multiple time. If --update
       is specify and the command will stop at the first failed
       --update.

       Specifying bookmark as <b>. </b>is equivalent to specifying the active
       bookmark's name.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update had unresolved files.

       Options:

       <b>-u, --update</b>
              update to new branch head if new descendants were pulled

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              run even when remote repository is unrelated

       <b>--confirm</b>
              confirm pull before applying changes

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              a remote changeset intended to be added

       <b>-B,</b><i>--bookmark</i> <b>&lt;BOOKMARK[+]&gt;</b>
              bookmark to pull

       <b>-b,</b><i>--branch</i> <b>&lt;BRANCH[+]&gt;</b>
              a specific branch you would like to pull

              specify ssh command to use

              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       <b>--insecure</b>
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts
              config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>push</b>
       push changes to the specified destination:

       hg push [-f] [-r REV]... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [DEST]...

       Push changesets from the local repository to the specified
       destination.

       This operation is symmetrical to pull: it is identical to a pull
       in the destination repository from the current one.

       By default, push will not allow creation of new heads at the
       destination, since multiple heads would make it unclear which
       head to use. In this situation, it is recommended to pull and
       merge before pushing.

       Use --new-branch if you want to allow push to create a new named
       branch that is not present at the destination. This allows you to
       only create a new branch without forcing other changes.

       Note   Extra care should be taken with the -f/--force option,
              which will push all new heads on all branches, an action
              which will almost always cause confusion for
              collaborators.

       If -r/--rev is used, the specified revision and all its ancestors
       will be pushed to the remote repository.

       If -B/--bookmark is used, the specified bookmarked revision, its
       ancestors, and the bookmark will be pushed to the remote
       repository. Specifying <b>. </b>is equivalent to specifying the active
       bookmark's name. Use the --all-bookmarks option for pushing all
       current bookmarks.

       Please see <b>hg help urls </b>for important details about <b>ssh:// </b>URLs.
       If DESTINATION is omitted, a default path will be used.

       When passed multiple destinations, push will process them one
       after the other, but stop should an error occur.

       The --pushvars option sends strings to the server that become
       environment variables prepended with <b>HG_USERVAR_</b>. For example,
       <b>--pushvars ENABLE_FEATURE=true</b>, provides the server side hooks
       with <b>HG_USERVAR_ENABLE_FEATURE=true </b>as part of their environment.

       pushvars can provide for user-overridable hooks as well as set
       debug levels. One example is having a hook that blocks commits
       containing conflict markers, but enables the user to override the
       hook if the file is using conflict markers for testing purposes
       or the file format has strings that look like conflict markers.

       By default, servers will ignore <i>--pushvars</i>. To enable it add the
       following to your configuration file:

       [push]
       pushvars.server = true

       Returns 0 if push was successful, 1 if nothing to push.

       Options:

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              force push

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>

       <b>-B,</b><i>--bookmark</i> <b>&lt;BOOKMARK[+]&gt;</b>
              bookmark to push

       <b>--all-bookmarks</b>

       <b>-b,</b><i>--branch</i> <b>&lt;BRANCH[+]&gt;</b>

       <b>--new-branch</b>
              allow pushing a new branch

       <b>--pushvars </b><i>&lt;VALUE[+]&gt;</i>

              config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>serve</b>
       start stand-alone webserver:

       hg serve [OPTION]...

       Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull server. You can
       use this for ad-hoc sharing and browsing of repositories. It is
       recommended to use a real web server to serve a repository for
       longer periods of time.

       Please note that the server does not implement access control.
       This means that, by default, anybody can read from the server and
       nobody can write to it by default. Set the <b>web.allow-push </b>option
       to <b>* </b>to allow everybody to push to the server. You should use a
       real web server if you need to authenticate users.

       By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and errors to
       stderr. Use the -A/--accesslog and -E/--errorlog options to log
       to files.

       To have the server choose a free port number to listen on,
       specify a port number of 0; in this case, the server will print
       the port number it uses.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-A,</b><i>--accesslog</i> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              name of access log file to write to

       <b>-d, --daemon</b>

       <b>--daemon-postexec </b><i>&lt;VALUE[+]&gt;</i>
              used internally by daemon mode

       <b>-E,</b><i>--errorlog</i> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              name of error log file to write to

       <b>-p,</b><i>--port</i> <b>&lt;PORT&gt;</b>
              port to listen on (default: 8000)

       <b>-a,</b><i>--address</i> <b>&lt;ADDR&gt;</b>
              address to listen on (default: all interfaces)

       <b>--prefix </b><i>&lt;PREFIX&gt;</i>
              prefix path to serve from (default: server root)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>Change creation</b>
   <b>commit</b>
       commit the specified files or all outstanding changes:

       hg commit [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Commit changes to the given files into the repository. Unlike a
       centralized SCM, this operation is a local operation. See <b>hg push</b>
       for a way to actively distribute your changes.

       If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by <b>hg status</b>
       will be committed.

       If you are committing the result of a merge, do not provide any
       filenames or -I/-X filters.

       If no commit message is specified, Mercurial starts your
       configured editor where you can enter a message. In case your
       commit fails, you will find a backup of your message in
       <b>.hg/last-message.txt</b>.

       The --close-branch flag can be used to mark the current branch
       head closed. When all heads of a branch are closed, the branch
       will be considered closed and no longer listed.

       The --amend flag can be used to amend the parent of the working
       directory with a new commit that contains the changes in the
       parent in addition to those currently reported by <b>hg status</b>, if
       there are any. The old commit is stored in a backup bundle in
       <b>.hg/strip-backup </b>(see <b>hg help bundle </b>and <b>hg help unbundle </b>on how
       to restore it).

       Message, user and date are taken from the amended commit unless
       specified. When a message isn't specified on the command line,
       the editor will open with the message of the amended commit.

       It is not possible to amend public changesets (see <b>hg help phases</b>
       ) or changesets that have children.

       See <b>hg help dates </b>for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing changed.

       Examples:

       • commit all files ending in .py:

         hg commit --include "set:**.py"

       • commit all non-binary files:

         hg commit --exclude "set:binary()"

       • amend the current commit and set the date to now:

         hg commit --amend --date now

       Options:

       <b>-A, --addremove</b>
              mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing

       <b>--close-branch</b>
              mark a branch head as closed

       <b>--amend</b>
              amend the parent of the working directory

       <b>-s, --secret</b>
              use the secret phase for committing

   <b>Change manipulation</b>
   <b>abort</b>
       abort an unfinished operation (EXPERIMENTAL):

       hg abort

       Aborts a multistep operation like graft, histedit, rebase, merge,
       and unshelve if they are in an unfinished state.

       use --dry-run/-n to dry run the command.

       Options:

       <b>-n, --dry-run</b>
              do not perform actions, just print output

   <b>backout</b>
       reverse effect of earlier changeset:

       hg backout [OPTION]... [-r] REV

       Prepare a new changeset with the effect of REV undone in the
       current working directory. If no conflicts were encountered, it
       will be committed immediately.

       If REV is the parent of the working directory, then this new
       changeset is committed automatically (unless --no-commit is
       specified).

       Note   <b>hg backout </b>cannot be used to fix either an unwanted or
              incorrect merge.

       Examples:

       • Reverse the effect of the parent of the working directory.
         This backout will be committed immediately:

         hg backout -r .

       • Reverse the effect of previous bad revision 23:

         hg backout -r 23

       • Reverse the effect of previous bad revision 23 and leave
         changes uncommitted:

         hg backout -r 23 --no-commit
         hg commit -m "Backout revision 23"

       By default, the pending changeset will have one parent,
       maintaining a linear history. With --merge, the pending changeset
       will instead have two parents: the old parent of the working
       directory and a new child of REV that simply undoes REV.

       Before version 1.7, the behavior without --merge was equivalent
       to specifying --merge followed by <b>hg update --clean . </b>to cancel
       the merge and leave the child of REV as a head to be merged
       separately.

       See <b>hg help dates </b>for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       See <b>hg help revert </b>for a way to restore files to the state of
       another revision.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing to backout or there are
       unresolved files.

       Options:

       <b>--merge</b>
              merge with old dirstate parent after backout

       <b>--commit</b>
              commit if no conflicts were encountered (DEPRECATED)

       <b>--no-commit</b>
              do not commit

       <b>--parent </b><i>&lt;REV&gt;</i>
              parent to choose when backing out merge (DEPRECATED)

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              revision to backout

       <b>-e, --edit</b>
              invoke editor on commit messages

       <b>-t,</b><i>--tool</i> <b>&lt;TOOL&gt;</b>

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>continue</b>
       resumes an interrupted operation (EXPERIMENTAL):

       hg continue

       Finishes a multistep operation like graft, histedit, rebase,
       merge, and unshelve if they are in an interrupted state.

       use --dry-run/-n to dry run the command.

       Options:

       <b>-n, --dry-run</b>
              do not perform actions, just print output

   <b>graft</b>
       copy changes from other branches onto the current branch:

       hg graft [OPTION]... [-r REV]... REV...

       This command uses Mercurial's merge logic to copy individual
       changes from other branches without merging branches in the
       history graph. This is sometimes known as 'backporting' or
       'cherry-picking'. By default, graft will copy user, date, and
       description from the source changesets.

       Changesets that are ancestors of the current revision, that have
       already been grafted, or that are merges will be skipped.

       If --log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended
       of the form:

       (grafted from CHANGESETHASH)

       If --force is specified, revisions will be grafted even if they
       are already ancestors of, or have been grafted to, the
       destination.  This is useful when the revisions have since been
       backed out.

       If a graft merge results in conflicts, the graft process is
       interrupted so that the current merge can be manually resolved.
       Once all conflicts are addressed, the graft process can be
       continued with the -c/--continue option.

       The -c/--continue option reapplies all the earlier options.

       The --base option exposes more of how graft internally uses merge
       with a custom base revision. --base can be used to specify
       another ancestor than the first and only parent.

       The command:

       hg graft -r 345 --base 234

       is thus pretty much the same as:

       hg diff --from 234 --to 345 | hg import

       but using merge to resolve conflicts and track moved files.

       The result of a merge can thus be backported as a single commit
       by specifying one of the merge parents as base, and thus
       effectively grafting the changes from the other side.

       It is also possible to collapse multiple changesets and clean up
       history by specifying another ancestor as base, much like rebase
       --collapse --keep.

       The commit message can be tweaked after the fact using commit
       --amend .

       For using non-ancestors as the base to backout changes, see the
       backout command and the hidden --parent option.

       Examples:

       • copy a single change to the stable branch and edit its
         description:

         hg update stable
         hg graft --edit 9393

       • graft a range of changesets with one exception, updating dates:

         hg graft -D "2085::2093 and not 2091"

       • continue a graft after resolving conflicts:

         hg graft -c

       • show the source of a grafted changeset:

         hg log --debug -r .

       • show revisions sorted by date:

         hg log -r "sort(all(), date)"

       • backport the result of a merge as a single commit:

         hg graft -r 123 --base 123^

       • land a feature branch as one changeset:

         hg up -cr default
         hg graft -r featureX --base "ancestor('featureX', 'default')"

       See <b>hg help revisions </b>for more about specifying revisions.

       Returns 0 on successful completion, 1 if there are unresolved
       files.

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>merge</b>
       merge another revision into working directory:

       hg merge [-P] [[-r] REV]

       The current working directory is updated with all changes made in
       the requested revision since the last common predecessor
       revision.

       Files that changed between either parent are marked as changed
       for the next commit and a commit must be performed before any
       further updates to the repository are allowed. The next commit
       will have two parents.

       <b>--tool </b>can be used to specify the merge tool used for file
       merges. It overrides the HGMERGE environment variable and your
       configuration files. See <b>hg help merge-tools </b>for options.

       If no revision is specified, the working directory's parent is a
       head revision, and the current branch contains exactly one other
       head, the other head is merged with by default. Otherwise, an
       explicit revision with which to merge must be provided.

       See <b>hg help resolve </b>for information on handling file conflicts.

       To undo an uncommitted merge, use <b>hg merge --abort </b>which will
       check out a clean copy of the original merge parent, losing all
       changes.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

       Options:

       <b>-P, --preview</b>
              review revisions to merge (no merge is performed)

       <b>--abort</b>
              abort the ongoing merge

       <b>-t,</b><i>--tool</i> <b>&lt;TOOL&gt;</b>
              specify merge tool

   <b>Change organization</b>
   <b>bookmarks</b>
       create a new bookmark or list existing bookmarks:

       hg bookmarks [OPTIONS]... [NAME]...

       Bookmarks are labels on changesets to help track lines of
       development.  Bookmarks are unversioned and can be moved, renamed
       and deleted.  Deleting or moving a bookmark has no effect on the
       associated changesets.

       Creating or updating to a bookmark causes it to be marked as
       'active'.  The active bookmark is indicated with a '*'.  When a
       commit is made, the active bookmark will advance to the new
       commit.  A plain <b>hg update </b>will also advance an active bookmark,
       if possible.  Updating away from a bookmark will cause it to be
       deactivated.

       Bookmarks can be pushed and pulled between repositories (see <b>hg</b>
       <b>help push </b>and <b>hg help pull</b>). If a shared bookmark has diverged, a
       new 'divergent bookmark' of the form 'name@path' will be created.
       Using <b>hg merge </b>will resolve the divergence.

       Specifying bookmark as '.' to -m/-d/-l options is equivalent to
       specifying the active bookmark's name.

       A bookmark named '@' has the special property that <b>hg clone </b>will
       check it out by default if it exists.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions such as <b>{bookmark}</b>. See also <b>hg</b>
       <b>help templates</b>.

       <b>active </b>Boolean. True if the bookmark is active.

       Examples:

       • create an active bookmark for a new line of development:

         hg book new-feature

       • create an inactive bookmark as a place marker:

         hg book -i reviewed

       • create an inactive bookmark on another changeset:

         hg book -r .^ tested

       • rename bookmark turkey to dinner:

         hg book -m turkey dinner

       • move the '@' bookmark from another branch:

         hg book -f @

       • print only the active bookmark name:

         hg book -ql .

       Options:

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              force

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              revision for bookmark action

       <b>-d, --delete</b>
              delete a given bookmark

       <b>-m,</b><i>--rename</i> <b>&lt;OLD&gt;</b>
              rename a given bookmark

       <b>-i, --inactive</b>
              mark a bookmark inactive

       <b>-l, --list</b>
              list existing bookmarks

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

          aliases: bookmark

   <b>branch</b>
       set or show the current branch name:

       hg branch [-fC] [NAME]

       Note   Branch names are permanent and global. Use <b>hg bookmark </b>to
              create a light-weight bookmark instead. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>glossary </b>for more information about named branches and
              bookmarks.

       With no argument, show the current branch name. With one
       argument, set the working directory branch name (the branch will
       not exist in the repository until the next commit). Standard
       practice recommends that primary development take place on the
       'default' branch.

       Unless -f/--force is specified, branch will not let you set a
       branch name that already exists.

       Use -C/--clean to reset the working directory branch to that of
       the parent of the working directory, negating a previous branch
       change.

       Use the command <b>hg update </b>to switch to an existing branch. Use <b>hg</b>
       <b>commit --close-branch </b>to mark this branch head as closed.  When
       all heads of a branch are closed, the branch will be considered
       closed.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              set branch name even if it shadows an existing branch

       <b>-C, --clean</b>
              reset branch name to parent branch name

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;VALUE[+]&gt;</b>
              change branches of the given revs (EXPERIMENTAL)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>branches</b>
       list repository named branches:

       hg branches [-c]

       List the repository's named branches, indicating which ones are
       inactive. If -c/--closed is specified, also list branches which
       have been marked closed (see <b>hg commit --close-branch</b>).

       Use the command <b>hg update </b>to switch to an existing branch.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions such as <b>{branch}</b>. See also <b>hg</b>
       <b>help templates</b>.

       <b>active </b>Boolean. True if the branch is active.

       <b>closed </b>Boolean. True if the branch is closed.

       <b>current</b>
              Boolean. True if it is the current branch.

       Returns 0.

       Options:

       <b>-a, --active</b>
              show only branches that have unmerged heads (DEPRECATED)

       <b>-c, --closed</b>
              show normal and closed branches

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;VALUE[+]&gt;</b>
              show branch name(s) of the given rev

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>phase</b>
       set or show the current phase name:

       hg phase [-p|-d|-s] [-f] [-r] [REV...]

       With no argument, show the phase name of the current revision(s).

       With one of -p/--public, -d/--draft or -s/--secret, change the
       phase value of the specified revisions.

       Unless -f/--force is specified, <b>hg phase </b>won't move changesets
       from a lower phase to a higher phase. Phases are ordered as
       follows:

       public &lt; draft &lt; secret

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if some phases could not be changed.

       (For more information about the phases concept, see <b>hg help</b>
       <b>phases</b>.)

       Options:

       <b>-p, --public</b>
              set changeset phase to public

       <b>-d, --draft</b>
              set changeset phase to draft

       <b>-s, --secret</b>
              set changeset phase to secret

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              allow to move boundary backward

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              target revision

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>tag</b>
       add one or more tags for the current or given revision:

       hg tag [-f] [-l] [-m TEXT] [-d DATE] [-u USER] [-r REV] NAME...

       Name a particular revision using &lt;name&gt;.

       Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and
       are very useful to compare different revisions, to go back to
       significant earlier versions or to mark branch points as
       releases, etc. Changing an existing tag is normally disallowed;
       use -f/--force to override.

       If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is
       used.

       To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
       they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed
       similarly to other project files and can be hand-edited if
       necessary. This also means that tagging creates a new commit. The
       file ".hg/localtags" is used for local tags (not shared among
       repositories).

       Tag commits are usually made at the head of a branch. If the
       parent of the working directory is not a branch head, <b>hg tag</b>
       aborts; use -f/--force to force the tag commit to be based on a
       non-head changeset.

       See <b>hg help dates </b>for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Since tag names have priority over branch names during revision
       lookup, using an existing branch name as a tag name is
       discouraged.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              force tag

       <b>-l, --local</b>
              make the tag local

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              revision to tag

       <b>--remove</b>
              remove a tag

       <b>-e, --edit</b>
              invoke editor on commit messages

       <b>-m,</b><i>--message</i> <b>&lt;TEXT&gt;</b>
              use text as commit message

       <b>-d,</b><i>--date</i> <b>&lt;DATE&gt;</b>
              record the specified date as commit date

       <b>-u,</b><i>--user</i> <b>&lt;USER&gt;</b>
              record the specified user as committer

   <b>tags</b>
       list repository tags:

       hg tags

       This lists both regular and local tags. When the -v/--verbose
       switch is used, a third column "local" is printed for local tags.
       When the -q/--quiet switch is used, only the tag name is printed.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions such as <b>{tag}</b>. See also <b>hg help</b>
       <b>templates</b>.

       <b>type   </b>String. <b>local </b>for local tags.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

   <b>File content management</b>
   <b>annotate</b>
       show changeset information by line for each file:

       hg annotate [-r REV] [-f] [-a] [-u] [-d] [-n] [-c] [-l] FILE...

       List changes in files, showing the revision id responsible for
       each line.

       This command is useful for discovering when a change was made and
       by whom.

       If you include --file, --user, or --date, the revision number is
       suppressed unless you also include --number.

       Without the -a/--text option, annotate will avoid processing
       files it detects as binary. With -a, annotate will annotate the
       file anyway, although the results will probably be neither useful
       nor desirable.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

       <b>lines  </b>List of lines with annotation data.

       <b>path   </b>String. Repository-absolute path of the specified file.

       And each entry of <b>{lines} </b>provides the following sub-keywords in
       addition to <b>{date}</b>, <b>{node}</b>, <b>{rev}</b>, <b>{user}</b>, etc.

       <b>line   </b>String. Line content.

       <b>lineno </b>Integer. Line number at that revision.

       <b>path   </b>String. Repository-absolute path of the file at that
              revision.

       See <b>hg help templates.operators </b>for the list expansion syntax.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       hg cat [OPTION]... FILE...

       Print the specified files as they were at the given revision. If
       no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is
       used.

       Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
       given using a template string. See <b>hg help templates</b>. In addition
       to the common template keywords, the following formatting rules
       are supported:

       <b>%%</b>

              literal "%" character

       <b>%s</b>

              basename of file being printed

       <b>data   </b>String. File content.

       <b>path   </b>String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       Returns 0 on success.

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>copy</b>
       mark files as copied for the next commit:

       hg copy [OPTION]... (SOURCE... DEST | --forget DEST...)

       Mark dest as having copies of source files. If dest is a
       directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is a file,
       the source must be a single file.

       By default, this command copies the contents of files as they
       exist in the working directory. If invoked with -A/--after, the
       operation is recorded, but no copying is performed.

       To undo marking a destination file as copied, use --forget. With
       that option, all given (positional) arguments are unmarked as
       copies. The destination file(s) will be left in place (still
       tracked). Note that <b>hg copy --forget </b>behaves the same way as <b>hg</b>
       <b>rename --forget</b>.

       This command takes effect with the next commit by default.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

       Options:

       <b>--forget</b>
              unmark a destination file as copied

       <b>-A, --after</b>
              record a copy that has already occurred

   <b>diff</b>
       diff repository (or selected files):

       hg diff [OPTION]... ([-c REV] | [--from REV1] [--to REV2]) [FILE]...

       Show differences between revisions for the specified files.

       Differences between files are shown using the unified diff
       format.

       Note   <b>hg diff </b>may generate unexpected results for merges, as it
              will default to comparing against the working directory's
              first parent changeset if no revisions are specified.  To
              diff against the conflict regions, you can use <i>--config</i>
              <i>diff.merge=yes</i>.

       By default, the working directory files are compared to its first
       parent. To see the differences from another revision, use --from.
       To see the difference to another revision, use --to. For example,
       <b>hg diff --from .^ </b>will show the differences from the working
       copy's grandparent to the working copy, <b>hg diff --to . </b>will show
       the diff from the working copy to its parent (i.e. the reverse of
       the default), and <b>hg diff --from 1.0 --to 1.2 </b>will show the diff
       between those two revisions.

       Alternatively you can specify -c/--change with a revision to see
       the changes in that changeset relative to its first parent (i.e.
       <b>hg diff -c 42 </b>is equivalent to <b>hg diff --from 42^ --to 42</b>)

       Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of
       files it detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff
       anyway, probably with undesirable results.

       Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended
       diff format. For more information, read <b>hg help diffs</b>.

       Examples:

       • compare a file in the current working directory to its parent:

         hg diff foo.c

       • compare two historical versions of a directory, with rename
         info:

         hg diff --git --from 1.0 --to 1.2 lib/

       • get change stats relative to the last change on some date:

         hg diff --stat --from "date('may 2')"

       • diff all newly-added files that contain a keyword:

         hg diff "set:added() and grep(GNU)"

       • compare a revision and its parents:

         hg diff -c 9353                  # compare against first parent
         hg diff --from 9353^ --to 9353   # same using revset syntax
         hg diff --from 9353^2 --to 9353  # compare against the second parent

       Returns 0 on success.

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>grep</b>
       search for a pattern in specified files:

       hg grep [--diff] [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...

       Search the working directory or revision history for a regular
       expression in the specified files for the entire repository.

       By default, grep searches the repository files in the working
       directory and prints the files where it finds a match. To specify
       historical revisions instead of the working directory, use the
       --rev flag.

       To search instead historical revision differences that contains a
       change in match status ("-" for a match that becomes a non-match,
       or "+" for a non-match that becomes a match), use the --diff
       flag.

       PATTERN can be any Python (roughly Perl-compatible) regular
       expression.

       If no FILEs are specified and the --rev flag isn't supplied, all
       files in the working directory are searched. When using the --rev
       flag and specifying FILEs, use the --follow argument to also
       follow the specified FILEs across renames and copies.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

       <b>change </b>String. Character denoting insertion <b>+ </b>or removal <b>-</b>.
              Available if <b>--diff </b>is specified.

       <b>lineno </b>Integer. Line number of the match.

       <b>path   </b>String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       <b>texts  </b>List of text chunks.

       And each entry of <b>{texts} </b>provides the following sub-keywords.

       <b>matched</b>
              Boolean. True if the chunk matches the specified pattern.

       <b>text   </b>String. Chunk content.

       See <b>hg help templates.operators </b>for the list expansion syntax.

       Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

   <b>Change navigation</b>
   <b>bisect</b>
       subdivision search of changesets:

       hg bisect [-gbsr] [-U] [-c CMD] [REV]

       This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems.
       To use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem
       as bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the
       problem as good. Bisect will update your working directory to a
       revision for testing (unless the -U/--noupdate option is
       specified). Once you have performed tests, mark the working
       directory as good or bad, and bisect will either update to
       another candidate changeset or announce that it has found the bad
       revision.

       As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a
       revision as good or bad without checking it out first.

       If you supply a command, it will be used for automatic bisection.
       The environment variable HG_NODE will contain the ID of the
       changeset being tested. The exit status of the command will be
       used to mark revisions as good or bad: status 0 means good, 125
       means to skip the revision, 127 (command not found) will abort
       the bisection, and any other non-zero exit status means the
       revision is bad.

       Some examples:

       • start a bisection with known bad revision 34, and good revision
         12:

         hg bisect --bad 34
         hg bisect --good 12

       • advance the current bisection by marking current revision as
         good or bad:

         hg bisect --good
         hg bisect --bad

       • mark the current revision, or a known revision, to be skipped
         (e.g. if that revision is not usable because of another issue):

         hg bisect --skip
         hg bisect --skip 23

       • skip all revisions that do not touch directories <b>foo </b>or <b>bar</b>:

         hg bisect --skip "!( file('path:foo') &amp; file('path:bar') )"

       • forget the current bisection:

         hg bisect --reset

       • use 'make &amp;&amp; make tests' to automatically find the first broken
         revision:

         hg bisect --reset
         hg bisect --bad 34
         hg bisect --good 12
         hg bisect --command "make &amp;&amp; make tests"

       • see all changesets whose states are already known in the
         current bisection:

         hg log -r "bisect(pruned)"

       • see the changeset currently being bisected (especially useful
         if running with -U/--noupdate):

         hg log -r "bisect(current)"

       • see all changesets that took part in the current bisection:

         hg log -r "bisect(range)"

       • you can even get a nice graph:

         hg log --graph -r "bisect(range)"

       See <b>hg help revisions.bisect </b>for more about the <i>bisect()</i>
       predicate.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-r, --reset</b>
              reset bisect state

       <b>-g, --good</b>
              mark changeset good

       <b>-b, --bad</b>
              mark changeset bad

       <b>-s, --skip</b>
              skip testing changeset

       <b>-e, --extend</b>
              extend the bisect range

       <b>-c,</b><i>--command</i> <b>&lt;CMD&gt;</b>
              use command to check changeset state

       <b>-U, --noupdate</b>
              do not update to target

   <b>heads</b>
       show branch heads:

       hg heads [-ct] [-r STARTREV] [REV]...

       With no arguments, show all open branch heads in the repository.
       Branch heads are changesets that have no descendants on the same
       branch. They are where development generally takes place and are
       the usual targets for update and merge operations.

       If one or more REVs are given, only open branch heads on the
       branches associated with the specified changesets are shown. This
       means that you can use <b>hg heads . </b>to see the heads on the
       currently checked-out branch.

       If -c/--closed is specified, also show branch heads marked closed
       (see <b>hg commit --close-branch</b>).

       If STARTREV is specified, only those heads that are descendants
       of STARTREV will be displayed.

       If -t/--topo is specified, named branch mechanics will be ignored
       and only topological heads (changesets with no children) will be
       shown.

       Returns 0 if matching heads are found, 1 if not.

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;STARTREV&gt;</b>
              show only heads which are descendants of STARTREV

       <b>-t, --topo</b>
              show topological heads only

       <b>-a, --active</b>
              show active branchheads only (DEPRECATED)

       <b>-c, --closed</b>
              show normal and closed branch heads

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

   <b>identify</b>
       identify the working directory or specified revision:

       hg identify [-nibtB] [-r REV] [SOURCE]

       Print a summary identifying the repository state at REV using one
       or two parent hash identifiers, followed by a "+" if the working
       directory has uncommitted changes, the branch name (if not
       default), a list of tags, and a list of bookmarks.

       When REV is not given, print a summary of the current state of
       the repository including the working directory. Specify -r. to
       get information of the working directory parent without scanning
       uncommitted changes.

       Specifying a path to a repository root or Mercurial bundle will
       cause lookup to operate on that repository/bundle.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

       <b>dirty  </b>String. Character <b>+ </b>denoting if the working directory has
              uncommitted changes.

       <b>id     </b>String. One or two nodes, optionally followed by <b>+</b>.

       <b>parents</b>
              List of strings. Parent nodes of the changeset.

       Examples:

       • generate a build identifier for the working directory:

         hg id --id &gt; build-id.dat

       • find the revision corresponding to a tag:

         hg id -n -r 1.3

       • check the most recent revision of a remote repository:

         hg id -r tip <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/</a>

       See <b>hg log </b>for generating more information about specific
       revisions, including full hash identifiers.

       Returns 0 if successful.

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              identify the specified revision

       <b>-n, --num</b>
              show local revision number

       <b>-i, --id</b>
              show global revision id

       <b>-b, --branch</b>
              show branch

       <b>-t, --tags</b>
              show tags

       <b>-B, --bookmarks</b>
              show bookmarks

       <b>-e,</b><i>--ssh</i> <b>&lt;CMD&gt;</b>
              specify ssh command to use

       <b>--remotecmd </b><i>&lt;CMD&gt;</i>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       <b>--insecure</b>
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts
              config)

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

          aliases: id

   <b>log</b>
       show revision history of entire repository or files:

       hg log [OPTION]... [FILE]

       Print the revision history of the specified files or the entire
       project.

       If no revision range is specified, the default is <b>tip:0 </b>unless
       --follow is set.

       File history is shown without following rename or copy history of
       files. Use -f/--follow with a filename to follow history across
       renames and copies. --follow without a filename will only show
       ancestors of the starting revisions. The starting revisions can
       be specified by -r/--rev, which default to the working directory
       parent.

       By default this command prints revision number and changeset id,
       tags, non-trivial parents, user, date and time, and a summary for
       each commit. When the -v/--verbose switch is used, the list of
       changed files and full commit message are shown.

       With --graph the revisions are shown as an ASCII art DAG with the
       most recent changeset at the top.  'o' is a changeset, '@' is a
       working directory parent, '%' is a changeset involved in an
       unresolved merge conflict, '_' closes a branch, 'x' is obsolete,
       '*' is unstable, and '+' represents a fork where the changeset
       from the lines below is a parent of the 'o' merge on the same
       line.  Paths in the DAG are represented with '|', '/' and so
       forth. ':' in place of a '|' indicates one or more revisions in a
       path are omitted.

       Use -L/--line-range FILE,M:N options to follow the history of
       lines from M to N in FILE. With -p/--patch only diff hunks
       affecting specified line range will be shown. This option
       requires --follow; it can be specified multiple times. Currently,
       this option is not compatible with --graph. This option is
       experimental.

       Note   <b>hg log --patch </b>may generate unexpected diff output for
              merge changesets, as it will only compare the merge
              changeset against its first parent. Also, only files
              different from BOTH parents will appear in files:.

       Note   For performance reasons, <b>hg log FILE </b>may omit duplicate
              changes made on branches and will not show removals or
              mode changes. To see all such changes, use the --removed
              switch.

       Note   The history resulting from -L/--line-range options depends
              on diff options; for instance if white-spaces are ignored,
              respective changes with only white-spaces in specified
              line range will not be listed.

       Some examples:

       • changesets with full descriptions and file lists:

         hg log -v

       • changesets ancestral to the working directory:

         hg log -f

       • last 10 commits on the current branch:

         hg log -l 10 -b .

       • changesets showing all modifications of a file, including
         removals:

         hg log --removed file.c

       • all changesets that touch a directory, with diffs, excluding
         merges:

         hg log -Mp lib/

       • all revision numbers that match a keyword:

         hg log -k bug --template "{rev}\n"

       • the full hash identifier of the working directory parent:

         hg log -r . --template "{node}\n"

       • list available log templates:

         hg log -T list

       • check if a given changeset is included in a tagged release:

         hg log -r "a21ccf and ancestor(1.9)"

       • find all changesets by some user in a date range:

         hg log -k alice -d "may 2008 to jul 2008"

       • summary of all changesets after the last tag:

         hg log -r "last(tagged())::" --template "{desc|firstline}\n"

       • changesets touching lines 13 to 23 for file.c:

         hg log -L file.c,13:23

       • changesets touching lines 13 to 23 for file.c and lines 2 to 6
         of main.c with patch:

         hg log -L file.c,13:23 -L main.c,2:6 -p

       most recently added to the repository (and therefore the most
       recently changed head).

       If you have just made a commit, that commit will be the tip. If
       you have just pulled changes from another repository, the tip of
       that repository becomes the current tip. The "tip" tag is special
       and cannot be renamed or assigned to a different changeset.

       This command is deprecated, please use <b>hg heads </b>instead.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-p, --patch</b>
              show patch

       <b>-g, --git</b>
              use git extended diff format

       <b>--style </b><i>&lt;STYLE&gt;</i>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

   <b>Working directory management</b>
   <b>add</b>
       add the specified files on the next commit:

       hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the
       repository.

       The files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To
       undo an add before that, see <b>hg forget</b>.

       If no names are given, add all files to the repository (except
       files matching <b>.hgignore</b>).

       Examples:

          • New (unknown) files are added automatically by <b>hg add</b>:

            $ ls
            foo.c
            $ hg status
            ? foo.c
            $ hg add
            adding foo.c
            $ hg status
            A foo.c

          • Specific files to be added can be specified:

            $ ls
            bar.c  foo.c
            $ hg status
            ? bar.c
            ? foo.c
            $ hg add bar.c
            $ hg status
            A bar.c
            ? foo.c

       Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

       Options:

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       <b>-S, --subrepos</b>
              recurse into subrepositories

       <b>-n, --dry-run</b>
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>addremove</b>
       add all new files, delete all missing files:

       hg addremove [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Add all new files and remove all missing files from the
       repository.

       Unless names are given, new files are ignored if they match any
       of the patterns in <b>.hgignore</b>. As with add, these changes take
       effect at the next commit.

       Use the -s/--similarity option to detect renamed files. This
       option takes a percentage between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files
       must be identical) as its parameter. With a parameter greater
       than 0, this compares every removed file with every added file
       and records those similar enough as renames. Detecting renamed
       files this way can be expensive. After using this option, <b>hg</b>
       <b>status -C </b>can be used to check which files were identified as
       moved or renamed. If not specified, -s/--similarity defaults to
       100 and only renames of identical files are detected.

       Examples:

          • A number of files (bar.c and foo.c) are new, while foobar.c
            has been removed (without using <b>hg remove</b>) from the
            repository:

            $ ls
            bar.c foo.c
            $ hg status
            ! foobar.c
            ? bar.c
            ? foo.c
            $ hg addremove
            adding bar.c
            adding foo.c
            removing foobar.c
            $ hg status
            A bar.c
            A foo.c
            R foobar.c

          • A file foobar.c was moved to foo.c without using <b>hg rename</b>.
            Afterwards, it was edited slightly:

            $ ls
            foo.c
            $ hg status
            ! foobar.c
            ? foo.c
            $ hg addremove --similarity 90
            removing foobar.c
            adding foo.c
            recording removal of foobar.c as rename to foo.c (94% similar)
            $ hg status -C
            A foo.c
              foobar.c
            R foobar.c

       Returns 0 if all files are successfully added.

       Options:

       <b>-s,</b><i>--similarity</i> <b>&lt;SIMILARITY&gt;</b>
              guess renamed files by similarity (0&lt;=s&lt;=100)

       <b>-S, --subrepos</b>
              recurse into subrepositories

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       <b>-n, --dry-run</b>
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>files</b>
       list tracked files:

       hg files [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Print files under Mercurial control in the working directory or
       specified revision for given files (excluding removed files).
       Files can be specified as filenames or filesets.

       If no files are given to match, this command prints the names of
       all files under Mercurial control.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

       <b>flags  </b>String. Character denoting file's symlink and executable
              bits.

       <b>path   </b>String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       <b>size   </b>Integer. Size of the file in bytes.

       Examples:

       • list all files under the current directory:

         hg files .

       • shows sizes and flags for current revision:

         hg files -vr .

       • list all files named README:

         hg files -I "**/README"

       • list all binary files:

         hg files "set:binary()"

       • find files containing a regular expression:

         hg files "set:grep('bob')"

       • search tracked file contents with xargs and grep:

         hg files -0 | xargs -0 grep foo

       See <b>hg help patterns </b>and <b>hg help filesets </b>for more information on
       specifying file patterns.

       Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              search the repository as it is in REV

       <b>-0, --print0</b>
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

       <b>-S, --subrepos</b>
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>forget</b>
       forget the specified files on the next commit:

       hg forget [OPTION]... FILE...

       Mark the specified files so they will no longer be tracked after
       the next commit.

       This only removes files from the current branch, not from the
       entire project history, and it does not delete them from the
       working directory.

       To delete the file from the working directory, see <b>hg remove</b>.

       To undo a forget before the next commit, see <b>hg add</b>.

       Examples:

       • forget newly-added binary files:

         hg forget "set:added() and binary()"

       • forget files that would be excluded by .hgignore:

         hg forget "set:hgignore()"

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-i, --interactive</b>
              use interactive mode

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       <b>-n, --dry-run</b>
              do not perform actions, just print output

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>locate</b>
       locate files matching specific patterns (DEPRECATED):

       hg locate [OPTION]... [PATTERN]...

       Print files under Mercurial control in the working directory
       whose names match the given patterns.

       By default, this command searches all directories in the working
       directory. To search just the current directory and its
       subdirectories, use "--include .".

       If no patterns are given to match, this command prints the names
       of all files under Mercurial control in the working directory.

       If you want to feed the output of this command into the "xargs"
       command, use the -0 option to both this command and "xargs". This
       will avoid the problem of "xargs" treating single filenames that
       contain whitespace as multiple filenames.

       See <b>hg help files </b>for a more versatile command.

       Returns 0 if a match is found, 1 otherwise.

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              search the repository as it is in REV

       <b>-0, --print0</b>
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs

       <b>-f, --fullpath</b>
              print complete paths from the filesystem root

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>purge</b>
       removes files not tracked by Mercurial:

       hg purge [OPTION]... [DIR]...

       Delete files not known to Mercurial. This is useful to test local
       and uncommitted changes in an otherwise-clean source tree.

       This means that purge will delete the following by default:

       • Unknown files: files marked with "?" by <b>hg status</b>

       • Empty directories: in fact Mercurial ignores directories unless
         they contain files under source control management

       But it will leave untouched:

       • Modified and unmodified tracked files

       • Ignored files (unless -i or --all is specified)

       • New files added to the repository (with <b>hg add</b>)

       The --files and --dirs options can be used to direct purge to
       delete only files, only directories, or both. If neither option
       is given, both will be deleted.

       If directories are given on the command line, only files in these
       directories are considered.

       Be careful with purge, as you could irreversibly delete some
       files you forgot to add to the repository. If you only want to
       print the list of files that this program would delete, use the
       --print option.

       Options:

       <b>-a, --abort-on-err</b>
              abort if an error occurs

       <b>--all  </b>purge ignored files too

       <b>-i, --ignored</b>
              purge only ignored files

       <b>--dirs </b>purge empty directories

       <b>--files</b>
              purge files

       <b>-p, --print</b>
              print filenames instead of deleting them

       <b>-0, --print0</b>
              end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs (implies
              -p/--print)

       <b>--confirm</b>
              ask before permanently deleting files

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: clean

   <b>remove</b>
       remove the specified files on the next commit:

       hg remove [OPTION]... FILE...

       Schedule the indicated files for removal from the current branch.

       This command schedules the files to be removed at the next
       commit.  To undo a remove before that, see <b>hg revert</b>. To undo
       added files, see <b>hg forget</b>.

       -A/--after can be used to remove only files that have already
       been deleted, -f/--force can be used to force deletion, and -Af
       can be used to remove files from the next revision without
       deleting them from the working directory.

       The following table details the behavior of remove for different
       file states (columns) and option combinations (rows). The file
       states are Added [A], Clean [C], Modified [M] and Missing [!]
       (as reported by <b>hg status</b>). The actions are Warn, Remove (from
       branch) and Delete (from disk):
                       ┌───────────┬───┬────┬────┬───┐
                       │ opt/state │ A │ C  │ M  │ ! │

                       └───────────┴───┴────┴────┴───┘

       Note   <b>hg remove </b>never deletes files in Added [A] state from the
              working directory, not even if <b>--force </b>is specified.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if any warnings encountered.

       Options:

       <b>-A, --after</b>
              record delete for missing files

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              forget added files, delete modified files

       <b>-S, --subrepos</b>
              recurse into subrepositories

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>

   <b>rename</b>
       rename files; equivalent of copy + remove:

       hg rename [OPTION]... SOURCE... DEST

       Mark dest as copies of sources; mark sources for deletion. If
       dest is a directory, copies are put in that directory. If dest is
       a file, there can only be one source.

       By default, this command copies the contents of files as they
       exist in the working directory. If invoked with -A/--after, the
       operation is recorded, but no copying is performed.

       To undo marking a destination file as renamed, use --forget. With
       that option, all given (positional) arguments are unmarked as
       renames. The destination file(s) will be left in place (still
       tracked). The source file(s) will not be restored. Note that <b>hg</b>
       <b>rename --forget </b>behaves the same way as <b>hg copy --forget</b>.

       This command takes effect with the next commit by default.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

       Options:

       <b>--forget</b>
              unmark a destination file as renamed

       <b>-A, --after</b>
              record a rename that has already occurred

       <b>--at-rev </b><i>&lt;REV&gt;</i>
              (un)mark renames in the given revision (EXPERIMENTAL)

       <b>-f, --force</b>

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

          aliases: move mv

   <b>resolve</b>
       redo merges or set/view the merge status of files:

       hg resolve [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Merges with unresolved conflicts are often the result of
       non-interactive merging using the <b>internal:merge </b>configuration
       setting, or a command-line merge tool like <b>diff3</b>. The resolve
       command is used to manage the files involved in a merge, after <b>hg</b>
       <b>merge </b>has been run, and before <b>hg commit </b>is run (i.e. the working
       directory must have two parents). See <b>hg help merge-tools </b>for
       information on configuring merge tools.

       The resolve command can be used in the following ways:

       • <b>hg resolve [--re-merge] [--tool TOOL] FILE...</b>: attempt to
         re-merge the specified files, discarding any previous merge
         attempts. Re-merging is not performed for files already marked
         as resolved. Use <b>--all/-a </b>to select all unresolved files.
         <b>--tool </b>can be used to specify the merge tool used for the given
         files. It overrides the HGMERGE environment variable and your
         configuration files.  Previous file contents are saved with a
         <b>.orig </b>suffix.

       • <b>hg resolve -m [FILE]</b>: mark a file as having been resolved (e.g.
         after having manually fixed-up the files). The default is to
         mark all unresolved files.

       • <b>hg resolve -u [FILE]...</b>: mark a file as unresolved. The default
         is to mark all resolved files.

       • <b>hg resolve -l</b>: list files which had or still have conflicts.
         In the printed list, <b>U </b>= unresolved and <b>R </b>= resolved.  You can
         use <b>set:unresolved() </b>or <b>set:resolved() </b>to filter the list. See
         <b>hg help filesets </b>for details.

       Note   Mercurial will not let you commit files with unresolved
              merge conflicts. You must use <b>hg resolve -m ... </b>before you
              can commit after a conflicting merge.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

       <b>mergestatus</b>
              String. Character denoting merge conflicts, <b>U </b>or <b>R</b>.

       <b>path   </b>String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if any files fail a resolve attempt.

       Options:

       <b>-a, --all</b>
              select all unresolved files

       <b>-l, --list</b>
              list state of files needing merge

       <b>-m, --mark</b>
              mark files as resolved

       <b>-u, --unmark</b>
              mark files as unresolved

       <b>-n, --no-status</b>
              hide status prefix

       <b>--re-merge</b>

   <b>revert</b>
       restore files to their checkout state:

       hg revert [OPTION]... [-r REV] [NAME]...

       Note   To check out earlier revisions, you should use <b>hg update</b>
              <b>REV</b>.  To cancel an uncommitted merge (and lose your
              changes), use <b>hg merge --abort</b>.

       With no revision specified, revert the specified files or
       directories to the contents they had in the parent of the working
       directory.  This restores the contents of files to an unmodified
       state and unschedules adds, removes, copies, and renames. If the
       working directory has two parents, you must explicitly specify a
       revision.

       Using the -r/--rev or -d/--date options, revert the given files
       or directories to their states as of a specific revision. Because
       revert does not change the working directory parents, this will
       cause these files to appear modified. This can be helpful to
       "back out" some or all of an earlier change. See <b>hg backout </b>for a
       related method.

       Modified files are saved with a .orig suffix before reverting.
       To disable these backups, use --no-backup. It is possible to
       store the backup files in a custom directory relative to the root
       of the repository by setting the <b>ui.origbackuppath </b>configuration
       option.

       See <b>hg help dates </b>for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       See <b>hg help backout </b>for a way to reverse the effect of an earlier
       changeset.

       Returns 0 on success.

   <b>root</b>
       print the root (top) of the current working directory:

       hg root

       Print the root directory of the current repository.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

       <b>hgpath </b>String. Path to the .hg directory.

       <b>storepath</b>
              String. Path to the directory holding versioned data.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

   <b>shelve</b>
       save and set aside changes from the working directory:

       hg shelve [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Shelving takes files that "hg status" reports as not clean, saves
       the modifications to a bundle (a shelved change), and reverts the
       files so that their state in the working directory becomes clean.

       To restore these changes to the working directory, using "hg
       unshelve"; this will work even if you switch to a different
       commit.

       When no files are specified, "hg shelve" saves all not-clean
       files. If specific files or directories are named, only changes
       to those files are shelved.

       In bare shelve (when no files are specified, without interactive,
       include and exclude option), shelving remembers information if
       the working directory was on newly created branch, in other words
       working directory was on different branch than its first parent.
       In this situation unshelving restores branch information to the
       working directory.

       Each shelved change has a name that makes it easier to find
       later.  The name of a shelved change defaults to being based on
       the active bookmark, or if there is no active bookmark, the
       current named branch.  To specify a different name, use <b>--name</b>.

       To see a list of existing shelved changes, use the <b>--list </b>option.
       For each shelved change, this will print its name, age, and
       description; use <b>--patch </b>or <b>--stat </b>for more details.

       To delete specific shelved changes, use <b>--delete</b>. To delete all
       shelved changes, use <b>--cleanup</b>.

       Options:

       <b>-A, --addremove</b>
              mark new/missing files as added/removed before shelving

       <b>-u, --unknown</b>
              store unknown files in the shelve

       <b>--cleanup</b>
              delete all shelved changes

       <b>--date </b><i>&lt;DATE&gt;</i>
              shelve with the specified commit date

       <b>-d, --delete</b>
              delete the named shelved change(s)

       <b>-e, --edit</b>
              invoke editor on commit messages

       <b>-k, --keep</b>
              shelve, but keep changes in the working directory

       <b>-l, --list</b>
              list current shelves

       <b>-m,</b><i>--message</i> <b>&lt;TEXT&gt;</b>
              use text as shelve message

       <b>-n,</b><i>--name</i> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
              use the given name for the shelved commit

       <b>-p, --patch</b>
              output patches for changes (provide the names of the
              shelved changes as positional arguments)

       <b>-i, --interactive</b>
              interactive mode

       <b>--stat </b>output diffstat-style summary of changes (provide the
              names of the shelved changes as positional arguments)

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>status</b>
       show changed files in the working directory:

       hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Show status of files in the repository. If names are given, only
       files that match are shown. Files that are clean or ignored or
       the source of a copy/move operation, are not listed unless
       -c/--clean, -i/--ignored, -C/--copies or -A/--all are given.
       Unless options described with "show only ..." are given, the
       options -mardu are used.

       Option -q/--quiet hides untracked (unknown and ignored) files
       unless explicitly requested with -u/--unknown or -i/--ignored.

       Note   <b>hg status </b>may appear to disagree with diff if permissions
              have changed or a merge has occurred. The standard diff
              format does not report permission changes and diff only
              reports changes relative to one merge parent.

       If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision.  If
       two revisions are given, the differences between them are shown.
       The --change option can also be used as a shortcut to list the
       changed files of a revision from its first parent.

       The codes used to show the status of files are:

       M = modified
       A = added
       R = removed
       C = clean
       ! = missing (deleted by non-hg command, but still tracked)
       ? = not tracked
       I = ignored
         = origin of the previous file (with --copies)

       The -t/--terse option abbreviates the output by showing only the
       directory name if all the files in it share the same status. The
       option takes an argument indicating the statuses to abbreviate:
       'm' for 'modified', 'a' for 'added', 'r' for 'removed', 'd' for
       'deleted', 'u' for 'unknown', 'i' for 'ignored' and 'c' for
       clean.

       It abbreviates only those statuses which are passed. Note that
       clean and ignored files are not displayed with '--terse ic'
       unless the -c/--clean and -i/--ignored options are also used.

       The -v/--verbose option shows information when the repository is
       in an unfinished merge, shelve, rebase state etc. You can have
       this behavior turned on by default by enabling the
       <b>commands.status.verbose </b>option.

       You can skip displaying some of these states by setting
       <b>commands.status.skipstates </b>to one or more of: 'bisect', 'graft',
       'histedit', 'merge', 'rebase', or 'unshelve'.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

       <b>path   </b>String. Repository-absolute path of the file.

       <b>source </b>String. Repository-absolute path of the file originated
              from.  Available if <b>--copies </b>is specified.

       <b>status </b>String. Character denoting file's status.

       Examples:

       • show changes in the working directory relative to a changeset:

         hg status --rev 9353

       • show changes in the working directory relative to the current
         directory (see <b>hg help patterns </b>for more information):

         hg status re:

       • show all changes including copies in an existing changeset:

         hg status --copies --change 9353

       • get a NUL separated list of added files, suitable for xargs:

         hg status -an0

       • show more information about the repository status, abbreviating
         added, removed, modified, deleted, and untracked paths:

         hg status -v -t mardu

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-A, --all</b>
              show status of all files

       <b>-m, --modified</b>

       <b>-r, --removed</b>
              show only removed files

       <b>-d, --deleted</b>
              show only missing files

       <b>-c, --clean</b>
              show only files without changes

       <b>-u, --unknown</b>
              show only unknown (not tracked) files

       <b>-i, --ignored</b>
              show only ignored files

       <b>-n, --no-status</b>

   <b>summary</b>
       summarize working directory state:

       hg summary [--remote]

       This generates a brief summary of the working directory state,
       including parents, branch, commit status, phase and available
       updates.

       With the --remote option, this will check the default paths for
       incoming and outgoing changes. This can be time-consuming.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>--remote</b>
              check for push and pull

          aliases: sum

   <b>unshelve</b>
       restore a shelved change to the working directory:

       hg unshelve [OPTION]... [[-n] SHELVED]

       This command accepts an optional name of a shelved change to
       restore. If none is given, the most recent shelved change is
       used.

       If a shelved change is applied successfully, the bundle that
       contains the shelved changes is moved to a backup location
       (.hg/shelve-backup).

       Since you can restore a shelved change on top of an arbitrary
       commit, it is possible that unshelving will result in a conflict
       between your changes and the commits you are unshelving onto. If
       this occurs, you must resolve the conflict, then use <b>--continue</b>
       to complete the unshelve operation. (The bundle will not be moved
       until you successfully complete the unshelve.)

       (Alternatively, you can use <b>--abort </b>to abandon an unshelve that
       causes a conflict. This reverts the unshelved changes, and leaves
       the bundle in place.)

       If bare shelved change (without interactive, include and exclude
       option) was done on newly created branch it would restore branch
       information to the working directory.

       After a successful unshelve, the shelved changes are stored in a
       backup directory. Only the N most recent backups are kept. N
       defaults to 10 but can be overridden using the <b>shelve.maxbackups</b>
       configuration option.

       Timestamp in seconds is used to decide order of backups. More
       than <b>maxbackups </b>backups are kept, if same timestamp prevents from
       deciding exact order of them, for safety.

       Selected changes can be unshelved with <b>--interactive </b>flag.  The
       working directory is updated with the selected changes, and only
       the unselected changes remain shelved.  Note: The whole shelve is
       applied to working directory first before running interactively.
       So, this will bring up all the conflicts between working
       directory and the shelve, irrespective of which changes will be
       unshelved.

       Options:

       <b>-a, --abort</b>
              abort an incomplete unshelve operation

       <b>-c, --continue</b>
              continue an incomplete unshelve operation

       <b>-i, --interactive</b>
              use interactive mode (EXPERIMENTAL)

       <b>-k, --keep</b>
              keep shelve after unshelving

       <b>-n,</b><i>--name</i> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
              restore shelved change with given name

       <b>-t,</b><i>--tool</i> <b>&lt;VALUE&gt;</b>
              specify merge tool

       <b>--date </b><i>&lt;DATE&gt;</i>
              set date for temporary commits (DEPRECATED)

   <b>update</b>
       update working directory (or switch revisions):

       hg update [-C|-c|-m] [-d DATE] [[-r] REV]

       Update the repository's working directory to the specified
       changeset. If no changeset is specified, update to the tip of the
       current named branch and move the active bookmark (see <b>hg help</b>
       <b>bookmarks</b>).

       Update sets the working directory's parent revision to the
       specified changeset (see <b>hg help parents</b>).

       If the changeset is not a descendant or ancestor of the working
       directory's parent and there are uncommitted changes, the update
       is aborted. With the -c/--check option, the working directory is
       checked for uncommitted changes; if none are found, the working
       directory is updated to the specified changeset.

       The -C/--clean, -c/--check, and -m/--merge options control what
       happens if the working directory contains uncommitted changes.
       At most of one of them can be specified.

       1. If no option is specified, and if the requested changeset is
          an ancestor or descendant of the working directory's parent,
          the uncommitted changes are merged into the requested
          changeset and the merged result is left uncommitted. If the
          requested changeset is not an ancestor or descendant (that is,
          it is on another branch), the update is aborted and the
          uncommitted changes are preserved.

       2. With the -m/--merge option, the update is allowed even if the
          requested changeset is not an ancestor or descendant of the
          working directory's parent.

       3. With the -c/--check option, the update is aborted and the
          uncommitted changes are preserved.

       4. With the -C/--clean option, uncommitted changes are discarded
          and the working directory is updated to the requested
          changeset.

       To cancel an uncommitted merge (and lose your changes), use <b>hg</b>
       <b>merge --abort</b>.

       Use null as the changeset to remove the working directory (like
       <b>hg clone -U</b>).

       If you want to revert just one file to an older revision, use <b>hg</b>
       <b>revert [-r REV] NAME</b>.

       See <b>hg help dates </b>for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if there are unresolved files.

       Options:

       <b>-C, --clean</b>
              discard uncommitted changes (no backup)

       <b>-c, --check</b>

   <b>Change import/export</b>
   <b>archive</b>
       create an unversioned archive of a repository revision:

       hg archive [OPTION]... DEST

       By default, the revision used is the parent of the working
       directory; use -r/--rev to specify a different revision.

       The archive type is automatically detected based on file
       extension (to override, use -t/--type).

       Examples:

       • create a zip file containing the 1.0 release:

         hg archive -r 1.0 project-1.0.zip

       • create a tarball excluding .hg files:

         hg archive project.tar.gz -X ".hg*"

       Valid types are:

       <b>files</b>

              a directory full of files (default)

       <b>tar</b>

              tar archive, uncompressed

       <b>tbz2</b>

              tar archive, compressed using bzip2

       <b>tgz</b>

              tar archive, compressed using gzip

       <b>txz</b>

              tar archive, compressed using lzma (only in Python 3)

       <b>uzip</b>

              zip archive, uncompressed

       <b>zip</b>

              zip archive, compressed using deflate

       The exact name of the destination archive or directory is given
       using a format string; see <b>hg help export </b>for details.

       Each member added to an archive file has a directory prefix
       prepended. Use -p/--prefix to specify a format string for the
       prefix. The default is the basename of the archive, with suffixes
       removed.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>--no-decode</b>

   <b>bundle</b>
       create a bundle file:

       hg bundle [-f] [-t BUNDLESPEC] [-a] [-r REV]... [--base REV]... FILE [DEST]...

       Generate a bundle file containing data to be transferred to
       another repository.

       To create a bundle containing all changesets, use -a/--all (or
       --base null). Otherwise, hg assumes the destination will have all
       the nodes you specify with --base parameters. Otherwise, hg will
       assume the repository has all the nodes in destination, or
       default-push/default if no destination is specified, where
       destination is the repositories you provide through DEST option.

       You can change bundle format with the -t/--type option. See <b>hg</b>
       <b>help bundlespec </b>for documentation on this format. By default, the
       most appropriate format is used and compression defaults to
       bzip2.

       The bundle file can then be transferred using conventional means
       and applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull
       command. This is useful when direct push and pull are not
       available or when exporting an entire repository is undesirable.

       Applying bundles preserves all changeset contents including
       permissions, copy/rename information, and revision history.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if no changes found.

       Options:

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              run even when the destination is unrelated

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              a changeset intended to be added to the destination

       <b>-b,</b><i>--branch</i> <b>&lt;BRANCH[+]&gt;</b>
              a specific branch you would like to bundle

       <b>--base </b><i>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</i>
              a base changeset assumed to be available at the
              destination

       <b>-a, --all</b>
              bundle all changesets in the repository

       <b>-t,</b><i>--type</i> <b>&lt;TYPE&gt;</b>
              bundle compression type to use (default: bzip2)

       <b>-e,</b><i>--ssh</i> <b>&lt;CMD&gt;</b>
              specify ssh command to use

       <b>--remotecmd </b><i>&lt;CMD&gt;</i>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       <b>--insecure</b>
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts
              config)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>export</b>
       dump the header and diffs for one or more changesets:

       hg export [OPTION]... [-o OUTFILESPEC] [-r] [REV]...

       Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more revisions.
       If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is
       used.

       The information shown in the changeset header is: author, date,
       branch name (if non-default), changeset hash, parent(s) and
       commit comment.

       Note   <b>hg export </b>may generate unexpected diff output for merge
              changesets, as it will compare the merge changeset against
              its first parent only.

       Output may be to a file, in which case the name of the file is
       given using a template string. See <b>hg help templates</b>. In addition
       to the common template keywords, the following formatting rules
       are supported:

       <b>%%</b>

              literal "%" character

       <b>%H</b>

              changeset hash (40 hexadecimal digits)

       <b>%N</b>

              number of patches being generated

       <b>%R</b>

              changeset revision number

       <b>%b</b>

              basename of the exporting repository

       <b>%h</b>

              short-form changeset hash (12 hexadecimal digits)

       <b>%m</b>

              first line of the commit message (only alphanumeric
              characters)

       <b>%n</b>

              zero-padded sequence number, starting at 1

       <b>%r</b>

              zero-padded changeset revision number

       <b>\</b>

              literal "" character

       Without the -a/--text option, export will avoid generating diffs
       of files it detects as binary. With -a, export will generate a
       diff anyway, probably with undesirable results.

       With -B/--bookmark changesets reachable by the given bookmark are
       selected.

       Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended
       diff format. See <b>hg help diffs </b>for more information.

       With the --switch-parent option, the diff will be against the
       second parent. It can be useful to review a merge.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported in addition to the common
       template keywords and functions. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

       <b>diff   </b>String. Diff content.

       <b>parents</b>
              List of strings. Parent nodes of the changeset.

       Examples:

       • use export and import to transplant a bugfix to the current
         branch:

         hg export -r 9353 | hg import -

       • export all the changesets between two revisions to a file with
         rename information:

         hg export --git -r 123:150 &gt; changes.txt

       • split outgoing changes into a series of patches with
         descriptive names:

         hg export -r "outgoing()" -o "%n-%m.patch"

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-B,</b><i>--bookmark</i> <b>&lt;BOOKMARK&gt;</b>
              export changes only reachable by given bookmark

       <b>-o,</b><i>--output</i> <b>&lt;FORMAT&gt;</b>
              print output to file with formatted name

       <b>--switch-parent</b>
              diff against the second parent

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              revisions to export

       <b>-a, --text</b>
              treat all files as text

       <b>-g, --git</b>
              use git extended diff format (DEFAULT: diff.git)

       <b>--binary</b>
              generate binary diffs in git mode (default)

       <b>--nodates</b>
              omit dates from diff headers

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>import</b>
       import an ordered set of patches:

       hg import [OPTION]... PATCH...

       Import a list of patches and commit them individually (unless
       --no-commit is specified).

       To read a patch from standard input (stdin), use "-" as the patch
       name. If a URL is specified, the patch will be downloaded from
       there.

       Import first applies changes to the working directory (unless
       --bypass is specified), import will abort if there are
       outstanding changes.

       Use --bypass to apply and commit patches directly to the
       repository, without affecting the working directory. Without
       --exact, patches will be applied on top of the working directory
       parent revision.

       You can import a patch straight from a mail message. Even patches
       as attachments work (to use the body part, it must have type
       text/plain or text/x-patch). From and Subject headers of email
       message are used as default committer and commit message. All
       text/plain body parts before first diff are added to the commit
       message.

       If the imported patch was generated by <b>hg export</b>, user and
       description from patch override values from message headers and
       body. Values given on command line with -m/--message and
       -u/--user override these.

       If --exact is specified, import will set the working directory to
       the parent of each patch before applying it, and will abort if
       the resulting changeset has a different ID than the one recorded
       in the patch. This will guard against various ways that portable
       patch formats and mail systems might fail to transfer Mercurial
       data or metadata. See <b>hg bundle </b>for lossless transmission.

       Use --partial to ensure a changeset will be created from the
       patch even if some hunks fail to apply. Hunks that fail to apply
       will be written to a &lt;target-file&gt;.rej file. Conflicts can then
       be resolved by hand before <b>hg commit --amend </b>is run to update the
       created changeset. This flag exists to let people import patches
       that partially apply without losing the associated metadata
       (author, date, description, ...).

       Note   When no hunks apply cleanly, <b>hg import --partial </b>will
              create an empty changeset, importing only the patch
              metadata.

       With -s/--similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and
       copies in the patch in the same way as <b>hg addremove</b>.

       It is possible to use external patch programs to perform the
       patch by setting the <b>ui.patch </b>configuration option. For the
       default internal tool, the fuzz can also be configured via
       <b>patch.fuzz</b>.  See <b>hg help config </b>for more information about
       configuration files and how to use these options.

       See <b>hg help dates </b>for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Examples:

       • import a traditional patch from a website and detect renames:

         hg import -s 80 <a href="http://example.com/bugfix.patch">http://example.com/bugfix.patch</a>

       • import a changeset from an hgweb server:

         hg import <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/5ca8c111e9aa">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/rev/5ca8c111e9aa</a>

       • import all the patches in an Unix-style mbox:

         hg import incoming-patches.mbox

       • import patches from stdin:

         hg import -

       • attempt to exactly restore an exported changeset (not always
         possible):

         hg import --exact proposed-fix.patch

       • use an external tool to apply a patch which is too fuzzy for
         the default internal tool.

            hg import --config ui.patch="patch --merge" fuzzy.patch

       • change the default fuzzing from 2 to a less strict 7

            hg import --config ui.fuzz=7 fuzz.patch

       Returns 0 on success, 1 on partial success (see --partial).

       Options:

       <b>-p,</b><i>--strip</i> <b>&lt;NUM&gt;</b>
              directory strip option for patch. This has the same
              meaning as the corresponding patch option (default: 1)

              record the specified user as committer

       <b>-s,</b><i>--similarity</i> <b>&lt;SIMILARITY&gt;</b>
              guess renamed files by similarity (0&lt;=s&lt;=100)

          aliases: patch

   <b>unbundle</b>
       apply one or more bundle files:

       hg unbundle [-u] FILE...

       Apply one or more bundle files generated by <b>hg bundle</b>.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if an update has unresolved files.

       Options:

       <b>-u, --update</b>
              update to new branch head if changesets were unbundled

   <b>Repository maintenance</b>
   <b>manifest</b>
       output the current or given revision of the project manifest:

       hg manifest [-r REV]

       Print a list of version controlled files for the given revision.
       If no revision is given, the first parent of the working
       directory is used, or the null revision if no revision is checked
       out.

       With -v, print file permissions, symlink and executable bits.
       With --debug, print file revision hashes.

       If option --all is specified, the list of all files from all

              display with template

   <b>recover</b>
       roll back an interrupted transaction:

       hg recover

       Recover from an interrupted commit or pull.

       This command tries to fix the repository status after an
       interrupted operation. It should only be necessary when Mercurial
       suggests it.

       Returns 0 if successful, 1 if nothing to recover or verify fails.

       Options:

       <b>--verify</b>
              run <i>hg verify</i> after successful recover

   <b>rollback</b>
       roll back the last transaction (DANGEROUS) (DEPRECATED):

       hg rollback

       Please use <b>hg commit --amend </b>instead of rollback to correct
       mistakes in the last commit.

       This command should be used with care. There is only one level of
       rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also
       restore the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing
       any dirstate changes since that time. This command does not alter
       the working directory.

       Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands
       that create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into
       a repository.

       For example, the following commands are transactional, and their
       effects can be rolled back:

       • commit

       • import

       • pull

       • push (with this repository as the destination)

       • unbundle

       To avoid permanent data loss, rollback will refuse to rollback a
       commit transaction if it isn't checked out. Use --force to
       override this protection.

       The rollback command can be entirely disabled by setting the
       <b>ui.rollback </b>configuration setting to false. If you're here
       because you want to use rollback and it's disabled, you can
       re-enable the command by setting <b>ui.rollback </b>to true.

       This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once
       changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a
       transaction back locally is ineffective (someone else may already
       have pulled the changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with
       readers of the repository; for example an in-progress pull from
       the repository may fail if a rollback is performed.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if no rollback data is available.

       Options:

       <b>-n, --dry-run</b>
              do not perform actions, just print output

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              ignore safety measures

   <b>verify</b>
       verify the integrity of the repository:

       hg verify

       Verify the integrity of the current repository.

       This will perform an extensive check of the repository's
       integrity, validating the hashes and checksums of each entry in
       the changelog, manifest, and tracked files, as well as the
       integrity of their crosslinks and indices.

       Please see <a href="https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RepositoryCorruption">https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RepositoryCorruption</a>
       for more information about recovery from corruption of the
       repository.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.

       <b>--full </b>perform more checks (EXPERIMENTAL)

       the repository-level config file.

       With --source, the source (filename and line number) is printed
       for each config item.

       See <b>hg help config </b>for more information about config files.

       --non-shared flag is used to edit <i>.hg/hgrc-not-shared</i> config
       file.  This file is not shared across shares when in share-safe
       mode.

       Template:

       The following keywords are supported. See also <b>hg help templates</b>.

</pre> <h2>
BUNDLE FILE FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial supports generating standalone "bundle" files that hold
       repository data. These "bundles" are typically saved locally and
       used later or exchanged between different repositories, possibly
       on different machines. Example commands using bundles are <b>hg</b>
       <b>bundle </b>and <b>hg unbundle</b>.

       Generation of bundle files is controlled by a "bundle
       specification" ("bundlespec") string. This string tells the
       bundle generation process how to create the bundle.

       A "bundlespec" string is composed of the following elements:

       <b>type   </b>A string denoting the bundle format to use.

       <b>compression</b>
              Denotes the compression engine to use compressing the raw
              bundle data.

       <b>parameters</b>
              Arbitrary key-value parameters to further control bundle
              generation.

       A "bundlespec" string has the following formats:

       <b>&lt;type&gt; </b>The literal bundle format string is used.

       <b>&lt;compression&gt;-&lt;type&gt;</b>
              The compression engine and format are delimited by a
              hyphen (<b>-</b>).

       Optional parameters follow the <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>. Parameters are URI escaped
       <b>key=value </b>pairs. Each pair is delimited by a semicolon (<b>;</b>). The
       first parameter begins after a <b>; </b>immediately following the <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
       value.

   <b>Available Types</b>
       The following bundle &lt;type&gt; strings are available:

       <b>v1     </b>Produces a legacy "changegroup" version 1 bundle.

              This format is compatible with nearly all Mercurial
              clients because it is the oldest. However, it has some
              limitations, which is why it is no longer the default for
              new repositories.

              <b>v1 </b>bundles can be used with modern repositories using the
              "generaldelta" storage format. However, it may take longer
              to produce the bundle and the resulting bundle may be
              significantly larger than a <b>v2 </b>bundle.

              <b>v1 </b>bundles can only use the <b>gzip</b>, <b>bzip2</b>, and <b>none</b>
              compression formats.

       <b>v2     </b>Produces a version 2 bundle.

              Version 2 bundles are an extensible format that can store
              additional repository data (such as bookmarks and phases
              information) and they can store data more efficiently,
              resulting in smaller bundles.

              Version 2 bundles can also use modern compression engines,
              such as <b>zstd</b>, making them faster to compress and often
              smaller.

   <b>Available Compression Engines</b>
       The following bundle &lt;compression&gt; engines can be used:

       <b>bzip2</b>

              An algorithm that produces smaller bundles than <b>gzip</b>.

              All Mercurial clients should support this format.

              This engine will likely produce smaller bundles than <b>gzip</b>
              but will be significantly slower, both during compression
              and decompression.

              If available, the <b>zstd </b>engine can yield similar or better
              compression at much higher speeds.

       <b>gzip</b>

              zlib compression using the DEFLATE algorithm.

              All Mercurial clients should support this format. The
              compression algorithm strikes a reasonable balance between
              compression ratio and size.

       <b>none</b>

              No compression is performed.

              Use this compression engine to explicitly disable
              compression.

   <b>Examples</b>
       <b>v2</b>

              Produce a <b>v2 </b>bundle using default options, including
              compression.

       <b>none-v1</b>

              Produce a <b>v1 </b>bundle with no compression.

       <b>zstd-v2</b>

              Produce a <b>v2 </b>bundle with zstandard compression using
              default settings.

       <b>zstd-v1</b>

              This errors because <b>zstd </b>is not supported for <b>v1 </b>types.
</pre> <h2>
COLORIZING OUTPUTS </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial colorizes output from several commands.

       For example, the diff command shows additions in green and
       deletions in red, while the status command shows modified files
       in magenta. Many other commands have analogous colors. It is
       possible to customize these colors.

       To enable color (default) whenever possible use:

       [ui]
       color = yes

       To disable color use:

       [ui]
       color = no

       See <b>hg help config.ui.color </b>for details.

       The default pager on Windows does not support color, so enabling
       the pager will effectively disable color.  See <b>hg help</b>
       <b>config.ui.paginate </b>to disable the pager.  Alternately, MSYS and
       Cygwin shells provide <i>less</i> as a pager, which can be configured to
       support ANSI color mode.  Windows 10 natively supports ANSI color
       mode.

   <b>Mode</b>
       Mercurial can use various systems to display color. The supported
       modes are <b>ansi</b>, <b>win32</b>, and <b>terminfo</b>.  See <b>hg help config.color</b>
       for details about how to control the mode.

   <b>Effects</b>
       Other effects in addition to color, like bold and underlined
       text, are also available. By default, the terminfo database is
       used to find the terminal codes used to change color and effect.
       If terminfo is not available, then effects are rendered with the
       ECMA-48 SGR control function (aka ANSI escape codes).

       The available effects in terminfo mode are 'blink', 'bold',
       'dim', 'inverse', 'invisible', 'italic', 'standout', and
       'underline'; in ECMA-48 mode, the options are 'bold', 'inverse',
       'italic', and 'underline'.  How each is rendered depends on the
       terminal emulator.  Some may not be available for a given
       terminal type, and will be silently ignored.

       If the terminfo entry for your terminal is missing codes for an
       effect or has the wrong codes, you can add or override those
       codes in your configuration:

       [color]
       terminfo.dim = \E[2m

       where 'E' is substituted with an escape character.

   <b>Labels</b>
       Text receives color effects depending on the labels that it has.
       Many default Mercurial commands emit labelled text. You can also
       define your own labels in templates using the label function, see
       <b>hg help templates</b>. A single portion of text may have more than
       one label. In that case, effects given to the last label will
       override any other effects. This includes the special "none"
       effect, which nullifies other effects.

       Labels are normally invisible. In order to see these labels and
       their position in the text, use the global --color=debug option.
       The same anchor text may be associated to multiple labels, e.g.

          [log.changeset changeset.secret|changeset:
          22611:6f0a53c8f587]

       The following are the default effects for some default labels.
       Default effects may be overridden from your configuration file:

       [color]
       status.modified = blue bold underline red_background
       status.added = green bold
       status.removed = red bold blue_background
       status.deleted = cyan bold underline
       status.unknown = magenta bold underline
       status.ignored = black bold

       # 'none' turns off all effects
       status.clean = none
       status.copied = none

       qseries.applied = blue bold underline
       qseries.unapplied = black bold
       qseries.missing = red bold

       diff.diffline = bold
       diff.extended = cyan bold
       diff.file_a = red bold
       diff.file_b = green bold
       diff.hunk = magenta
       diff.deleted = red
       diff.inserted = green
       diff.changed = white
       diff.tab =
       diff.trailingwhitespace = bold red_background

       # Blank so it inherits the style of the surrounding label
       changeset.public =
       changeset.draft =
       changeset.secret =

       resolve.unresolved = red bold
       resolve.resolved = green bold

       bookmarks.active = green

       branches.active = none
       branches.closed = black bold
       branches.current = green
       branches.inactive = none

       tags.normal = green
       tags.local = black bold

       rebase.rebased = blue
       rebase.remaining = red bold

       shelve.age = cyan
       shelve.newest = green bold
       shelve.name = blue bold

       histedit.remaining = red bold

   <b>Custom colors</b>
       Because there are only eight standard colors, Mercurial allows
       you to define color names for other color slots which might be
       available for your terminal type, assuming terminfo mode.  For
       instance:

       color.brightblue = 12
       color.pink = 207
       color.orange = 202

       to set 'brightblue' to color slot 12 (useful for 16 color
       terminals that have brighter colors defined in the upper eight)
       and, 'pink' and 'orange' to colors in 256-color xterm's default
       color cube.  These defined colors may then be used as any of the
       pre-defined eight, including appending '_background' to set the
       background to that color.
</pre> <h2>
DATE FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:

       • backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.

       • log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.

       Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:

       • <b>Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 </b>(local timezone assumed)

       • <b>Dec 6 13:18 -0600 </b>(year assumed, time offset provided)

       • <b>Dec 6 13:18 UTC </b>(UTC and GMT are aliases for +0000)

       • <b>Dec 6 </b>(midnight)

       • <b>13:18 </b>(today assumed)

       • <b>3:39 </b>(3:39AM assumed)

       • <b>3:39pm </b>(15:39)

       • <b>2006-12-06 13:18:29 </b>(ISO 8601 format)

       • <b>2006-12-6 13:18</b>

       • <b>2006-12-6</b>

       • <b>12-6</b>

       • <b>12/6</b>

       • <b>12/6/6 </b>(Dec 6 2006)

       • <b>today </b>(midnight)

       • <b>yesterday </b>(midnight)

       • <b>now </b>- right now

       Lastly, there is Mercurial's internal format:

       • <b>1165411109 0 </b>(Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)

       This is the internal representation format for dates. The first
       number is the number of seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00
       UTC). The second is the offset of the local timezone, in seconds
       west of UTC (negative if the timezone is east of UTC).

       The log command also accepts date ranges:

       • <b>&lt;DATE </b>- at or before a given date/time

       • <b>&gt;DATE </b>- on or after a given date/time

       • <b>DATE to DATE </b>- a date range, inclusive

       • <b>-DAYS </b>- within a given number of days from today
</pre> <h2>
DEPRECATED FEATURES </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial evolves over time, some features, options, commands may
       be replaced by better and more secure alternatives. This topic
       will help you migrating your existing usage and/or configuration
       to newer features.

   <b>Commands</b>
       The following commands are still available but their use are not
       recommended:

       <b>locate</b>

       This command has been replaced by <i>hg files</i>.

       <b>parents</b>

       This command can be replaced by <i>hg summary</i> or <i>hg log</i> with
       appropriate revsets. See <i>hg help revsets</i> for more information.

       <b>tip</b>

       The recommended alternative is <i>hg heads</i>.

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>web.allowpull</b>

              Renamed to <i>allow-pull</i>.

       <b>web.allow_push</b>

              Renamed to <i>allow-push</i>.
</pre> <h2>
DIFF FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial's default format for showing changes between two
       versions of a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU
       diff, which can be used by GNU patch and many other standard
       tools.

       While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode
       the following information:

       • executable status and other permission bits

       • copy or rename information

       • changes in binary files

       • creation or deletion of empty files

       Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS
       which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not
       produced by default because a few widespread tools still do not
       understand this format.

       This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository
       (e.g. with <b>hg export</b>), you should be careful about things like
       file copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because
       when applying a standard diff to a different repository, this
       extra information is lost. Mercurial's internal operations (like
       push and pull) are not affected by this, because they use an
       internal binary format for communicating changes.

       To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the
       --git option available for many commands, or set 'git = True' in
       the [diff] section of your configuration file. You do not need to
       set this option when importing diffs in this format or using them
       in the mq extension.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>HG     </b>Path to the 'hg' executable, automatically passed when
              running hooks, extensions or external tools. If unset or
              empty, this is the hg executable's name if it's frozen, or
              an executable named 'hg' (with %PATHEXT% [defaulting to
              COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions on Windows) is searched.

       <b>HGEDITOR</b>
              This is the name of the editor to run when committing. See
              EDITOR.

              (deprecated, see <b>hg help config.ui.editor</b>)

       <b>HGENCODING</b>
              This overrides the default locale setting detected by
              Mercurial.  This setting is used to convert data including
              usernames, changeset descriptions, tag names, and
              branches. This setting can be overridden with the
              --encoding command-line option.

       <b>HGENCODINGMODE</b>
              This sets Mercurial's behavior for handling unknown
              characters while transcoding user input. The default is
              "strict", which causes Mercurial to abort if it can't map
              a character. Other settings include "replace", which
              replaces unknown characters, and "ignore", which drops
              them. This setting can be overridden with the
              --encodingmode command-line option.

       <b>HGENCODINGAMBIGUOUS</b>
              This sets Mercurial's behavior for handling characters
              with "ambiguous" widths like accented Latin characters
              with East Asian fonts. By default, Mercurial assumes
              ambiguous characters are narrow, set this variable to
              "wide" if such characters cause formatting problems.

       <b>HGMERGE</b>
              An executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The
              program will be executed with three arguments: local file,
              remote file, ancestor file.

              (deprecated, see <b>hg help config.ui.merge</b>)

       <b>HGRCPATH</b>
              A list of files or directories to search for configuration
              files. Item separator is ":" on Unix, ";" on Windows. If
              HGRCPATH is not set, platform default search path is used.
              If empty, only the .hg/hgrc from the current repository is
              read.

              For each element in HGRCPATH:

              • if it's a directory, all files ending with .rc are added

              • otherwise, the file itself will be added

       <b>HGRCSKIPREPO</b>
              When set, the .hg/hgrc from repositories are not read.

       <b>HGPLAIN</b>
              When set, this disables any configuration settings that
              might change Mercurial's default output. This includes
              encoding, defaults, verbose mode, debug mode, quiet mode,
              tracebacks, and localization. This can be useful when
              scripting against Mercurial in the face of existing user
              configuration.

              In addition to the features disabled by <b>HGPLAIN=</b>, the
              following values can be specified to adjust behavior:

              <b>+strictflags</b>

                     Restrict parsing of command line flags.

              Equivalent options set via command line flags or
              environment variables are not overridden.

              See <b>hg help scripting </b>for details.

       <b>HGPLAINEXCEPT</b>
              This is a comma-separated list of features to preserve
              when HGPLAIN is enabled. Currently the following values
              are supported:

              <b>alias</b>

                     Don't remove aliases.

              <b>color</b>

                     Don't disable colored output.

              <b>i18n</b>

                     Preserve internationalization.

              <b>revsetalias</b>

                     Don't remove revset aliases.

              <b>templatealias</b>

                     Don't remove template aliases.

              <b>progress</b>

                     Don't hide progress output.

              Setting HGPLAINEXCEPT to anything (even an empty string)
              will enable plain mode.

       <b>HGUSER </b>This is the string used as the author of a commit. If not
              set, available values will be considered in this order:

              • HGUSER (deprecated)

              • configuration files from the HGRCPATH

              • EMAIL

              • interactive prompt

              • LOGNAME (with <b>@hostname </b>appended)

              (deprecated, see <b>hg help config.ui.username</b>)

       <b>EMAIL  </b>May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.

       <b>VISUAL </b>This is the name of the editor to use when committing. See
              EDITOR.

       <b>EDITOR </b>Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor
              for a user to modify, for example when writing commit
              messages. The editor it uses is determined by looking at
              the environment variables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR, in
              that order. The first non-empty one is chosen. If all of
              them are empty, the editor defaults to 'vi'.

       <b>PYTHONPATH</b>
              This is used by Python to find imported modules and may
              need to be set appropriately if this Mercurial is not
              installed system-wide.
</pre> <h2>
SAFELY REWRITING HISTORY (EXPERIMENTAL) </h2>
<pre>
       Obsolescence markers make it possible to mark changesets that
       have been deleted or superseded in a new version of the
       changeset.

       Unlike the previous way of handling such changes, by stripping
       the old changesets from the repository, obsolescence markers can
       be propagated between repositories. This allows for a safe and
       simple way of exchanging mutable history and altering it after
       the fact. Changeset phases are respected, such that only draft
       and secret changesets can be altered (see <b>hg help phases </b>for
       details).

       Obsolescence is tracked using "obsolescence markers", a piece of
       metadata tracking which changesets have been made obsolete,
       potential successors for a given changeset, the moment the
       changeset was marked as obsolete, and the user who performed the
       rewriting operation. The markers are stored separately from
       standard changeset data can be exchanged without any of the
       precursor changesets, preventing unnecessary exchange of
       obsolescence data.

       The complete set of obsolescence markers describes a history of
       changeset modifications that is orthogonal to the repository
       history of file modifications. This changeset history allows for
       detection and automatic resolution of edge cases arising from
       multiple users rewriting the same part of history concurrently.

   <b>Current feature status</b>
       This feature is still in development.

   <b>Instability</b>
       Rewriting changesets might introduce instability.

       There are two main kinds of instability: orphaning and diverging.

       Orphans are changesets left behind when their ancestors are
       rewritten.  Divergence has two variants:

       • Content-divergence occurs when independent rewrites of the same
         changesets lead to different results.

       • Phase-divergence occurs when the old (obsolete) version of a
         changeset becomes public.

       It is possible to prevent local creation of orphans by using the
       following config:

       [experimental]
       evolution.createmarkers = true
       evolution.exchange = true

       You can also enable that option explicitly:

       [experimental]
       evolution.createmarkers = true
       evolution.exchange = true
       evolution.allowunstable = true
</pre> <h2>
USING ADDITIONAL FEATURES </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of
       extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to
       existing commands, change the default behavior of commands, or
       implement hooks.

       To enable the "foo" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or
       in the Python search path, create an entry for it in your
       configuration file, like this:

       [extensions]
       foo =

       You may also specify the full path to an extension:

       [extensions]
       myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py

       See <b>hg help config </b>for more information on configuration files.

       Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons:
       they can increase startup overhead; they may be meant for
       advanced usage only; they may provide potentially dangerous
       abilities (such as letting you destroy or modify history); they
       might not be ready for prime time; or they may alter some usual
       behaviors of stock Mercurial. It is thus up to the user to
       activate extensions as needed.

       To explicitly disable an extension enabled in a configuration
       file of broader scope, prepend its path with !:

       [extensions]
       # disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
       bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
       # ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
       baz = !

       disabled extensions:

          <b>acl    </b>hooks for controlling repository access

          <b>blackbox</b>
                 log repository events to a blackbox for debugging

</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING FILE SETS </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of
       files.

       Like other file patterns, this pattern type is indicated by a
       prefix, 'set:'. The language supports a number of predicates
       which are joined by infix operators. Parenthesis can be used for
       grouping.

       Identifiers such as filenames or patterns must be quoted with
       single or double quotes if they contain characters outside of
       <b>[.*{}[]?/\_a-zA-Z0-9\x80-\xff] </b>or if they match one of the
       predefined predicates. This generally applies to file patterns
       other than globs and arguments for predicates. Pattern prefixes
       such as <b>path: </b>may be specified without quoting.

       Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping
       them, e.g., <b>\n </b>is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from
       being interpreted, strings can be prefixed with <b>r</b>, e.g. <b>r'...'</b>.

       See also <b>hg help patterns</b>.

   <b>Operators</b>
       There is a single prefix operator:

       <b>not x</b>

              Files not in x. Short form is <b>! x</b>.

       These are the supported infix operators:

       <b>x and y</b>

              The intersection of files in x and y. Short form is <b>x &amp; y</b>.

       <b>x or y</b>

              The union of files in x and y. There are two alternative
              short forms: <b>x | y </b>and <b>x + y</b>.

       <b>x - y</b>

              Files in x but not in y.

   <b>Predicates</b>
       The following predicates are supported:

       <b>added()</b>

              File that is added according to <b>hg status</b>.

       <b>binary()</b>

              File that appears to be binary (contains NUL bytes).

       <b>clean()</b>

              File that is clean according to <b>hg status</b>.

       <b>copied()</b>

              File that is recorded as being copied.

       <b>deleted()</b>

              Alias for <b>missing()</b>.

       <b>encoding(name)</b>

              File can be successfully decoded with the given character
              encoding. May not be useful for encodings other than ASCII
              and UTF-8.

       <b>eol(style)</b>

              File contains newlines of the given style (dos, unix,
              mac). Binary files are excluded, files with mixed line
              endings match multiple styles.

       <b>exec()</b>

              File that is marked as executable.

       <b>grep(regex)</b>

              File contains the given regular expression.

       <b>hgignore()</b>

              File that matches the active .hgignore pattern.

       <b>ignored()</b>

              File that is ignored according to <b>hg status</b>.

       <b>missing()</b>

              File that is missing according to <b>hg status</b>.

       <b>modified()</b>

              File that is modified according to <b>hg status</b>.

       <b>portable()</b>

              File that has a portable name. (This doesn't include
              filenames with case collisions.)

       <b>removed()</b>

              File that is removed according to <b>hg status</b>.

       <b>resolved()</b>

              File that is marked resolved according to <b>hg resolve -l</b>.

       <b>revs(revs, pattern)</b>

              Evaluate set in the specified revisions. If the revset
              match multiple revs, this will return file matching
              pattern in any of the revision.

       <b>size(expression)</b>

              File size matches the given expression. Examples:

              • size('1k') - files from 1024 to 2047 bytes

              • size('&lt; 20k') - files less than 20480 bytes

              • size('&gt;= .5MB') - files at least 524288 bytes

              • size('4k - 1MB') - files from 4096 bytes to 1048576
                bytes

       <b>status(base, rev, pattern)</b>

              Evaluate predicate using status change between <b>base </b>and
              <b>rev</b>. Examples:

              • <b>status(3, 7, added()) </b>- matches files added from "3" to
                "7"

       <b>subrepo([pattern])</b>

              Subrepositories whose paths match the given pattern.

       <b>symlink()</b>

              File that is marked as a symlink.

       <b>tracked()</b>

              File that is under Mercurial control.

       <b>unknown()</b>

              File that is unknown according to <b>hg status</b>.

       <b>unresolved()</b>

              File that is marked unresolved according to <b>hg resolve -l</b>.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Some sample queries:

       • Show status of files that appear to be binary in the working
         directory:

         hg status -A "set:binary()"

       • Forget files that are in .hgignore but are already tracked:

         hg forget "set:hgignore() and not ignored()"

       • Find text files that contain a string:

         hg files "set:grep(magic) and not binary()"

       • Find C files in a non-standard encoding:

         hg files "set:**.c and not encoding('UTF-8')"

       • Revert copies of large binary files:

         hg revert "set:copied() and binary() and size('&gt;1M')"

       • Revert files that were added to the working directory:

         hg revert "set:revs('wdir()', added())"

       • Remove files listed in foo.lst that contain the letter a or b:

         hg remove "set: listfile:foo.lst and (**a* or **b*)"
</pre> <h2>
COMMAND-LINE FLAGS </h2>
<pre>
       Most Mercurial commands accept various flags.

   <b>Flag names</b>
       Flags for each command are listed in <b>hg help </b>for that command.
       Additionally, some flags, such as --repository, are global and
       can be used with any command - those are seen in <b>hg help -v</b>, and
       can be specified before or after the command.

       Every flag has at least a long name, such as --repository. Some
       flags may also have a short one-letter name, such as the
       equivalent -R. Using the short or long name is equivalent and has
       the same effect. The long name may be abbreviated to any
       unambiguous prefix. For example, <b>hg commit --amend </b>can be
       abbreviated to <b>hg commit --am</b>.

       Flags that have a short name can also be bundled together - for
       instance, to specify both --edit (short -e) and --interactive
       (short -i), one could use:

       hg commit -ei

       If any of the bundled flags takes a value (i.e. is not a
       boolean), it must be last, followed by the value:

       hg commit -im 'Message'

   <b>Flag types</b>
       Mercurial command-line flags can be strings, numbers, booleans,
       or lists of strings.

   <b>Specifying flag values</b>
       The following syntaxes are allowed, assuming a flag 'flagname'
       with short name 'f':

       --flagname=foo
       --flagname foo
       -f foo
       -ffoo

       This syntax applies to all non-boolean flags (strings, numbers or
       lists).

   <b>Specifying boolean flags</b>
       Boolean flags do not take a value parameter. To specify a
       boolean, use the flag name to set it to true, or the same name
       prefixed with 'no-' to set it to false:

       hg commit --interactive
       hg commit --no-interactive

   <b>Specifying list flags</b>
       List flags take multiple values. To specify them, pass the flag
       multiple times:

       hg files --include mercurial --include tests

   <b>Setting flag defaults</b>
       In order to set a default value for a flag in an hgrc file, it is
       recommended to use aliases:

       [alias]
       commit = commit --interactive

       For more information on hgrc files, see <b>hg help config</b>.

   <b>Overriding flags on the command line</b>
       If the same non-list flag is specified multiple times on the
       command line, the latest specification is used:

       hg commit -m "Ignored value" -m "Used value"

       This includes the use of aliases - e.g., if one has:

       [alias]
       committemp = commit -m "Ignored value"

       then the following command will override that -m:

       hg committemp -m "Used value"

   <b>Overriding flag defaults</b>
       Every flag has a default value, and you may also set your own
       defaults in hgrc as described above.  Except for list flags,
       defaults can be overridden on the command line simply by
       specifying the flag in that location.

   <b>Hidden flags</b>
       Some flags are not shown in a command's help by default -
       specifically, those that are deemed to be experimental,
       deprecated or advanced. To show all flags, add the --verbose flag
       for the help command:

       hg help --verbose commit
</pre> <h2>
GLOSSARY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Ancestor</b>
              Any changeset that can be reached by an unbroken chain of
              parent changesets from a given changeset. More precisely,
              the ancestors of a changeset can be defined by two
              properties: a parent of a changeset is an ancestor, and a
              parent of an ancestor is an ancestor. See also:
              'Descendant'.

       <b>Bookmark</b>
              Bookmarks are pointers to certain commits that move when
              committing. They are similar to tags in that it is
              possible to use bookmark names in all places where
              Mercurial expects a changeset ID, e.g., with <b>hg update</b>.
              Unlike tags, bookmarks move along when you make a commit.

              Bookmarks can be renamed, copied and deleted. Bookmarks
              are local, unless they are explicitly pushed or pulled
              between repositories.  Pushing and pulling bookmarks allow
              you to collaborate with others on a branch without
              creating a named branch.

       <b>Branch </b>(Noun) A child changeset that has been created from a
              parent that is not a head. These are known as topological
              branches, see 'Branch, topological'. If a topological
              branch is named, it becomes a named branch. If a
              topological branch is not named, it becomes an anonymous
              branch. See 'Branch, anonymous' and 'Branch, named'.

              Branches may be created when changes are pulled from or
              pushed to a remote repository, since new heads may be
              created by these operations. Note that the term branch can
              also be used informally to describe a development process
              in which certain development is done independently of
              other development. This is sometimes done explicitly with
              a named branch, but it can also be done locally, using
              bookmarks or clones and anonymous branches.

              Example: "The experimental branch."

              (Verb) The action of creating a child changeset which
              results in its parent having more than one child.

              Example: "I'm going to branch at X."

       <b>Branch, anonymous</b>
              Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent
              that is not a head and the name of the branch is not
              changed, a new anonymous branch is created.

       <b>Branch, closed</b>
              A named branch whose branch heads have all been closed.

       <b>Branch, default</b>
              The branch assigned to a changeset when no name has
              previously been assigned.

       <b>Branch head</b>
              See 'Head, branch'.

       <b>Branch, inactive</b>
              If a named branch has no topological heads, it is
              considered to be inactive. As an example, a feature branch
              becomes inactive when it is merged into the default
              branch. The <b>hg branches </b>command shows inactive branches by
              default, though they can be hidden with <b>hg branches</b>
              <b>--active</b>.

              NOTE: this concept is deprecated because it is too
              implicit.  Branches should now be explicitly closed using
              <b>hg commit --close-branch </b>when they are no longer needed.

       <b>Branch, named</b>
              A collection of changesets which have the same branch
              name. By default, children of a changeset in a named
              branch belong to the same named branch. A child can be
              explicitly assigned to a different branch. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>branch</b>, <b>hg help branches </b>and <b>hg commit --close-branch </b>for
              more information on managing branches.

              Named branches can be thought of as a kind of namespace,
              dividing the collection of changesets that comprise the
              repository into a collection of disjoint subsets. A named
              branch is not necessarily a topological branch. If a new
              named branch is created from the head of another named
              branch, or the default branch, but no further changesets
              are added to that previous branch, then that previous
              branch will be a branch in name only.

       <b>Branch tip</b>
              See 'Tip, branch'.

       <b>Branch, topological</b>
              Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent
              that is not a head, a new topological branch is created.
              If a topological branch is named, it becomes a named
              branch. If a topological branch is not named, it becomes
              an anonymous branch of the current, possibly default,
              branch.

       <b>Changelog</b>
              A record of the changesets in the order in which they were
              added to the repository. This includes details such as
              changeset id, author, commit message, date, and list of
              changed files.

       <b>Changeset</b>
              A snapshot of the state of the repository used to record a
              change.

       <b>Changeset, child</b>
              The converse of parent changeset: if P is a parent of C,
              then C is a child of P. There is no limit to the number of
              children that a changeset may have.

       <b>Changeset id</b>
              A SHA-1 hash that uniquely identifies a changeset. It may
              be represented as either a "long" 40 hexadecimal digit
              string, or a "short" 12 hexadecimal digit string.

       <b>Changeset, merge</b>
              A changeset with two parents. This occurs when a merge is
              committed.

       <b>Changeset, parent</b>
              A revision upon which a child changeset is based.
              Specifically, a parent changeset of a changeset C is a
              changeset whose node immediately precedes C in the DAG.
              Changesets have at most two parents.

       <b>Checkout</b>
              (Noun) The working directory being updated to a specific
              revision. This use should probably be avoided where
              possible, as changeset is much more appropriate than
              checkout in this context.

              Example: "I'm using checkout X."

              (Verb) Updating the working directory to a specific
              changeset. See <b>hg help update</b>.

              Example: "I'm going to check out changeset X."

       <b>Child changeset</b>
              See 'Changeset, child'.

       <b>Close changeset</b>
              See 'Head, closed branch'.

       <b>Closed branch</b>
              See 'Branch, closed'.

       <b>Clone  </b>(Noun) An entire or partial copy of a repository. The
              partial clone must be in the form of a revision and its
              ancestors.

              Example: "Is your clone up to date?"

              (Verb) The process of creating a clone, using <b>hg clone</b>.

              Example: "I'm going to clone the repository."

       <b>Closed branch head</b>
              See 'Head, closed branch'.

       <b>Commit </b>(Noun) A synonym for changeset.

              Example: "Is the bug fixed in your recent commit?"

              (Verb) The act of recording changes to a repository. When
              files are committed in a working directory, Mercurial
              finds the differences between the committed files and
              their parent changeset, creating a new changeset in the
              repository.

              Example: "You should commit those changes now."

       <b>Cset   </b>A common abbreviation of the term changeset.

       <b>DAG    </b>The repository of changesets of a distributed version
              control system (DVCS) can be described as a directed
              acyclic graph (DAG), consisting of nodes and edges, where
              nodes correspond to changesets and edges imply a parent -&gt;
              child relation. This graph can be visualized by graphical
              tools such as <b>hg log --graph</b>. In Mercurial, the DAG is
              limited by the requirement for children to have at most
              two parents.

       <b>Deprecated</b>
              Feature removed from documentation, but not scheduled for
              removal.

       <b>Default branch</b>
              See 'Branch, default'.

       <b>Descendant</b>
              Any changeset that can be reached by a chain of child
              changesets from a given changeset. More precisely, the
              descendants of a changeset can be defined by two
              properties: the child of a changeset is a descendant, and
              the child of a descendant is a descendant. See also:
              'Ancestor'.

       <b>Diff   </b>(Noun) The difference between the contents and attributes
              of files in two changesets or a changeset and the current
              working directory. The difference is usually represented
              in a standard form called a "diff" or "patch". The "git
              diff" format is used when the changes include copies,
              renames, or changes to file attributes, none of which can
              be represented/handled by classic "diff" and "patch".

              Example: "Did you see my correction in the diff?"

              (Verb) Diffing two changesets is the action of creating a
              diff or patch.

              Example: "If you diff with changeset X, you will see what
              I mean."

       <b>Directory, working</b>
              The working directory represents the state of the files
              tracked by Mercurial, that will be recorded in the next
              commit. The working directory initially corresponds to the
              snapshot at an existing changeset, known as the parent of
              the working directory. See 'Parent, working directory'.
              The state may be modified by changes to the files
              introduced manually or by a merge. The repository metadata
              exists in the .hg directory inside the working directory.

       <b>Draft  </b>Changesets in the draft phase have not been shared with
              publishing repositories and may thus be safely changed by
              history-modifying extensions. See <b>hg help phases</b>.

       <b>Experimental</b>
              Feature that may change or be removed at a later date.

       <b>Graph  </b>See DAG and <b>hg log --graph</b>.

       <b>Head   </b>The term 'head' may be used to refer to both a branch head
              or a repository head, depending on the context. See 'Head,
              branch' and 'Head, repository' for specific definitions.

              Heads are where development generally takes place and are
              the usual targets for update and merge operations.

       <b>Head, branch</b>
              A changeset with no descendants on the same named branch.

       <b>Head, closed branch</b>
              A changeset that marks a head as no longer interesting.
              The closed head is no longer listed by <b>hg heads</b>. A branch
              is considered closed when all its heads are closed and
              consequently is not listed by <b>hg branches</b>.

              Closed heads can be re-opened by committing new changeset
              as the child of the changeset that marks a head as closed.

       <b>Head, repository</b>
              A topological head which has not been closed.

       <b>Head, topological</b>
              A changeset with no children in the repository.

       <b>History, immutable</b>
              Once committed, changesets cannot be altered.  Extensions
              which appear to change history actually create new
              changesets that replace existing ones, and then destroy
              the old changesets. Doing so in public repositories can
              result in old changesets being reintroduced to the
              repository.

       <b>History, rewriting</b>
              The changesets in a repository are immutable. However,
              extensions to Mercurial can be used to alter the
              repository, usually in such a way as to preserve changeset
              contents.

       <b>Immutable history</b>
              See 'History, immutable'.

       <b>Merge changeset</b>
              See 'Changeset, merge'.

       <b>Manifest</b>
              Each changeset has a manifest, which is the list of files
              that are tracked by the changeset.

       <b>Merge  </b>Used to bring together divergent branches of work. When
              you update to a changeset and then merge another
              changeset, you bring the history of the latter changeset
              into your working directory. Once conflicts are resolved
              (and marked), this merge may be committed as a merge
              changeset, bringing two branches together in the DAG.

       <b>Named branch</b>
              See 'Branch, named'.

       <b>Null changeset</b>
              The empty changeset. It is the parent state of
              newly-initialized repositories and repositories with no
              checked out revision. It is thus the parent of root
              changesets and the effective ancestor when merging
              unrelated changesets. Can be specified by the alias 'null'
              or by the changeset ID '000000000000'.

       <b>Parent </b>See 'Changeset, parent'.

       <b>Parent changeset</b>
              See 'Changeset, parent'.

       <b>Parent, working directory</b>
              The working directory parent reflects a virtual revision
              which is the child of the changeset (or two changesets
              with an uncommitted merge) shown by <b>hg parents</b>. This is
              changed with <b>hg update</b>. Other commands to see the working
              directory parent are <b>hg summary </b>and <b>hg id</b>. Can be
              specified by the alias ".".

       <b>Patch  </b>(Noun) The product of a diff operation.

              Example: "I've sent you my patch."

              (Verb) The process of using a patch file to transform one
              changeset into another.

              Example: "You will need to patch that revision."

       <b>Phase  </b>A per-changeset state tracking how the changeset has been
              or should be shared. See <b>hg help phases</b>.

       <b>Public </b>Changesets in the public phase have been shared with
              publishing repositories and are therefore considered
              immutable. See <b>hg help phases</b>.

       <b>Pull   </b>An operation in which changesets in a remote repository
              which are not in the local repository are brought into the
              local repository. Note that this operation without special
              arguments only updates the repository, it does not update
              the files in the working directory. See <b>hg help pull</b>.

       <b>Push   </b>An operation in which changesets in a local repository
              which are not in a remote repository are sent to the
              remote repository. Note that this operation only adds
              changesets which have been committed locally to the remote
              repository. Uncommitted changes are not sent. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>push</b>.

       <b>Repository</b>
              The metadata describing all recorded states of a
              collection of files. Each recorded state is represented by
              a changeset. A repository is usually (but not always)
              found in the <b>.hg </b>subdirectory of a working directory. Any
              recorded state can be recreated by "updating" a working
              directory to a specific changeset.

       <b>Repository head</b>
              See 'Head, repository'.

       <b>Revision</b>
              A state of the repository at some point in time. Earlier
              revisions can be updated to by using <b>hg update</b>.  See also
              'Revision number'; See also 'Changeset'.

       <b>Revision number</b>
              This integer uniquely identifies a changeset in a specific
              repository. It represents the order in which changesets
              were added to a repository, starting with revision number
              0. Note that the revision number may be different in each
              clone of a repository. To identify changesets uniquely
              between different clones, see 'Changeset id'.

       <b>Revlog </b>History storage mechanism used by Mercurial. It is a form
              of delta encoding, with occasional full revision of data
              followed by delta of each successive revision. It includes
              data and an index pointing to the data.

       <b>Rewriting history</b>
              See 'History, rewriting'.

       <b>Root   </b>A changeset that has only the null changeset as its
              parent. Most repositories have only a single root
              changeset.

       <b>Secret </b>Changesets in the secret phase may not be shared via push,
              pull, or clone. See <b>hg help phases</b>.

       <b>Tag    </b>An alternative name given to a changeset. Tags can be used
              in all places where Mercurial expects a changeset ID,
              e.g., with <b>hg update</b>. The creation of a tag is stored in
              the history and will thus automatically be shared with
              other using push and pull.

       <b>Tip    </b>The changeset with the highest revision number. It is the
              changeset most recently added in a repository.

       <b>Tip, branch</b>
              The head of a given branch with the highest revision
              number. When a branch name is used as a revision
              identifier, it refers to the branch tip. See also 'Branch,
              head'. Note that because revision numbers may be different
              in different repository clones, the branch tip may be
              different in different cloned repositories.

       <b>Update </b>(Noun) Another synonym of changeset.

              Example: "I've pushed an update."

              (Verb) This term is usually used to describe updating the
              state of the working directory to that of a specific
              changeset. See <b>hg help update</b>.

              Example: "You should update."

       <b>Working directory</b>

SYNTAX FOR MERCURIAL IGNORE FILES </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Synopsis</b>
       The Mercurial system uses a file called <b>.hgignore </b>in the root
       directory of a repository to control its behavior when it
       searches for files that it is not currently tracking.

   <b>Description</b>
       The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often
       contain files that should not be tracked by Mercurial. These
       include backup files created by editors and build products
       created by compilers.  These files can be ignored by listing them
       in a <b>.hgignore </b>file in the root of the working directory. The
       <b>.hgignore </b>file must be created manually. It is typically put
       under version control, so that the settings will propagate to
       other repositories with push and pull.

       An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the
       repository root directory, or any prefix path of that path, is
       matched against any pattern in <b>.hgignore</b>.

       For example, say we have an untracked file, <b>file.c</b>, at <b>a/b/file.c</b>
       inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore <b>file.c </b>if any
       pattern in <b>.hgignore </b>matches <b>a/b/file.c</b>, <b>a/b </b>or <b>a</b>.

       In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can reference a set
       of per-user or global ignore files. See the <b>ignore </b>configuration
       key on the <b>[ui] </b>section of <b>hg help config </b>for details of how to
       configure these files.

       To control Mercurial's handling of files that it manages, many
       commands support the <b>-I </b>and <b>-X </b>options; see <b>hg help &lt;command&gt; </b>and
       <b>hg help patterns </b>for details.

       Files that are already tracked are not affected by .hgignore,
       even if they appear in .hgignore. An untracked file X can be
       explicitly added with <b>hg add X</b>, even if X would be excluded by a
       pattern in .hgignore.

   <b>Syntax</b>
       An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list of
       patterns, with one pattern per line. Empty lines are skipped. The
       <b># </b>character is treated as a comment character, and the <b>\</b>
       character is treated as an escape character.

       Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes. The default syntax
       used is Python/Perl-style regular expressions.

       To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:

       syntax: NAME

       where <b>NAME </b>is one of the following:

       <b>regexp</b>

              Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.

       <b>glob</b>

              Shell-style glob.

       <b>rootglob</b>

              A variant of <b>glob </b>that is rooted (see below).

       The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns that
       follow, until another syntax is selected.

       Neither <b>glob </b>nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob-syntax
       pattern of the form <b>*.c </b>will match a file ending in <b>.c </b>in any
       directory, and a regexp pattern of the form <b>\.c$ </b>will do the
       same. To root a regexp pattern, start it with <b>^</b>. To get the same
       effect with glob-syntax, you have to use <b>rootglob</b>.

       Subdirectories can have their own .hgignore settings by adding
       <b>subinclude:path/to/subdir/.hgignore </b>to the root <b>.hgignore</b>. See <b>hg</b>
       <b>help patterns </b>for details on <b>subinclude: </b>and <b>include:</b>.

       Note   Patterns specified in other than <b>.hgignore </b>are always
              rooted.  Please see <b>hg help patterns </b>for details.

   <b>Example</b>
       Here is an example ignore file.

       # use glob syntax.
       syntax: glob

       *.elc
       *.pyc
       *~

       # switch to regexp syntax.
       syntax: regexp
       ^\.pc/

   <b>Debugging</b>
       Use the <b>debugignore </b>command to see if and why a file is ignored,
       or to see the combined ignore pattern. See <b>hg help debugignore</b>
       for details.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURING HGWEB </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial's internal web server, hgweb, can serve either a single
       repository, or a tree of repositories. In the second case,
       repository paths and global options can be defined using a
       dedicated configuration file common to <b>hg serve</b>, <b>hgweb.wsgi</b>,
       <b>hgweb.cgi </b>and <b>hgweb.fcgi</b>.

       This file uses the same syntax as other Mercurial configuration
       files but recognizes only the following sections:

          • web

          • paths

          • collections

       The <b>web </b>options are thoroughly described in <b>hg help config</b>.

       The <b>paths </b>section maps URL paths to paths of repositories in the
       filesystem. hgweb will not expose the filesystem directly - only
       Mercurial repositories can be published and only according to the
       configuration.

       The left hand side is the path in the URL. Note that hgweb
       reserves subpaths like <b>rev </b>or <b>file</b>, try using different names for
       nested repositories to avoid confusing effects.

       The right hand side is the path in the filesystem. If the
       specified path ends with <b>* </b>or <b>** </b>the filesystem will be searched
       recursively for repositories below that point.  With <b>* </b>it will
       not recurse into the repositories it finds (except for
       <b>.hg/patches</b>).  With <b>** </b>it will also search inside repository
       working directories and possibly find subrepositories.

       In this example:

       [paths]
       /projects/a = /srv/tmprepos/a
       /projects/b = c:/repos/b
       / = /srv/repos/*
       /user/bob = /home/bob/repos/**

       • The first two entries make two repositories in different
         directories appear under the same directory in the web
         interface

       • The third entry will publish every Mercurial repository found
         in <b>/srv/repos/</b>, for instance the repository <b>/srv/repos/quux/</b>
         will appear as <b><a href="http://server/quux/">http://server/quux/</a> </b>

       • The fourth entry will publish both <b><a href="http://server/user/bob/quux/">http://server/user/bob/quux/</a> </b>
         and <b><a href="http://server/user/bob/quux/testsubrepo/">http://server/user/bob/quux/testsubrepo/</a> </b>

       The <b>collections </b>section is deprecated and has been superseded by
       <b>paths</b>.

   <b>URLs and Common Arguments</b>
       URLs under each repository have the form <b>/{command}[/{arguments}]</b>
       where <b>{command} </b>represents the name of a command or handler and
       <b>{arguments} </b>represents any number of additional URL parameters to
       that command.

       The web server has a default style associated with it. Styles map
       to a collection of named templates. Each template is used to
       render a specific piece of data, such as a changeset or diff.

       The style for the current request can be overridden two ways.
       First, if <b>{command} </b>contains a hyphen (<b>-</b>), the text before the
       hyphen defines the style. For example, <b>/atom-log </b>will render the
       <b>log </b>command handler with the <b>atom </b>style. The second way to set
       the style is with the <b>style </b>query string argument. For example,
       <b>/log?style=atom</b>. The hyphenated URL parameter is preferred.

       Not all templates are available for all styles. Attempting to use
       a style that doesn't have all templates defined may result in an
       error rendering the page.

       Many commands take a <b>{revision} </b>URL parameter. This defines the
       changeset to operate on. This is commonly specified as the short,
       12 digit hexadecimal abbreviation for the full 40 character
       unique revision identifier. However, any value described by <b>hg</b>
       <b>help revisions </b>typically works.

   <b>Commands and URLs</b>
       The following web commands and their URLs are available:

   <b>/annotate/{revision}/{path}</b>
       Show changeset information for each line in a file.

       The <b>ignorews</b>, <b>ignorewsamount</b>, <b>ignorewseol</b>, and <b>ignoreblanklines</b>
       query string arguments have the same meaning as their <b>[annotate]</b>
       config equivalents. It uses the hgrc boolean parsing logic to
       interpret the value. e.g. <b>0 </b>and <b>false </b>are false and <b>1 </b>and <b>true</b>
       are true. If not defined, the server default settings are used.

       The <b>fileannotate </b>template is rendered.

   <b>/archive/{revision}.{format}[/{path}]</b>
       Obtain an archive of repository content.

       The content and type of the archive is defined by a URL path
       parameter.  <b>format </b>is the file extension of the archive type to
       be generated. e.g.  <b>zip </b>or <b>tar.bz2</b>. Not all archive types may be
       allowed by your server configuration.

       The optional <b>path </b>URL parameter controls content to include in
       the archive. If omitted, every file in the specified revision is
       present in the archive. If included, only the specified file or
       contents of the specified directory will be included in the
       archive.

       No template is used for this handler. Raw, binary content is
       generated.

   <b>/bookmarks</b>
       Show information about bookmarks.

       No arguments are accepted.

       The <b>bookmarks </b>template is rendered.

   <b>/branches</b>
       Show information about branches.

       All known branches are contained in the output, even closed
       branches.

       No arguments are accepted.

       The <b>branches </b>template is rendered.

   <b>/changelog[/{revision}]</b>
       Show information about multiple changesets.

       If the optional <b>revision </b>URL argument is absent, information
       about all changesets starting at <b>tip </b>will be rendered. If the
       <b>revision </b>argument is present, changesets will be shown starting
       from the specified revision.

       If <b>revision </b>is absent, the <b>rev </b>query string argument may be
       defined. This will perform a search for changesets.

       The argument for <b>rev </b>can be a single revision, a revision set, or
       a literal keyword to search for in changeset data (equivalent to
       <b>hg log -k</b>).

       The <b>revcount </b>query string argument defines the maximum numbers of
       changesets to render.

       For non-searches, the <b>changelog </b>template will be rendered.

   <b>/changeset[/{revision}]</b>
       Show information about a single changeset.

       A URL path argument is the changeset identifier to show. See <b>hg</b>
       <b>help revisions </b>for possible values. If not defined, the <b>tip</b>
       changeset will be shown.

       The <b>changeset </b>template is rendered. Contents of the <b>changesettag</b>,
       <b>changesetbookmark</b>, <b>filenodelink</b>, <b>filenolink</b>, and the many
       templates related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.

   <b>/comparison/{revision}/{path}</b>
       Show a comparison between the old and new versions of a file from
       changes made on a particular revision.

       This is similar to the <b>diff </b>handler. However, this form features
       a split or side-by-side diff rather than a unified diff.

       The <b>context </b>query string argument can be used to control the
       lines of context in the diff.

       The <b>filecomparison </b>template is rendered.

   <b>/diff/{revision}/{path}</b>
       Show how a file changed in a particular commit.

       The <b>filediff </b>template is rendered.

       This handler is registered under both the <b>/diff </b>and <b>/filediff</b>
       paths. <b>/diff </b>is used in modern code.

   <b>/file/{revision}[/{path}]</b>
       Show information about a directory or file in the repository.

       Info about the <b>path </b>given as a URL parameter will be rendered.

       If <b>path </b>is a directory, information about the entries in that
       directory will be rendered. This form is equivalent to the
       <b>manifest </b>handler.

       If <b>path </b>is a file, information about that file will be shown via
       the <b>filerevision </b>template.

       If <b>path </b>is not defined, information about the root directory will
       be rendered.

   <b>/diff/{revision}/{path}</b>
       Show how a file changed in a particular commit.

       The <b>filediff </b>template is rendered.

       This handler is registered under both the <b>/diff </b>and <b>/filediff</b>
       paths. <b>/diff </b>is used in modern code.

   <b>/filelog/{revision}/{path}</b>
       Show information about the history of a file in the repository.

       The <b>revcount </b>query string argument can be defined to control the
       maximum number of entries to show.

       The <b>filelog </b>template will be rendered.

   <b>/graph[/{revision}]</b>
       Show information about the graphical topology of the repository.

       Information rendered by this handler can be used to create visual
       representations of repository topology.

       The <b>revision </b>URL parameter controls the starting changeset. If
       it's absent, the default is <b>tip</b>.

       The <b>revcount </b>query string argument can define the number of
       changesets to show information for.

       The <b>graphtop </b>query string argument can specify the starting
       changeset for producing <b>jsdata </b>variable that is used for
       rendering graph in JavaScript. By default it has the same value
       as <b>revision</b>.

       This handler will render the <b>graph </b>template.

   <b>/help[/{topic}]</b>
       Render help documentation.

       This web command is roughly equivalent to <b>hg help</b>. If a <b>topic </b>is
       defined, that help topic will be rendered. If not, an index of
       available help topics will be rendered.

       The <b>help </b>template will be rendered when requesting help for a
       topic.  <b>helptopics </b>will be rendered for the index of help topics.

   <b>/log[/{revision}[/{path}]]</b>
       Show repository or file history.

       For URLs of the form <b>/log/{revision}</b>, a list of changesets
       starting at the specified changeset identifier is shown. If
       <b>{revision} </b>is not defined, the default is <b>tip</b>. This form is
       equivalent to the <b>changelog </b>handler.

       For URLs of the form <b>/log/{revision}/{file}</b>, the history for a
       specific file will be shown. This form is equivalent to the
       <b>filelog </b>handler.

   <b>/manifest[/{revision}[/{path}]]</b>
       Show information about a directory.

       If the URL path arguments are omitted, information about the root
       directory for the <b>tip </b>changeset will be shown.

       Because this handler can only show information for directories,
       it is recommended to use the <b>file </b>handler instead, as it can
       handle both directories and files.

       The <b>manifest </b>template will be rendered for this handler.

   <b>/changeset[/{revision}]</b>
       Show information about a single changeset.

       A URL path argument is the changeset identifier to show. See <b>hg</b>
       <b>help revisions </b>for possible values. If not defined, the <b>tip</b>
       changeset will be shown.

       The <b>changeset </b>template is rendered. Contents of the <b>changesettag</b>,
       <b>changesetbookmark</b>, <b>filenodelink</b>, <b>filenolink</b>, and the many
       templates related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.

   <b>/shortlog</b>
       Show basic information about a set of changesets.

       This accepts the same parameters as the <b>changelog </b>handler. The
       only difference is the <b>shortlog </b>template will be rendered instead
       of the <b>changelog </b>template.

   <b>/summary</b>
       Show a summary of repository state.

       Information about the latest changesets, bookmarks, tags, and
       branches is captured by this handler.

       The <b>summary </b>template is rendered.

   <b>/tags</b>
       Show information about tags.

       No arguments are accepted.

       The <b>tags </b>template is rendered.

MERGE TOOLS </h2>
<pre>
       To merge files Mercurial uses merge tools.

       A merge tool combines two different versions of a file into a
       merged file. Merge tools are given the two files and the greatest
       common ancestor of the two file versions, so they can determine
       the changes made on both branches.

       Merge tools are used both for <b>hg resolve</b>, <b>hg merge</b>, <b>hg update</b>, <b>hg</b>
       <b>backout </b>and in several extensions.

       Usually, the merge tool tries to automatically reconcile the
       files by combining all non-overlapping changes that occurred
       separately in the two different evolutions of the same initial
       base file. Furthermore, some interactive merge programs make it
       easier to manually resolve conflicting merges, either in a
       graphical way, or by inserting some conflict markers. Mercurial
       does not include any interactive merge programs but relies on
       external tools for that.

   <b>Available merge tools</b>
       External merge tools and their properties are configured in the
       merge-tools configuration section - see hgrc(5) - but they can
       often just be named by their executable.

       A merge tool is generally usable if its executable can be found
       on the system and if it can handle the merge. The executable is
       found if it is an absolute or relative executable path or the
       name of an application in the executable search path. The tool is
       assumed to be able to handle the merge if it can handle symlinks
       if the file is a symlink, if it can handle binary files if the
       file is binary, and if a GUI is available if the tool requires a
       GUI.

       There are some internal merge tools which can be used. The
       internal merge tools are:

       <b>:dump</b>

              Creates three versions of the files to merge, containing
              the contents of local, other and base. These files can
              then be used to perform a merge manually. If the file to
              be merged is named <b>a.txt</b>, these files will accordingly be
              named <b>a.txt.local</b>, <b>a.txt.other </b>and <b>a.txt.base </b>and they
              will be placed in the same directory as <b>a.txt</b>.

              This implies premerge. Therefore, files aren't dumped, if
              premerge runs successfully. Use :forcedump to forcibly
              write files out.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       <b>:fail</b>

              Rather than attempting to merge files that were modified
              on both branches, it marks them as unresolved. The resolve
              command must be used to resolve these conflicts.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       <b>:forcedump</b>

              Creates three versions of the files as same as :dump, but
              omits premerge.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       <b>:local</b>

              Uses the local <i>p1()</i> version of files as the merged
              version.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       <b>:merge</b>

              Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm
              for merging files. It will fail if there are any conflicts
              and leave markers in the partially merged file. Markers
              will have two sections, one for each side of merge.

       <b>:merge-local</b>

              Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non-interactively
              in favor of the local <i>p1()</i> changes.

       <b>:merge-other</b>

              Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non-interactively
              in favor of the other <i>p2()</i> changes.

       <b>:merge3</b>

              Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm
              for merging files. It will fail if there are any conflicts
              and leave markers in the partially merged file. Marker
              will have three sections, one from each side of the merge
              and one for the base content.

       <b>:mergediff</b>

              Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm
              for merging files. It will fail if there are any conflicts
              and leave markers in the partially merged file. The marker
              will have two sections, one with the content from one side
              of the merge, and one with a diff from the base content to
              the content on the other side. (experimental)

       <b>:other</b>

              Uses the other <i>p2()</i> version of files as the merged
              version.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       <b>:prompt</b>

              Asks the user which of the local <i>p1()</i> or the other <i>p2()</i>
              version to keep as the merged version.

              (actual capabilities: binary, symlink)

       <b>:tagmerge</b>

              Uses the internal tag merge algorithm (experimental).

       <b>:union</b>

              Uses the internal non-interactive simple merge algorithm
              for merging files. It will use both left and right sides
              for conflict regions.  No markers are inserted.

       Internal tools are always available and do not require a GUI but
       will by default not handle symlinks or binary files. See next
       section for detail about "actual capabilities" described above.

   <b>Choosing a merge tool</b>
       Mercurial uses these rules when deciding which merge tool to use:

       1. If a tool has been specified with the --tool option to merge
          or resolve, it is used.  If it is the name of a tool in the
          merge-tools configuration, its configuration is used.
          Otherwise the specified tool must be executable by the shell.

       2. If the <b>HGMERGE </b>environment variable is present, its value is
          used and must be executable by the shell.

       3. If the filename of the file to be merged matches any of the
          patterns in the merge-patterns configuration section, the
          first usable merge tool corresponding to a matching pattern is
          used.

       4. If ui.merge is set it will be considered next. If the value is
          not the name of a configured tool, the specified value is used
          and must be executable by the shell. Otherwise the named tool
          is used if it is usable.

       5. If any usable merge tools are present in the merge-tools
          configuration section, the one with the highest priority is
          used.

       6. If a program named <b>hgmerge </b>can be found on the system, it is
          used - but it will by default not be used for symlinks and
          binary files.

       7. If the file to be merged is not binary and is not a symlink,
          then internal <b>:merge </b>is used.

       8. Otherwise, <b>:prompt </b>is used.

       For historical reason, Mercurial treats merge tools as below
       while examining rules above.
              ┌────────────┬────────────────┬────────┬─────────┐
              │ step       │ specified via  │ binary │ symlink │
              ├────────────┼────────────────┼────────┼─────────┤

              │        2.  │                │        │         │
              ├────────────┼────────────────┼────────┼─────────┤

              ├────────────┼────────────────┼────────┼─────────┤

              │        4.  │                │        │         │
              └────────────┴────────────────┴────────┴─────────┘

       Each capability column indicates Mercurial behavior for
       internal/external merge tools at examining each rule.

       • "o": "assume that a tool has capability"

       • "x": "assume that a tool does not have capability"

       • "?": "check actual capability of a tool"

       If <b>merge.strict-capability-check </b>configuration is true, Mercurial
       checks capabilities of merge tools strictly in (*) cases above (=
       each capability column becomes "?/?"). It is false by default for
       backward compatibility.

       Note   After selecting a merge program, Mercurial will by default
              attempt to merge the files using a simple merge algorithm
              first. Only if it doesn't succeed because of conflicting
              changes will Mercurial actually execute the merge program.
              Whether to use the simple merge algorithm first can be
              controlled by the premerge setting of the merge tool.
              Premerge is enabled by default unless the file is binary
              or a symlink.

       See the merge-tools and ui sections of hgrc(5) for details on the
       configuration of merge tools.
</pre> <h2>
PAGER SUPPORT </h2>
<pre>
       Some Mercurial commands can produce a lot of output, and
       Mercurial will attempt to use a pager to make those commands more
       pleasant.

       To set the pager that should be used, set the application
       variable:

       [pager]
       pager = less -FRX

       If no pager is set in the user or repository configuration,
       Mercurial uses the environment variable $PAGER. If $PAGER is not
       set, pager.pager from the default or system configuration is
       used. If none of these are set, a default pager will be used,
       typically <i>less</i> on Unix and <i>more</i> on Windows.

       On Windows, <i>more</i> is not color aware, so using it effectively
       disables color.  MSYS and Cygwin shells provide <i>less</i> as a pager,
       which can be configured to support ANSI color codes.  See <b>hg help</b>
       <b>config.color.pagermode </b>to configure the color mode when invoking
       a pager.

       You can disable the pager for certain commands by adding them to
       the pager.ignore list:

       [pager]
       ignore = version, help, update

       To ignore global commands like <b>hg version </b>or <b>hg help</b>, you have to
       specify them in your user configuration file.

       To control whether the pager is used at all for an individual
       command, you can use --pager=&lt;value&gt;:

          • use as needed: <i>auto</i>.

          • require the pager: <i>yes</i> or <i>on</i>.

          • suppress the pager: <i>no</i> or <i>off</i> (any unrecognized value will
            also work).

       To globally turn off all attempts to use a pager, set:

       [ui]
       paginate = never

       which will prevent the pager from running.
</pre> <h2>
FILE NAME PATTERNS </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more
       files at a time.

       By default, Mercurial treats filenames verbatim without pattern
       matching, relative to the current working directory. Note that
       your system shell might perform pattern matching of its own
       before passing filenames into Mercurial.

       Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.

       Note   Patterns specified in <b>.hgignore </b>are not rooted.  Please
              see <b>hg help hgignore </b>for details.

       To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start it
       with <b>path:</b>. These path names must completely match starting at
       the current repository root, and when the path points to a
       directory, it is matched recursively. To match all files in a
       directory non-recursively (not including any files in
       subdirectories), <b>rootfilesin: </b>can be used, specifying an absolute
       path (relative to the repository root).

       To use an extended glob, start a name with <b>glob:</b>. Globs are
       rooted at the current directory; a glob such as <b>*.c </b>will only
       match files in the current directory ending with <b>.c</b>. <b>rootglob:</b>
       can be used instead of <b>glob: </b>for a glob that is rooted at the
       root of the repository.

       The supported glob syntax extensions are <b>** </b>to match any string
       across path separators and <b>{a,b} </b>to mean "a or b".

       To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with <b>re:</b>.
       Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the
       repository.

       To read name patterns from a file, use <b>listfile: </b>or <b>listfile0:</b>.
       The latter expects null delimited patterns while the former
       expects line feeds. Each string read from the file is itself
       treated as a file pattern.

       To read a set of patterns from a file, use <b>include: </b>or
       <b>subinclude:</b>.  <b>include: </b>will use all the patterns from the given
       file and treat them as if they had been passed in manually.
       <b>subinclude: </b>will only apply the patterns against files that are
       under the subinclude file's directory. See <b>hg help hgignore </b>for
       details on the format of these files.

       All patterns, except for <b>glob: </b>specified in command line (not for
       <b>-I </b>or <b>-X </b>options), can match also against directories: files
       under matched directories are treated as matched.  For <b>-I </b>and <b>-X</b>
       options, <b>glob: </b>will match directories recursively.

       Plain examples:

       path:foo/bar        a name bar in a directory named foo in the root
                           of the repository
       path:path:name      a file or directory named "path:name"
       rootfilesin:foo/bar the files in a directory called foo/bar, but not any files
                           in its subdirectories and not a file bar in directory foo

       Glob examples:

       glob:*.c       any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
       *.c            any name ending in ".c" in the current directory
       **.c           any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of the
                      current directory including itself.
       foo/*          any file in directory foo
       foo/**         any file in directory foo plus all its subdirectories,
                      recursively
       foo/*.c        any name ending in ".c" in the directory foo
       foo/**.c       any name ending in ".c" in any subdirectory of foo
                      including itself.
       rootglob:*.c   any name ending in ".c" in the root of the repository

       Regexp examples:

       re:.*\.c$      any name ending in ".c", anywhere in the repository

       File examples:

       listfile:list.txt  read list from list.txt with one file pattern per line
       listfile0:list.txt read list from list.txt with null byte delimiters

       See also <b>hg help filesets</b>.

       Include examples:

       include:path/to/mypatternfile    reads patterns to be applied to all paths
       subinclude:path/to/subignorefile reads patterns specifically for paths in the
                                        subdirectory

       Phases are a system for tracking which changesets have been or
       should be shared. This helps prevent common mistakes when
       modifying history (for instance, with the mq or rebase
       extensions).

       Each changeset in a repository is in one of the following phases:

          • public : changeset is visible on a public server

          • draft : changeset is not yet published

          • secret : changeset should not be pushed, pulled, or cloned

       These phases are ordered (public &lt; draft &lt; secret) and no
       changeset can be in a lower phase than its ancestors. For
       instance, if a changeset is public, all its ancestors are also
       public. Lastly, changeset phases should only be changed towards
       the public phase.

   <b>How are phases managed?</b>
       For the most part, phases should work transparently. By default,
       a changeset is created in the draft phase and is moved into the
       public phase when it is pushed to another repository.

       Once changesets become public, extensions like mq and rebase will
       refuse to operate on them to prevent creating duplicate
       changesets.  Phases can also be manually manipulated with the <b>hg</b>
       <b>phase </b>command if needed. See <b>hg help -v phase </b>for examples.

       To make your commits secret by default, put this in your
       configuration file:

       [phases]
       new-commit = secret

   <b>Phases and servers</b>
       Normally, all servers are <b>publishing </b>by default. This means:

       - all draft changesets that are pulled or cloned appear in phase
       public on the client

       - all draft changesets that are pushed appear as public on both
       client and server

       - secret changesets are neither pushed, pulled, or cloned

       Note   Pulling a draft changeset from a publishing server does
              not mark it as public on the server side due to the
              read-only nature of pull.

       Sometimes it may be desirable to push and pull changesets in the
       draft phase to share unfinished work. This can be done by setting
       a repository to disable publishing in its configuration file:

       [phases]
       publish = False

       See <b>hg help config </b>for more information on configuration files.

       Note   Servers running older versions of Mercurial are treated as
              publishing.

       Note   Changesets in secret phase are not exchanged with the
              server. This applies to their content: file names, file
              contents, and changeset metadata. For technical reasons,
              the identifier (e.g. d825e4025e39) of the secret changeset
              may be communicated to the server.

   <b>Examples</b>
          • list changesets in draft or secret phase:

            hg log -r "not public()"

          • change all secret changesets to draft:

            hg phase --draft "secret()"

          • forcibly move the current changeset and descendants from
            public to draft:

            hg phase --force --draft .

          • show a list of changeset revisions and each corresponding
            phase:

            hg log --template "{rev} {phase}\n"

          • resynchronize draft changesets relative to a remote
            repository:

            hg phase -fd "outgoing(URL)"

       See <b>hg help phase </b>for more information on manually manipulating
       phases.
</pre> <h2>
SPECIFYING REVISIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial supports several ways to specify revisions.

   <b>Specifying single revisions</b>
       A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative
       integers are treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with -1
       denoting the tip, -2 denoting the revision prior to the tip, and
       so forth.

       A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision
       identifier.  A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is
       treated as a unique revision identifier and is referred to as a
       short-form identifier. A short-form identifier is only valid if
       it is the prefix of exactly one full-length identifier.

       Any other string is treated as a bookmark, tag, or branch name. A
       bookmark is a movable pointer to a revision. A tag is a permanent
       name associated with a revision. A branch name denotes the
       tipmost open branch head of that branch - or if they are all
       closed, the tipmost closed head of the branch. Bookmark, tag, and
       branch names must not contain the ":" character.

       The reserved name "tip" always identifies the most recent
       revision.

       The reserved name "null" indicates the null revision. This is the
       revision of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.

       The reserved name "." indicates the working directory parent. If
       no working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If
       an uncommitted merge is in progress, "." is the revision of the
       first parent.

       Finally, commands that expect a single revision (like <b>hg update</b>)
       also accept revsets (see below for details). When given a revset,
       they use the last revision of the revset. A few commands accept
       two single revisions (like <b>hg diff</b>). When given a revset, they
       use the first and the last revisions of the revset.

   <b>Specifying multiple revisions</b>
       Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of
       revisions. Expressions in this language are called revsets.

       The language supports a number of predicates which are joined by
       infix operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.

       Identifiers such as branch names may need quoting with single or
       double quotes if they contain characters like <b>- </b>or if they match
       one of the predefined predicates.

       Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping
       them, e.g., <b>\n </b>is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from
       being interpreted, strings can be prefixed with <b>r</b>, e.g. <b>r'...'</b>.

   <b>Operators</b>
       There is a single prefix operator:

       <b>not x</b>

              Changesets not in x. Short form is <b>! x</b>.

       These are the supported infix operators:

       <b>x::y</b>

              A DAG range, meaning all changesets that are descendants
              of x and ancestors of y, including x and y themselves. If
              the first endpoint is left out, this is equivalent to
              <b>ancestors(y)</b>, if the second is left out it is equivalent
              to <b>descendants(x)</b>.

              An alternative syntax is <b>x..y</b>.

       <b>x:y</b>

              All changesets with revision numbers between x and y, both
              inclusive. Either endpoint can be left out, they default
              to 0 and tip.

       <b>x and y</b>

              The intersection of changesets in x and y. Short form is <b>x</b>
              <b>&amp; y</b>.

       <b>x or y</b>

              The union of changesets in x and y. There are two
              alternative short forms: <b>x | y </b>and <b>x + y</b>.

       <b>x - y</b>

              Changesets in x but not in y.

       <b>x % y</b>

              Changesets that are ancestors of x but not ancestors of y
              (i.e. ::x - ::y).  This is shorthand notation for <b>only(x,</b>
              <b>y) </b>(see below). The second argument is optional and, if
              left out, is equivalent to <b>only(x)</b>.

       <b>x^n</b>

              The nth parent of x, n == 0, 1, or 2.  For n == 0, x; for
              n == 1, the first parent of each changeset in x; for n ==
              2, the second parent of changeset in x.

       <b>x~n</b>

              The nth first ancestor of x; <b>x~0 </b>is x; <b>x~3 </b>is <b>x^^^</b>.  For n
              &lt; 0, the nth unambiguous descendent of x.

       <b>x ## y</b>

              Concatenate strings and identifiers into one string.

              All other prefix, infix and postfix operators have lower
              priority than <b>##</b>. For example, <b>a1 ## a2~2 </b>is equivalent to
              <b>(a1 ## a2)~2</b>.

              For example:

              [revsetalias]
              issue(a1) = grep(r'\bissue[ :]?' ## a1 ## r'\b|\bbug\(' ## a1 ## r'\)')

              <b>issue(1234) </b>is equivalent to <b>grep(r'\bissue[</b>
              <b>:]?1234\b|\bbug\(1234\)') </b>in this case. This matches
              against all of "issue 1234", "issue:1234", "issue1234" and
              "bug(1234)".

       There is a single postfix operator:

       <b>x^</b>

              Equivalent to <b>x^1</b>, the first parent of each changeset in
              x.

   <b>Patterns</b>
       Where noted, predicates that perform string matching can accept a
       pattern string. The pattern may be either a literal, or a regular
       expression. If the pattern starts with <b>re:</b>, the remainder of the
       pattern is treated as a regular expression. Otherwise, it is
       treated as a literal. To match a pattern that actually starts
       with <b>re:</b>, use the prefix <b>literal:</b>.

       Matching is case-sensitive, unless otherwise noted.  To perform a
       case- insensitive match on a case-sensitive predicate, use a
       regular expression, prefixed with <b>(?i)</b>.

       For example, <b>tag(r're:(?i)release') </b>matches "release" or
       "RELEASE" or "Release", etc.

   <b>Predicates</b>
       The following predicates are supported:

       <b>adds(pattern)</b>

              Changesets that add a file matching pattern.

              The pattern without explicit kind like <b>glob: </b>is expected
              to be relative to the current directory and match against
              a file or a directory.

       <b>all()</b>

              All changesets, the same as <b>0:tip</b>.

       <b>ancestor(*changeset)</b>

              A greatest common ancestor of the changesets.

              Accepts 0 or more changesets.  Will return empty list when
              passed no args.  Greatest common ancestor of a single
              changeset is that changeset.

       <b>ancestors(set[, depth])</b>

              Changesets that are ancestors of changesets in set,
              including the given changesets themselves.

              If depth is specified, the result only includes changesets
              up to the specified generation.

       <b>author(string)</b>

              Alias for <b>user(string)</b>.

       <b>bisect(string)</b>

              Changesets marked in the specified bisect status:

              • <b>good</b>, <b>bad</b>, <b>skip</b>: csets explicitly marked as
                good/bad/skip

              • <b>goods</b>, <b>bads      </b>: csets topologically good/bad

              • <b>range              </b>: csets taking part in the bisection

              • <b>pruned             </b>: csets that are goods, bads or
                skipped

              • <b>untested           </b>: csets whose fate is yet unknown

              • <b>ignored            </b>: csets ignored due to DAG topology

              • <b>current            </b>: the cset currently being bisected

       <b>bookmark([name])</b>

              The named bookmark or all bookmarks.

              Pattern matching is supported for <i>name</i>. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>revisions.patterns</b>.

       <b>branch(string or set)</b>

              All changesets belonging to the given branch or the
              branches of the given changesets.

              Pattern matching is supported for <i>string</i>. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>revisions.patterns</b>.

       <b>branchpoint()</b>

              Changesets with more than one child.

       <b>bundle()</b>

              Changesets in the bundle.

              Bundle must be specified by the -R option.

       <b>children(set)</b>

              Child changesets of changesets in set.

       <b>closed()</b>

              Changeset is closed.

       <b>commonancestors(set)</b>

              Changesets that are ancestors of every changeset in set.

       <b>conflictlocal()</b>

              The local side of the merge, if currently in an unresolved
              merge.

              "merge" here includes merge conflicts from e.g. 'hg
              rebase' or 'hg graft'.

       <b>conflictother()</b>

              The other side of the merge, if currently in an unresolved
              merge.

              "merge" here includes merge conflicts from e.g. 'hg
              rebase' or 'hg graft'.

       <b>contains(pattern)</b>

              The revision's manifest contains a file matching pattern
              (but might not modify it). See <b>hg help patterns </b>for
              information about file patterns.

              The pattern without explicit kind like <b>glob: </b>is expected
              to be relative to the current directory and match against
              a file exactly for efficiency.

       <b>converted([id])</b>

              Changesets converted from the given identifier in the old
              repository if present, or all converted changesets if no
              identifier is specified.

       <b>date(interval)</b>

              Changesets within the interval, see <b>hg help dates</b>.

       <b>desc(string)</b>

              Search commit message for string. The match is
              case-insensitive.

              Pattern matching is supported for <i>string</i>. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>revisions.patterns</b>.

       <b>descendants(set[, depth])</b>

              Changesets which are descendants of changesets in set,
              including the given changesets themselves.

              If depth is specified, the result only includes changesets
              up to the specified generation.

       <b>destination([set])</b>

              Changesets that were created by a graft, transplant or
              rebase operation, with the given revisions specified as
              the source.  Omitting the optional set is the same as
              passing all().

       <b>diffcontains(pattern)</b>

              Search revision differences for when the pattern was added
              or removed.

              The pattern may be a substring literal or a regular
              expression. See <b>hg help revisions.patterns</b>.

       <b>draft()</b>

              Changeset in draft phase.

       <b>expectsize(set[, size])</b>

              Return the given revset if size matches the revset size.
              Abort if the revset doesn't expect given size.  size can
              either be an integer range or an integer.

              For example, <b>expectsize(0:1, 3:5) </b>will abort as revset
              size is 2 and 2 is not between 3 and 5 inclusive.

       <b>extra(label, [value])</b>

              Changesets with the given label in the extra metadata,
              with the given optional value.

              Pattern matching is supported for <i>value</i>. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>revisions.patterns</b>.

       <b>file(pattern)</b>

              Changesets affecting files matched by pattern.

              For a faster but less accurate result, consider using
              <b>filelog() </b>instead.

              This predicate uses <b>glob: </b>as the default kind of pattern.

       <b>filelog(pattern)</b>

              Changesets connected to the specified filelog.

              For performance reasons, visits only revisions mentioned
              in the file-level filelog, rather than filtering through
              all changesets (much faster, but doesn't include deletes
              or duplicate changes). For a slower, more accurate result,
              use <b>file()</b>.

              The pattern without explicit kind like <b>glob: </b>is expected
              to be relative to the current directory and match against
              a file exactly for efficiency.

       <b>first(set, [n])</b>

              An alias for limit().

       <b>follow([file[, startrev]])</b>

              An alias for <b>::. </b>(ancestors of the working directory's
              first parent).  If file pattern is specified, the
              histories of files matching given pattern in the revision
              given by startrev are followed, including copies.

       <b>followlines(file, fromline:toline[, startrev=., descend=False])</b>

              Changesets modifying <i>file</i> in line range ('fromline',
              'toline').

              Line range corresponds to 'file' content at 'startrev' and
              should hence be consistent with file size. If startrev is
              not specified, working directory's parent is used.

              By default, ancestors of 'startrev' are returned. If
              'descend' is True, descendants of 'startrev' are returned
              though renames are (currently) not followed in this
              direction.

       <b>grep(regex)</b>

              Like <b>keyword(string) </b>but accepts a regex. Use <b>grep(r'...')</b>
              to ensure special escape characters are handled correctly.
              Unlike <b>keyword(string)</b>, the match is case-sensitive.

       <b>head()</b>

              Changeset is a named branch head.

       <b>heads(set)</b>

              Members of set with no children in set.

       <b>hidden()</b>

              Hidden changesets.

       <b>id(string)</b>

              Revision non-ambiguously specified by the given hex string
              prefix.

       <b>keyword(string)</b>

              Search commit message, user name, and names of changed
              files for string. The match is case-insensitive.

              For a regular expression or case sensitive search of these
              fields, use <b>grep(regex)</b>.

       <b>last(set, [n])</b>

              Last n members of set, defaulting to 1.

       <b>limit(set[, n[, offset]])</b>

              First n members of set, defaulting to 1, starting from
              offset.

       <b>matching(revision [, field])</b>

              Changesets in which a given set of fields match the set of
              fields in the selected revision or set.

              To match more than one field pass the list of fields to
              match separated by spaces (e.g. <b>author description</b>).

              Valid fields are most regular revision fields and some
              special fields.

              Regular revision fields are <b>description</b>, <b>author</b>, <b>branch</b>,
              <b>date</b>, <b>files</b>, <b>phase</b>, <b>parents</b>, <b>substate</b>, <b>user </b>and <b>diff</b>.
              Note that <b>author </b>and <b>user </b>are synonyms. <b>diff </b>refers to the
              contents of the revision. Two revisions matching their
              <b>diff </b>will also match their <b>files</b>.

              Special fields are <b>summary </b>and <b>metadata</b>: <b>summary </b>matches
              the first line of the description.  <b>metadata </b>is equivalent
              to matching <b>description user date </b>(i.e. it matches the
              main metadata fields).

              <b>metadata </b>is the default field which is used when no fields
              are specified. You can match more than one field at a
              time.

       <b>max(set)</b>

              Changeset with highest revision number in set.

       <b>merge()</b>

              Changeset is a merge changeset.

       <b>min(set)</b>

              Changeset with lowest revision number in set.

       <b>modifies(pattern)</b>

              Changesets modifying files matched by pattern.

              The pattern without explicit kind like <b>glob: </b>is expected
              to be relative to the current directory and match against
              a file or a directory.

       <b>named(namespace)</b>

              The changesets in a given namespace.

              Pattern matching is supported for <i>namespace</i>. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>revisions.patterns</b>.

       <b>nodefromfile(path)</b>

              Read a list of nodes from the file at <i>path</i>.

              This applies <i>id(LINE)</i> to each line of the file.

              This is useful when the amount of nodes you need to
              specify gets too large for the command line.

       <b>none()</b>

              No changesets.

       <b>only(set, [set])</b>

              Changesets that are ancestors of the first set that are
              not ancestors of any other head in the repo. If a second
              set is specified, the result is ancestors of the first set
              that are not ancestors of the second set (i.e. ::&lt;set1&gt; -
              ::&lt;set2&gt;).

       <b>origin([set])</b>

              Changesets that were specified as a source for the grafts,
              transplants or rebases that created the given revisions.
              Omitting the optional set is the same as passing all().
              If a changeset created by these operations is itself
              specified as a source for one of these operations, only
              the source changeset for the first operation is selected.

       <b>outgoing([path])</b>

              Changesets not found in the specified destination
              repository, or the default push location.

              If the location resolve to multiple repositories, the
              union of all outgoing changeset will be used.

       <b>p1([set])</b>

              First parent of changesets in set, or the working
              directory.

       <b>p2([set])</b>

              Second parent of changesets in set, or the working
              directory.

       <b>parents([set])</b>

              The set of all parents for all changesets in set, or the
              working directory.

       <b>present(set)</b>

              An empty set, if any revision in set isn't found;
              otherwise, all revisions in set.

              If any of specified revisions is not present in the local
              repository, the query is normally aborted. But this
              predicate allows the query to continue even in such cases.

       <b>public()</b>

              Changeset in public phase.

       <b>remote([id [,path]])</b>

              Local revision that corresponds to the given identifier in
              a remote repository, if present. Here, the '.' identifier
              is a synonym for the current local branch.

       <b>removes(pattern)</b>

              Changesets which remove files matching pattern.

              The pattern without explicit kind like <b>glob: </b>is expected
              to be relative to the current directory and match against
              a file or a directory.

       <b>rev(number)</b>

              Revision with the given numeric identifier.

       <b>reverse(set)</b>

              Reverse order of set.

       <b>revset(set)</b>

              Strictly interpret the content as a revset.

              The content of this special predicate will be strictly
              interpreted as a revset. For example, <b>revset(id(0)) </b>will
              be interpreted as "id(0)" without possible ambiguity with
              a "id(0)" bookmark or tag.

       <b>roots(set)</b>

              Changesets in set with no parent changeset in set.

       <b>secret()</b>

              Changeset in secret phase.

       <b>sort(set[, [-]key... [, ...]])</b>

              Sort set by keys. The default sort order is ascending,
              specify a key as <b>-key </b>to sort in descending order.

              The keys can be:

              • <b>rev </b>for the revision number,

              • <b>branch </b>for the branch name,

              • <b>desc </b>for the commit message (description),

              • <b>user </b>for user name (<b>author </b>can be used as an alias),

              • <b>date </b>for the commit date

              • <b>topo </b>for a reverse topographical sort

              • <b>node </b>the nodeid of the revision

              The <b>topo </b>sort order cannot be combined with other sort
              keys. This sort takes one optional argument,
              <b>topo.firstbranch</b>, which takes a revset that specifies what
              topographical branches to prioritize in the sort.

       <b>subrepo([pattern])</b>

              Changesets that add, modify or remove the given subrepo.
              If no subrepo pattern is named, any subrepo changes are
              returned.

       <b>tag([name])</b>

              The specified tag by name, or all tagged revisions if no
              name is given.

              Pattern matching is supported for <i>name</i>. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>revisions.patterns</b>.

       <b>user(string)</b>

              User name contains string. The match is case-insensitive.

              Pattern matching is supported for <i>string</i>. See <b>hg help</b>
              <b>revisions.patterns</b>.

   <b>Aliases</b>
       New predicates (known as "aliases") can be defined, using any
       combination of existing predicates or other aliases. An alias
       definition looks like:

       &lt;alias&gt; = &lt;definition&gt;

       in the <b>revsetalias </b>section of a Mercurial configuration file.
       Arguments of the form <i>a1</i>, <i>a2</i>, etc. are substituted from the alias
       into the definition.

       For example,

       [revsetalias]
       h = heads()
       d(s) = sort(s, date)
       rs(s, k) = reverse(sort(s, k))

       defines three aliases, <b>h</b>, <b>d</b>, and <b>rs</b>. <b>rs(0:tip, author) </b>is exactly
       equivalent to <b>reverse(sort(0:tip, author))</b>.

   <b>Equivalents</b>
       Command line equivalents for <b>hg log</b>:

       -f    -&gt;  ::.
       -d x  -&gt;  date(x)
       -k x  -&gt;  keyword(x)
       -m    -&gt;  merge()
       -u x  -&gt;  user(x)
       -b x  -&gt;  branch(x)
       -P x  -&gt;  !::x
       -l x  -&gt;  limit(expr, x)

   <b>Examples</b>
       Some sample queries:

       • Changesets on the default branch:

         hg log -r "branch(default)"

       • Changesets on the default branch since tag 1.5 (excluding
         merges):

         hg log -r "branch(default) and 1.5:: and not merge()"

       • Open branch heads:

         hg log -r "head() and not closed()"

       • Changesets between tags 1.3 and 1.5 mentioning "bug" that
         affect <b>hgext/*</b>:

         hg log -r "1.3::1.5 and keyword(bug) and file('hgext/*')"

       • Changesets committed in May 2008, sorted by user:

         hg log -r "sort(date('May 2008'), user)"

       • Changesets mentioning "bug" or "issue" that are not in a tagged
         release:

         hg log -r "(keyword(bug) or keyword(issue)) and not ancestors(tag())"

       • Update to the commit that bookmark @ is pointing to, without
         activating the bookmark (this works because the last revision
         of the revset is used):

         hg update :@

       • Show diff between tags 1.3 and 1.5 (this works because the
         first and the last revisions of the revset are used):

         hg diff -r 1.3::1.5

RUST IN MERCURIAL </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial can be augmented with Rust extensions for speeding up
       certain operations.

   <b>Compatibility</b>
       Though the Rust extensions are only tested by the project under
       Linux, users of MacOS, FreeBSD and other UNIX-likes have been
       using the Rust extensions. Your mileage may vary, but by all
       means do give us feedback or signal your interest for better
       support.

       No Rust extensions are available for Windows at this time.

   <b>Features</b>
       The following operations are sped up when using Rust:

          • discovery of differences between repositories (pull/push)

          • nodemap (see <b>hg help config.format.use-persistent-nodemap</b>)

          • all commands using the dirstate (status, commit, diff, add,
            update, etc.)

          • dirstate-v2 (see <b>hg help config.format.use-dirstate-v2</b>)

          • iteration over ancestors in a graph

       More features are in the works, and improvements on the above
       listed are still in progress. For more experimental work see the
       "rhg" section.

   <b>Checking for Rust</b>
       You may already have the Rust extensions depending on how you
       install Mercurial:

       $ hg debuginstall | grep -i rust
       checking Rust extensions (installed)
       checking module policy (rust+c-allow)

       If those lines don't even exist, you're using an old version of
       <i>hg</i> which does not have any Rust extensions yet.

   <b>Installing</b>
       You will need <i>cargo</i> to be in your <i>$PATH</i>. See the "MSRV" section
       for which version to use.

   <b>Using pip</b>
       Users of <i>pip</i> can install the Rust extensions with the following
       command:

       $ pip install mercurial --global-option --rust --no-use-pep517

       <i>--no-use-pep517</i> is here to tell <i>pip</i> to preserve backwards
       compatibility with the legacy <i>setup.py</i> system. Mercurial has not
       yet migrated its complex setup to the new system, so we still
       need this to add compiled extensions.

       This might take a couple of minutes because you're compiling
       everything.

       See the "Checking for Rust" section to see if the install
       succeeded.

   <b>From your distribution</b>
       Some distributions are shipping Mercurial with Rust extensions
       enabled and pre-compiled (meaning you won't have to install
       <i>cargo</i>), or allow you to specify an install flag. Check with your
       specific distribution for how to do that, or ask their team to
       add support for hg+Rust!

   <b>From source</b>
       Please refer to the <i>rust/README.rst</i> file in the Mercurial
       repository for instructions on how to install from source.

   <b>MSRV</b>
       The minimum supported Rust version is currently 1.48.0. The
       project's policy is to follow the version from Debian stable, to
       make the distributions' job easier.

   <b>rhg</b>
       There exists an experimental pure-Rust version of Mercurial
       called <i>rhg</i> with a fallback mechanism for unsupported invocations.
       It allows for much faster execution of certain commands while
       adding no discernable overhead for the rest.

       The only way of trying it out is by building it from source.
       Please refer to <i>rust/README.rst</i> in the Mercurial repository.

   <b>Contributing</b>
       If you would like to help the Rust endeavor, please refer to
       <i>rust/README.rst</i> in the Mercurial repository.

USING MERCURIAL FROM SCRIPTS AND AUTOMATION </h2>
<pre>
       It is common for machines (as opposed to humans) to consume
       Mercurial.  This help topic describes some of the considerations
       for interfacing machines with Mercurial.

   <b>Choosing an Interface</b>
       Machines have a choice of several methods to interface with
       Mercurial.  These include:

       • Executing the <b>hg </b>process

       • Querying a HTTP server

       • Calling out to a command server

       Executing <b>hg </b>processes is very similar to how humans interact
       with Mercurial in the shell. It should already be familiar to
       you.

       <b>hg serve </b>can be used to start a server. By default, this will
       start a "hgweb" HTTP server. This HTTP server has support for
       machine-readable output, such as JSON. For more, see <b>hg help</b>
       <b>hgweb</b>.

       <b>hg serve </b>can also start a "command server." Clients can connect
       to this server and issue Mercurial commands over a special
       protocol.  For more details on the command server, including
       links to client libraries, see
       <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommandServer">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CommandServer</a>.

       <b>hg serve </b>based interfaces (the hgweb and command servers) have
       the advantage over simple <b>hg </b>process invocations in that they are
       likely more efficient. This is because there is significant
       overhead to spawn new Python processes.

       Tip    If you need to invoke several <b>hg </b>processes in short order
              and/or performance is important to you, use of a
              server-based interface is highly recommended.

   <b>Environment Variables</b>
       As documented in <b>hg help environment</b>, various environment
       variables influence the operation of Mercurial. The following are
       particularly relevant for machines consuming Mercurial:

       <b>HGPLAIN</b>
              If not set, Mercurial's output could be influenced by
              configuration settings that impact its encoding, verbose
              mode, localization, etc.

              It is highly recommended for machines to set this variable
              when invoking <b>hg </b>processes.

       <b>HGENCODING</b>
              If not set, the locale used by Mercurial will be detected
              from the environment. If the determined locale does not
              support display of certain characters, Mercurial may
              render these character sequences incorrectly (often by
              using "?" as a placeholder for invalid characters in the
              current locale).

              Explicitly setting this environment variable is a good
              practice to guarantee consistent results. "utf-8" is a
              good choice on UNIX-like environments.

       <b>HGRCPATH</b>
              If not set, Mercurial will inherit config options from
              config files using the process described in <b>hg help config</b>
              . This includes inheriting user or system-wide config
              files.

              When utmost control over the Mercurial configuration is
              desired, the value of <b>HGRCPATH </b>can be set to an explicit
              file with known good configs. In rare cases, the value can
              be set to an empty file or the null device (often
              <b>/dev/null</b>) to bypass loading of any user or system config
              files. Note that these approaches can have unintended
              consequences, as the user and system config files often
              define things like the username and extensions that may be
              required to interface with a repository.

       <b>HGRCSKIPREPO</b>
              When set, the .hg/hgrc from repositories are not read.

              Note that not reading the repository's configuration can
              have unintended consequences, as the repository config
              files can define things like extensions that are required
              for access to the repository.

   <b>Command-line Flags</b>
       Mercurial's default command-line parser is designed for humans,
       and is not robust against malicious input. For instance, you can
       start a debugger by passing <b>--debugger </b>as an option value:

       $ REV=--debugger sh -c 'hg log -r "$REV"'

       This happens because several command-line flags need to be
       scanned without using a concrete command table, which may be
       modified while loading repository settings and extensions.

       Since Mercurial 4.4.2, the parsing of such flags may be
       restricted by setting <b>HGPLAIN=+strictflags</b>. When this feature is
       enabled, all early options (e.g. <b>-R/--repository</b>, <b>--cwd</b>,
       <b>--config</b>) must be specified first amongst the other global
       options, and cannot be injected to an arbitrary location:

       $ HGPLAIN=+strictflags hg -R "$REPO" log -r "$REV"

       In earlier Mercurial versions where <b>+strictflags </b>isn't available,
       you can mitigate the issue by concatenating an option value with
       its flag:

       $ hg log -r"$REV" --keyword="$KEYWORD"

   <b>Consuming Command Output</b>
       It is common for machines to need to parse the output of
       Mercurial commands for relevant data. This section describes the
       various techniques for doing so.

   <b>Parsing Raw Command Output</b>
       Likely the simplest and most effective solution for consuming
       command output is to simply invoke <b>hg </b>commands as you would as a
       user and parse their output.

       The output of many commands can easily be parsed with tools like
       <b>grep</b>, <b>sed</b>, and <b>awk</b>.

       A potential downside with parsing command output is that the
       output of commands can change when Mercurial is upgraded. While
       Mercurial does generally strive for strong backwards
       compatibility, command output does occasionally change. Having
       tests for your automated interactions with <b>hg </b>commands is
       generally recommended, but is even more important when raw
       command output parsing is involved.

   <b>Using Templates to Control Output</b>
       Many <b>hg </b>commands support templatized output via the <b>-T/--template</b>
       argument. For more, see <b>hg help templates</b>.

       Templates are useful for explicitly controlling output so that
       you get exactly the data you want formatted how you want it. For
       example, <b>log -T {node}\n </b>can be used to print a newline delimited
       list of changeset nodes instead of a human-tailored output
       containing authors, dates, descriptions, etc.

       Tip    If parsing raw command output is too complicated, consider
              using templates to make your life easier.

       The <b>-T/--template </b>argument allows specifying pre-defined styles.
       Mercurial ships with the machine-readable styles <b>cbor</b>, <b>json</b>, and
       <b>xml</b>, which provide CBOR, JSON, and XML output, respectively.
       These are useful for producing output that is machine readable
       as-is.

       (Mercurial 5.0 is required for CBOR style.)

       Important
              The <b>json </b>and <b>xml </b>styles are considered experimental. While
              they may be attractive to use for easily obtaining
              machine-readable output, their behavior may change in
              subsequent versions.

              These styles may also exhibit unexpected results when
              dealing with certain encodings. Mercurial treats things
              like filenames as a series of bytes and normalizing
              certain byte sequences to JSON or XML with certain
              encoding settings can lead to surprises.

   <b>Command Server Output</b>
       If using the command server to interact with Mercurial, you are
       likely using an existing library/API that abstracts
       implementation details of the command server. If so, this
       interface layer may perform parsing for you, saving you the work
       of implementing it yourself.

   <b>Output Verbosity</b>
       Commands often have varying output verbosity, even when machine
       readable styles are being used (e.g. <b>-T json</b>). Adding
       <b>-v/--verbose </b>and <b>--debug </b>to the command's arguments can increase
       the amount of data exposed by Mercurial.

       An alternate way to get the data you need is by explicitly
       specifying a template.

   <b>Other Topics</b>
       <b>revsets</b>
              Revisions sets is a functional query language for
              selecting a set of revisions. Think of it as SQL for
              Mercurial repositories. Revsets are useful for querying
              repositories for specific data.

              See <b>hg help revsets </b>for more.

       <b>share extension</b>
              The <b>share </b>extension provides functionality for sharing
              repository data across several working copies. It can even
              automatically "pool" storage for logically related
              repositories when cloning.

              Configuring the <b>share </b>extension can lead to significant
              resource utilization reduction, particularly around disk
              space and the network. This is especially true for
              continuous integration (CI) environments.

              See <b>hg help -e share </b>for more.
</pre> <h2>
SUBREPOSITORIES </h2>
<pre>
       Subrepositories let you nest external repositories or projects
       into a parent Mercurial repository, and make commands operate on
       them as a group.

       Mercurial currently supports Mercurial, Git, and Subversion
       subrepositories.

       Subrepositories are made of three components:

       1. Nested repository checkouts. They can appear anywhere in the
          parent working directory.

       2. Nested repository references. They are defined in <b>.hgsub</b>,
          which should be placed in the root of working directory, and
          tell where the subrepository checkouts come from. Mercurial
          subrepositories are referenced like:

          path/to/nested = <a href="https://example.com/nested/repo/path">https://example.com/nested/repo/path</a>

          Git and Subversion subrepos are also supported:

          path/to/nested = [git]git://example.com/nested/repo/path
          path/to/nested = [svn]https://example.com/nested/trunk/path

          where <b>path/to/nested </b>is the checkout location relatively to
          the parent Mercurial root, and
          <b>https://example.com/nested/repo/path </b>is the source repository
          path. The source can also reference a filesystem path.

          Note that <b>.hgsub </b>does not exist by default in Mercurial
          repositories, you have to create and add it to the parent
          repository before using subrepositories.

       3. Nested repository states. They are defined in <b>.hgsubstate</b>,
          which is placed in the root of working directory, and capture
          whatever information is required to restore the
          subrepositories to the state they were committed in a parent
          repository changeset. Mercurial automatically record the
          nested repositories states when committing in the parent
          repository.

       Note
          The <b>.hgsubstate </b>file should not be edited manually.

   <b>Adding a Subrepository</b>
       If <b>.hgsub </b>does not exist, create it and add it to the parent
       repository. Clone or checkout the external projects where you
       want it to live in the parent repository. Edit <b>.hgsub </b>and add the
       subrepository entry as described above. At this point, the
       subrepository is tracked and the next commit will record its
       state in <b>.hgsubstate </b>and bind it to the committed changeset.

   <b>Synchronizing a Subrepository</b>
       Subrepos do not automatically track the latest changeset of their
       sources. Instead, they are updated to the changeset that
       corresponds with the changeset checked out in the top-level
       changeset. This is so developers always get a consistent set of
       compatible code and libraries when they update.

       Thus, updating subrepos is a manual process. Simply check out
       target subrepo at the desired revision, test in the top-level
       repo, then commit in the parent repository to record the new
       combination.

   <b>Deleting a Subrepository</b>
       To remove a subrepository from the parent repository, delete its
       reference from <b>.hgsub</b>, then remove its files.

   <b>Interaction with Mercurial Commands</b>
       <b>add    </b>add does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is
              specified.  However, if you specify the full path of a
              file in a subrepo, it will be added even without
              -S/--subrepos specified.  Subversion subrepositories are
              currently silently ignored.

       <b>addremove</b>
              addremove does not recurse into subrepos unless
              -S/--subrepos is specified.  However, if you specify the
              full path of a directory in a subrepo, addremove will be
              performed on it even without -S/--subrepos being
              specified.  Git and Subversion subrepositories will print
              a warning and continue.

       <b>archive</b>
              archive does not recurse in subrepositories unless
              -S/--subrepos is specified.

       <b>cat    </b>Git subrepositories only support exact file matches.
              Subversion subrepositories are currently ignored.

       <b>commit </b>commit creates a consistent snapshot of the state of the
              entire project and its subrepositories. If any
              subrepositories have been modified, Mercurial will abort.
              Mercurial can be made to instead commit all modified
              subrepositories by specifying -S/--subrepos, or setting
              "ui.commitsubrepos=True" in a configuration file (see <b>hg</b>
              <b>help config</b>).  After there are no longer any modified
              subrepositories, it records their state and finally
              commits it in the parent repository.  The --addremove
              option also honors the -S/--subrepos option.  However, Git
              and Subversion subrepositories will print a warning and
              abort.

       <b>diff   </b>diff does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos is
              specified.  However, if you specify the full path of a
              file or directory in a subrepo, it will be diffed even
              without -S/--subrepos being specified.  Subversion
              subrepositories are currently silently ignored.

       <b>files  </b>files does not recurse into subrepos unless -S/--subrepos
              is specified.  However, if you specify the full path of a
              file or directory in a subrepo, it will be displayed even
              without -S/--subrepos being specified.  Git and Subversion
              subrepositories are currently silently ignored.

       <b>forget </b>forget currently only handles exact file matches in
              subrepos.  Git and Subversion subrepositories are
              currently silently ignored.

       <b>incoming</b>
              incoming does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos
              is specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories are
              currently silently ignored.

       <b>outgoing</b>
              outgoing does not recurse in subrepos unless -S/--subrepos
              is specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories are
              currently silently ignored.

       <b>pull   </b>pull is not recursive since it is not clear what to pull
              prior to running <b>hg update</b>. Listing and retrieving all
              subrepositories changes referenced by the parent
              repository pulled changesets is expensive at best,
              impossible in the Subversion case.

       <b>push   </b>Mercurial will automatically push all subrepositories
              first when the parent repository is being pushed. This
              ensures new subrepository changes are available when
              referenced by top-level repositories.  Push is a no-op for
              Subversion subrepositories.

       <b>serve  </b>serve does not recurse into subrepositories unless
              -S/--subrepos is specified.  Git and Subversion
              subrepositories are currently silently ignored.

       <b>status </b>status does not recurse into subrepositories unless
              -S/--subrepos is specified. Subrepository changes are
              displayed as regular Mercurial changes on the
              subrepository elements. Subversion subrepositories are
              currently silently ignored.

       <b>remove </b>remove does not recurse into subrepositories unless
              -S/--subrepos is specified.  However, if you specify a
              file or directory path in a subrepo, it will be removed
              even without -S/--subrepos.  Git and Subversion
              subrepositories are currently silently ignored.

       <b>update </b>update restores the subrepos in the state they were
              originally committed in target changeset. If the recorded
              changeset is not available in the current subrepository,
              Mercurial will pull it in first before updating.  This
              means that updating can require network access when using
              subrepositories.

   <b>Remapping Subrepositories Sources</b>
       A subrepository source location may change during a project life,
       invalidating references stored in the parent repository history.
       To fix this, rewriting rules can be defined in parent repository
       <b>hgrc </b>file or in Mercurial configuration. See the <b>[subpaths]</b>
       section in hgrc(5) for more details.
</pre> <h2>
TEMPLATE USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through
       templates. You can either pass in a template or select an
       existing template-style from the command line, via the --template
       option.

       You can customize output for any "log-like" command: log,
       outgoing, incoming, tip, parents, and heads.

       Some built-in styles are packaged with Mercurial. These can be
       listed with <b>hg log --template list</b>. Example usage:

       $ hg log -r1.0::1.1 --template changelog

       A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable
       expansion:

       $ hg log -r1 --template "{node}\n"
       b56ce7b07c52de7d5fd79fb89701ea538af65746

   <b>Keywords</b>
       Strings in curly braces are called keywords. The availability of
       keywords depends on the exact context of the templater. These
       keywords are usually available for templating a log-like command:

       <b>_fast_rank</b>
              the rank of a changeset if cached

              The rank of a revision is the size of the sub-graph it
              defines as a head.  Equivalently, the rank of a revision <i>r</i>
              is the size of the set <i>ancestors(r)</i>, <i>r</i> included.

       <b>activebookmark</b>
              String. The active bookmark, if it is associated with the

              hash.

       <b>p2     </b>Changeset. The changeset's second parent. <b>{p2.rev} </b>for the
              revision number, and <b>{p2.node} </b>for the identification
              hash.

       <b>parents</b>
              List of strings. The parents of the changeset in
              "rev:node" format. If the changeset has only one "natural"
              parent (the predecessor revision) nothing is shown.

       <b>peerurls</b>

              String. The current output verbosity in 'debug', 'quiet',
              'verbose', or ''.

       The "date" keyword does not produce human-readable output. If you
       want to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to
       process it. Filters are functions which return a string based on
       the input variable. Be sure to use the stringify filter first
       when you're applying a string-input filter to a list-like input
       variable.  You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired
       output:

       $ hg tip --template "{date|isodate}\n"
       2008-08-21 18:22 +0000

   <b>Filters</b>
       List of filters:

       <b>addbreaks</b>
              Any text. Add an XHTML "&lt;br /&gt;" tag before the end of
              every line except the last.

       <b>age    </b>Date. Returns a human-readable date/time difference
              between the given date/time and the current date/time.

       <b>basename</b>
              Any text. Treats the text as a path, and returns the last
              component of the path after splitting by the path
              separator.  For example, "foo/bar/baz" becomes "baz" and
              "foo/bar//" becomes "".

       <b>cbor   </b>Any object. Serializes the object to CBOR bytes.

       <b>commondir</b>
              List of text. Treats each list item as file name with / as
              path separator and returns the longest common directory
              prefix shared by all list items.  Returns the empty string
              if no common prefix exists.

              The list items are not normalized, i.e. "foo/../bar" is
              handled as file "bar" in the directory "foo/..". Leading
              slashes are ignored.

              For example, ["foo/bar/baz", "foo/baz/bar"] becomes "foo"
              and ["foo/bar", "baz"] becomes "".

       <b>count  </b>List or text. Returns the length as an integer.

       <b>dirname</b>
              Any text. Treats the text as a path, and strips the last
              component of the path after splitting by the path
              separator.

       <b>domain </b>Any text. Finds the first string that looks like an email
              address, and extracts just the domain component. Example:
              <b>User &lt;user@example.com&gt; </b>becomes <b>example.com</b>.

       <b>email  </b>Any text. Extracts the first string that looks like an
              email address. Example: <b>User &lt;user@example.com&gt; </b>becomes
              <b>user@example.com</b>.

       <b>emailuser</b>
              Any text. Returns the user portion of an email address.

       <b>escape </b>Any text. Replaces the special XML/XHTML characters "&amp;",
              "&lt;" and "&gt;" with XML entities, and filters out NUL
              characters.

       <b>fill68 </b>Any text. Wraps the text to fit in 68 columns.

       <b>fill76 </b>Any text. Wraps the text to fit in 76 columns.

       <b>firstline</b>
              Any text. Returns the first line of text.

       <b>hex    </b>Any text. Convert a binary Mercurial node identifier into
              its long hexadecimal representation.

       <b>hgdate </b>Date. Returns the date as a pair of numbers: "1157407993
              25200" (Unix timestamp, timezone offset).

       <b>isodate</b>
              Date. Returns the date in ISO 8601 format: "2009-08-18
              13:00 +0200".

       <b>isodatesec</b>
              Date. Returns the date in ISO 8601 format, including
              seconds: "2009-08-18 13:00:13 +0200". See also the
              rfc3339date filter.

       <b>json   </b>Any object. Serializes the object to a JSON formatted
              text.

       <b>lower  </b>Any text. Converts the text to lowercase.

       <b>nonempty</b>
              Any text. Returns '(none)' if the string is empty.

       <b>obfuscate</b>
              Any text. Returns the input text rendered as a sequence of
              XML entities.

       <b>person </b>Any text. Returns the name before an email address,
              interpreting it as per RFC 5322.

       <b>revescape</b>
              Any text. Escapes all "special" characters, except @.
              Forward slashes are escaped twice to prevent web servers
              from prematurely unescaping them. For example, "@foo
              bar/baz" becomes "@foo%20bar%252Fbaz".

       <b>rfc3339date</b>
              Date. Returns a date using the Internet date format
              specified in RFC 3339: "2009-08-18T13:00:13+02:00".

       <b>rfc822date</b>
              Date. Returns a date using the same format used in email
              headers: "Tue, 18 Aug 2009 13:00:13 +0200".

       <b>short  </b>Changeset hash. Returns the short form of a changeset
              hash, i.e. a 12 hexadecimal digit string.

       <b>shortbisect</b>
              Any text. Treats <i>label</i> as a bisection status, and returns
              a single-character representing the status (G: good, B:
              bad, S: skipped, U: untested, I: ignored). Returns single
              space if <i>text</i> is not a valid bisection status.

       <b>shortdate</b>
              Date. Returns a date like "2006-09-18".

       <b>slashpath</b>
              Any text. Replaces the native path separator with slash.

       <b>splitlines</b>
              Any text. Split text into a list of lines.

       <b>stringify</b>
              Any type. Turns the value into text by converting values
              into text and concatenating them.

       <b>stripdir</b>
              Treat the text as path and strip a directory level, if
              possible. For example, "foo" and "foo/bar" becomes "foo".

       <b>tabindent</b>
              Any text. Returns the text, with every non-empty line
              except the first starting with a tab character.

       <b>upper  </b>Any text. Converts the text to uppercase.

       <b>urlescape</b>
              Any text. Escapes all "special" characters. For example,

              email address.

       <b>utf8   </b>Any text. Converts from the local character encoding to
              UTF-8.

       Note that a filter is nothing more than a function call, i.e.
       <b>expr|filter </b>is equivalent to <b>filter(expr)</b>.

   <b>Functions</b>
       In addition to filters, there are some basic built-in functions:

       <b>config(section, name[, default])</b>
              Returns the requested hgrc config option as a string.

       <b>configbool(section, name[, default])</b>
              Returns the requested hgrc config option as a boolean.

       <b>configint(section, name[, default])</b>
              Returns the requested hgrc config option as an integer.

       <b>date(date[, fmt])</b>
              Format a date. See <b>hg help dates </b>for formatting strings.
              The default is a Unix date format, including the timezone:
              "Mon Sep 04 15:13:13 2006 0700".

       <b>dict([[key=]value...])</b>
              Construct a dict from key-value pairs. A key may be
              omitted if a value expression can provide an unambiguous
              name.

       <b>diff([includepattern [, excludepattern]])</b>
              Show a diff, optionally specifying files to include or
              exclude.

       <b>files(pattern)</b>
              All files of the current changeset matching the pattern.
              See <b>hg help patterns</b>.

       <b>fill(text[, width[, initialident[, hangindent]]])</b>
              Fill many paragraphs with optional indentation. See the
              "fill" filter.

       <b>filter(iterable[, expr])</b>
              Remove empty elements from a list or a dict. If expr
              specified, it's applied to each element to test emptiness.

       <b>get(dict, key)</b>
              Get an attribute/key from an object. Some keywords are
              complex types. This function allows you to obtain the
              value of an attribute on these types.

       <b>if(expr, then[, else])</b>
              Conditionally execute based on the result of an
              expression.

       <b>ifcontains(needle, haystack, then[, else])</b>
              Conditionally execute based on whether the item "needle"
              is in "haystack".

       <b>ifeq(expr1, expr2, then[, else])</b>
              Conditionally execute based on whether 2 items are
              equivalent.

       <b>indent(text, indentchars[, firstline])</b>
              Indents all non-empty lines with the characters given in
              the indentchars string. An optional third parameter will
              override the indent for the first line only if present.

       <b>join(list, sep)</b>
              Join items in a list with a delimiter.

       <b>label(label, expr)</b>
              Apply a label to generated content. Content with a label
              applied can result in additional post-processing, such as
              automatic colorization.

       <b>latesttag([pattern])</b>
              The global tags matching the given pattern on the most
              recent globally tagged ancestor of this changeset.  If no
              such tags exist, the "{tag}" template resolves to the
              string "null". See <b>hg help revisions.patterns </b>for the
              pattern syntax.

       <b>localdate(date[, tz])</b>
              Converts a date to the specified timezone.  The default is
              local date.

       <b>mailmap(author)</b>
              Return the author, updated according to the value set in
              the .mailmap file

       <b>max(iterable)</b>
              Return the max of an iterable

       <b>min(iterable)</b>
              Return the min of an iterable

       <b>mod(a, b)</b>
              Calculate a mod b such that a / b + a mod b == a

       <b>pad(text, width[, fillchar=' '[, left=False[, truncate=False]]])</b>
              Pad text with a fill character.

       <b>relpath(path)</b>
              Convert a repository-absolute path into a filesystem path
              relative to the current working directory.

       <b>revset(query[, formatargs...])</b>
              Execute a revision set query. See <b>hg help revset</b>.

       <b>rstdoc(text, style)</b>
              Format reStructuredText.

       <b>search(pattern, text)</b>
              Look for the first text matching the regular expression
              pattern.  Groups are accessible as <b>{1}</b>, <b>{2}</b>, ... in
              %-mapped template.

       <b>separate(sep, args...)</b>
              Add a separator between non-empty arguments.

       <b>shortest(node, minlength=4)</b>
              Obtain the shortest representation of a node.

       <b>startswith(pattern, text)</b>
              Returns the value from the "text" argument if it begins
              with the content from the "pattern" argument.

       <b>strip(text[, chars])</b>
              Strip characters from a string. By default, strips all
              leading and trailing whitespace.

       <b>sub(pattern, replacement, expression)</b>
              Perform text substitution using regular expressions.

       <b>subsetparents(rev, revset)</b>
              Look up parents of the rev in the sub graph given by the
              revset.

       <b>word(number, text[, separator])</b>
              Return the nth word from a string.

   <b>Operators</b>
       We provide a limited set of infix arithmetic operations on
       integers:

       + for addition
       - for subtraction
       * for multiplication
       / for floor division (division rounded to integer nearest -infinity)

       Division fulfills the law x = x / y + mod(x, y).

       Also, for any expression that returns a list, there is a list
       operator:

       expr % "{template}"

       As seen in the above example, <b>{template} </b>is interpreted as a
       template.  To prevent it from being interpreted, you can use an
       escape character <b>\{ </b>or a raw string prefix, <b>r'...'</b>.

       The dot operator can be used as a shorthand for accessing a sub
       item:

       • <b>expr.member </b>is roughly equivalent to <b>expr % '{member}' </b>if <b>expr</b>
         returns a non-list/dict. The returned value is not stringified.

       • <b>dict.key </b>is identical to <b>get(dict, 'key')</b>.

   <b>Aliases</b>
       New keywords and functions can be defined in the <b>templatealias</b>
       section of a Mercurial configuration file:

       &lt;alias&gt; = &lt;definition&gt;

       Arguments of the form <i>a1</i>, <i>a2</i>, etc. are substituted from the alias
       into the definition.

       For example,

       [templatealias]
       r = rev
       rn = "{r}:{node|short}"
       leftpad(s, w) = pad(s, w, ' ', True)

       defines two symbol aliases, <b>r </b>and <b>rn</b>, and a function alias
       <b>leftpad()</b>.

       It's also possible to specify complete template strings, using
       the <b>templates </b>section. The syntax used is the general template
       string syntax.

       For example,

       [templates]
       nodedate = "{node|short}: {date(date, "%Y-%m-%d")}\n"

       defines a template, <b>nodedate</b>, which can be called like:

       $ hg log -r . -Tnodedate

       A template defined in <b>templates </b>section can also be referenced
       from another template:

       $ hg log -r . -T "{rev} {nodedate}"

       but be aware that the keywords cannot be overridden by templates.
       For example, a template defined as <b>templates.rev </b>cannot be
       referenced as <b>{rev}</b>.

       A template defined in <b>templates </b>section may have sub templates
       which are inserted before/after/between items:

       [templates]
       myjson = ' {dict(rev, node|short)|json}'
       myjson:docheader = '\{\n'
       myjson:docfooter = '\n}\n'
       myjson:separator = ',\n'

   <b>Examples</b>
       Some sample command line templates:

       • Format lists, e.g. files:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "files:\n{files % '  {file}\n'}"

       • Join the list of files with a ", ":

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "files: {join(files, ', ')}\n"

       • Join the list of files ending with ".py" with a ", ":

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "pythonfiles: {join(files('**.py'), ', ')}\n"

       • Separate non-empty arguments by a " ":

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{separate(' ', node, bookmarks, tags}\n"

       • Modify each line of a commit description:

         $ hg log --template "{splitlines(desc) % '**** {line}\n'}"

       • Format date:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{date(date, '%Y')}\n"

       • Display date in UTC:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{localdate(date, 'UTC')|date}\n"

       • Output the description set to a fill-width of 30:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{fill(desc, 30)}"

       • Use a conditional to test for the default branch:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{ifeq(branch, 'default', 'on the main branch',
         'on branch {branch}')}\n"

       • Append a newline if not empty:

         $ hg tip --template "{if(author, '{author}\n')}"

       • Label the output for use with the color extension:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{label('changeset.{phase}', node|short)}\n"

       • Invert the firstline filter, i.e. everything but the first
         line:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{sub(r'^.*\n?\n?', '', desc)}\n"

       • Display the contents of the 'extra' field, one per line:

         $ hg log -r 0 --template "{join(extras, '\n')}\n"

       • Mark the active bookmark with '*':

         $ hg log --template "{bookmarks % '{bookmark}{ifeq(bookmark, active, '*')} '}\n"

       • Find the previous release candidate tag, the distance and
         changes since the tag:

         $ hg log -r . --template "{latesttag('re:^.*-rc$') % '{tag}, {changes}, {distance}'}\n"

       • Mark the working copy parent with '@':

         $ hg log --template "{ifcontains(rev, revset('.'), '@')}\n"

       • Show details of parent revisions:

         $ hg log --template "{revset('parents(%d)', rev) % '{desc|firstline}\n'}"

       • Show only commit descriptions that start with "template":

         $ hg log --template "{startswith('template', firstline(desc))}\n"

       • Print the first word of each line of a commit message:

         $ hg log --template "{word(0, desc)}\n"
</pre> <h2>
URL PATHS </h2>
<pre>
       Valid URLs are of the form:

       local/filesystem/path[#revision]
       file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
       http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
       https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
       ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
       path://pathname

       Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial
       repositories or to bundle files (as created by <b>hg bundle </b>or <b>hg</b>
       <b>incoming --bundle</b>). See also <b>hg help paths</b>.

       An optional identifier after # indicates a particular branch,
       tag, or changeset to use from the remote repository. See also <b>hg</b>
       <b>help revisions</b>.

       Some features, such as pushing to <a href="#">http://</a> and <a href="#">https://</a> URLs are
       only possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the remote
       Mercurial server.

       Note that the security of HTTPS URLs depends on proper
       configuration of web.cacerts.

       Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:

       • SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination
         machine and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with
         remotecmd.

       • path is relative to the remote user's home directory by
         default. Use an extra slash at the start of a path to specify
         an absolute path:

         ssh://example.com//tmp/repository

       • Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right
         thing to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:

         Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
           Compression no
         Host *
           Compression yes

         Alternatively specify "ssh -C" as your ssh command in your
         configuration file or with the --ssh command line option.

       These URLs can all be stored in your configuration file with path
       aliases under the [paths] section like so:

       [paths]
       alias1 = URL1
       alias2 = URL2
       ...

       You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for
       example <b>hg pull alias1 </b>will be treated as <b>hg pull URL1</b>).

       Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults
       when you do not provide the URL to a command:

       <b>default:</b>
              When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone
              command saves the location of the source repository as the
              new repository's 'default' path. This is then used when
              you omit path from push- and pull-like commands (including
              incoming and outgoing).

       <b>default-push:</b>
              The push command will look for a path named
              'default-push', and prefer it over 'default' if both are
              defined.

       These alias can also be use in the <i>path://</i> scheme:

       [paths]
       alias1 = URL1
       alias2 = path://alias1
       ...

       check <b>hg help config.paths </b>for details about the behavior of such
       "sub-path".
</pre> <h2>
EXTENSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       This section contains help for extensions that are distributed
       together with Mercurial. Help for other extensions is available
       in the help system.

   <b>absorb</b>
       apply working directory changes to changesets (EXPERIMENTAL)

       The absorb extension provides a command to use annotate
       information to amend modified chunks into the corresponding
       non-public changesets.

       [absorb]
       # only check 50 recent non-public changesets at most
       max-stack-size = 50
       # whether to add noise to new commits to avoid obsolescence cycle
       add-noise = 1
       # make `amend --correlated` a shortcut to the main command
       amend-flag = correlated

       [color]
       absorb.description = yellow
       absorb.node = blue bold
       absorb.path = bold

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change creation</b>
   <b>absorb</b>
       incorporate corrections into the stack of draft changesets:

       hg absorb [OPTION] [FILE]...

       absorb analyzes each change in your working directory and
       attempts to amend the changed lines into the changesets in your
       stack that first introduced those lines.

       If absorb cannot find an unambiguous changeset to amend for a
       change, that change will be left in the working directory,
       untouched. They can be observed by <b>hg status </b>or <b>hg diff</b>
       afterwards. In other words, absorb does not write to the working
       directory.

       Changesets outside the revset <i>::. and not public() and not</i>
       <i>merge()</i> will not be changed.

       Changesets that become empty after applying the changes will be
       deleted.

       By default, absorb will show what it plans to do and prompt for
       confirmation.  If you are confident that the changes will be
       absorbed to the correct place, run <b>hg absorb -a </b>to apply the
       changes immediately.

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if all chunks were ignored and nothing
       amended.

       Options:

       <b>-a, --apply-changes</b>
              apply changes without prompting for confirmation

       <b>-p, --print-changes</b>
              always print which changesets are modified by which
              changes

       <b>-i, --interactive</b>
              interactively select which chunks to apply

       <b>-e, --edit-lines</b>
              edit what lines belong to which changesets before commit
              (EXPERIMENTAL)

       <b>-n, --dry-run</b>
              do not perform actions, just print output

       <b>--style </b><i>&lt;STYLE&gt;</i>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>acl</b>
       hooks for controlling repository access

       This hook makes it possible to allow or deny write access to
       given branches and paths of a repository when receiving incoming
       changesets via pretxnchangegroup and pretxncommit.

       The authorization is matched based on the local user name on the
       system where the hook runs, and not the committer of the original
       changeset (since the latter is merely informative).

       The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like
       hgsh, preventing authenticating users from doing anything other
       than pushing or pulling. The hook is not safe to use if users
       have interactive shell access, as they can then disable the hook.
       Nor is it safe if remote users share an account, because then
       there is no way to distinguish them.

       The order in which access checks are performed is:

       1. Deny  list for branches (section <b>acl.deny.branches</b>)

       2. Allow list for branches (section <b>acl.allow.branches</b>)

       3. Deny  list for paths    (section <b>acl.deny</b>)

       4. Allow list for paths    (section <b>acl.allow</b>)

       The allow and deny sections take key-value pairs.

   <b>Branch-based Access Control</b>
       Use the <b>acl.deny.branches </b>and <b>acl.allow.branches </b>sections to have
       branch-based access control. Keys in these sections can be
       either:

       • a branch name, or

       • an asterisk, to match any branch;

       The corresponding values can be either:

       • a comma-separated list containing users and groups, or

       • an asterisk, to match anyone;

       You can add the "!" prefix to a user or group name to invert the
       sense of the match.

   <b>Path-based Access Control</b>
       Use the <b>acl.deny </b>and <b>acl.allow </b>sections to have path-based access
       control. Keys in these sections accept a subtree pattern (with a
       glob syntax by default). The corresponding values follow the same
       syntax as the other sections above.

   <b>Bookmark-based Access Control</b>
       Use the <b>acl.deny.bookmarks </b>and <b>acl.allow.bookmarks </b>sections to
       have bookmark-based access control. Keys in these sections can be
       either:

       • a bookmark name, or

       • an asterisk, to match any bookmark;

       The corresponding values can be either:

       • a comma-separated list containing users and groups, or

       • an asterisk, to match anyone;

       You can add the "!" prefix to a user or group name to invert the
       sense of the match.

       Note: for interactions between clients and servers using
       Mercurial 3.6+ a rejection will generally reject the entire push,
       for interactions involving older clients, the commit transactions
       will already be accepted, and only the bookmark movement will be
       rejected.

   <b>Groups</b>
       Group names must be prefixed with an <b>@ </b>symbol. Specifying a group
       name has the same effect as specifying all the users in that
       group.

       You can define group members in the <b>acl.groups </b>section.  If a
       group name is not defined there, and Mercurial is running under a
       Unix-like system, the list of users will be taken from the OS.
       Otherwise, an exception will be raised.

   <b>Example Configuration</b>
       [hooks]

       # Use this if you want to check access restrictions at commit time
       pretxncommit.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook

       # Use this if you want to check access restrictions for pull, push,
       # bundle and serve.
       pretxnchangegroup.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook

       [acl]
       # Allow or deny access for incoming changes only if their source is
       # listed here, let them pass otherwise. Source is "serve" for all

   <b>Examples using the ! prefix</b>
       Suppose there's a branch that only a given user (or group) should
       be able to push to, and you don't want to restrict access to any
       other branch that may be created.

       The "!" prefix allows you to prevent anyone except a given user
       or group to push changesets in a given branch or path.

       In the examples below, we will: 1) Deny access to branch "ring"
       to anyone but user "gollum" 2) Deny access to branch "lake" to
       anyone but members of the group "hobbit" 3) Deny access to a file
       to anyone but user "gollum"

       [acl.allow.branches]
       # Empty

       [acl.deny.branches]

       # 1) only 'gollum' can commit to branch 'ring';
       # 'gollum' and anyone else can still commit to any other branch.
       ring = !gollum

       # 2) only members of the group 'hobbit' can commit to branch 'lake';
       # 'hobbit' members and anyone else can still commit to any other branch.
       lake = !@hobbit

       # You can also deny access based on file paths:

       [acl.allow]
       # Empty

       [acl.deny]
       # 3) only 'gollum' can change the file below;
       # 'gollum' and anyone else can still change any other file.

       logsource = True

       [blackbox]
       track = command, commandfinish, commandexception, exthook, pythonhook

       [blackbox]
       track = incoming

       [blackbox]
       # limit the size of a log file
       maxsize = 1.5 MB
       # rotate up to N log files when the current one gets too big
       maxfiles = 3

       [blackbox]

   <b>bookflow</b>
       implements bookmark-based branching (EXPERIMENTAL)

          • Disables creation of new branches (config:
            enable_branches=False).

          • Requires an active bookmark on commit (config:
            require_bookmark=True).

          • Doesn't move the active bookmark on update, only on commit.

          • Requires '--rev' for moving an existing bookmark.

          • Protects special bookmarks (config: protect=@).

          flow related commands

              <b>hg book NAME</b>
                     create a new bookmark

              <b>hg book NAME -r REV</b>
                     move bookmark to revision (fast-forward)

              <b>hg up|co NAME</b>
                     switch to bookmark

              <b>hg push -B .</b>
                     push active bookmark

   <b>bugzilla</b>
       hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker

       This hook extension adds comments on bugs in Bugzilla when
       changesets that refer to bugs by Bugzilla ID are seen. The
       comment is formatted using the Mercurial template mechanism.

       The bug references can optionally include an update for Bugzilla
       of the hours spent working on the bug. Bugs can also be marked
       fixed.

       Four basic modes of access to Bugzilla are provided:

       1. Access via the Bugzilla REST-API. Requires bugzilla 5.0 or
          later.

       2. Access via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface. Requires Bugzilla
          3.4 or later.

       3. Check data via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface and submit bug
          change via email to Bugzilla email interface. Requires
          Bugzilla 3.4 or later.

       4. Writing directly to the Bugzilla database. Only Bugzilla
          installations using MySQL are supported. Requires Python
          MySQLdb.

       Writing directly to the database is susceptible to schema
       changes, and relies on a Bugzilla contrib script to send out bug
       change notification emails. This script runs as the user running
       Mercurial, must be run on the host with the Bugzilla install, and
       requires permission to read Bugzilla configuration details and
       the necessary MySQL user and password to have full access rights
       to the Bugzilla database. For these reasons this access mode is
       now considered deprecated, and will not be updated for new
       Bugzilla versions going forward. Only adding comments is
       supported in this access mode.

       Access via XMLRPC needs a Bugzilla username and password to be
       specified in the configuration. Comments are added under that
       username. Since the configuration must be readable by all
       Mercurial users, it is recommended that the rights of that user
       are restricted in Bugzilla to the minimum necessary to add
       comments. Marking bugs fixed requires Bugzilla 4.0 and later.

       Access via XMLRPC/email uses XMLRPC to query Bugzilla, but sends
       email to the Bugzilla email interface to submit comments to bugs.
       The From: address in the email is set to the email address of the
       Mercurial user, so the comment appears to come from the Mercurial
       user. In the event that the Mercurial user email is not
       recognized by Bugzilla as a Bugzilla user, the email associated
       with the Bugzilla username used to log into Bugzilla is used
       instead as the source of the comment. Marking bugs fixed works on
       all supported Bugzilla versions.

       Access via the REST-API needs either a Bugzilla username and
       password or an apikey specified in the configuration. Comments
       are made under the given username or the user associated with the
       apikey in Bugzilla.

       Configuration items common to all access modes:

       <b>bugzilla.version</b>
              The access type to use. Values recognized are:

              <b>restapi</b>

              <b>2.16</b>

                     MySQL access, Bugzilla 2.16 and up to but not
                     including 2.18.

       <b>bugzilla.regexp</b>
              Regular expression to match bug IDs for update in
              changeset commit message.  It must contain one "()" named
              group <b>&lt;ids&gt; </b>containing the bug IDs separated by non-digit
              characters. It may also contain a named group <b>&lt;hours&gt; </b>with
              a floating-point number giving the hours worked on the
              bug. If no named groups are present, the first "()" group
              is assumed to contain the bug IDs, and work time is not
              updated. The default expression matches <b>Bug 1234</b>, <b>Bug no.</b>
              <b>1234</b>, <b>Bug number 1234</b>, <b>Bugs 1234,5678</b>, <b>Bug 1234 and 5678</b>

              insensitive.

       <b>bugzilla.fixregexp</b>
              Regular expression to match bug IDs for marking fixed in
              changeset commit message. This must contain a "()" named
              group <b>&lt;ids&gt;` containing the bug IDs separated by non-digit</b>
              <b>characters. It may also contain a named group ``&lt;hours&gt;</b>
              with a floating-point number giving the hours worked on
              the bug. If no named groups are present, the first "()"
              group is assumed to contain the bug IDs, and work time is
              not updated. The default expression matches <b>Fixes 1234</b>,
              <b>Fixes bug 1234</b>, <b>Fixes bugs 1234,5678</b>, <b>Fixes 1234 and 5678</b>
              and variations thereof, followed by an hours number
              prefixed by <b>h </b>or <b>hours</b>, e.g. <b>hours 1.5</b>. Matching is case
              insensitive.

       <b>bugzilla.template</b>
              Template to use when formatting comments. Overrides style
              if specified. In addition to the usual Mercurial keywords,
              the extension specifies:

              <b>{bug}</b>

                     The Bugzilla bug ID.

              <b>{root}</b>

              with <b>{root} /var/local/my-project </b>with a strip of 2 gives
              a value for <b>{webroot} </b>of <b>my-project</b>. Default 0.

       <b>web.baseurl</b>
              Base URL for browsing Mercurial repositories. Referenced
              from templates as <b>{hgweb}</b>.

   <b>censor</b>
       erase file content at a given revision

       The censor command instructs Mercurial to erase all content of a
       file at a given revision <i>without updating the changeset hash.</i>
       This allows existing history to remain valid while preventing
       future clones/pulls from receiving the erased data.

       Typical uses for censor are due to security or legal
       requirements, including:

       * Passwords, private keys, cryptographic material
       * Licensed data/code/libraries for which the license has expired
       * Personally Identifiable Information or other private data

       Censored nodes can interrupt mercurial's typical operation
       whenever the excised data needs to be materialized. Some
       commands, like <b>hg cat</b>/<b>hg revert</b>, simply fail when asked to
       produce censored data. Others, like <b>hg verify </b>and <b>hg update</b>, must
       be capable of tolerating censored data to continue to function in
       a meaningful way. Such commands only tolerate censored file
       revisions if they are allowed by the "censor.policy=ignore"
       config option.

       A few informative commands such as <b>hg grep </b>will unconditionally
       ignore censored data and merely report that it was encountered.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Repository maintenance</b>
   <b>censor</b>
       hg censor -r REV [-t TEXT] [FILE]

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              censor file from specified revision

       <b>-t,</b><i>--tombstone</i> <b>&lt;TEXT&gt;</b>
              replacement tombstone data

   <b>children</b>
       command to display child changesets (DEPRECATED)

       This extension is deprecated. You should use <b>hg log -r</b>
       <b>"children(REV)" </b>instead.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change navigation</b>
   <b>children</b>
       show the children of the given or working directory revision:

       hg children [-r REV] [FILE]

       Print the children of the working directory's revisions. If a
       revision is given via -r/--rev, the children of that revision
       will be printed. If a file argument is given, revision in which
       the file was last changed (after the working directory revision
       or the argument to --rev if given) is printed.

       Please use <b>hg log </b>instead:

       hg children =&gt; hg log -r "children(.)"
       hg children -r REV =&gt; hg log -r "children(REV)"

       See <b>hg help log </b>and <b>hg help revsets.children</b>.

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              show children of the specified revision (default: .)

       <b>--style </b><i>&lt;STYLE&gt;</i>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

   <b>churn</b>
       command to display statistics about repository history

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Repository maintenance</b>
   <b>churn</b>
       histogram of changes to the repository:

       hg churn [-d DATE] [-r REV] [--aliases FILE] [FILE]

       This command will display a histogram representing the number of
       changed lines or revisions, grouped according to the given
       template. The default template will group changes by author.  The
       --dateformat option may be used to group the results by date
       instead.

       Statistics are based on the number of changed lines, or
       alternatively the number of matching revisions if the
       --changesets option is specified.

       Examples:

       # display count of changed lines for every committer
       hg churn -T "{author|email}"

       # display daily activity graph
       hg churn -f "%H" -s -c

       # display activity of developers by month
       hg churn -f "%Y-%m" -s -c

       # display count of lines changed in every year
       hg churn -f "%Y" -s

       # display count of lines changed in a time range
       hg churn -d "2020-04 to 2020-09"

       It is possible to map alternate email addresses to a main address
       by providing a file using the following format:

       &lt;alias email&gt; = &lt;actual email&gt;

       Such a file may be specified with the --aliases option, otherwise
       a .hgchurn file will be looked for in the working directory root.
       Aliases will be split from the rightmost "=".

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              count rate for the specified revision or revset

       <b>-d,</b><i>--date</i> <b>&lt;DATE&gt;</b>
              count rate for revisions matching date spec

       <b>-t,</b><i>--oldtemplate</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              template to group changesets (DEPRECATED)

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              template to group changesets (default: {author|email})

       <b>-f,</b><i>--dateformat</i> <b>&lt;FORMAT&gt;</b>
              strftime-compatible format for grouping by date

       <b>-c, --changesets</b>
              count rate by number of changesets

       <b>-s, --sort</b>

   <b>clonebundles</b>
       advertise pre-generated bundles to seed clones

       "clonebundles" is a server-side extension used to advertise the
       existence of pre-generated, externally hosted bundle files to
       clients that are cloning so that cloning can be faster, more
       reliable, and require less resources on the server. "pullbundles"
       is a related feature for sending pre-generated bundle files to
       clients as part of pull operations.

       Cloning can be a CPU and I/O intensive operation on servers.
       Traditionally, the server, in response to a client's request to
       clone, dynamically generates a bundle containing the entire
       repository content and sends it to the client.  There is no
       caching on the server and the server will have to redundantly
       generate the same outgoing bundle in response to each clone
       request. For servers with large repositories or with high clone
       volume, the load from clones can make scaling the server
       challenging and costly.

       This extension provides server operators the ability to offload
       potentially expensive clone load to an external service.
       Pre-generated bundles also allow using more CPU intensive
       compression, reducing the effective bandwidth requirements.

       Here's how clone bundles work:

       1. A server operator establishes a mechanism for making bundle
          files available on a hosting service where Mercurial clients
          can fetch them.

       2. A manifest file listing available bundle URLs and some
          optional metadata is added to the Mercurial repository on the
          server.

       3. A client initiates a clone against a clone bundles aware
          server.

       4. The client sees the server is advertising clone bundles and
          fetches the manifest listing available bundles.

       5. The client filters and sorts the available bundles based on
          what it supports and prefers.

       6. The client downloads and applies an available bundle from the
          server-specified URL.

       7. The client reconnects to the original server and performs the
          equivalent of <b>hg pull </b>to retrieve all repository data not in
          the bundle. (The repository could have been updated between
          when the bundle was created and when the client started the
          clone.) This may use "pullbundles".

       Instead of the server generating full repository bundles for
       every clone request, it generates full bundles once and they are
       subsequently reused to bootstrap new clones. The server may still
       transfer data at clone time.  However, this is only data that has
       been added/changed since the bundle was created. For large,
       established repositories, this can reduce server load for clones
       to less than 1% of original.

       Here's how pullbundles work:

       1. A manifest file listing available bundles and describing the
          revisions is added to the Mercurial repository on the server.

       2. A new-enough client informs the server that it supports
          partial pulls and initiates a pull.

       3. If the server has pull bundles enabled and sees the client
          advertising partial pulls, it checks for a matching pull
          bundle in the manifest.  A bundle matches if the format is
          supported by the client, the client has the required revisions
          already and needs something from the bundle.

       4. If there is at least one matching bundle, the server sends it
          to the client.

       5. The client applies the bundle and notices that the server
          reply was incomplete. It initiates another pull.

       To work, this extension requires the following of server
       operators:

       • Generating bundle files of repository content (typically
         periodically, such as once per day).

       • Clone bundles: A file server that clients have network access
         to and that Python knows how to talk to through its normal URL
         handling facility (typically an HTTP/HTTPS server).

       • A process for keeping the bundles manifest in sync with
         available bundle files.

       Strictly speaking, using a static file hosting server isn't
       required: a server operator could use a dynamic service for
       retrieving bundle data. However, static file hosting services are
       simple and scalable and should be sufficient for most needs.

       Bundle files can be generated with the <b>hg bundle </b>command.
       Typically <b>hg bundle --all </b>is used to produce a bundle of the
       entire repository.

       <b>hg debugcreatestreamclonebundle </b>can be used to produce a special
       <i>streaming clonebundle</i>. These are bundle files that are extremely
       efficient to produce and consume (read: fast). However, they are
       larger than traditional bundle formats and require that clients
       support the exact set of repository data store formats in use by
       the repository that created them.  Typically, a newer server can
       serve data that is compatible with older clients.  However,
       <i>streaming clone bundles</i> don't have this guarantee. <b>Server</b>
       <b>operators need to be aware that newer versions of Mercurial may</b>
       <b>produce streaming clone bundles incompatible with older Mercurial</b>
       <b>versions.</b>

       A server operator is responsible for creating a
       <b>.hg/clonebundles.manifest </b>file containing the list of available
       bundle files suitable for seeding clones. If this file does not
       exist, the repository will not advertise the existence of clone
       bundles when clients connect. For pull bundles,
       <b>.hg/pullbundles.manifest </b>is used.

       The manifest file contains a newline (n) delimited list of
       entries.

       Each line in this file defines an available bundle. Lines have
       the format:

          &lt;URL&gt; [&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;[ &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;]]

       That is, a URL followed by an optional, space-delimited list of
       key=value pairs describing additional properties of this bundle.
       Both keys and values are URI encoded.

       For pull bundles, the URL is a path under the <b>.hg </b>directory of
       the repository.

       Keys in UPPERCASE are reserved for use by Mercurial and are
       defined below.  All non-uppercase keys can be used by site
       installations. An example use for custom properties is to use the
       <i>datacenter</i> attribute to define which data center a file is hosted
       in. Clients could then prefer a server in the data center closest
       to them.

       The following reserved keys are currently defined:

       <b>BUNDLESPEC</b>
              A "bundle specification" string that describes the type of
              the bundle.

              These are string values that are accepted by the "--type"
              argument of <b>hg bundle</b>.

              The values are parsed in strict mode, which means they
              must be of the "&lt;compression&gt;-&lt;type&gt;" form. See
              mercurial.exchange.parsebundlespec() for more details.

              <b>hg debugbundle --spec </b>can be used to print the bundle
              specification string for a bundle file. The output of this
              command can be used verbatim for the value of <b>BUNDLESPEC</b>
              (it is already escaped).

              Clients will automatically filter out specifications that
              are unknown or unsupported so they won't attempt to
              download something that likely won't apply.

              The actual value doesn't impact client behavior beyond
              filtering: clients will still sniff the bundle type from
              the header of downloaded files.

              <b>Use of this key is highly recommended</b>, as it allows
              clients to easily skip unsupported bundles. If this key is
              not defined, an old client may attempt to apply a bundle
              that it is incapable of reading.

       <b>REQUIRESNI</b>
              Whether Server Name Indication (SNI) is required to
              connect to the URL.  SNI allows servers to use multiple
              certificates on the same IP. It is somewhat common in CDNs
              and other hosting providers. Older Python versions do not
              support SNI. Defining this attribute enables clients with
              older Python versions to filter this entry without
              experiencing an opaque SSL failure at connection time.

              If this is defined, it is important to advertise a non-SNI
              fallback URL or clients running old Python releases may
              not be able to clone with the clonebundles facility.

              Value should be "true".

       <b>REQUIREDRAM</b>
              Value specifies expected memory requirements to decode the
              payload.  Values can have suffixes for common bytes sizes.
              e.g. "64MB".

              This key is often used with zstd-compressed bundles using
              a high compression level / window size, which can require
              100+ MB of memory to decode.

       <b>heads  </b>Used for pull bundles. This contains the <b>; </b>separated
              changeset hashes of the heads of the bundle content.

       <b>bases  </b>Used for pull bundles. This contains the <b>; </b>separated
              changeset hashes of the roots of the bundle content. This
              can be skipped if the bundle was created without <b>--base</b>.

       Manifests can contain multiple entries. Assuming metadata is
       defined, clients will filter entries from the manifest that they
       don't support. The remaining entries are optionally sorted by
       client preferences (<b>ui.clonebundleprefers </b>config option). The
       client then attempts to fetch the bundle at the first URL in the
       remaining list.

       <b>Errors when downloading a bundle will fail the entire clone</b>
       <b>operation: clients do not automatically fall back to a</b>
       <b>traditional clone. </b>The reason for this is that if a server is
       using clone bundles, it is probably doing so because the feature
       is necessary to help it scale. In other words, there is an
       assumption that clone load will be offloaded to another service
       and that the Mercurial server isn't responsible for serving this
       clone load.  If that other service experiences issues and clients
       start mass falling back to the original Mercurial server, the
       added clone load could overwhelm the server due to unexpected
       load and effectively take it offline. Not having clients
       automatically fall back to cloning from the original server
       mitigates this scenario.

       Because there is no automatic Mercurial server fallback on
       failure of the bundle hosting service, it is important for server
       operators to view the bundle hosting service as an extension of
       the Mercurial server in terms of availability and service level
       agreements: if the bundle hosting service goes down, so does the
       ability for clients to clone. Note: clients will see a message
       informing them how to bypass the clone bundles facility when a
       failure occurs. So server operators should prepare for some
       people to follow these instructions when a failure occurs, thus
       driving more load to the original Mercurial server when the
       bundle hosting service fails.

   <b>closehead</b>

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change manipulation</b>
   <b>close-head</b>
       close the given head revisions:

   <b>convert</b>
       import revisions from foreign VCS repositories into Mercurial

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Uncategorized commands</b>
   <b>convert</b>
       convert a foreign SCM repository to a Mercurial one.:

       hg convert [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST [REVMAP]]

       Accepted source formats [identifiers]:

       • Mercurial [hg]

       • CVS [cvs]

       • Darcs [darcs]

       • git [git]

       • Subversion [svn]

       • Monotone [mtn]

       • GNU Arch [gnuarch]

       • Bazaar [bzr]

       • Perforce [p4]

       Accepted destination formats [identifiers]:

       • Mercurial [hg]

       • Subversion [svn] (history on branches is not preserved)

       If no revision is given, all revisions will be converted.
       Otherwise, convert will only import up to the named revision
       (given in a format understood by the source).

       If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
       basename of the source with <b>-hg </b>appended. If the destination
       repository doesn't exist, it will be created.

       By default, all sources except Mercurial will use --branchsort.
       Mercurial uses --sourcesort to preserve original revision numbers
       order. Sort modes have the following effects:

       <b>--branchsort</b>
              convert from parent to child revision when possible, which
              means branches are usually converted one after the other.
              It generates more compact repositories.

       <b>--datesort</b>
              sort revisions by date. Converted repositories have
              good-looking changelogs but are often an order of
              magnitude larger than the same ones generated by
              --branchsort.

       <b>--sourcesort</b>
              try to preserve source revisions order, only supported by
              Mercurial sources.

       <b>--closesort</b>
              try to move closed revisions as close as possible to
              parent branches, only supported by Mercurial sources.

       If <b>REVMAP </b>isn't given, it will be put in a default location
       (<b>&lt;dest&gt;/.hg/shamap </b>by default). The <b>REVMAP </b>is a simple text file
       that maps each source commit ID to the destination ID for that
       revision, like so:

       &lt;source ID&gt; &lt;destination ID&gt;

       If the file doesn't exist, it's automatically created. It's
       updated on each commit copied, so <b>hg convert </b>can be interrupted
       and can be run repeatedly to copy new commits.

       The authormap is a simple text file that maps each source commit
       author to a destination commit author. It is handy for source
       SCMs that use unix logins to identify authors (e.g.: CVS). One
       line per author mapping and the line format is:

       source author = destination author

       Empty lines and lines starting with a <b># </b>are ignored.

       The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of
       files and directories. Each line can contain one of the following
       directives:

       include path/to/file-or-dir

       exclude path/to/file-or-dir

       rename path/to/source path/to/destination

       Comment lines start with <b>#</b>. A specified path matches if it equals
       the full relative name of a file or one of its parent
       directories. The <b>include </b>or <b>exclude </b>directive with the longest
       matching path applies, so line order does not matter.

       The <b>include </b>directive causes a file, or all files under a
       directory, to be included in the destination repository. The
       default if there are no <b>include </b>statements is to include
       everything.  If there are any <b>include </b>statements, nothing else is
       included.  The <b>exclude </b>directive causes files or directories to
       be omitted. The <b>rename </b>directive renames a file or directory if
       it is converted. To rename from a subdirectory into the root of
       the repository, use <b>. </b>as the path to rename to.

       <b>--full </b>will make sure the converted changesets contain exactly
       the right files with the right content. It will make a full
       conversion of all files, not just the ones that have changed.
       Files that already are correct will not be changed. This can be
       used to apply filemap changes when converting incrementally. This
       is currently only supported for Mercurial and Subversion.

       The splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic
       history, letting you specify the parents of a revision. This is
       useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents,
       or graft two disconnected series of history together. Each entry
       contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two
       comma-separated values:

       key parent1, parent2

       The key is the revision ID in the source revision control system
       whose parents should be modified (same format as a key in
       .hg/shamap). The values are the revision IDs (in either the
       source or destination revision control system) that should be
       used as the new parents for that node. For example, if you have
       merged "release-1.0" into "trunk", then you should specify the
       revision on "trunk" as the first parent and the one on the
       "release-1.0" branch as the second.

       The branchmap is a file that allows you to rename a branch when
       it is being brought in from whatever external repository. When
       used in conjunction with a splicemap, it allows for a powerful
       combination to help fix even the most badly mismanaged
       repositories and turn them into nicely structured Mercurial
       repositories. The branchmap contains lines of the form:

       original_branch_name new_branch_name

       where "original_branch_name" is the name of the branch in the
       source repository, and "new_branch_name" is the name of the
       branch is the destination repository. No whitespace is allowed in
       the new branch name. This can be used to (for instance) move code
       in one repository from "default" to a named branch.

   <b>Mercurial Source</b>
       The Mercurial source recognizes the following configuration
       options, which you can set on the command line with <b>--config</b>:

       <b>convert.hg.ignoreerrors</b>
              ignore integrity errors when reading.  Use it to fix
              Mercurial repositories with missing revlogs, by converting
              from and to Mercurial. Default is False.

       <b>convert.hg.saverev</b>
              store original revision ID in changeset (forces target IDs
              to change). It takes a boolean argument and defaults to
              False.

       <b>convert.hg.startrev</b>
              specify the initial Mercurial revision.  The default is 0.

       <b>convert.hg.revs</b>
              revset specifying the source revisions to convert.

   <b>Bazaar Source</b>
       The following options can be used with <b>--config</b>:

       <b>convert.bzr.saverev</b>
              whether to store the original Bazaar commit ID in the
              metadata of the destination commit. The default is True.

   <b>CVS Source</b>
       CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out copy) from CVS
       to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct
       access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course
       the repository is <b>:local:</b>. The conversion uses the top level
       directory in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then
       uses CVS rlog commands to find files to convert. This means that
       unless a filemap is given, all files under the starting directory
       will be converted, and that any directory reorganization in the
       CVS sandbox is ignored.

       The following options can be used with <b>--config</b>:

       <b>convert.cvsps.cache</b>
              Set to False to disable remote log caching, for testing
              and debugging purposes. Default is True.

       <b>convert.cvsps.fuzz</b>
              Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is allowed
              between commits with identical user and log message in a
              single changeset. When very large files were checked in as
              part of a changeset then the default may not be long
              enough.  The default is 60.

       <b>convert.cvsps.logencoding</b>
              Specify encoding name to be used for transcoding CVS log
              messages. Multiple encoding names can be specified as a
              list (see <b>hg help config.Syntax</b>), but only the first
              acceptable encoding in the list is used per CVS log
              entries. This transcoding is executed before cvslog hook
              below.

       <b>convert.cvsps.mergeto</b>
              Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages
              are matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion
              process will insert a dummy revision merging the branch on
              which this log message occurs to the branch indicated in
              the regex. Default is <b>{{mergetobranch ([-\w]+)}}</b>

       <b>convert.cvsps.mergefrom</b>
              Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages
              are matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion
              process will add the most recent revision on the branch
              indicated in the regex as the second parent of the
              changeset. Default is <b>{{mergefrombranch ([-\w]+)}}</b>

       <b>convert.localtimezone</b>
              use local time (as determined by the TZ environment
              variable) for changeset date/times. The default is False
              (use UTC).

       <b>hooks.cvslog</b>
              Specify a Python function to be called at the end of
              gathering the CVS log. The function is passed a list with
              the log entries, and can modify the entries in-place, or
              add or delete them.

       <b>hooks.cvschangesets</b>
              Specify a Python function to be called after the
              changesets are calculated from the CVS log. The function
              is passed a list with the changeset entries, and can
              modify the changesets in-place, or add or delete them.

       An additional "debugcvsps" Mercurial command allows the builtin
       changeset merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its
       parameters and output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1. Please
       see the command help for more details.

   <b>Subversion Source</b>
       Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.
       By default, the supplied <b>svn://repo/path/ </b>source URL is converted
       as a single branch. If <b>svn://repo/path/trunk </b>exists it replaces
       the default branch. If <b>svn://repo/path/branches </b>exists, its
       subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If
       <b>svn://repo/path/tags </b>exists, it is looked for tags referencing
       converted branches. Default <b>trunk</b>, <b>branches </b>and <b>tags </b>values can
       be overridden with following options. Set them to paths relative
       to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto detection.

       The following options can be set with <b>--config</b>:

       <b>convert.svn.branches</b>
              specify the directory containing branches.  The default is
              <b>branches</b>.

       <b>convert.svn.tags</b>
              specify the directory containing tags. The default is
              <b>tags</b>.

       <b>convert.svn.trunk</b>
              specify the name of the trunk branch. The default is
              <b>trunk</b>.

       <b>convert.localtimezone</b>
              use local time (as determined by the TZ environment
              variable) for changeset date/times. The default is False
              (use UTC).

       Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,
       instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch
       conversions are supported.

       <b>convert.svn.startrev</b>
              specify start Subversion revision number.  The default is
              0.

   <b>Git Source</b>
       The Git importer converts commits from all reachable branches
       (refs in refs/heads) and remotes (refs in refs/remotes) to
       Mercurial.  Branches are converted to bookmarks with the same
       name, with the leading 'refs/heads' stripped. Git submodules are
       converted to Git subrepos in Mercurial.

       The following options can be set with <b>--config</b>:

       <b>convert.git.similarity</b>
              specify how similar files modified in a commit must be to
              be imported as renames or copies, as a percentage between
              <b>0 </b>(disabled) and <b>100 </b>(files must be identical). For
              example, <b>90 </b>means that a delete/add pair will be imported
              as a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn't changed.
              The default is <b>50</b>.

       <b>convert.git.findcopiesharder</b>
              while detecting copies, look at all files in the working
              copy instead of just changed ones. This is very expensive
              for large projects, and is only effective when
              <b>convert.git.similarity </b>is greater than 0. The default is
              False.

       <b>convert.git.renamelimit</b>
              perform rename and copy detection up to this many changed
              files in a commit. Increasing this will make rename and
              copy detection more accurate but will significantly slow
              down computation on large projects. The option is only
              relevant if <b>convert.git.similarity </b>is greater than 0. The
              default is <b>400</b>.

       <b>convert.git.committeractions</b>
              list of actions to take when processing author and
              committer values.

              Git commits have separate author (who wrote the commit)
              and committer (who applied the commit) fields. Not all
              destinations support separate author and committer fields
              (including Mercurial). This config option controls what to
              do with these author and committer fields during
              conversion.

              A value of <b>messagedifferent </b>will append a <b>committer: ...</b>
              line to the commit message if the Git committer is
              different from the author. The prefix of that line can be
              specified using the syntax <b>messagedifferent=&lt;prefix&gt;</b>. e.g.
              <b>messagedifferent=git-committer:</b>.  When a prefix is
              specified, a space will always be inserted between the
              prefix and the value.

              <b>messagealways </b>behaves like <b>messagedifferent </b>except it will
              always result in a <b>committer: ... </b>line being appended to
              the commit message. This value is mutually exclusive with
              <b>messagedifferent</b>.

              <b>dropcommitter </b>will remove references to the committer.
              Only references to the author will remain. Actions that
              add references to the committer will have no effect when
              this is set.

              <b>replaceauthor </b>will replace the value of the author field
              with the committer. Other actions that add references to
              the committer will still take effect when this is set.

              The default is <b>messagedifferent</b>.

       <b>convert.git.extrakeys</b>
              list of extra keys from commit metadata to copy to the
              destination. Some Git repositories store extra metadata in
              commits.  By default, this non-default metadata will be
              lost during conversion.  Setting this config option can
              retain that metadata. Some built-in keys such as <b>parent</b>
              and <b>branch </b>are not allowed to be copied.

       <b>convert.git.remoteprefix</b>
              remote refs are converted as bookmarks with
              <b>convert.git.remoteprefix </b>as a prefix followed by a /. The
              default is 'remote'.

       <b>convert.git.saverev</b>
              whether to store the original Git commit ID in the
              metadata of the destination commit. The default is True.

       <b>convert.git.skipsubmodules</b>
              does not convert root level .gitmodules files or files
              with 160000 mode indicating a submodule. Default is False.

   <b>Perforce Source</b>
       The Perforce (P4) importer can be given a p4 depot path or a
       client specification as source. It will convert all files in the
       source to a flat Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches
       and integrations. Note that when a depot path is given you then
       usually should specify a target directory, because otherwise the
       target may be named <b>...-hg</b>.

       The following options can be set with <b>--config</b>:

       <b>convert.p4.encoding</b>
              specify the encoding to use when decoding standard output
              of the Perforce command line tool. The default is default
              system encoding.

       <b>convert.p4.startrev</b>
              specify initial Perforce revision (a Perforce changelist
              number).

   <b>Mercurial Destination</b>
       The Mercurial destination will recognize Mercurial
       subrepositories in the destination directory, and update the
       .hgsubstate file automatically if the destination subrepositories
       contain the &lt;dest&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;/.hg/shamap file.  Converting a
       repository with subrepositories requires converting a single
       repository at a time, from the bottom up.

       An example showing how to convert a repository with
       subrepositories:

       # so convert knows the type when it sees a non empty destination
       $ hg init converted

       $ hg convert orig/sub1 converted/sub1
       $ hg convert orig/sub2 converted/sub2
       $ hg convert orig converted

       The following options are supported:

       <b>convert.hg.clonebranches</b>
              dispatch source branches in separate clones. The default
              is False.

       <b>convert.hg.tagsbranch</b>
              branch name for tag revisions, defaults to <b>default</b>.

       <b>convert.hg.usebranchnames</b>
              preserve branch names. The default is True.

       <b>convert.hg.sourcename</b>
              records the given string as a 'convert_source' extra value
              on each commit made in the target repository. The default
              is None.

       <b>convert.hg.preserve-hash</b>
              only works with mercurial sources. Make convert prevent
              performance improvement to the list of modified files in
              commits when such an improvement would cause the hash of a
              commit to change.  The default is False.

   <b>All Destinations</b>
       All destination types accept the following options:

       <b>convert.skiptags</b>
              does not convert tags from the source repo to the target
              repo. The default is False.

   <b>Subversion Destination</b>
       Original commit dates are not preserved by default.

       <b>convert.svn.dangerous-set-commit-dates</b>
              preserve original commit dates, forcefully setting
              <b>svn:date </b>revision properties. This option is DANGEROUS and
              may break some subversion functionality for the resulting
              repository (e.g. filtering revisions with date ranges in
              <b>svn log</b>), as original commit dates are not guaranteed to
              be monotonically increasing.

       For commit dates setting to work destination repository must have
       <b>pre-revprop-change </b>hook configured to allow setting of <b>svn:date</b>
       revision properties. See Subversion documentation for more
       details.

       Options:

       <b>--authors </b><i>&lt;FILE&gt;</i>

              preserve source changesets order

       <b>--closesort</b>
              try to reorder closed revisions

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>eol</b>
       automatically manage newlines in repository files

       This extension allows you to manage the type of line endings
       (CRLF or LF) that are used in the repository and in the local
       working directory. That way you can get CRLF line endings on
       Windows and LF on Unix/Mac, thereby letting everybody use their
       OS native line endings.

       The extension reads its configuration from a versioned <b>.hgeol</b>
       configuration file found in the root of the working directory.
       The <b>.hgeol </b>file use the same syntax as all other Mercurial
       configuration files. It uses two sections, <b>[patterns] </b>and
       <b>[repository]</b>.

       The <b>[patterns] </b>section specifies how line endings should be
       converted between the working directory and the repository. The
       format is specified by a file pattern. The first match is used,
       so put more specific patterns first. The available line endings
       are <b>LF</b>, <b>CRLF</b>, and <b>BIN</b>.

       Files with the declared format of <b>CRLF </b>or <b>LF </b>are always checked
       out and stored in the repository in that format and files
       declared to be binary (<b>BIN</b>) are left unchanged. Additionally,
       <b>native </b>is an alias for checking out in the platform's default
       line ending: <b>LF </b>on Unix (including Mac OS X) and <b>CRLF </b>on Windows.
       Note that <b>BIN </b>(do nothing to line endings) is Mercurial's default
       behavior; it is only needed if you need to override a later, more
       general pattern.

       The optional <b>[repository] </b>section specifies the line endings to
       use for files stored in the repository. It has a single setting,
       <b>native</b>, which determines the storage line endings for files
       declared as <b>native </b>in the <b>[patterns] </b>section. It can be set to <b>LF</b>
       or <b>CRLF</b>. The default is <b>LF</b>. For example, this means that on
       Windows, files configured as <b>native </b>(<b>CRLF </b>by default) will be
       converted to <b>LF </b>when stored in the repository. Files declared as
       <b>LF</b>, <b>CRLF</b>, or <b>BIN </b>in the <b>[patterns] </b>section are always stored
       as-is in the repository.

       Example versioned <b>.hgeol </b>file:

       [patterns]
       **.py = native
       **.vcproj = CRLF
       **.txt = native
       Makefile = LF
       **.jpg = BIN

       [repository]
       native = LF

       Note   The rules will first apply when files are touched in the
              working directory, e.g. by updating to null and back to
              tip to touch all files.

       The extension uses an optional <b>[eol] </b>section read from both the
       normal Mercurial configuration files and the <b>.hgeol </b>file, with
       the latter overriding the former. You can use that section to
       control the overall behavior. There are three settings:

       • <b>eol.native </b>(default <b>os.linesep</b>) can be set to <b>LF </b>or <b>CRLF </b>to
         override the default interpretation of <b>native </b>for checkout.
         This can be used with <b>hg archive </b>on Unix, say, to generate an
         archive where files have line endings for Windows.

       • <b>eol.only-consistent </b>(default True) can be set to False to make
         the extension convert files with inconsistent EOLs.
         Inconsistent means that there is both <b>CRLF </b>and <b>LF </b>present in
         the file.  Such files are normally not touched under the
         assumption that they have mixed EOLs on purpose.

       • <b>eol.fix-trailing-newline </b>(default False) can be set to True to
         ensure that converted files end with a EOL character (either <b>\n</b>
         or <b>\r\n </b>as per the configured patterns).

       The extension provides <b>cleverencode: </b>and <b>cleverdecode: </b>filters
       like the deprecated win32text extension does. This means that you
       can disable win32text and enable eol and your filters will still
       work. You only need to these filters until you have prepared a
       <b>.hgeol </b>file.

       The <b>win32text.forbid* </b>hooks provided by the win32text extension
       have been unified into a single hook named <b>eol.checkheadshook</b>.
       The hook will lookup the expected line endings from the <b>.hgeol</b>
       file, which means you must migrate to a <b>.hgeol </b>file first before
       using the hook. <b>eol.checkheadshook </b>only checks heads,
       intermediate invalid revisions will be pushed. To forbid them
       completely, use the <b>eol.checkallhook </b>hook. These hooks are best
       used as <b>pretxnchangegroup </b>hooks.

       See <b>hg help patterns </b>for more information about the glob patterns
       used.

   <b>extdiff</b>
       command to allow external programs to compare revisions

       The extdiff Mercurial extension allows you to use external
       programs to compare revisions, or revision with working
       directory. The external diff programs are called with a
       configurable set of options and two non-option arguments: paths
       to directories containing snapshots of files to compare.

       If there is more than one file being compared and the "child"
       revision is the working directory, any modifications made in the
       external diff program will be copied back to the working
       directory from the temporary directory.

       The extdiff extension also allows you to configure new diff
       commands, so you do not need to type <b>hg extdiff -p kdiff3 </b>always.

       [extdiff]
       # add new command that runs GNU diff(1) in 'context diff' mode
       cdiff = gdiff -Nprc5
       ## or the old way:
       #cmd.cdiff = gdiff
       #opts.cdiff = -Nprc5

       # add new command called meld, runs meld (no need to name twice).  If
       # the meld executable is not available, the meld tool in [merge-tools]
       # will be used, if available
       meld =

       # add new command called vimdiff, runs gvimdiff with DirDiff plugin
       # (see <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=102)">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=102)</a> Non
       # English user, be sure to put "let g:DirDiffDynamicDiffText = 1" in
       # your .vimrc
       vimdiff = gvim -f "+next" \
                 "+execute 'DirDiff' fnameescape(argv(0)) fnameescape(argv(1))"

       Tool arguments can include variables that are expanded at
       runtime:

       $parent1, $plabel1 - filename, descriptive label of first parent
       $child,   $clabel  - filename, descriptive label of child revision
       $parent2, $plabel2 - filename, descriptive label of second parent
       $root              - repository root
       $parent is an alias for $parent1.

       The extdiff extension will look in your [diff-tools] and
       [merge-tools] sections for diff tool arguments, when none are
       specified in [extdiff].

       [extdiff]
       kdiff3 =

       [diff-tools]
       kdiff3.diffargs=--L1 '$plabel1' --L2 '$clabel' $parent $child

       If a program has a graphical interface, it might be interesting
       to tell Mercurial about it. It will prevent the program from
       being mistakenly used in a terminal-only environment (such as an
       SSH terminal session), and will make <b>hg extdiff --per-file </b>open
       multiple file diffs at once instead of one by one (if you still
       want to open file diffs one by one, you can use the --confirm
       option).

       Declaring that a tool has a graphical interface can be done with
       the <b>gui </b>flag next to where <b>diffargs </b>are specified:

       [diff-tools]
       kdiff3.diffargs=--L1 '$plabel1' --L2 '$clabel' $parent $child
       kdiff3.gui = true

       You can use -I/-X and list of file or directory names like normal
       <b>hg diff </b>command. The extdiff extension makes snapshots of only
       needed files, so running the external diff program will actually
       be pretty fast (at least faster than having to compare the entire
       tree).

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>File content management</b>
   <b>extdiff</b>
       use external program to diff repository (or selected files):

       hg extdiff [OPT]... [FILE]...

       Show differences between revisions for the specified files, using
       an external program. The default program used is diff, with
       default options "-Npru".

       To select a different program, use the -p/--program option. The
       program will be passed the names of two directories to compare,
       unless the --per-file option is specified (see below). To pass
       additional options to the program, use -o/--option. These will be
       passed before the names of the directories or files to compare.

       The --from, --to, and --change options work the same way they do
       for <b>hg diff</b>.

       The --per-file option runs the external program repeatedly on
       each file to diff, instead of once on two directories. By
       default, this happens one by one, where the next file diff is
       open in the external program only once the previous external
       program (for the previous file diff) has exited. If the external
       program has a graphical interface, it can open all the file diffs
       at once instead of one by one. See <b>hg help -e extdiff </b>for
       information about how to tell Mercurial that a given program has
       a graphical interface.

       The --confirm option will prompt the user before each invocation
       of the external program. It is ignored if --per-file isn't
       specified.

       Options:

       <b>-p,</b><i>--program</i> <b>&lt;CMD&gt;</b>
              comparison program to run

       <b>-o,</b><i>--option</i> <b>&lt;OPT[+]&gt;</b>

       <b>-c,</b><i>--change</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              change made by revision

       <b>--per-file</b>
              compare each file instead of revision snapshots

       <b>--confirm</b>
              prompt user before each external program invocation

       <b>--patch</b>
              compare patches for two revisions

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       <b>-S, --subrepos</b>
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>factotum</b>
       http authentication with factotum

       This extension allows the factotum(4) facility on Plan 9 from
       Bell Labs platforms to provide authentication information for
       HTTP access. Configuration entries specified in the auth section
       as well as authentication information provided in the repository
       URL are fully supported. If no prefix is specified, a value of
       "*" will be assumed.

       By default, keys are specified as:

       proto=pass service=hg prefix=&lt;prefix&gt; user=&lt;username&gt; !password=&lt;password&gt;

       If the factotum extension is unable to read the required key, one
       will be requested interactively.

       A configuration section is available to customize runtime
       behavior. By default, these entries are:

       [factotum]
       executable = /bin/auth/factotum
       mountpoint = /mnt/factotum
       service = hg

       The executable entry defines the full path to the factotum
       binary. The mountpoint entry defines the path to the factotum
       file service. Lastly, the service entry controls the service name
       used when reading keys.

   <b>fastannotate</b>
       yet another annotate implementation that might be faster
       (EXPERIMENTAL)

       The fastannotate extension provides a 'fastannotate' command that
       makes use of the linelog data structure as a cache layer and is
       expected to be faster than the vanilla 'annotate' if the cache is
       present.

       In most cases, fastannotate requires a setup that mainbranch is
       some pointer that always moves forward, to be most efficient.

       Using fastannotate together with linkrevcache would speed up
       building the annotate cache greatly. Run "debugbuildlinkrevcache"
       before "debugbuildannotatecache".

       [fastannotate]
       # specify the main branch head. the internal linelog will only contain
       # the linear (ignoring p2) "mainbranch". since linelog cannot move
       # backwards without a rebuild, this should be something that always moves
       # forward, usually it is "master" or "@".
       mainbranch = master

       # fastannotate supports different modes to expose its feature.
       # a list of combination:
       # - fastannotate: expose the feature via the "fastannotate" command which
       #   deals with everything in a most efficient way, and provides extra
       #   features like --deleted etc.
       # - fctx: replace fctx.annotate implementation. note:
       #     a. it is less efficient than the "fastannotate" command
       #     b. it will make it practically impossible to access the old (disk
       #        side-effect free) annotate implementation
       #     c. it implies "hgweb".
       # - hgweb: replace hgweb's annotate implementation. conflict with "fctx".

   <b>fastexport</b>
       export repository as git fast-import stream:

       hg fastexport [OPTION]... [REV]...

       This command lets you dump a repository as a human-readable text
       stream.  It can be piped into corresponding import routines like
       "git fast-import".  Incremental dumps can be created by using
       marks files.

   <b>fetch</b>
       pull, update and merge in one command (DEPRECATED)

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Remote repository management</b>
   <b>fetch</b>
       pull changes from a remote repository, merge new changes if
       needed.:

       hg fetch [SOURCE]

       This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path
       or URL and adds them to the local repository.

       If the pulled changes add a new branch head, the head is
       automatically merged, and the result of the merge is committed.
       Otherwise, the working directory is updated to include the new
       changes.

       When a merge is needed, the working directory is first updated to
       the newly pulled changes. Local changes are then merged into the
       pulled changes. To switch the merge order, use --switch-parent.

       See <b>hg help dates </b>for a list of formats valid for -d/--date.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

   <b>fix</b>
       rewrite file content in changesets or working copy (EXPERIMENTAL)

       Provides a command that runs configured tools on the contents of
       modified files, writing back any fixes to the working copy or
       replacing changesets.

       Here is an example configuration that causes <b>hg fix </b>to apply
       automatic formatting fixes to modified lines in C++ code:

       [fix]
       clang-format:command=clang-format --assume-filename={rootpath}
       clang-format:linerange=--lines={first}:{last}
       clang-format:pattern=set:**.cpp or **.hpp

       The :command suboption forms the first part of the shell command
       that will be used to fix a file. The content of the file is
       passed on standard input, and the fixed file content is expected
       on standard output. Any output on standard error will be
       displayed as a warning. If the exit status is not zero, the file
       will not be affected. A placeholder warning is displayed if there
       is a non-zero exit status but no standard error output. Some
       values may be substituted into the command:

       {rootpath}  The path of the file being fixed, relative to the repo root
       {basename}  The name of the file being fixed, without the directory path

       If the :linerange suboption is set, the tool will only be run if
       there are changed lines in a file. The value of this suboption is
       appended to the shell command once for every range of changed
       lines in the file. Some values may be substituted into the
       command:

       {first}   The 1-based line number of the first line in the modified range
       {last}    The 1-based line number of the last line in the modified range

       Deleted sections of a file will be ignored by :linerange, because
       there is no corresponding line range in the version being fixed.

       By default, tools that set :linerange will only be executed if
       there is at least one changed line range. This is meant to
       prevent accidents like running a code formatter in such a way
       that it unexpectedly reformats the whole file. If such a tool
       needs to operate on unchanged files, it should set the :skipclean
       suboption to false.

       The :pattern suboption determines which files will be passed
       through each configured tool. See <b>hg help patterns </b>for possible
       values. However, all patterns are relative to the repo root, even
       if that text says they are relative to the current working
       directory. If there are file arguments to <b>hg fix</b>, the
       intersection of these patterns is used.

       There is also a configurable limit for the maximum size of file
       that will be processed by <b>hg fix</b>:

       [fix]
       maxfilesize = 2MB

       Normally, execution of configured tools will continue after a
       failure (indicated by a non-zero exit status). It can also be
       configured to abort after the first such failure, so that no
       files will be affected if any tool fails. This abort will also
       cause <b>hg fix </b>to exit with a non-zero status:

       [fix]
       failure = abort

       When multiple tools are configured to affect a file, they execute
       in an order defined by the :priority suboption. The priority
       suboption has a default value of zero for each tool. Tools are
       executed in order of descending priority. The execution order of
       tools with equal priority is unspecified. For example, you could
       use the 'sort' and 'head' utilities to keep only the 10 smallest
       numbers in a text file by ensuring that 'sort' runs before
       'head':

       [fix]
       sort:command = sort -n
       head:command = head -n 10
       sort:pattern = numbers.txt
       head:pattern = numbers.txt
       sort:priority = 2
       head:priority = 1

       To account for changes made by each tool, the line numbers used
       for incremental formatting are recomputed before executing the
       next tool. So, each tool may see different values for the
       arguments added by the :linerange suboption.

       Each fixer tool is allowed to return some metadata in addition to
       the fixed file content. The metadata must be placed before the
       file content on stdout, separated from the file content by a zero
       byte. The metadata is parsed as a JSON value (so, it should be
       UTF-8 encoded and contain no zero bytes). A fixer tool is
       expected to produce this metadata encoding if and only if the
       :metadata suboption is true:

       [fix]
       tool:command = tool --prepend-json-metadata
       tool:metadata = true

       The metadata values are passed to hooks, which can be used to
       print summaries or perform other post-fixing work. The supported
       hooks are:

       "postfixfile"
         Run once for each file in each revision where any fixer tools made changes
         to the file content. Provides "$HG_REV" and "$HG_PATH" to identify the file,
         and "$HG_METADATA" with a map of fixer names to metadata values from fixer
         tools that affected the file. Fixer tools that didn't affect the file have a
         value of None. Only fixer tools that executed are present in the metadata.

       "postfix"
         Run once after all files and revisions have been handled. Provides
         "$HG_REPLACEMENTS" with information about what revisions were created and
         made obsolete. Provides a boolean "$HG_WDIRWRITTEN" to indicate whether any
         files in the working copy were updated. Provides a list "$HG_METADATA"
         mapping fixer tool names to lists of metadata values returned from
         executions that modified a file. This aggregates the same metadata
         previously passed to the "postfixfile" hook.

       Fixer tools are run in the repository's root directory. This
       allows them to read configuration files from the working copy, or
       even write to the working copy.  The working copy is not updated
       to match the revision being fixed. In fact, several revisions may
       be fixed in parallel. Writes to the working copy are not amended
       into the revision being fixed; fixer tools should always write
       fixed file content back to stdout as documented above.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>File content management</b>
   <b>fix</b>
       rewrite file content in changesets or working directory:

       hg fix [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Runs any configured tools to fix the content of files. Only
       affects files with changes, unless file arguments are provided.
       Only affects changed lines of files, unless the --whole flag is
       used. Some tools may always affect the whole file regardless of
       --whole.

       If --working-dir is used, files with uncommitted changes in the
       working copy will be fixed. Note that no backup are made.

       If revisions are specified with --source, those revisions and
       their descendants will be checked, and they may be replaced with
       new revisions that have fixed file content. By automatically
       including the descendants, no merging, rebasing, or evolution
       will be required. If an ancestor of the working copy is included,
       then the working copy itself will also be fixed, and the working
       copy will be updated to the fixed parent.

       When determining what lines of each file to fix at each revision,
       the whole set of revisions being fixed is considered, so that
       fixes to earlier revisions are not forgotten in later ones. The
       --base flag can be used to override this default behavior, though
       it is not usually desirable to do so.

       Options:

       <b>--all  </b>fix all non-public non-obsolete revisions

       <b>--base </b><i>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</i>
              revisions to diff against (overrides automatic selection,
              and applies to every revision being fixed)

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              revisions to fix (ADVANCED)

       <b>-s,</b><i>--source</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              fix the specified revisions and their descendants

       <b>-w, --working-dir</b>
              fix the working directory

       <b>--whole</b>
              always fix every line of a file

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>fsmonitor</b>
       Faster status operations with the Watchman file monitor
       (EXPERIMENTAL)

       Integrates the file-watching program Watchman with Mercurial to
       produce faster status results.

       On a particular Linux system, for a real-world repository with
       over 400,000 files hosted on ext4, vanilla <i>hg status</i> takes 1.3
       seconds. On the same system, with fsmonitor it takes about 0.3
       seconds.

       fsmonitor requires no configuration -- it will tell Watchman
       about your repository as necessary. You'll need to install
       Watchman from <a href="https://facebook.github.io/watchman/">https://facebook.github.io/watchman/</a> and make sure
       it is in your PATH.

       fsmonitor is incompatible with the largefiles and eol extensions,
       and will disable itself if any of those are active.

       The following configuration options exist:

       [fsmonitor]
       mode = {off, on, paranoid}

       When <i>mode = off</i>, fsmonitor will disable itself (similar to not
       loading the extension at all). When <i>mode = on</i>, fsmonitor will be
       enabled (the default).  When <i>mode = paranoid</i>, fsmonitor will
       query both Watchman and the filesystem, and ensure that the
       results are consistent.

       [fsmonitor]
       timeout = (float)

       A value, in seconds, that determines how long fsmonitor will wait
       for Watchman to return results. Defaults to <i>2.0</i>.

       [fsmonitor]
       blacklistusers = (list of userids)

       A list of usernames for which fsmonitor will disable itself
       altogether.

       [fsmonitor]
       walk_on_invalidate = (boolean)

       Whether or not to walk the whole repo ourselves when our cached
       state has been invalidated, for example when Watchman has been
       restarted or .hgignore rules have been changed. Walking the repo
       in that case can result in competing for I/O with Watchman. For
       large repos it is recommended to set this value to false. You may
       wish to set this to true if you have a very fast filesystem that
       can outpace the IPC overhead of getting the result data for the
       full repo from Watchman. Defaults to false.

       [fsmonitor]
       warn_when_unused = (boolean)

       Whether to print a warning during certain operations when
       fsmonitor would be beneficial to performance but isn't enabled.

       [fsmonitor]
       warn_update_file_count = (integer)
       # or when mercurial is built with rust support
       warn_update_file_count_rust = (integer)

       If <b>warn_when_unused </b>is set and fsmonitor isn't enabled, a warning
       will be printed during working directory updates if this many
       files will be created.

   <b>git</b>
       grant Mercurial the ability to operate on Git repositories.
       (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This is currently super experimental. It probably will consume
       your firstborn a la Rumpelstiltskin, etc.

   <b>githelp</b>
       try mapping git commands to Mercurial commands

       Tries to map a given git command to a Mercurial command:

          $ hg githelp -- git checkout master hg update master

       If an unknown command or parameter combination is detected, an
       error is produced.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Help</b>
   <b>githelp</b>
       suggests the Mercurial equivalent of the given git command:

       hg githelp

       Usage: hg githelp -- &lt;git command&gt;

          aliases: git

   <b>gpg</b>
       commands to sign and verify changesets

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Signing changes (GPG)</b>
   <b>sigcheck</b>
       verify all the signatures there may be for a particular revision:

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>hgk</b>
       browse the repository in a graphical way

       The hgk extension allows browsing the history of a repository in
       a graphical way. It requires Tcl/Tk version 8.4 or later. (Tcl/Tk
       is not distributed with Mercurial.)

       hgk consists of two parts: a Tcl script that does the displaying
       and querying of information, and an extension to Mercurial named
       hgk.py, which provides hooks for hgk to get information. hgk can
       be found in the contrib directory, and the extension is shipped
       in the hgext repository, and needs to be enabled.

       The <b>hg view </b>command will launch the hgk Tcl script. For this
       command to work, hgk must be in your search path. Alternately,
       you can specify the path to hgk in your configuration file:

       [hgk]
       path = /location/of/hgk

       hgk can make use of the extdiff extension to visualize revisions.
       Assuming you had already configured extdiff vdiff command, just
       add:

       [hgk]
       vdiff=vdiff

       Revisions context menu will now display additional entries to
       fire vdiff on hovered and selected revisions.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change navigation</b>
   <b>view</b>
       start interactive history viewer:

       hg view [-l LIMIT] [REVRANGE]

       start interactive history viewer

       Options:

       <b>-l,</b><i>--limit</i> <b>&lt;NUM&gt;</b>
              limit number of changes displayed

   <b>Uncategorized commands</b>
   <b>highlight</b>
       syntax highlighting for hgweb (requires Pygments)

       It depends on the Pygments syntax highlighting library:
       <a href="http://pygments.org/">http://pygments.org/</a>

       There are the following configuration options:

       [web]
       pygments_style = &lt;style&gt; (default: colorful)
       highlightfiles = &lt;fileset&gt; (default: size('&lt;5M'))
       highlightonlymatchfilename = &lt;bool&gt; (default False)

       <b>highlightonlymatchfilename </b>will only highlight files if their
       type could be identified by their filename. When this is not
       enabled (the default), Pygments will try very hard to identify
       the file type from content and any match (even matches with a low
       confidence score) will be used.

   <b>histedit</b>
       interactive history editing

       With this extension installed, Mercurial gains one new command:
       histedit. Usage is as follows, assuming the following history:

       @  3[tip]   7c2fd3b9020c   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add delta
       |
       o  2   030b686bedc4   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add gamma
       |
       o  1   c561b4e977df   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add beta
       |
       o  0   d8d2fcd0e319   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
            Add alpha

       If you were to run <b>hg histedit c561b4e977df</b>, you would see the
       following file open in your editor:

       pick c561b4e977df Add beta
       pick 030b686bedc4 Add gamma
       pick 7c2fd3b9020c Add delta

       # Edit history between c561b4e977df and 7c2fd3b9020c
       #
       # Commits are listed from least to most recent
       #
       # Commands:
       #  p, pick = use commit
       #  e, edit = use commit, but allow edits before making new commit
       #  f, fold = use commit, but combine it with the one above
       #  r, roll = like fold, but discard this commit's description and date
       #  d, drop = remove commit from history
       #  m, mess = edit commit message without changing commit content
       #  b, base = checkout changeset and apply further changesets from there
       #

       In this file, lines beginning with <b># </b>are ignored. You must
       specify a rule for each revision in your history. For example, if
       you had meant to add gamma before beta, and then wanted to add
       delta in the same revision as beta, you would reorganize the file
       to look like this:

       pick 030b686bedc4 Add gamma
       pick c561b4e977df Add beta
       fold 7c2fd3b9020c Add delta

       # Edit history between c561b4e977df and 7c2fd3b9020c
       #
       # Commits are listed from least to most recent
       #
       # Commands:
       #  p, pick = use commit
       #  e, edit = use commit, but allow edits before making new commit
       #  f, fold = use commit, but combine it with the one above
       #  r, roll = like fold, but discard this commit's description and date
       #  d, drop = remove commit from history
       #  m, mess = edit commit message without changing commit content
       #  b, base = checkout changeset and apply further changesets from there
       #

       At which point you close the editor and <b>histedit </b>starts working.
       When you specify a <b>fold </b>operation, <b>histedit </b>will open an editor
       when it folds those revisions together, offering you a chance to
       clean up the commit message:

       Add beta
       ***
       Add delta

       Edit the commit message to your liking, then close the editor.
       The date used for the commit will be the later of the two
       commits' dates. For this example, let's assume that the commit
       message was changed to <b>Add beta and delta.  </b>After histedit has
       run and had a chance to remove any old or temporary revisions it
       needed, the history looks like this:

       @  2[tip]   989b4d060121   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add beta and delta.
       |
       o  1   081603921c3f   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
       |    Add gamma
       |
       o  0   d8d2fcd0e319   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   durin42
            Add alpha

       Note that <b>histedit </b>does <i>not</i> remove any revisions (even its own
       temporary ones) until after it has completed all the editing
       operations, so it will probably perform several strip operations
       when it's done. For the above example, it had to run strip twice.
       Strip can be slow depending on a variety of factors, so you might
       need to be a little patient. You can choose to keep the original
       revisions by passing the <b>--keep </b>flag.

       The <b>edit </b>operation will drop you back to a command prompt,
       allowing you to edit files freely, or even use <b>hg record </b>to
       commit some changes as a separate commit. When you're done, any
       remaining uncommitted changes will be committed as well. When
       done, run <b>hg histedit --continue </b>to finish this step. If there
       are uncommitted changes, you'll be prompted for a new commit
       message, but the default commit message will be the original
       message for the <b>edit </b>ed revision, and the date of the original
       commit will be preserved.

       The <b>message </b>operation will give you a chance to revise a commit
       message without changing the contents. It's a shortcut for doing
       <b>edit </b>immediately followed by <i>hg histedit --continue`</i>.

       If <b>histedit </b>encounters a conflict when moving a revision (while
       handling <b>pick </b>or <b>fold</b>), it'll stop in a similar manner to <b>edit</b>
       with the difference that it won't prompt you for a commit message
       when done. If you decide at this point that you don't like how
       much work it will be to rearrange history, or that you made a
       mistake, you can use <b>hg histedit --abort </b>to abandon the new
       changes you have made and return to the state before you
       attempted to edit your history.

       If we clone the histedit-ed example repository above and add four
       more changes, such that we have the following history:

       @  6[tip]   038383181893   2009-04-27 18:04 -0500   stefan

       If you run <b>hg histedit --outgoing </b>on the clone then it is the
       same as running <b>hg histedit 836302820282</b>. If you need plan to
       push to a repository that Mercurial does not detect to be related
       to the source repo, you can add a <b>--force </b>option.

   <b>Config</b>
       Histedit rule lines are truncated to 80 characters by default.
       You can customize this behavior by setting a different length in
       your configuration file:

       [histedit]
       linelen = 120      # truncate rule lines at 120 characters

       The summary of a change can be customized as well:

       [histedit]
       summary-template = '{rev} {bookmarks} {desc|firstline}'

       The customized summary should be kept short enough that rule
       lines will fit in the configured line length. See above if that
       requires customization.

       <b>hg histedit </b>attempts to automatically choose an appropriate base
       revision to use. To change which base revision is used, define a
       revset in your configuration file:

       [histedit]
       defaultrev = only(.) &amp; draft()

       By default each edited revision needs to be present in histedit
       commands.  To remove revision you need to use <b>drop </b>operation. You
       can configure the drop to be implicit for missing commits by
       adding:

       [histedit]
       dropmissing = True

       By default, histedit will close the transaction after each
       action. For performance purposes, you can configure histedit to
       use a single transaction across the entire histedit. WARNING:
       This setting introduces a significant risk of losing the work
       you've done in a histedit if the histedit aborts unexpectedly:

       [histedit]

   <b>Change manipulation</b>
   <b>histedit</b>
       interactively edit changeset history:

       hg histedit [OPTIONS] ([ANCESTOR] | --outgoing [URL])

       This command lets you edit a linear series of changesets (up to
       and including the working directory, which should be clean).  You
       can:

       • <i>pick</i> to [re]order a changeset

       • <i>drop</i> to omit changeset

       • <i>mess</i> to reword the changeset commit message

       • <i>fold</i> to combine it with the preceding changeset (using the
         later date)

       • <i>roll</i> like fold, but discarding this commit's description and
         date

       • <i>edit</i> to edit this changeset (preserving date)

       • <i>base</i> to checkout changeset and apply further changesets from
         there

       There are a number of ways to select the root changeset:

       • Specify ANCESTOR directly

       • Use --outgoing -- it will be the first linear changeset not
         included in destination. (See <b>hg help config.paths.default-push</b>
         )

       • Otherwise, the value from the "histedit.defaultrev" config
         option is used as a revset to select the base revision when
         ANCESTOR is not specified. The first revision returned by the
         revset is used. By default, this selects the editable history
         that is unique to the ancestry of the working directory.

       If you use --outgoing, this command will abort if there are
       ambiguous outgoing revisions. For example, if there are multiple
       branches containing outgoing revisions.

       Use "min(outgoing() and ::.)" or similar revset specification
       instead of --outgoing to specify edit target revision exactly in
       such ambiguous situation. See <b>hg help revsets </b>for detail about
       selecting revisions.

       Examples:

          • A number of changes have been made.  Revision 3 is no longer
            needed.

            Start history editing from revision 3:

            hg histedit -r 3

            An editor opens, containing the list of revisions, with
            specific actions specified:

            pick 5339bf82f0ca 3 Zworgle the foobar
            pick 8ef592ce7cc4 4 Bedazzle the zerlog
            pick 0a9639fcda9d 5 Morgify the cromulancy

            Additional information about the possible actions to take
            appears below the list of revisions.

            To remove revision 3 from the history, its action (at the
            beginning of the relevant line) is changed to 'drop':

            drop 5339bf82f0ca 3 Zworgle the foobar
            pick 8ef592ce7cc4 4 Bedazzle the zerlog
            pick 0a9639fcda9d 5 Morgify the cromulancy

          • A number of changes have been made.  Revision 2 and 4 need
            to be swapped.

            Start history editing from revision 2:

            hg histedit -r 2

            An editor opens, containing the list of revisions, with
            specific actions specified:

            pick 252a1af424ad 2 Blorb a morgwazzle
            pick 5339bf82f0ca 3 Zworgle the foobar
            pick 8ef592ce7cc4 4 Bedazzle the zerlog

            To swap revision 2 and 4, its lines are swapped in the
            editor:

            pick 8ef592ce7cc4 4 Bedazzle the zerlog
            pick 5339bf82f0ca 3 Zworgle the foobar
            pick 252a1af424ad 2 Blorb a morgwazzle

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if user intervention is required (not
       only for intentional "edit" command, but also for resolving
       unexpected conflicts).

   <b>hooklib</b>
       collection of simple hooks for common tasks (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This extension provides a number of simple hooks to handle issues
       commonly found in repositories with many contributors: - email
       notification when changesets move from draft to public phase -
       email notification when changesets are obsoleted - enforcement of
       draft phase for all incoming changesets - enforcement of a
       no-branch-merge policy - enforcement of a no-multiple-heads
       policy

       The implementation of the hooks is subject to change, e.g.
       whether to implement them as individual hooks or merge them into
       the notify extension as option. The functionality itself is
       planned to be supported long-term.

   <b>infinitepush</b>

       believed to be unused and barring learning of users of this
       functionality, we will delete this code at the end of 2020.

   <b>journal</b>
       track previous positions of bookmarks (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This extension adds a new command: <i>hg journal</i>, which shows you
       where bookmarks were previously located.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change organization</b>
   <b>journal</b>
       show the previous position of bookmarks and the working copy:

       hg journal [OPTION]... [BOOKMARKNAME]

       The journal is used to see the previous commits that bookmarks
       and the working copy pointed to. By default the previous
       locations for the working copy.  Passing a bookmark name will
       show all the previous positions of that bookmark. Use the --all
       switch to show previous locations for all bookmarks and the
       working copy; each line will then include the bookmark name, or
       '.' for the working copy, as well.

       If <i>name</i> starts with <i>re:</i>, the remainder of the name is treated as
       a regular expression. To match a name that actually starts with
       <i>re:</i>, use the prefix <i>literal:</i>.

       By default hg journal only shows the commit hash and the command
       that was running at that time. -v/--verbose will show the prior
       hash, the user, and the time at which it happened.

       Use -c/--commits to output log information on each commit hash;
       at this point you can use the usual <i>--patch</i>, <i>--git</i>, <i>--stat</i> and
       <i>--template</i> switches to alter the log output for these.

       <i>hg journal -T json</i> can be used to produce machine readable
       output.

       Options:

       <b>--all  </b>show history for all names

       <b>-c, --commits</b>
              show commit metadata

       <b>-p, --patch</b>
              show patch

       <b>-g, --git</b>
              use git extended diff format

       <b>-l,</b><i>--limit</i> <b>&lt;NUM&gt;</b>
              limit number of changes displayed

       <b>--stat </b>output diffstat-style summary of changes

       <b>--style </b><i>&lt;STYLE&gt;</i>
              display using template map file (DEPRECATED)

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

   <b>keyword</b>
       expand keywords in tracked files

       This extension expands RCS/CVS-like or self-customized $Keywords$
       in tracked text files selected by your configuration.

       Keywords are only expanded in local repositories and not stored
       in the change history. The mechanism can be regarded as a
       convenience for the current user or for archive distribution.

       Keywords expand to the changeset data pertaining to the latest
       change relative to the working directory parent of each file.

       Configuration is done in the [keyword], [keywordset] and
       [keywordmaps] sections of hgrc files.

       Example:

       [keyword]
       # expand keywords in every python file except those matching "x*"
       **.py =
       x*    = ignore

       [keywordset]
       # prefer svn- over cvs-like default keywordmaps
       svn = True

       Note   The more specific you are in your filename patterns the
              less you lose speed in huge repositories.

       For [keywordmaps] template mapping and expansion demonstration
       and control run <b>hg kwdemo</b>. See <b>hg help templates </b>for a list of
       available templates and filters.

       Three additional date template filters are provided:

       <b>utcdate</b>

              "2006/09/18 15:13:13"

       <b>svnutcdate</b>

              "2006-09-18 15:13:13Z"

       <b>svnisodate</b>

              "2006-09-18 08:13:13 -700 (Mon, 18 Sep 2006)"

       The default template mappings (view with <b>hg kwdemo -d</b>) can be
       replaced with customized keywords and templates. Again, run <b>hg</b>
       <b>kwdemo </b>to control the results of your configuration changes.

       Before changing/disabling active keywords, you must run <b>hg</b>
       <b>kwshrink </b>to avoid storing expanded keywords in the change
       history.

       To force expansion after enabling it, or a configuration change,
       run <b>hg kwexpand</b>.

       Expansions spanning more than one line and incremental
       expansions, like CVS' $Log$, are not supported. A keyword
       template map "Log = {desc}" expands to the first line of the
       changeset description.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Uncategorized commands</b>
   <b>kwdemo</b>
       print [keywordmaps] configuration and an expansion example:

       hg kwdemo [-d] [-f RCFILE] [TEMPLATEMAP]...

       Show current, custom, or default keyword template maps and their
       expansions.

       Extend the current configuration by specifying maps as arguments
       and using -f/--rcfile to source an external hgrc file.

       Use -d/--default to disable current configuration.

       See <b>hg help templates </b>for information on templates and filters.

       Options:

       <b>-d, --default</b>
              show default keyword template maps

       <b>-f,</b><i>--rcfile</i> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              read maps from rcfile

   <b>kwexpand</b>
       expand keywords in the working directory:

       hg kwexpand [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Run after (re)enabling keyword expansion.

       kwexpand refuses to run if given files contain local changes.

       Options:

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>kwfiles</b>
       show files configured for keyword expansion:

       hg kwfiles [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       List which files in the working directory are matched by the
       [keyword] configuration patterns.

       Useful to prevent inadvertent keyword expansion and to speed up
       execution by including only files that are actual candidates for
       expansion.

       See <b>hg help keyword </b>on how to construct patterns both for
       inclusion and exclusion of files.

       With -A/--all and -v/--verbose the codes used to show the status
       of files are:

       K = keyword expansion candidate
       k = keyword expansion candidate (not tracked)
       I = ignored
       i = ignored (not tracked)

       Options:

       <b>-A, --all</b>
              show keyword status flags of all files

       <b>-i, --ignore</b>
              show files excluded from expansion

       <b>-u, --unknown</b>
              only show unknown (not tracked) files

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>kwshrink</b>
       revert expanded keywords in the working directory:

       hg kwshrink [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Must be run before changing/disabling active keywords.

       kwshrink refuses to run if given files contain local changes.

       Options:

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>largefiles</b>
       track large binary files

       Large binary files tend to be not very compressible, not very
       diffable, and not at all mergeable. Such files are not handled
       efficiently by Mercurial's storage format (revlog), which is
       based on compressed binary deltas; storing large binary files as
       regular Mercurial files wastes bandwidth and disk space and
       increases Mercurial's memory usage. The largefiles extension
       addresses these problems by adding a centralized client-server
       layer on top of Mercurial: largefiles live in a <i>central store</i> out
       on the network somewhere, and you only fetch the revisions that
       you need when you need them.

       largefiles works by maintaining a "standin file" in .hglf/ for
       each largefile. The standins are small (41 bytes: an SHA-1 hash
       plus newline) and are tracked by Mercurial. Largefile revisions
       are identified by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, which is
       written to the standin. largefiles uses that revision ID to
       get/put largefile revisions from/to the central store. This saves
       both disk space and bandwidth, since you don't need to retrieve
       all historical revisions of large files when you clone or pull.

       To start a new repository or add new large binary files, just add
       --large to your <b>hg add </b>command. For example:

       $ dd if=/dev/urandom of=randomdata count=2000
       $ hg add --large randomdata
       $ hg commit -m "add randomdata as a largefile"

       When you push a changeset that adds/modifies largefiles to a
       remote repository, its largefile revisions will be uploaded along
       with it.  Note that the remote Mercurial must also have the
       largefiles extension enabled for this to work.

       When you pull a changeset that affects largefiles from a remote
       repository, the largefiles for the changeset will by default not
       be pulled down. However, when you update to such a revision, any
       largefiles needed by that revision are downloaded and cached (if
       they have never been downloaded before). One way to pull
       largefiles when pulling is thus to use --update, which will
       update your working copy to the latest pulled revision (and
       thereby downloading any new largefiles).

       If you want to pull largefiles you don't need for update yet,
       then you can use pull with the <i>--lfrev</i> option or the <b>hg lfpull</b>
       command.

       If you know you are pulling from a non-default location and want
       to download all the largefiles that correspond to the new
       changesets at the same time, then you can pull with <i>--lfrev</i>
       <i>"pulled()"</i>.

       If you just want to ensure that you will have the largefiles
       needed to merge or rebase with new heads that you are pulling,
       then you can pull with <i>--lfrev "head(pulled())"</i> flag to
       pre-emptively download any largefiles that are new in the heads
       you are pulling.

       Keep in mind that network access may now be required to update to
       changesets that you have not previously updated to. The nature of
       the largefiles extension means that updating is no longer
       guaranteed to be a local-only operation.

       If you already have large files tracked by Mercurial without the
       largefiles extension, you will need to convert your repository in
       order to benefit from largefiles. This is done with the <b>hg</b>
       <b>lfconvert </b>command:

       $ hg lfconvert --size 10 oldrepo newrepo

       In repositories that already have largefiles in them, any new
       file over 10MB will automatically be added as a largefile. To
       change this threshold, set <b>largefiles.minsize </b>in your Mercurial
       config file to the minimum size in megabytes to track as a
       largefile, or use the --lfsize option to the add command (also in
       megabytes):

       [largefiles]
       minsize = 2

       $ hg add --lfsize 2

       The <b>largefiles.patterns </b>config option allows you to specify a
       list of filename patterns (see <b>hg help patterns</b>) that should
       always be tracked as largefiles:

       [largefiles]
       patterns =
         *.jpg
         re:.*\.(png|bmp)$
         library.zip
         content/audio/*

       Files that match one of these patterns will be added as
       largefiles regardless of their size.

       The <b>largefiles.minsize </b>and <b>largefiles.patterns </b>config options
       will be ignored for any repositories not already containing a
       largefile. To add the first largefile to a repository, you must
       explicitly do so with the --large flag passed to the <b>hg add</b>
       command.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Uncategorized commands</b>
   <b>lfconvert</b>
       convert a normal repository to a largefiles repository:

       hg lfconvert SOURCE DEST [FILE ...]

       Convert repository SOURCE to a new repository DEST, identical to
       SOURCE except that certain files will be converted as largefiles:
       specifically, any file that matches any PATTERN <i>or</i> whose size is
       above the minimum size threshold is converted as a largefile. The
       size used to determine whether or not to track a file as a
       largefile is the size of the first version of the file. The
       minimum size can be specified either with --size or in
       configuration as <b>largefiles.size</b>.

       After running this command you will need to make sure that
       largefiles is enabled anywhere you intend to push the new
       repository.

       Use --to-normal to convert largefiles back to normal files; after
       this, the DEST repository can be used without largefiles at all.

       Options:

       <b>-s,</b><i>--size</i> <b>&lt;SIZE&gt;</b>
              minimum size (MB) for files to be converted as largefiles

              convert from a largefiles repo to a normal repo

   <b>lfpull</b>
       pull largefiles for the specified revisions from the specified
       source:

       hg lfpull -r REV... [-e CMD] [--remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]

       Pull largefiles that are referenced from local changesets but
       missing locally, pulling from a remote repository to the local
       cache.

       If SOURCE is omitted, the 'default' path will be used.  See <b>hg</b>
       <b>help urls </b>for more information.

       Some examples:

       • pull largefiles for all branch heads:

         hg lfpull -r "head() and not closed()"

       • pull largefiles on the default branch:

         hg lfpull -r "branch(default)"

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;VALUE[+]&gt;</b>
              pull largefiles for these revisions

       <b>-e,</b><i>--ssh</i> <b>&lt;CMD&gt;</b>
              specify ssh command to use

   <b>lfs</b>
       lfs - large file support (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This extension allows large files to be tracked outside of the
       normal repository storage and stored on a centralized server,
       similar to the <b>largefiles </b>extension.  The <b>git-lfs </b>protocol is
       used when communicating with the server, so existing git
       infrastructure can be harnessed.  Even though the files are
       stored outside of the repository, they are still integrity
       checked in the same manner as normal files.

       The files stored outside of the repository are downloaded on
       demand, which reduces the time to clone, and possibly the local
       disk usage.  This changes fundamental workflows in a DVCS, so
       careful thought should be given before deploying it.  <b>hg convert</b>
       can be used to convert LFS repositories to normal repositories
       that no longer require this extension, and do so without changing
       the commit hashes.  This allows the extension to be disabled if
       the centralized workflow becomes burdensome.  However, the pre
       and post convert clones will not be able to communicate with each
       other unless the extension is enabled on both.

       To start a new repository, or to add LFS files to an existing
       one, just create an <b>.hglfs </b>file as described below in the root
       directory of the repository.  Typically, this file should be put
       under version control, so that the settings will propagate to
       other repositories with push and pull.  During any commit,
       Mercurial will consult this file to determine if an added or
       modified file should be stored externally.  The type of storage
       depends on the characteristics of the file at each commit.  A
       file that is near a size threshold may switch back and forth
       between LFS and normal storage, as needed.

       Alternately, both normal repositories and largefile controlled
       repositories can be converted to LFS by using <b>hg convert </b>and the
       <b>lfs.track </b>config option described below.  The <b>.hglfs </b>file should
       then be created and added, to control subsequent LFS selection.
       The hashes are also unchanged in this case.  The LFS and non-LFS
       repositories can be distinguished because the LFS repository will
       abort any command if this extension is disabled.

       Committed LFS files are held locally, until the repository is
       pushed.  Prior to pushing the normal repository data, the LFS
       files that are tracked by the outgoing commits are automatically
       uploaded to the configured central server.  No LFS files are
       transferred on <b>hg pull </b>or <b>hg clone</b>.  Instead, the files are
       downloaded on demand as they need to be read, if a cached copy
       cannot be found locally.  Both committing and downloading an LFS
       file will link the file to a usercache, to speed up future
       access.  See the <i>usercache</i> config setting described below.

       The extension reads its configuration from a versioned <b>.hglfs</b>
       configuration file found in the root of the working directory.
       The <b>.hglfs </b>file uses the same syntax as all other Mercurial
       configuration files. It uses a single section, <b>[track]</b>.

       The <b>[track] </b>section specifies which files are stored as LFS (or
       not). Each line is keyed by a file pattern, with a predicate
       value.  The first file pattern match is used, so put more
       specific patterns first.  The available predicates are <b>all()</b>,
       <b>none()</b>, and <b>size()</b>. See "hg help filesets.size" for the latter.

       Example versioned <b>.hglfs </b>file:

       [track]
       # No Makefile or python file, anywhere, will be LFS
       **Makefile = none()
       **.py = none()

       **.zip = all()
       **.exe = size("&gt;1MB")

       # Catchall for everything not matched above
       ** = size("&gt;10MB")

       Configs:

       [lfs]
       # Remote endpoint. Multiple protocols are supported:
       # - http(s)://user:pass@example.com/path
       #   git-lfs endpoint
       # - file:///tmp/path
       #   local filesystem, usually for testing
       # if unset, lfs will assume the remote repository also handles blob storage
       # for http(s) URLs.  Otherwise, lfs will prompt to set this when it must
       # use this value.
       # (default: unset)
       url = <a href="https://example.com/repo.git/info/lfs">https://example.com/repo.git/info/lfs</a>

       # Which files to track in LFS.  Path tests are "**.extname" for file
       # extensions, and "path:under/some/directory" for path prefix.  Both
       # are relative to the repository root.
       # File size can be tested with the "size()" fileset, and tests can be
       # joined with fileset operators.  (See "hg help filesets.operators".)
       #
       # Some examples:
       # - all()                       # everything
       # - none()                      # nothing

       # (default: none())
       #
       # This is ignored if there is a tracked '.hglfs' file, and this setting
       # will eventually be deprecated and removed.
       track = size("&gt;10M")

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Uncategorized commands</b>
   <b>logtoprocess</b>
       send ui.log() data to a subprocess (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This extension lets you specify a shell command per ui.log()
       event, sending all remaining arguments to as environment
       variables to that command.

       Positional arguments construct a log message, which is passed in
       the <i>MSG1</i> environment variables. Each keyword argument is set as a
       <i>OPT_UPPERCASE_KEY</i> variable (so the key is uppercased, and
       prefixed with <i>OPT_</i>). The original event name is passed in the
       <i>EVENT</i> environment variable, and the process ID of mercurial is
       given in <i>HGPID</i>.

       So given a call <i>ui.log('foo', 'bar %s ', 'baz', spam='eggs'), a</i>
       <i>script configured for the `foo</i> event can expect an environment
       with <i>MSG1=bar baz</i>, and <i>OPT_SPAM=eggs</i>.

       Scripts are configured in the <i>[logtoprocess]</i> section, each key an
       event name.  For example:

       [logtoprocess]
       commandexception = echo "$MSG1" &gt; /var/log/mercurial_exceptions.log

       would log the warning message and traceback of any failed command
       dispatch.

       Scripts are run asynchronously as detached daemon processes;
       mercurial will not ensure that they exit cleanly.

   <b>mq</b>
       manage a stack of patches

       This extension lets you work with a stack of patches in a
       Mercurial repository. It manages two stacks of patches - all
       known patches, and applied patches (subset of known patches).

       Known patches are represented as patch files in the .hg/patches
       directory. Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.

       Common tasks (use <b>hg help COMMAND </b>for more details):

       create new patch                          qnew
       import existing patch                     qimport

       print patch series                        qseries
       print applied patches                     qapplied

       add known patch to applied stack          qpush
       remove patch from applied stack           qpop
       refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh

       By default, mq will automatically use git patches when required
       to avoid losing file mode changes, copy records, binary files or
       empty files creations or deletions. This behavior can be
       configured with:

       [mq]
       git = auto/keep/yes/no

       If set to 'keep', mq will obey the [diff] section configuration
       while preserving existing git patches upon qrefresh. If set to
       'yes' or 'no', mq will override the [diff] section and always
       generate git or regular patches, possibly losing data in the
       second case.

       It may be desirable for mq changesets to be kept in the secret
       phase (see <b>hg help phases</b>), which can be enabled with the
       following setting:

       [mq]
       secret = True

       You will by default be managing a patch queue named "patches".
       You can create other, independent patch queues with the <b>hg qqueue</b>
       command.

       If the working directory contains uncommitted files, qpush, qpop
       and qgoto abort immediately. If -f/--force is used, the changes
       are discarded. Setting:

       [mq]
       keepchanges = True

       make them behave as if --keep-changes were passed, and
       non-conflicting local changes will be tolerated and preserved. If
       incompatible options such as -f/--force or --exact are passed,
       this setting is ignored.

       This extension used to provide a strip command. This command now
       lives in the strip extension.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Repository creation</b>
   <b>qclone</b>
       clone main and patch repository at same time:

       hg qclone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]

       If source is local, destination will have no patches applied. If
       source is remote, this command can not check if patches are
       applied in source, so cannot guarantee that patches are not
       applied in destination. If you clone remote repository, be sure
       before that it has no patches applied.

       Source patch repository is looked for in &lt;src&gt;/.hg/patches by
       default. Use -p &lt;url&gt; to change.

       The patch directory must be a nested Mercurial repository, as
       would be created by <b>hg init --mq</b>.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>--pull </b>use pull protocol to copy metadata

       <b>-U, --noupdate</b>
              do not update the new working directories

       <b>--uncompressed</b>
              use uncompressed transfer (fast over LAN)

       <b>-p,</b><i>--patches</i> <b>&lt;REPO&gt;</b>
              location of source patch repository

       <b>-e,</b><i>--ssh</i> <b>&lt;CMD&gt;</b>
              specify ssh command to use

       <b>--remotecmd </b><i>&lt;CMD&gt;</i>
              specify hg command to run on the remote side

       <b>--insecure</b>
              do not verify server certificate (ignoring web.cacerts
              config)

   <b>qinit</b>
       init a new queue repository (DEPRECATED):

       hg qinit [-c]

       The queue repository is unversioned by default. If
       -c/--create-repo is specified, qinit will create a separate
       nested repository for patches (qinit -c may also be run later to
       convert an unversioned patch repository into a versioned one).
       You can use qcommit to commit changes to this queue repository.

       This command is deprecated. Without -c, it's implied by other
       relevant commands. With -c, use <b>hg init --mq </b>instead.

       Options:

       <b>-c, --create-repo</b>
              create queue repository

   <b>Change creation</b>
   <b>qcommit</b>
       commit changes in the queue repository (DEPRECATED):

       hg qcommit [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       This command is deprecated; use <b>hg commit --mq </b>instead.

       Options:

       <b>-A, --addremove</b>
              mark new/missing files as added/removed before committing

       <b>--close-branch</b>
              mark a branch head as closed

       <b>--amend</b>
              amend the parent of the working directory

       <b>-s, --secret</b>
              use the secret phase for committing

       <b>-e, --edit</b>
              invoke editor on commit messages

       <b>--force-close-branch</b>
              forcibly close branch from a non-head changeset (ADVANCED)

       <b>-i, --interactive</b>
              use interactive mode

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       <b>-m,</b><i>--message</i> <b>&lt;TEXT&gt;</b>
              use text as commit message

              read commit message from file

       <b>-d,</b><i>--date</i> <b>&lt;DATE&gt;</b>
              record the specified date as commit date

       <b>-u,</b><i>--user</i> <b>&lt;USER&gt;</b>
              record the specified user as committer

       <b>-S, --subrepos</b>
              recurse into subrepositories

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: qci

   <b>qnew</b>
       create a new patch:

       hg qnew [-e] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] PATCH [FILE]...

       qnew creates a new patch on top of the currently-applied patch
       (if any). The patch will be initialized with any outstanding
       changes in the working directory. You may also use -I/--include,
       -X/--exclude, and/or a list of files after the patch name to add
       only changes to matching files to the new patch, leaving the rest
       as uncommitted modifications.

       -u/--user and -d/--date can be used to set the (given) user and
       date, respectively. -U/--currentuser and -D/--currentdate set
       user to current user and date to current date.

       -e/--edit, -m/--message or -l/--logfile set the patch header as
       well as the commit message. If none is specified, the header is
       empty and the commit message is '[mq]: PATCH'.

       Use the -g/--git option to keep the patch in the git extended
       diff format. Read the diffs help topic for more information on
       why this is important for preserving permission changes and
       copy/rename information.

       Returns 0 on successful creation of a new patch.

       Options:

       <b>-e, --edit</b>
              invoke editor on commit messages

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              import uncommitted changes (DEPRECATED)

       <b>-g, --git</b>
              use git extended diff format

       <b>-U, --currentuser</b>
              add "From: &lt;current user&gt;" to patch

       <b>-u,</b><i>--user</i> <b>&lt;USER&gt;</b>
              add "From: &lt;USER&gt;" to patch

       <b>-D, --currentdate</b>
              add "Date: &lt;current date&gt;" to patch

       <b>-d,</b><i>--date</i> <b>&lt;DATE&gt;</b>
              add "Date: &lt;DATE&gt;" to patch

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>

       <b>-l,</b><i>--logfile</i> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              read commit message from file

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>qrefresh</b>
       update the current patch:

       hg qrefresh [-I] [-X] [-e] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] [-s] [FILE]...

       If any file patterns are provided, the refreshed patch will
       contain only the modifications that match those patterns; the
       remaining modifications will remain in the working directory.

       If -s/--short is specified, files currently included in the patch
       will be refreshed just like matched files and remain in the
       patch.

       If -e/--edit is specified, Mercurial will start your configured
       editor for you to enter a message. In case qrefresh fails, you
       will find a backup of your message in <b>.hg/last-message.txt</b>.

       hg add/remove/copy/rename work as usual, though you might want to
       use git-style patches (-g/--git or [diff] git=1) to track copies
       and renames. See the diffs help topic for more information on the
       git diff format.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-e, --edit</b>
              invoke editor on commit messages

       <b>-g, --git</b>
              use git extended diff format

       <b>-s, --short</b>
              refresh only files already in the patch and specified
              files

       <b>-U, --currentuser</b>
              add/update author field in patch with current user

       <b>-u,</b><i>--user</i> <b>&lt;USER&gt;</b>
              add/update author field in patch with given user

       <b>-D, --currentdate</b>

              read commit message from file

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>Change manipulation</b>
   <b>qfold</b>
       fold the named patches into the current patch:

       hg qfold [-e] [-k] [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] PATCH...

       Patches must not yet be applied. Each patch will be successively
       applied to the current patch in the order given. If all the
       patches apply successfully, the current patch will be refreshed
       with the new cumulative patch, and the folded patches will be
       deleted. With -k/--keep, the folded patch files will not be
       removed afterwards.

       The header for each folded patch will be concatenated with the
       current patch header, separated by a line of <b>* * *</b>.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-e, --edit</b>
              invoke editor on commit messages

       <b>-k, --keep</b>
              keep folded patch files

       <b>-m,</b><i>--message</i> <b>&lt;TEXT&gt;</b>
              use text as commit message

   <b>Change organization</b>
   <b>qapplied</b>
       print the patches already applied:

       hg qapplied [-1] [-s] [PATCH]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-1, --last</b>
              show only the preceding applied patch

       <b>-s, --summary</b>
              print first line of patch header

   <b>qdelete</b>
       remove patches from queue:

       hg qdelete [-k] [PATCH]...

       The patches must not be applied, and at least one patch is
       required. Exact patch identifiers must be given. With -k/--keep,
       the patch files are preserved in the patch directory.

       To stop managing a patch and move it into permanent history, use
       the <b>hg qfinish </b>command.

       Options:

       <b>-k, --keep</b>
              keep patch file

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              stop managing a revision (DEPRECATED)

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

          aliases: qremove qrm

   <b>qfinish</b>
       move applied patches into repository history:

       hg qfinish [-a] [REV]...

       Finishes the specified revisions (corresponding to applied
       patches) by moving them out of mq control into regular repository
       history.

       Accepts a revision range or the -a/--applied option. If --applied
       is specified, all applied mq revisions are removed from mq
       control. Otherwise, the given revisions must be at the base of
       the stack of applied patches.

       This can be especially useful if your changes have been applied
       to an upstream repository, or if you are about to push your
       changes to upstream.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-a, --applied</b>
              finish all applied changesets

   <b>qgoto</b>
       push or pop patches until named patch is at top of stack:

       hg qgoto [OPTION]... PATCH

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>--keep-changes</b>
              tolerate non-conflicting local changes

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              overwrite any local changes

       <b>--no-backup</b>
              do not save backup copies of files

   <b>qguard</b>
       set or print guards for a patch:

       hg qguard [-l] [-n] [PATCH] [-- [+GUARD]... [-GUARD]...]

       Guards control whether a patch can be pushed. A patch with no
       guards is always pushed. A patch with a positive guard ("+foo")
       is pushed only if the <b>hg qselect </b>command has activated it. A
       patch with a negative guard ("-foo") is never pushed if the <b>hg</b>
       <b>qselect </b>command has activated it.

       With no arguments, print the currently active guards.  With
       arguments, set guards for the named patch.

       Note   Specifying negative guards now requires '--'.

       To set guards on another patch:

       hg qguard other.patch -- +2.6.17 -stable

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-l, --list</b>
              list all patches and guards

       <b>-n, --none</b>
              drop all guards

       hg qheader [PATCH]

       Returns 0 on success.

   <b>qnext</b>
       print the name of the next pushable patch:

       hg qnext [-s]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-s, --summary</b>
              print first line of patch header

   <b>qpop</b>
       pop the current patch off the stack:

       hg qpop [-a] [-f] [PATCH | INDEX]

       Without argument, pops off the top of the patch stack. If given a
       patch name, keeps popping off patches until the named patch is at
       the top of the stack.

       By default, abort if the working directory contains uncommitted
       changes. With --keep-changes, abort only if the uncommitted files
       overlap with patched files. With -f/--force, backup and discard
       changes made to such files.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-a, --all</b>
              pop all patches

       <b>-n,</b><i>--name</i> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
              queue name to pop (DEPRECATED)

       <b>--keep-changes</b>
              tolerate non-conflicting local changes

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              forget any local changes to patched files

       <b>--no-backup</b>
              do not save backup copies of files

   <b>qprev</b>
       print the name of the preceding applied patch:

       hg qprev [-s]

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-s, --summary</b>
              print first line of patch header

   <b>qpush</b>
       push the next patch onto the stack:

       hg qpush [-f] [-l] [-a] [--move] [PATCH | INDEX]

       By default, abort if the working directory contains uncommitted
       changes. With --keep-changes, abort only if the uncommitted files
       overlap with patched files. With -f/--force, backup and patch
       over uncommitted changes.

       Return 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>--keep-changes</b>
              tolerate non-conflicting local changes

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              apply on top of local changes

       <b>-e, --exact</b>
              apply the target patch to its recorded parent

       <b>-n,</b><i>--name</i> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
              merge queue name (DEPRECATED)

       <b>--move </b>reorder patch series and apply only the patch

       <b>--no-backup</b>
              do not save backup copies of files

   <b>qqueue</b>
       manage multiple patch queues:

       hg qqueue [OPTION] [QUEUE]

       Supports switching between different patch queues, as well as
       creating new patch queues and deleting existing ones.

       Omitting a queue name or specifying -l/--list will show you the
       registered queues - by default the "normal" patches queue is
       registered. The currently active queue will be marked with
       "(active)". Specifying --active will print only the name of the
       active queue.

       To create a new queue, use -c/--create. The queue is
       automatically made active, except in the case where there are
       applied patches from the currently active queue in the
       repository. Then the queue will only be created and switching
       will fail.

       To delete an existing queue, use --delete. You cannot delete the
       currently active queue.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-l, --list</b>
              list all available queues

       <b>--active</b>
              print name of active queue

       <b>--purge</b>
              delete queue, and remove patch dir

   <b>qrename</b>
       rename a patch:

       hg qrename PATCH1 [PATCH2]

       With one argument, renames the current patch to PATCH1.  With two
       arguments, renames PATCH1 to PATCH2.

       Returns 0 on success.

          aliases: qmv

   <b>qrestore</b>
       restore the queue state saved by a revision (DEPRECATED):

       hg qrestore [-d] [-u] REV

       This command is deprecated, use <b>hg rebase </b>instead.

       Options:

       <b>-d, --delete</b>
              delete save entry

       <b>-u, --update</b>
              update queue working directory

   <b>qsave</b>
       save current queue state (DEPRECATED):

       hg qsave [-m TEXT] [-l FILE] [-c] [-n NAME] [-e] [-f]

       This command is deprecated, use <b>hg rebase </b>instead.

       Options:

       <b>-c, --copy</b>
              copy patch directory

       <b>-n,</b><i>--name</i> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
              copy directory name

       <b>-e, --empty</b>
              clear queue status file

       <b>-f, --force</b>
              force copy

       <b>-m,</b><i>--message</i> <b>&lt;TEXT&gt;</b>
              use text as commit message

       <b>-l,</b><i>--logfile</i> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              read commit message from file

   <b>qselect</b>
       set or print guarded patches to push:

       hg qselect [OPTION]... [GUARD]...

       Use the <b>hg qguard </b>command to set or print guards on patch, then
       use qselect to tell mq which guards to use. A patch will be
       pushed if it has no guards or any positive guards match the
       currently selected guard, but will not be pushed if any negative
       guards match the current guard. For example:

       qguard foo.patch -- -stable    (negative guard)
       qguard bar.patch    +stable    (positive guard)
       qselect stable

       This activates the "stable" guard. mq will skip foo.patch
       (because it has a negative match) but push bar.patch (because it
       has a positive match).

       With no arguments, prints the currently active guards.  With one
       argument, sets the active guard.

       Use -n/--none to deactivate guards (no other arguments needed).
       When no guards are active, patches with positive guards are
       skipped and patches with negative guards are pushed.

       qselect can change the guards on applied patches. It does not pop
       guarded patches by default. Use --pop to pop back to the last
       applied patch that is not guarded. Use --reapply (which implies
       --pop) to push back to the current patch afterwards, but skip
       guarded patches.

       Use -s/--series to print a list of all guards in the series file
       (no other arguments needed). Use -v for more information.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-n, --none</b>
              disable all guards

       <b>-s, --series</b>
              list all guards in series file

       <b>--pop  </b>pop to before first guarded applied patch

       <b>--reapply</b>

       <b>-1, --first</b>
              show only the first patch

       <b>-s, --summary</b>
              print first line of patch header

   <b>File content management</b>
   <b>qdiff</b>
       diff of the current patch and subsequent modifications:

       hg qdiff [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       Shows a diff which includes the current patch as well as any
       changes which have been made in the working directory since the
       last refresh (thus showing what the current patch would become
       after a qrefresh).

       Use <b>hg diff </b>if you only want to see the changes made since the
       last qrefresh, or <b>hg export qtip </b>if you want to see changes made
       by the current patch without including changes made since the
       qrefresh.

       Returns 0 on success.

       Options:

       <b>-a, --text</b>
              treat all files as text

   <b>qimport</b>
       import a patch or existing changeset:

       hg qimport [-e] [-n NAME] [-f] [-g] [-P] [-r REV]... [FILE]...

       The patch is inserted into the series after the last applied
       patch. If no patches have been applied, qimport prepends the
       patch to the series.

       The patch will have the same name as its source file unless you
       give it a new one with -n/--name.

       You can register an existing patch inside the patch directory
       with the -e/--existing flag.

       With -f/--force, an existing patch of the same name will be
       overwritten.

       An existing changeset may be placed under mq control with
       -r/--rev (e.g. qimport --rev . -n patch will place the current
       revision under mq control). With -g/--git, patches imported with
       --rev will use the git diff format. See the diffs help topic for
       information on why this is important for preserving rename/copy
       information and permission changes. Use <b>hg qfinish </b>to remove
       changesets from mq control.

       To import a patch from standard input, pass - as the patch file.
       When importing from standard input, a patch name must be
       specified using the --name flag.

       To import an existing patch while renaming it:

       hg qimport -e existing-patch -n new-name

       Returns 0 if import succeeded.

       Options:

   <b>narrow</b>
       create clones which fetch history data for subset of files
       (EXPERIMENTAL)

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Repository maintenance</b>
   <b>tracked</b>
       show or change the current narrowspec:

       hg tracked [OPTIONS]... [REMOTE]

       With no argument, shows the current narrowspec entries, one per
       line. Each line will be prefixed with 'I' or 'X' for included or
       excluded patterns, respectively.

       The narrowspec is comprised of expressions to match remote files
       and/or directories that should be pulled into your client.  The
       narrowspec has <i>include</i> and <i>exclude</i> expressions, with excludes
       always trumping includes: that is, if a file matches an exclude
       expression, it will be excluded even if it also matches an
       include expression.  Excluding files that were never included has
       no effect.

       Each included or excluded entry is in the format described by 'hg
       help patterns'.

       The options allow you to add or remove included and excluded
       expressions.

       If --clear is specified, then all previous includes and excludes
       are DROPPED and replaced by the new ones specified to
       --addinclude and --addexclude.  If --clear is specified without
       any further options, the narrowspec will be empty and will not
       match any files.

       If --auto-remove-includes is specified, then those includes that
       don't match any files modified by currently visible local commits
       (those not shared by the remote) will be added to the set of
       explicitly specified includes to remove.

       --import-rules accepts a path to a file containing rules,
       allowing you to add --addinclude, --addexclude rules in bulk.
       Like the other include and exclude switches, the changes are
       applied immediately.

       Options:

       <b>--addinclude </b><i>&lt;VALUE[+]&gt;</i>
              new paths to include

       <b>--removeinclude </b><i>&lt;VALUE[+]&gt;</i>
              old paths to no longer include

       <b>--auto-remove-includes</b>
              automatically choose unused includes to remove

       <b>--addexclude </b><i>&lt;VALUE[+]&gt;</i>
              new paths to exclude

       <b>--import-rules </b><i>&lt;VALUE&gt;</i>
              import narrowspecs from a file

       <b>--removeexclude </b><i>&lt;VALUE[+]&gt;</i>
              old paths to no longer exclude

       <b>--clear</b>
              whether to replace the existing narrowspec

       <b>--force-delete-local-changes</b>
              forces deletion of local changes when narrowing

       <b>--backup</b>
              back up local changes when narrowing (default: True)

       <b>--update-working-copy</b>

   <b>notify</b>
       hooks for sending email push notifications

       This extension implements hooks to send email notifications when
       changesets are sent from or received by the local repository.

       First, enable the extension as explained in <b>hg help extensions</b>,
       and register the hook you want to run. <b>incoming </b>and <b>changegroup</b>
       hooks are run when changesets are received, while <b>outgoing </b>hooks
       are for changesets sent to another repository:

       [hooks]
       # one email for each incoming changeset
       incoming.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
       # one email for all incoming changesets
       changegroup.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

       # one email for all outgoing changesets
       outgoing.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

       This registers the hooks. To enable notification, subscribers
       must be assigned to repositories. The <b>[usersubs] </b>section maps
       multiple repositories to a given recipient. The <b>[reposubs]</b>
       section maps multiple recipients to a single repository:

       [usersubs]
       # key is subscriber email, value is a comma-separated list of repo patterns
       user@host = pattern

       [reposubs]
       # key is repo pattern, value is a comma-separated list of subscriber emails
       pattern = user@host

       A <b>pattern </b>is a <b>glob </b>matching the absolute path to a repository,
       optionally combined with a revset expression. A revset
       expression, if present, is separated from the glob by a hash.
       Example:

       [reposubs]
       */widgets#branch(release) = qa-team@example.com

       This sends to <b>qa-team@example.com </b>whenever a changeset on the
       <b>release </b>branch triggers a notification in any repository ending
       in <b>widgets</b>.

       In order to place them under direct user management, <b>[usersubs]</b>
       and <b>[reposubs] </b>sections may be placed in a separate <b>hgrc </b>file and
       incorporated by reference:

       [notify]
       config = /path/to/subscriptionsfile

       Notifications will not be sent until the <b>notify.test </b>value is set
       to <b>False</b>; see below.

       Notifications content can be tweaked with the following
       configuration entries:

       <b>notify.test</b>
              If <b>True</b>, print messages to stdout instead of sending them.
              Default: True.

       <b>notify.sources</b>
              Space-separated list of change sources. Notifications are
              activated only when a changeset's source is in this list.
              Sources may be:

              <b>serve</b>

                     changesets received via http or ssh

              Default: serve.

       <b>notify.strip</b>
              Number of leading slashes to strip from url paths. By
              default, notifications reference repositories with their
              absolute path. <b>notify.strip </b>lets you turn them into
              relative paths. For example, <b>notify.strip=3 </b>will change
              <b>/long/path/repository </b>into <b>repository</b>. Default: 0.

       <b>notify.domain</b>
              Default email domain for sender or recipients with no
              explicit domain.  It is also used for the domain part of
              the <b>Message-Id </b>when using <b>notify.messageidseed</b>.

       <b>notify.messageidseed</b>
              Create deterministic <b>Message-Id </b>headers for the mails
              based on the seed and the revision identifier of the first
              commit in the changeset.

       <b>notify.style</b>
              Style file to use when formatting emails.

       <b>notify.template</b>
              Template to use when formatting emails.

       <b>notify.incoming</b>
              Template to use when run as an incoming hook, overriding
              <b>notify.template</b>.

       <b>notify.outgoing</b>
              Template to use when run as an outgoing hook, overriding
              <b>notify.template</b>.

       <b>notify.changegroup</b>
              Template to use when running as a changegroup hook,
              overriding <b>notify.template</b>.

       <b>notify.maxdiff</b>
              Maximum number of diff lines to include in notification
              email. Set to 0 to disable the diff, or -1 to include all
              of it. Default: 300.

       <b>notify.maxdiffstat</b>
              Maximum number of diffstat lines to include in
              notification email. Set to -1 to include all of it.
              Default: -1.

       <b>notify.maxsubject</b>
              Maximum number of characters in email's subject line.
              Default: 67.

       <b>notify.diffstat</b>
              Set to True to include a diffstat before diff content.
              Default: True.

       <b>notify.showfunc</b>
              If set, override <b>diff.showfunc </b>for the diff content.
              Default: None.

       <b>notify.merge</b>
              If True, send notifications for merge changesets. Default:
              True.

       <b>notify.mbox</b>
              If set, append mails to this mbox file instead of sending.
              Default: None.

       <b>notify.fromauthor</b>
              If set, use the committer of the first changeset in a
              changegroup for the "From" field of the notification mail.
              If not set, take the user from the pushing repo.  Default:
              False.

       <b>notify.reply-to-predecessor (EXPERIMENTAL)</b>
              If set and the changeset has a predecessor in the
              repository, try to thread the notification mail with the
              predecessor. This adds the "In-Reply-To" header to the
              notification mail with a reference to the predecessor with
              the smallest revision number. Mail threads can still be
              torn, especially when changesets are folded.

              This option must  be used in combination with
              <b>notify.messageidseed</b>.

       If set, the following entries will also be used to customize the
       notifications:

       <b>email.from</b>
              Email <b>From </b>address to use if none can be found in the
              generated email content.

       <b>web.baseurl</b>
              Root repository URL to combine with repository paths when
              making references. See also <b>notify.strip</b>.

   <b>pager</b>
       browse command output with an external pager (DEPRECATED)

       Forcibly enable paging for individual commands that don't
       typically request pagination with the attend-&lt;command&gt; option.
       This setting takes precedence over ignore options and defaults:

       [pager]
       attend-cat = false

   <b>patchbomb</b>
       command to send changesets as (a series of) patch emails

       The series is started off with a "[PATCH 0 of N]" introduction,
       which describes the series as a whole.

       Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...",
       using the first line of the changeset description as the subject
       text. The message contains two or three body parts:

       • The changeset description.

       • [Optional] The result of running diffstat on the patch.

       • The patch itself, as generated by <b>hg export</b>.

       Each message refers to the first in the series using the
       In-Reply-To and References headers, so they will show up as a
       sequence in threaded mail and news readers, and in mail archives.

       To configure other defaults, add a section like this to your
       configuration file:

       [email]
       from = My Name &lt;my@email&gt;
       to = recipient1, recipient2, ...
       cc = cc1, cc2, ...
       bcc = bcc1, bcc2, ...
       reply-to = address1, address2, ...

       Use <b>[patchbomb] </b>as configuration section name if you need to
       override global <b>[email] </b>address settings.

       Then you can use the <b>hg email </b>command to mail a series of
       changesets as a patchbomb.

       You can also either configure the method option in the email
       section to be a sendmail compatible mailer or fill out the [smtp]
       section so that the patchbomb extension can automatically send
       patchbombs directly from the commandline. See the [email] and
       [smtp] sections in hgrc(5) for details.

       By default, <b>hg email </b>will prompt for a <b>To </b>or <b>CC </b>header if you do
       not supply one via configuration or the command line.  You can
       override this to never prompt by configuring an empty value:

       [email]
       cc =

       You can control the default inclusion of an introduction message
       with the <b>patchbomb.intro </b>configuration option. The configuration
       is always overwritten by command line flags like --intro and
       --desc:

       [patchbomb]
       intro=auto   # include introduction message if more than 1 patch (default)
       intro=never  # never include an introduction message
       intro=always # always include an introduction message

       You can specify a template for flags to be added in subject
       prefixes. Flags specified by --flag option are exported as
       <b>{flags} </b>keyword:

       [patchbomb]
       flagtemplate = "{separate(' ',
                                 ifeq(branch, 'default', '', branch|upper),
                                 flags)}"

       You can set patchbomb to always ask for confirmation by setting
       <b>patchbomb.confirm </b>to true.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change import/export</b>
   <b>email</b>
       send changesets by email:

       hg email [OPTION]... [DEST]...

       By default, diffs are sent in the format generated by <b>hg export</b>,
       one per message. The series starts with a "[PATCH 0 of N]"
       introduction, which describes the series as a whole.

       Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...",
       using the first line of the changeset description as the subject
       text.  The message contains two or three parts. First, the
       changeset description.

       With the -d/--diffstat option, if the diffstat program is
       installed, the result of running diffstat on the patch is
       inserted.

       Finally, the patch itself, as generated by <b>hg export</b>.

       With the -d/--diffstat or --confirm options, you will be
       presented with a final summary of all messages and asked for
       confirmation before the messages are sent.

       By default the patch is included as text in the email body for
       easy reviewing. Using the -a/--attach option will instead create
       an attachment for the patch. With -i/--inline an inline
       attachment will be created. You can include a patch both as text
       in the email body and as a regular or an inline attachment by
       combining the -a/--attach or -i/--inline with the --body option.

       With -B/--bookmark changesets reachable by the given bookmark are
       selected.

       With -o/--outgoing, emails will be generated for patches not
       found in the destination repository (or only those which are
       ancestors of the specified revisions if any are provided)

       With -b/--bundle, changesets are selected as for --outgoing, but
       a single email containing a binary Mercurial bundle as an
       attachment will be sent. Use the <b>patchbomb.bundletype </b>config
       option to control the bundle type as with <b>hg bundle --type</b>.

       With -m/--mbox, instead of previewing each patchbomb message in a
       pager or sending the messages directly, it will create a UNIX
       mailbox file with the patch emails. This mailbox file can be
       previewed with any mail user agent which supports UNIX mbox
       files.

       With -n/--test, all steps will run, but mail will not be sent.
       You will be prompted for an email recipient address, a subject
       and an introductory message describing the patches of your
       patchbomb.  Then when all is done, patchbomb messages are
       displayed.

       In case email sending fails, you will find a backup of your
       series introductory message in <b>.hg/last-email.txt</b>.

       The default behavior of this command can be customized through
       configuration. (See <b>hg help patchbomb </b>for details)

       Examples:

       hg email -r 3000          # send patch 3000 only
       hg email -r 3000 -r 3001  # send patches 3000 and 3001
       hg email -r 3000:3005     # send patches 3000 through 3005
       hg email 3000             # send patch 3000 (deprecated)

       hg email -o               # send all patches not in default
       hg email -o DEST          # send all patches not in DEST
       hg email -o -r 3000       # send all ancestors of 3000 not in default
       hg email -o -r 3000 DEST  # send all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

       hg email -B feature       # send all ancestors of feature bookmark

       hg email -b               # send bundle of all patches not in default
       hg email -b DEST          # send bundle of all patches not in DEST
       hg email -b -r 3000       # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in default
       hg email -b -r 3000 DEST  # bundle of all ancestors of 3000 not in DEST

       hg email -o -m mbox &amp;&amp;    # generate an mbox file...
         mutt -R -f mbox         # ... and view it with mutt
       hg email -o -m mbox &amp;&amp;    # generate an mbox file ...
         formail -s sendmail \   # ... and use formail to send from the mbox
           -bm -t &lt; mbox         # ... using sendmail

       Before using this command, you will need to enable email in your
       hgrc. See the [email] section in hgrc(5) for details.

   <b>phabricator</b>
       simple Phabricator integration (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This extension provides a <b>phabsend </b>command which sends a stack of
       changesets to Phabricator, and a <b>phabread </b>command which prints a
       stack of revisions in a format suitable for <b>hg import</b>, and a
       <b>phabupdate </b>command to update statuses in batch.

       A "phabstatus" view for <b>hg show </b>is also provided; it displays
       status information of Phabricator differentials associated with
       unfinished changesets.

       By default, Phabricator requires <b>Test Plan </b>which might prevent
       some changeset from being sent. The requirement could be disabled
       by changing <b>differential.require-test-plan-field </b>config server
       side.

       Config:

       [phabricator]
       # Phabricator URL
       url = <a href="https://phab.example.com/">https://phab.example.com/</a>

       # Repo callsign. If a repo has a URL <a href="#">https://$HOST/diffusion/FOO</a>, then its
       # callsign is "FOO".
       callsign = FOO

       # curl command to use. If not set (default), use builtin HTTP library to
       # communicate. If set, use the specified curl command. This could be useful
       # if you need to specify advanced options that is not easily supported by
       # the internal library.
       curlcmd = curl --connect-timeout 2 --retry 3 --silent

       # retry failed command N time (default 0). Useful when using the extension
       # over flakly connection.
       #
       # We wait `retry.interval` between each retry, in seconds.
       # (default 1 second).
       retry = 3
       retry.interval = 10

       # the retry option can combine well with the http.timeout one.
       #
       # For example to give up on http request after 20 seconds:
       [http]
       timeout=20

       [auth]
       example.schemes = https
       example.prefix = phab.example.com

       # API token. Get it from <a href="#">https://$HOST/conduit/login/</a>
       example.phabtoken = cli-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change import/export</b>
   <b>phabimport</b>
       import patches from Phabricator for the specified Differential
       Revisions:

       hg phabimport DREVSPEC... [OPTIONS]

       The patches are read and applied starting at the parent of the
       working directory.

       See <b>hg help phabread </b>for how to specify DREVSPEC.

       Options:

       <b>--stack</b>
              import dependencies as well

       <b>--test-vcr </b><i>&lt;VALUE&gt;</i>
              Path to a vcr file. If nonexistent, will record a new vcr
              transcript, otherwise will mock all http requests using
              the specified vcr file. (ADVANCED)

   <b>phabread</b>
       print patches from Phabricator suitable for importing:

       hg phabread DREVSPEC... [OPTIONS]

       DREVSPEC could be a Differential Revision identity, like <b>D123</b>, or
       just the number <b>123</b>. It could also have common operators like <b>+</b>,
       <b>-</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>(</b>, <b>) </b>for complex queries. Prefix <b>: </b>could be used to select
       a stack.  If multiple DREVSPEC values are given, the result is
       the union of each individually evaluated value.  No attempt is
       currently made to reorder the values to run from parent to child.

       <b>abandoned</b>, <b>accepted</b>, <b>closed</b>, <b>needsreview</b>, <b>needsrevision </b>could be
       used to filter patches by status. For performance reason, they
       only represent a subset of non-status selections and cannot be
       used alone.

       For example, <b>:D6+8-(2+D4) </b>selects a stack up to D6, plus D8 and
       exclude D2 and D4. <b>:D9 &amp; needsreview </b>selects "Needs Review"
       revisions in a stack up to D9.

       If --stack is given, follow dependencies information and read all
       patches.  It is equivalent to the <b>: </b>operator.

       Options:

       <b>--stack</b>
              read dependencies

       <b>--test-vcr </b><i>&lt;VALUE&gt;</i>
              Path to a vcr file. If nonexistent, will record a new vcr
              transcript, otherwise will mock all http requests using
              the specified vcr file. (ADVANCED)

   <b>phabsend</b>
       upload changesets to Phabricator:

       hg phabsend REV [OPTIONS]

       If there are multiple revisions specified, they will be send as a
       stack with a linear dependencies relationship using the order
       specified by the revset.

       For the first time uploading changesets, local tags will be
       created to maintain the association. After the first time,
       phabsend will check obsstore and tags information so it can
       figure out whether to update an existing Differential Revision,
       or create a new one.

       If --amend is set, update commit messages so they have the
       <b>Differential Revision </b>URL, remove related tags. This is similar
       to what arcanist will do, and is more desired in author-push
       workflows. Otherwise, use local tags to record the <b>Differential</b>
       <b>Revision </b>association.

       The --confirm option lets you confirm changesets before sending
       them. You can also add following to your configuration file to
       make it default behaviour:

       [phabsend]
       confirm = true

       By default, a separate review will be created for each commit
       that is selected, and will have the same parent/child
       relationship in Phabricator.  If <b>--fold </b>is set, multiple commits
       are rolled up into a single review as if diffed from the parent
       of the first revision to the last.  The commit messages are
       concatenated in the summary field on Phabricator.

       phabsend will check obsstore and the above association to decide
       whether to update an existing Differential Revision, or create a
       new one.

   <b>Uncategorized commands</b>
   <b>purge</b>
       command to delete untracked files from the working directory
       (DEPRECATED)

       The functionality of this extension has been included in core
       Mercurial since version 5.7. Please use <b>hg purge ... </b>instead. <b>hg</b>
       <b>purge --confirm </b>is now the default, unless the extension is
       enabled for backward compatibility.

   <b>rebase</b>
       command to move sets of revisions to a different ancestor

       This extension lets you rebase changesets in an existing
       Mercurial repository.

       For more information:
       <a href="https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RebaseExtension">https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/RebaseExtension</a>

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change manipulation</b>
   <b>rebase</b>
       move changeset (and descendants) to a different branch:

       hg rebase [[-s REV]... | [-b REV]... | [-r REV]...] [-d REV] [OPTION]...

       Rebase uses repeated merging to graft changesets from one part of
       history (the source) onto another (the destination). This can be
       useful for linearizing <i>local</i> changes relative to a master
       development tree.

       Published commits cannot be rebased (see <b>hg help phases</b>).  To
       copy commits, see <b>hg help graft</b>.

       If you don't specify a destination changeset (<b>-d/--dest</b>), rebase
       will use the same logic as <b>hg merge </b>to pick a destination.  if
       the current branch contains exactly one other head, the other
       head is merged with by default.  Otherwise, an explicit revision
       with which to merge with must be provided.  (destination
       changeset is not modified by rebasing, but new changesets are
       added as its descendants.)

       Here are the ways to select changesets:

          1. Explicitly select them using <b>--rev</b>.

          2. Use <b>--source </b>to select a root changeset and include all of
             its descendants.

          3. Use <b>--base </b>to select a changeset; rebase will find
             ancestors and their descendants which are not also
             ancestors of the destination.

          4. If you do not specify any of <b>--rev</b>, <b>--source</b>, or <b>--base</b>,
             rebase will use <b>--base . </b>as above.

       If <b>--source </b>or <b>--rev </b>is used, special names <b>SRC </b>and <b>ALLSRC </b>can be
       used in <b>--dest</b>. Destination would be calculated per source
       revision with <b>SRC </b>substituted by that single source revision and
       <b>ALLSRC </b>substituted by all source revisions.

       Rebase will destroy original changesets unless you use <b>--keep</b>.
       It will also move your bookmarks (even if you do).

       Some changesets may be dropped if they do not contribute changes
       (e.g. merges from the destination branch).

       Unlike <b>merge</b>, rebase will do nothing if you are at the branch tip
       of a named branch with two heads. You will need to explicitly
       specify source and/or destination.

       If you need to use a tool to automate merge/conflict decisions,
       you can specify one with <b>--tool</b>, see <b>hg help merge-tools</b>.  As a
       caveat: the tool will not be used to mediate when a file was
       deleted, there is no hook presently available for this.

       If a rebase is interrupted to manually resolve a conflict, it can
       be continued with --continue/-c, aborted with --abort/-a, or
       stopped with --stop.

       Examples:

       • move "local changes" (current commit back to branching point)
         to the current branch tip after a pull:

         hg rebase

       • move a single changeset to the stable branch:

         hg rebase -r 5f493448 -d stable

       • splice a commit and all its descendants onto another part of
         history:

         hg rebase --source c0c3 --dest 4cf9

       • rebase everything on a branch marked by a bookmark onto the
         default branch:

         hg rebase --base myfeature --dest default

       • collapse a sequence of changes into a single commit:

         hg rebase --collapse -r 1520:1525 -d .

       • move a named branch while preserving its name:

         hg rebase -r "branch(featureX)" -d 1.3 --keepbranches

       • stabilize orphaned changesets so history looks linear:

         hg rebase -r 'orphan()-obsolete()' -d 'first(max((successors(max(roots(ALLSRC) &amp; ::SRC)^)-obsolete())::) + max(::((roots(ALLSRC) &amp; ::SRC)^)-obsolete()))'

       Configuration Options:

       You can make rebase require a destination if you set the
       following config option:

       [commands]
       rebase.requiredest = True

       By default, rebase will close the transaction after each commit.
       For performance purposes, you can configure rebase to use a
       single transaction across the entire rebase. WARNING: This
       setting introduces a significant risk of losing the work you've
       done in a rebase if the rebase aborts unexpectedly:

       [rebase]
       singletransaction = True

       By default, rebase writes to the working copy, but you can
       configure it to run in-memory for better performance. When the
       rebase is not moving the parent(s) of the working copy (AKA the
       "currently checked out changesets"), this may also allow it to
       run even if the working copy is dirty:

       [rebase]
       experimental.inmemory = True

       Return Values:

       Returns 0 on success, 1 if nothing to rebase or there are
       unresolved conflicts.

   <b>releasenotes</b>
       generate release notes from commit messages (EXPERIMENTAL)

       It is common to maintain files detailing changes in a project
       between releases. Maintaining these files can be difficult and
       time consuming.  The <b>hg releasenotes </b>command provided by this
       extension makes the process simpler by automating it.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change navigation</b>
   <b>releasenotes</b>
       parse release notes from commit messages into an output file:

       hg releasenotes [-r REV] [-c] FILE

       Given an output file and set of revisions, this command will
       parse commit messages for release notes then add them to the
       output file.

       Release notes are defined in commit messages as ReStructuredText
       directives. These have the form:

       .. directive:: title

          content

       Each <b>directive </b>maps to an output section in a generated release
       notes file, which itself is ReStructuredText. For example, the <b>..</b>
       <b>feature:: </b>directive would map to a <b>New Features </b>section.

       Release note directives can be either short-form or long-form. In
       short- form, <b>title </b>is omitted and the release note is rendered as
       a bullet list. In long form, a sub-section with the title <b>title</b>
       is added to the section.

       The <b>FILE </b>argument controls the output file to write gathered
       release notes to. The format of the file is:

       Section 1
       =========

       ...

       Section 2
       =========

       ...

       Only sections with defined release notes are emitted.

       If a section only has short-form notes, it will consist of bullet
       list:

       Section
       =======

       * Release note 1
       * Release note 2

       If a section has long-form notes, sub-sections will be emitted:

       Section
       =======

       Note 1 Title
       ------------

       Description of the first long-form note.

       Note 2 Title
       ------------

       Description of the second long-form note.

       If the <b>FILE </b>argument points to an existing file, that file will
       be parsed for release notes having the format that would be
       generated by this command. The notes from the processed commit
       messages will be <i>merged</i> into this parsed set.

       During release notes merging:

       • Duplicate items are automatically ignored

       • Items that are different are automatically ignored if the
         similarity is greater than a threshold.

       This means that the release notes file can be updated
       independently from this command and changes should not be lost
       when running this command on that file. A particular use case for
       this is to tweak the wording of a release note after it has been
       added to the release notes file.

       The -c/--check option checks the commit message for invalid
       admonitions.

       The -l/--list option, presents the user with a list of existing
       available admonitions along with their title. This also includes
       the custom admonitions (if any).

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              revisions to process for release notes

       <b>-c, --check</b>
              checks for validity of admonitions (if any)

       <b>-l, --list</b>
              list the available admonitions with their title

   <b>relink</b>
       recreates hardlinks between repository clones

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Repository maintenance</b>
   <b>relink</b>
       recreate hardlinks between two repositories:

       hg relink [ORIGIN]

       When repositories are cloned locally, their data files will be
       hardlinked so that they only use the space of a single
       repository.

       Unfortunately, subsequent pulls into either repository will break
       hardlinks for any files touched by the new changesets, even if
       both repositories end up pulling the same changes.

       Similarly, passing --rev to "hg clone" will fail to use any
       hardlinks, falling back to a complete copy of the source
       repository.

       This command lets you recreate those hardlinks and reclaim that
       wasted space.

       This repository will be relinked to share space with ORIGIN,
       which must be on the same local disk. If ORIGIN is omitted, looks
       for "default-relink", then "default", in [paths].

       Do not attempt any read operations on this repository while the
       command is running. (Both repositories will be locked against
       writes.)

   <b>remotefilelog</b>
       remotefilelog causes Mercurial to lazilly fetch file contents
       (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This extension is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. There are NO BACKWARDS
       COMPATIBILITY GUARANTEES. This means that repositories created
       with this extension may only be usable with the exact version of
       this extension/Mercurial that was used. The extension attempts to
       enforce this in order to prevent repository corruption.

       remotefilelog works by fetching file contents lazily and storing
       them in a cache on the client rather than in revlogs. This allows
       enormous histories to be transferred only partially, making them
       easier to operate on.

       Configs:

   <b>remotenames</b>
          showing remotebookmarks and remotebranches in UI
          (EXPERIMENTAL)

       By default both remotebookmarks and remotebranches are turned on.
       Config knob to control the individually are as follows.

       Config options to tweak the default behaviour:

       <b>remotenames.bookmarks</b>
              Boolean value to enable or disable showing of
              remotebookmarks (default: True)

       <b>remotenames.branches</b>
              Boolean value to enable or disable showing of
              remotebranches (default: True)

       <b>remotenames.hoistedpeer</b>
              Name of the peer whose remotebookmarks should be hoisted
              into the top-level namespace (default: 'default')

   <b>schemes</b>
       extend schemes with shortcuts to repository swarms

       This extension allows you to specify shortcuts for parent URLs
       with a lot of repositories to act like a scheme, for example:

       [schemes]
       py = <a href="http://code.python.org/hg/">http://code.python.org/hg/</a>

       After that you can use it like:

       hg clone py://trunk/

       Additionally there is support for some more complex schemas, for
       example used by Google Code:

       [schemes]
       gcode = http://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/

       The syntax is taken from Mercurial templates, and you have
       unlimited number of variables, starting with <b>{1} </b>and continuing
       with <b>{2}</b>, <b>{3} </b>and so on. This variables will receive parts of URL
       supplied, split by <b>/</b>. Anything not specified as <b>{part} </b>will be
       just appended to an URL.

       For convenience, the extension adds these schemes by default:

       [schemes]
       py = <a href="http://hg.python.org/">http://hg.python.org/</a>
       bb = <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">https://bitbucket.org/</a>
       bb+ssh = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/
       gcode = https://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
       kiln = https://{1}.kilnhg.com/Repo/

       You can override a predefined scheme by defining a new scheme
       with the same name.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Uncategorized commands</b>
   <b>share</b>
       share a common history between several working directories

       The share extension introduces a new command <b>hg share </b>to create a
       new working directory. This is similar to <b>hg clone</b>, but doesn't
       involve copying or linking the storage of the repository. This
       allows working on different branches or changes in parallel
       without the associated cost in terms of disk space.

       Note: destructive operations or extensions like <b>hg rollback</b>
       should be used with care as they can result in confusing
       problems.

   <b>Automatic Pooled Storage for Clones</b>
       When this extension is active, <b>hg clone </b>can be configured to
       automatically share/pool storage across multiple clones. This
       mode effectively converts <b>hg clone </b>to <b>hg clone </b>+ <b>hg share</b>.  The
       benefit of using this mode is the automatic management of store
       paths and intelligent pooling of related repositories.

       The following <b>share. </b>config options influence this feature:

       <b>share.pool</b>

              Filesystem path where shared repository data will be
              stored. When defined, <b>hg clone </b>will automatically use
              shared repository storage instead of creating a store
              inside each clone.

       <b>share.poolnaming</b>

              How directory names in <b>share.pool </b>are constructed.

              "identity" means the name is derived from the first
              changeset in the repository. In this mode, different
              remotes share storage if their root/initial changeset is
              identical. In this mode, the local shared repository is an
              aggregate of all encountered remote repositories.

              "remote" means the name is derived from the source
              repository's path or URL. In this mode, storage is only
              shared if the path or URL requested in the <b>hg clone</b>
              command matches exactly to a repository that was cloned
              before.

              The default naming mode is "identity".

       Sharing requirements and configs of source repository with
       shares:

       By default creating a shared repository only enables sharing a
       common history and does not share requirements and configs
       between them. This may lead to problems in some cases, for
       example when you upgrade the storage format from one repository
       but does not set related configs in the shares.

       Setting <i>format.exp-share-safe = True</i> enables sharing configs and
       requirements. This only applies to shares which are done after
       enabling the config option.

       For enabling this in existing shares, enable the config option
       and reshare.

       For resharing existing shares, make sure your working directory
       is clean and there are no untracked files, delete that share and
       create a new share.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Repository creation</b>
   <b>share</b>
       create a new shared repository:

       hg share [-U] [-B] SOURCE [DEST]

       Initialize a new repository and working directory that shares its
       history (and optionally bookmarks) with another repository.

       Note   using rollback or extensions that destroy/modify history
              (mq, rebase, etc.) can cause considerable confusion with
              shared clones. In particular, if two shared clones are
              both updated to the same changeset, and one of them
              destroys that changeset with rollback, the other clone
              will suddenly stop working: all operations will fail with
              "abort: working directory has unknown parent". The only
              known workaround is to use debugsetparents on the broken
              clone to reset it to a changeset that still exists.

       Options:

       <b>-U, --noupdate</b>
              do not create a working directory

       <b>-B, --bookmarks</b>
              also share bookmarks

       <b>--relative</b>
              point to source using a relative path

   <b>Repository maintenance</b>
   <b>unshare</b>
       convert a shared repository to a normal one:

       hg unshare

       Copy the store data to the repo and remove the sharedpath data.

   <b>show</b>
       unified command to show various repository information
       (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This extension provides the <b>hg show </b>command, which provides a
       central command for displaying commonly-accessed repository data
       and views of that data.

       The following config options can influence operation.

   <b>commands</b>
       <b>show.aliasprefix</b>

              List of strings that will register aliases for views. e.g.
              <b>s </b>will effectively set config options <b>alias.s&lt;view&gt; = show</b>
              <b>&lt;view&gt; </b>for all views. i.e. <i>hg swork</i> would execute <i>hg show</i>
              <i>work</i>.

              Aliases that would conflict with existing registrations
              will not be performed.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change navigation</b>
   <b>show</b>
       show various repository information:

       hg show VIEW

       A requested view of repository data is displayed.

       If no view is requested, the list of available views is shown and
       the command aborts.

       Note   There are no backwards compatibility guarantees for the
              output of this command. Output may change in any future
              Mercurial release.

              Consumers wanting stable command output should specify a
              template via <b>-T/--template</b>.

       List of available views:

       bookmarks   bookmarks and their associated changeset

       stack       current line of work

       work        changesets that aren't finished

       Options:

       <b>-T,</b><i>--template</i> <b>&lt;TEMPLATE&gt;</b>
              display with template

   <b>sparse</b>
       allow sparse checkouts of the working directory (EXPERIMENTAL)

       (This extension is not yet protected by backwards compatibility
       guarantees. Any aspect may break in future releases until this
       notice is removed.)

       This extension allows the working directory to only consist of a
       subset of files for the revision. This allows specific files or
       directories to be explicitly included or excluded. Many
       repository operations have performance proportional to the number
       of files in the working directory. So only realizing a subset of
       files in the working directory can improve performance.

   <b>Sparse Config Files</b>
       The set of files that are part of a sparse checkout are defined
       by a sparse config file. The file defines 3 things: includes
       (files to include in the sparse checkout), excludes (files to
       exclude from the sparse checkout), and profiles (links to other
       config files).

       The file format is newline delimited. Empty lines and lines
       beginning with <b># </b>are ignored.

       Lines beginning with <b>%include `` denote another sparse config</b>
       <b>file to include. e.g. ``%include tests.sparse</b>. The filename is
       relative to the repository root.

       The special lines <b>[include] </b>and <b>[exclude] </b>denote the section for
       includes and excludes that follow, respectively. It is illegal to
       have <b>[include] </b>after <b>[exclude]</b>.

       Non-special lines resemble file patterns to be added to either
       includes or excludes. The syntax of these lines is documented by
       <b>hg help patterns</b>.  Patterns are interpreted as <b>glob: </b>by default
       and match against the root of the repository.

       Exclusion patterns take precedence over inclusion patterns. So
       even if a file is explicitly included, an <b>[exclude] </b>entry can
       remove it.

       For example, say you have a repository with 3 directories,
       <b>frontend/</b>, <b>backend/</b>, and <b>tools/</b>. <b>frontend/ </b>and <b>backend/</b>
       correspond to different projects and it is uncommon for someone
       working on one to need the files for the other. But <b>tools/</b>
       contains files shared between both projects. Your sparse config
       files may resemble:

       # frontend.sparse
       frontend/**
       tools/**

       # backend.sparse
       backend/**
       tools/**

       Say the backend grows in size. Or there's a directory with
       thousands of files you wish to exclude. You can modify the
       profile to exclude certain files:

       [include]
       backend/**
       tools/**

       [exclude]
       tools/tests/**

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Uncategorized commands</b>
   <b>split</b>
       command to split a changeset into smaller ones (EXPERIMENTAL)

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change manipulation</b>
   <b>split</b>
       split a changeset into smaller ones:

       hg split [--no-rebase] [[-r] REV]

       Repeatedly prompt changes and commit message for new changesets
       until there is nothing left in the original changeset.

       If --rev was not given, split the working directory parent.

       By default, rebase connected non-obsoleted descendants onto the
       new changeset. Use --no-rebase to avoid the rebase.

       Options:

       <b>-r,</b><i>--rev</i> <b>&lt;REV&gt;</b>
              revision to split

       <b>--rebase</b>
              rebase descendants after split (default: True)

       <b>-d,</b><i>--date</i> <b>&lt;DATE&gt;</b>
              record the specified date as commit date

       <b>-u,</b><i>--user</i> <b>&lt;USER&gt;</b>
              record the specified user as committer

   <b>sqlitestore</b>
       store repository data in SQLite (EXPERIMENTAL)

       The sqlitestore extension enables the storage of repository data
       in SQLite.

       This extension is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. There are NO BACKWARDS
       COMPATIBILITY GUARANTEES. This means that repositories created
       with this extension may only be usable with the exact version of
       this extension/Mercurial that was used. The extension attempts to
       enforce this in order to prevent repository corruption.

       In addition, several features are not yet supported or have known
       bugs:

       • Only some data is stored in SQLite. Changeset, manifest, and
         other repository data is not yet stored in SQLite.

       • Transactions are not robust. If the process is aborted at the
         right time during transaction close/rollback, the repository
         could be in an inconsistent state. This problem will diminish
         once all repository data is tracked by SQLite.

       • Bundle repositories do not work (the ability to use e.g.  <i>hg -R</i>
         <i>&lt;bundle-file&gt; log</i> to automatically overlay a bundle on top of
         the existing repository).

       • Various other features don't work.

       This extension should work for basic clone/pull, update, and
       commit workflows.  Some history rewriting operations may fail due
       to lack of support for bundle repositories.

       To use, activate the extension and set the
       <b>storage.new-repo-backend </b>config option to <b>sqlite </b>to enable new
       repositories to use SQLite for storage.

   <b>strip</b>
       strip changesets and their descendants from history (DEPRECATED)

       The functionality of this extension has been included in core
       Mercurial since version 5.7. Please use <b>hg debugstrip ...</b>
       instead.

       This extension allows you to strip changesets and all their
       descendants from the repository. See the command help for
       details.

   <b>transplant</b>
       command to transplant changesets from another branch

       This extension allows you to transplant changes to another parent
       revision, possibly in another repository. The transplant is done
       using 'diff' patches.

       Transplanted patches are recorded in .hg/transplant/transplants,
       as a map from a changeset hash to its hash in the source
       repository.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change manipulation</b>
   <b>transplant</b>
       transplant changesets from another branch:

       hg transplant [-s REPO] [-b BRANCH [-a]] [-p REV] [-m REV] [REV]...

       Selected changesets will be applied on top of the current working
       directory with the log of the original changeset. The changesets
       are copied and will thus appear twice in the history with
       different identities.

       Consider using the graft command if everything is inside the same
       repository - it will use merges and will usually give a better
       result.  Use the rebase extension if the changesets are
       unpublished and you want to move them instead of copying them.

       If --log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended
       of the form:

       (transplanted from CHANGESETHASH)

       You can rewrite the changelog message with the --filter option.
       Its argument will be invoked with the current changelog message
       as $1 and the patch as $2.

       --source/-s specifies another repository to use for selecting
       changesets, just as if it temporarily had been pulled.  If
       --branch/-b is specified, these revisions will be used as heads
       when deciding which changesets to transplant, just as if only
       these revisions had been pulled.  If --all/-a is specified, all
       the revisions up to the heads specified with --branch will be
       transplanted.

       Example:

       • transplant all changes up to REV on top of your current
         revision:

         hg transplant --branch REV --all

       You can optionally mark selected transplanted changesets as merge
       changesets. You will not be prompted to transplant any ancestors
       of a merged transplant, and you can merge descendants of them
       normally instead of transplanting them.

       Merge changesets may be transplanted directly by specifying the
       proper parent changeset by calling <b>hg transplant --parent</b>.

       If no merges or revisions are provided, <b>hg transplant </b>will start
       an interactive changeset browser.

       If a changeset application fails, you can fix the merge by hand
       and then resume where you left off by calling <b>hg transplant</b>
       <b>--continue/-c</b>.

       Options:

       <b>-s,</b><i>--source</i> <b>&lt;REPO&gt;</b>
              transplant changesets from REPO

       <b>-b,</b><i>--branch</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              use this source changeset as head

       <b>-a, --all</b>
              pull all changesets up to the --branch revisions

       <b>-p,</b><i>--prune</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              skip over REV

       <b>-m,</b><i>--merge</i> <b>&lt;REV[+]&gt;</b>
              merge at REV

       <b>--parent </b><i>&lt;REV&gt;</i>
              parent to choose when transplanting merge

       <b>-e, --edit</b>
              invoke editor on commit messages

       <b>--log  </b>append transplant info to log message

       <b>--stop </b>stop interrupted transplant

       <b>-c, --continue</b>
              continue last transplant session after fixing conflicts

       <b>--filter </b><i>&lt;CMD&gt;</i>
              filter changesets through command

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>uncommit</b>
       uncommit part or all of a local changeset (EXPERIMENTAL)

       This command undoes the effect of a local commit, returning the
       affected files to their uncommitted state. This means that files
       modified, added or removed in the changeset will be left
       unchanged, and so will remain modified, added and removed in the
       working directory.

   <b>Commands</b>
   <b>Change manipulation</b>
   <b>unamend</b>
       undo the most recent amend operation on a current changeset:

       hg unamend

       This command will roll back to the previous version of a
       changeset, leaving working directory in state in which it was
       before running <i>hg amend</i> (e.g. files modified as part of an amend
       will be marked as modified <i>hg status</i>)

   <b>uncommit</b>
       uncommit part or all of a local changeset:

       hg uncommit [OPTION]... [FILE]...

       This command undoes the effect of a local commit, returning the
       affected files to their uncommitted state. This means that files
       modified or deleted in the changeset will be left unchanged, and
       so will remain modified in the working directory.

       If no files are specified, the commit will be pruned, unless
       --keep is given.

       Options:

       <b>--keep </b>allow an empty commit after uncommitting

       <b>--allow-dirty-working-copy</b>
              allow uncommit with outstanding changes

       <b>-n,</b><i>--note</i> <b>&lt;TEXT&gt;</b>
              store a note on uncommit

       <b>-I,</b><i>--include</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              include names matching the given patterns

       <b>-X,</b><i>--exclude</i> <b>&lt;PATTERN[+]&gt;</b>
              exclude names matching the given patterns

       <b>-m,</b><i>--message</i> <b>&lt;TEXT&gt;</b>
              use text as commit message

       <b>-l,</b><i>--logfile</i> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              read commit message from file

       <b>-d,</b><i>--date</i> <b>&lt;DATE&gt;</b>
              record the specified date as commit date

       <b>-u,</b><i>--user</i> <b>&lt;USER&gt;</b>
              record the specified user as committer

       <b>-D, --currentdate</b>
              record the current date as commit date

       <b>-U, --currentuser</b>
              record the current user as committer

       [+] marked option can be specified multiple times

   <b>win32mbcs</b>
       allow the use of MBCS paths with problematic encodings

       Some MBCS encodings are not good for some path operations (i.e.
       splitting path, case conversion, etc.) with its encoded bytes. We
       call such a encoding (i.e. shift_jis and big5) as "problematic
       encoding".  This extension can be used to fix the issue with
       those encodings by wrapping some functions to convert to Unicode
       string before path operation.

       This extension is useful for:

       • Japanese Windows users using shift_jis encoding.

       • Chinese Windows users using big5 encoding.

       • All users who use a repository with one of problematic
         encodings on case-insensitive file system.

       This extension is not needed for:

       • Any user who use only ASCII chars in path.

       • Any user who do not use any of problematic encodings.

       Note that there are some limitations on using this extension:

       • You should use single encoding in one repository.

       • If the repository path ends with 0x5c, .hg/hgrc cannot be read.

       • win32mbcs is not compatible with fixutf8 extension.

       By default, win32mbcs uses encoding.encoding decided by
       Mercurial.  You can specify the encoding by config option:

       [win32mbcs]
       encoding = sjis

       It is useful for the users who want to commit with UTF-8 log
       message.

   <b>win32text</b>
       perform automatic newline conversion (DEPRECATED)

          Deprecation: The win32text extension requires each user to
          configure the extension again and again for each clone since
          the configuration is not copied when cloning.

          We have therefore made the <b>eol </b>as an alternative. The <b>eol </b>uses
          a version controlled file for its configuration and each clone
          will therefore use the right settings from the start.

       To perform automatic newline conversion, use:

       [extensions]
       win32text =
       [encode]
       ** = cleverencode:
       # or ** = macencode:

       [decode]
       ** = cleverdecode:
       # or ** = macdecode:

       If not doing conversion, to make sure you do not commit CRLF/CR
       by accident:

       [hooks]
       pretxncommit.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
       # or pretxncommit.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr

       To do the same check on a server to prevent CRLF/CR from being
       pushed or pulled:

       [hooks]
       pretxnchangegroup.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
       # or pretxnchangegroup.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr

   <b>zeroconf</b>
       discover and advertise repositories on the local network

       The zeroconf extension will advertise <b>hg serve </b>instances over
       DNS-SD so that they can be discovered using the <b>hg paths </b>command
       without knowing the server's IP address.

       To allow other people to discover your repository using run <b>hg</b>
       <b>serve </b>in your repository:

       $ cd test
       $ hg serve

       You can discover Zeroconf-enabled repositories by running <b>hg</b>
       <b>paths</b>:

       $ hg paths
       zc-test = <a href="http://example.com:8000/test">http://example.com:8000/test</a>

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/etc/mercurial/hgrc, $HOME/.hgrc, .hg/hgrc</b>

              This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in
              <b>.hg/hgrc </b>override those in <b>$HOME/.hgrc</b>, and these override
              settings made in the global <b>/etc/mercurial/hgrc</b>
              configuration.  See <a href="../man5/hgrc.5.html">hgrc(5)</a> for details of the contents
              and format of these files.

       <b>.hgignore</b>

              This file contains regular expressions (one per line) that
              describe file names that should be ignored by <b>hg</b>. For
              details, see <a href="../man5/hgignore.5.html">hgignore(5)</a>.

       <b>.hgsub</b>

              This file defines the locations of all subrepositories,
              and tells where the subrepository checkouts came from. For
              details, see <b>hg help subrepos</b>.

       <b>.hgsubstate</b>

              This file is where Mercurial stores all nested repository
              states. <i>NB: This file should not be edited manually.</i>

       <b>.hgtags</b>

              This file contains changeset hash values and text tag
              names (one of each separated by spaces) that correspond to
              tagged versions of the repository contents. The file
              content is encoded using UTF-8.

       <b>.hg/last-message.txt</b>

              This file is used by <b>hg commit </b>to store a backup of the
              commit message in case the commit fails.

       <b>.hg/localtags</b>

              This file can be used to define local tags which are not
              shared among repositories. The file format is the same as
              for <b>.hgtags</b>, but it is encoded using the local system
              encoding.

       Some commands (e.g. revert) produce backup files ending in <b>.orig</b>,
       if the <b>.orig </b>file already exists and is not tracked by Mercurial,
       it will be overwritten.
