NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-whatchanged - Show logs with differences each commit
       introduces
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git whatchanged</i> &lt;option&gt;...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.

       New users are encouraged to use <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> instead. The
       <b>whatchanged </b>command is essentially the same as <a href="git-log.1.html">git-log(1)</a> but
       defaults to showing the raw format diff output and skipping
       merges.

       The command is primarily kept for historical reasons; fingers of
       many people who learned Git long before <b>git log </b>was invented by
       reading the Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git whatchanged -p v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi</b>
           Show as patches the commits since version <i>v2.6.12</i> that
           changed any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi
           subdirectories

       <b>git whatchanged --since="2 weeks ago" -- gitk</b>
           Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file <i>gitk</i>.
           The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion with the <b>branch</b>
           named <i>gitk</i>
