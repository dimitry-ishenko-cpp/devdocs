PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       uncompress — expand compressed data
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       uncompress <b>[</b>-cfv<b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>uncompress</i> utility shall restore files to their original
       state after they have been compressed using the <i>compress</i> utility.
       If no files are specified, the standard input shall be
       uncompressed to the standard output. If the invoking process has
       appropriate privileges, the ownership, modes, access time, and
       modification time of the original file shall be preserved.

       This utility shall support the uncompressing of any files
       produced by the <i>compress</i> utility on the same implementation. For
       files produced by <i>compress</i> on other systems, <i>uncompress</i> supports
       9 to 14-bit compression (see <a href="compress.1p.html">compress(1p)</a>, <b>-b</b>); it is
       implementation-defined whether values of <b>-b </b>greater than 14 are
       supported.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>uncompress</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>,
       except that Guideline 1 does apply since the utility name has ten
       letters.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c        </b>Write to standard output; no files are changed.

       <b>-f        </b>Do not prompt for overwriting files. Except when run in
                 the background, if <b>-f </b>is not given the user shall be
                 prompted as to whether an existing file should be
                 overwritten. If the standard input is not a terminal
                 and <b>-f </b>is not given, <i>uncompress</i> shall write a
                 diagnostic message to standard error and exit with a
                 status greater than zero.

       <b>-v        </b>Write messages to standard error concerning the
                 expansion of each file.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file. If <i>file</i> already has the <b>.Z </b>suffix
                 specified, it shall be used as the input file and the
                 output file shall be named <b>file </b>with the <b>.Z </b>suffix
                 removed. Otherwise, <i>file</i> shall be used as the name of
                 the output file and <b>file </b>with the <b>.Z </b>suffix appended
                 shall be used as the input file.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if no <i>file</i> operands are
       specified, or if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-'</b>.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Input files shall be in the format produced by the <i>compress</i>
       utility.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>uncompress</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       When there are no <i>file</i> operands or the <b>-c </b>option is specified,
       the uncompressed output is written to standard output.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       Prompts shall be written to the standard error output under the
       conditions specified in the DESCRIPTION and OPTIONS sections. The
       prompts shall contain the <i>file</i> pathname, but their format is
       otherwise unspecified. Otherwise, the standard error output shall
       be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Output files are the same as the respective input files to
       <i>compress</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       The input file remains unmodified.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The limit of 14 on the <i>compress</i> <b>-b </b><i>bits</i> argument is to achieve
       portability to all systems (within the restrictions imposed by
       the lack of an explicit published file format). Some
       implementations based on 16-bit architectures cannot support 15
       or 16-bit uncompression.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>

       None.
