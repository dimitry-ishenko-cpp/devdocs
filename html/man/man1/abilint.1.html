NAME </h2>
<pre>
       abilint - validate an abigail ABI representation

       abilint parses the native XML representation of an ABI as emitted
       by <i>abidw</i>.  Once it has parsed the XML representation of the ABI,
       <b>abilint </b>builds and in-memory model from it.  It then tries to
       save it back to an XML form, to standard output.  If that
       read-write operation succeeds chances are the input XML ABI
       representation is meaningful.

       Note that the main intent of this tool to help debugging issues
       in the underlying Libabigail library.

       Note also that <b>abilint </b>can also read an <i>ELF</i> input file, build the
       in-memory model for its ABI, and serialize that model back into
       XML to standard output.  In that case, the <i>ELF</i> input file must be
       accompanied with its debug information in the <i>DWARF</i> format.

INVOCATION </h2>

          abilint [options] [&lt;abi-file1&gt;]
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
          • <b>--annotate</b>

            Annotate the ABIXML output with comments above most
            elements.  The comments are made of the pretty-printed form
            of types, declaration or even ELF symbols.  The purpose is
            to make the ABIXML output more human-readable for debugging
            or documenting purposes.

          • <b>--ctf</b>

            Extract ABI information from CTF debug information, if
            present in the given object.

          • <b>--debug-info-dir </b>&lt;<i>path</i>&gt;

            When reading an <i>ELF</i> input file which debug information is
            split out into a separate file, this options tells <b>abilint</b>
            where to find that separate debug information file.

            Note that <i>path</i> must point to the root directory under which
            the debug information is arranged in a tree-like manner.
            Under Red Hat based systems, that directory is usually
            <b>&lt;root&gt;/usr/lib/debug</b>.

            Note also that this option is not mandatory for split debug
            information installed by your system's package manager
            because then <b>abidiff </b>knows where to find it.

          • <b>--diff</b>

            For XML inputs, perform a text diff between the input and
            the memory model saved back to disk.  This can help to spot
            issues in the handling of the XML format by the underlying
            Libabigail library.

          • <b>--header-file | --hf </b>&lt;header-file-path&gt;

            Specifies where to find one of the public headers of the abi
            file that the tool has to consider.  The tool will thus
            filter out types that are not defined in public headers.

          • <b>--headers-dir | --hd </b>&lt;headers-directory-path-1&gt;

            Specifies where to find the public headers of the first
            shared library that the tool has to consider.  The tool will
            thus filter out types that are not defined in public
            headers.

          • <b>--help</b>

            Display a short help message and exits.

          • <b>--noout</b>

            Do not display anything on standard output.  The return code
            of the command is the only way to know if the command
            succeeded.

          • <b>--suppressions | suppr</b>
            &lt;<i>path-to-suppression-specifications-file</i>&gt;

            Use a <i>suppression specification</i> file located at
            <i>path-to-suppression-specifications-file</i>.  Note that this
            option can appear multiple times on the command line.  In
            that case, all of the provided suppression specification
            files are taken into account.  ABI artifacts matched by the
            suppression specifications are suppressed from the output of
            this tool.

          • <b>--stdin | --</b>

            Read the input content from standard input.

          • <b>--tu</b>

            Expect the input XML to represent a single translation unit.

          • <i>--version | -v</i>

            Display the version of the program and exit.
