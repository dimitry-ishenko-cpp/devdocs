NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-pin - Pin runtimes to prevent automatic removal
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak pin </b>[OPTION...] PATTERN...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are
       pinned. A pinned ref will never be automatically uninstalled (as
       are unused runtimes periodically). This can be useful if for
       example you are using a runtime for development purposes.

       Runtimes that are explicitly installed, rather than installed as
       a dependency of something else, are automatically pinned.

       The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character
       matching anything within that part of the ref. Only runtimes can
       be pinned, not apps. Here are some example patterns:

           org.some.Runtime
           org.some.Runtime//unstable
           runtime/org.domain.*
           org.some.Runtime/arm

       To list the current set of pins, run this command without any
       patterns.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>--remove</b>
           Instead of adding the patterns, remove matching patterns.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Pin refs in a per-user installation.

       <b>--system</b>
           Pin refs in the default system-wide installation.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Pin refs in a system-wide installation specified by NAME
           among those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
           <b>--installation=default </b>is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$ flatpak pin</b>

       <b>$ flatpak pin org.freedesktop.Platform//19.08</b>

       <b>$ flatpak pin --remove org.freedesktop.Platform//19.08</b>
