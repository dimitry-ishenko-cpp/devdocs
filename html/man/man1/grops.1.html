Description </h2>
<pre>
       The GNU <i>roff</i> PostScript output driver translates the output of
       <i>troff</i>(1) into PostScript.  Normally, <i>grops</i> is invoked by <i>groff</i>(1)
       when the latter is given the “<b>-T ps</b>” option.  (In this
       installation, <b>ps </b>is the default output device.)  Use <i>groff</i>'s <b>-P</b>
       option to pass any options shown above to <i>grops</i>.  If no <i>file</i>
       arguments are given, or if <i>file</i> is “-”, <i>grotty</i> reads the standard
       input stream.  It writes to the standard output stream.

       When called with multiple <i>file</i> arguments, <i>grops</i> doesn't produce a
       valid document structure (one conforming to the Document
       Structuring Conventions).  To print such concatenated output, it
       is necessary to deactivate DSC handling in the printing program
       or previewer.

       See section “Font installation” below for a guide to installing
       fonts for <i>grops</i>.

Options </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b>displays a usage message, while <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>show
       version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-b </b><i>n</i>   Work around problems with spoolers, previewers, and older
              printers.  Normally, <i>grops</i> produces output at PostScript
              LanguageLevel 2 that conforms to version 3.0 of the
              Document Structuring Conventions.  Some software and
              devices can't handle such a data stream.  The value of <i>n</i>
              determines what <i>grops</i> does to make its output acceptable
              to such consumers.  If <i>n</i> is <b>0</b>, <i>grops</i> employs no
              workarounds, which is the default; it can be changed by
              modifying the <b>broken </b>directive in <i>grops</i>'s <i>DESC</i> file.

              Add 1 to suppress generation of <b>%%BeginDocumentSetup </b>and
              <b>%%EndDocumentSetup </b>comments; this is needed for early
              versions of TranScript that get confused by anything
              between the <b>%%EndProlog </b>comment and the first <b>%%Page</b>
              comment.

              Add 2 to omit lines in included files beginning with <b>%!</b>,
              which confuse Sun's <i>pageview</i> previewer.

              Add 4 to omit lines in included files beginning with
              <b>%%Page</b>, <b>%%Trailer </b>and <b>%%EndProlog</b>; this is needed for
              spoolers that don't understand <b>%%BeginDocument </b>and <b>%%End‐</b>
              <b>Document </b>comments.

              Add 8 to write <b>%!PS-Adobe-2.0 </b>rather than <b>%!PS-Adobe-3.0</b>
              as the first line of the PostScript output; this is needed
              when using Sun's Newsprint with a printer that requires
              page reversal.

              Add 16 to omit media size information (that is, output
              neither a <b>%%DocumentMedia </b>comment nor the <b>setpagedevice</b>
              PostScript command).  This was the behavior of <i>groff</i>
              1.18.1 and earlier; it is needed for older printers that
              don't understand PostScript LanguageLevel 2, and is also
              necessary if the output is further processed to produce an
              EPS file; see subsection “Escapsulated PostScript” below.

       <b>-c </b><i>n</i>   Output <i>n</i> copies of each page.

       <b>-F </b><i>dir</i> Prepend directory dir<i>/dev</i>name to the search path for font
              and device description and PostScript prologue files; <i>name</i>
              is the name of the device, usually <b>ps</b>.

       <b>-g     </b>Generate PostScript code to guess the page length.  The
              guess is correct only if the imageable area is vertically
              centered on the page.  This option allows you to generate
              documents that can be printed on both U.S. letter and A4
              paper formats without change.

       <b>-I </b><i>dir</i> Search the directory <i>dir</i> for files named in <b>\X'ps: file'</b>
              and <b>\X'ps: import' </b>escape sequences.  <b>-I </b>may be specified
              more than once; each <i>dir</i> is searched in the given order.
              To search the current working directory before others, add
              “<b>-I .</b>” at the desired place; it is otherwise searched
              last.

       <b>-l     </b>Use landscape orientation rather than portrait.

       <b>-m     </b>Turn on manual feed for the document.

       <b>-p </b><i>fmt</i> Set physical dimensions of output medium, overriding the
              <b>papersize</b>, <b>paperlength</b>, and <b>paperwidth </b>directives in the
              <i>DESC</i> file.  <i>fmt</i> can be any argument accepted by the
              <b>papersize </b>directive; see <i>groff_font</i>(5).

       <b>-P </b><i>prologue</i>
              Use the file <i>prologue</i>, sought in the <i>groff</i> font search
              path, as the PostScript prologue, overriding the default
              (see section “Files” below) and the environment variable
              <i>GROPS_PROLOGUE.</i>

       <b>-w </b><i>n</i>   Draw rules (lines) with a thickness of <i>n</i> thousandths of an
              em.  The default thickness is <b>40 </b>(0.04 em).
</pre> <h2>
Usage </h2>
<pre>
       The input to <i>grops</i> must be in the format output by <i>troff</i>(1),
       described in <i>groff_out</i>(5).  In addition, the device and font
       description files for the device used must meet certain
       requirements.  The device resolution must be an integer multiple
       of 72 times the <b>sizescale</b>.  The device description file must
       contain a valid paper format; see <i>groff_font</i>(5).  Each font
       description file must contain a directive
              internalname <i>psname</i>
       which says that the PostScript name of the font is <i>psname</i>.

       A font description file may also contain a directive
              encoding <i>enc-file</i>
       which says that the PostScript font should be reencoded using the
       encoding described in <i>enc-file</i>; this file should consist of a
       sequence of lines of the form
              <i>pschar code</i>
       where <i>pschar</i> is the PostScript name of the character, and <i>code</i> is
       its position in the encoding expressed as a decimal integer;
       valid values are in the range 0 to 255.  Lines starting with <b>#</b>
       and blank lines are ignored.  The code for each character given
       in the font description file must correspond to the code for the
       character in encoding file, or to the code in the default
       encoding for the font if the PostScript font is not to be
       reencoded.  This code can be used with the <b>\N </b>escape sequence in
       <i>troff</i> to select the character, even if it does not have a <i>groff</i>
       glyph name.  Every character in the font description file must
       exist in the PostScript font, and the widths given in the font
       description file must match the widths used in the PostScript
       font.  <i>grops</i> assumes that a character with a <i>groff</i> name of <b>space</b>
       is blank (makes no marks on the page); it can make use of such a
       character to generate more efficient and compact PostScript
       output.

       <i>grops</i> is able to display all glyphs in a PostScript font; it is
       not limited to 256 of them.  <i>enc-file</i> (or the default encoding if
       no encoding file is specified) just defines the order of glyphs
       for the first 256 characters; all other glyphs are accessed with
       additional encoding vectors which <i>grops</i> produces on the fly.

       <i>grops</i> can embed fonts in a document that are necessary to render
       it; this is called “downloading”.  Such fonts must be in PFA
       format.  Use <i>pfbtops</i>(1) to convert a Type 1 font in PFB format.
       Downloadable fonts must be listed a <i>download</i> file containing
       lines of the form
              <i>psname file</i>
       where <i>psname</i> is the PostScript name of the font, and <i>file</i> is the
       name of the file containing it.  Blank lines and those beginning
       with <b># </b>are ignored; fields are separated by tabs.  <i>file</i> is sought
       using the same mechanism as for <i>groff</i> font description files.
       The <i>download</i> file itself is as well; currently, the first
       matching file found in the device and font description search
       path is used.

       If the file containing a downloadable font or imported document
       conforms to the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions, then
       <i>grops</i> interprets any comments in the files sufficiently to ensure
       that its own output is conforming.  It also supplies any needed
       font resources that are listed in the <i>download</i> file as well as
       any needed file resources.  It is also able to handle inter-
       resource dependencies.  For example, suppose that you have a
       downloadable font called Garamond, and also a downloadable font
       called Garamond-Outline which depends on Garamond (typically it
       would be defined to copy Garamond's font dictionary, and change
       the PaintType), then it is necessary for Garamond to appear
       before Garamond-Outline in the PostScript document.  <i>grops</i>
       handles this automatically provided that the downloadable font
       file for Garamond-Outline indicates its dependence on Garamond by
       means of the Document Structuring Conventions, for example by
       beginning with the following lines.
              %!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-Font
              %%DocumentNeededResources: font Garamond
              %%EndComments
              %%IncludeResource: font Garamond
       In this case, both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need to be
       listed in the <i>download</i> file.  A downloadable font should not
       include its own name in a <b>%%DocumentSuppliedResources </b>comment.

       <i>grops</i> does not interpret <b>%%DocumentFonts </b>comments.  The
       <b>%%DocumentNeededResources</b>, <b>%%DocumentSuppliedResources</b>,
       <b>%%IncludeResource</b>, <b>%%BeginResource</b>, and <b>%%EndResource </b>comments
       (or possibly the old <b>%%DocumentNeededFonts</b>, <b>%%DocumentSupplied‐</b>
       <b>Fonts</b>, <b>%%IncludeFont</b>, <b>%%BeginFont</b>, and <b>%%EndFont </b>comments) should
       be used.

       The default stroke and fill colors are black.  For colors defined
       in the “rgb” color space, <b>setrgbcolor </b>is used; for “cmy” and
       “cmyk”, <b>setcmykcolor</b>; and for “gray”, <b>setgray</b>.  <b>setcmykcolor </b>is a
       PostScript LanguageLevel 2 command and thus not available on some
       older printers.

   <b>Typefaces</b>
       Styles called <b>R</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>BI </b>mounted at font positions 1 to 4.
       Text fonts are grouped into families <b>A</b>, <b>BM</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>HN</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>,
       and <b>T</b>, each having members in each of these styles.

              <b>ZCMI   </b>ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

       Special fonts include <b>S</b>, the PostScript Symbol font; <b>ZD</b>, Zapf
       Dingbats; <b>SS </b>(slanted symbol), which contains oblique forms of
       lowercase Greek letters derived from Symbol; <b>EURO</b>, which offers a
       Euro glyph for use with old devices lacking it; and <b>ZDR</b>, a
       reversed version of Zapf Dingbats (with symbols flipped about the
       vertical axis).  Most glyphs in these fonts are unnamed and must
       be accessed using <b>\N</b>.  The last three are not standard PostScript
       fonts, but supplied by <i>groff</i> and therefore included in the
       default <i>download</i> file.

   <b>Device control commands</b>
       <i>grops</i> recognizes device control commands produced by the <b>\X</b>
       escape sequence, but interprets only those that begin with a
       “<b>ps:</b>” tag.

       <b>\X'ps: exec </b><i>code</i><b>'</b>
              Execute the arbitrary PostScript commands <i>code</i>.  The
              PostScript <i>currentpoint</i> is set to the <i>groff</i> drawing
              position when the <b>\X </b>escape sequence is interpreted before
              executing <i>code</i>.  The origin is at the top left corner of
              the page; <i>x</i> coordinates increase to the right, and
              <i>y</i> coordinates down the page.  A procedure <b>u </b>is defined
              that converts <i>groff</i> basic units to the coordinate system
              in effect (provided the user doesn't change the scale).
              For example,
                     .nr x 1i
                     \X'ps: exec \nx u 0 rlineto stroke'
              draws a horizontal line one inch long.  <i>code</i> may make
              changes to the graphics state, but any changes persist
              only to the end of the page.  A dictionary containing the
              definitions specified by the <b>def </b>and <b>mdef </b>commands is on
              top of the dictionary stack.  If your code adds
              definitions to this dictionary, you should allocate space
              for them using “<b>\X'ps: mdef </b><i>n</i><b>'</b>”.  Any definitions persist
              only until the end of the page.  If you use the <b>\Y </b>escape
              sequence with an argument that names a macro, <i>code</i> can
              extend over multiple lines.  For example,
                     .nr x 1i
                     .de y
                     ps: exec
                     \nx u 0 rlineto
                     stroke
                     ..
                     \Yy
              is another way to draw a horizontal line one inch long.
              The single backslash before “<b>nx</b>”—the only reason to use a
              register while defining the macro “<b>y</b>”—is to convert a
              user-specified dimension “<b>1i</b>” to <i>groff</i> basic units which
              are in turn converted to PostScript units with the <b>u</b>
              procedure.

              <i>grops</i> wraps user-specified PostScript code into a
              dictionary, nothing more.  In particular, it doesn't start
              and end the inserted code with <b>save </b>and <b>restore</b>,
              respectively.  This must be supplied by the user, if
              necessary.

       <b>\X'ps: file </b><i>name</i><b>'</b>
              This is the same as the <b>exec </b>command except that the
              PostScript code is read from file <i>name</i>.

       <b>\X'ps: def </b><i>code</i><b>'</b>
              Place a PostScript definition contained in <i>code</i> in the
              prologue.  There should be at most one definition per <b>\X</b>
              command.  Long definitions can be split over several <b>\X</b>
              commands; all the <i>code</i> arguments are simply joined
              together separated by newlines.  The definitions are
              placed in a dictionary which is automatically pushed on
              the dictionary stack when an <b>exec </b>command is executed.  If
              you use the <b>\Y </b>escape sequence with an argument that names
              a macro, <i>code</i> can extend over multiple lines.

       <b>\X'ps: mdef </b><i>n code</i><b>'</b>
              Like <b>def</b>, except that <i>code</i> may contain up to
              <i>n</i> definitions.  <i>grops</i> needs to know how many definitions
              <i>code</i> contains so that it can create an appropriately sized
              PostScript dictionary to contain them.

       <b>\X'ps: import </b><i>file llx lly urx ury width</i> [<i>height</i>]<b>'</b>
              Import a PostScript graphic from <i>file</i>.  The arguments <i>llx</i>,
              <i>lly</i>, <i>urx</i>, and <i>ury</i> give the bounding box of the graphic in
              the default PostScript coordinate system.  They should all
              be integers: <i>llx</i> and <i>lly</i> are the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of
              the lower left corner of the graphic; <i>urx</i> and <i>ury</i> are the
              <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of the upper right corner of the
              graphic; <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are integers that give the
              desired width and height in <i>groff</i> basic units of the
              graphic.

              The graphic is scaled so that it has this width and height
              and translated so that the lower left corner of the
              graphic is located at the position associated with <b>\X</b>
              command.  If the height argument is omitted it is scaled
              uniformly in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes so that it has the specified
              width.

              The contents of the <b>\X </b>command are not interpreted by
              <i>troff</i>, so vertical space for the graphic is not
              automatically added, and the <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> arguments
              are not allowed to have attached scaling indicators.

              If the PostScript file complies with the Adobe Document
              Structuring Conventions and contains a <b>%%BoundingBox</b>
              comment, then the bounding box can be automatically
              extracted from within <i>groff</i> input by using the <b>psbb</b>
              request.

              See <i>groff_tmac</i>(5) for a description of the <b>PSPIC </b>macro
              which provides a convenient high-level interface for
              inclusion of PostScript graphics.

       <b>\X'ps: invis'</b>
       <b>\X'ps: endinvis'</b>
              No output is generated for text and drawing commands that
              are bracketed with these <b>\X </b>commands.  These commands are
              intended for use when output from <i>troff</i> is previewed
              before being processed with <i>grops</i>; if the previewer is
              unable to display certain characters or other constructs,
              then other substitute characters or constructs can be used
              for previewing by bracketing them with these <b>\X </b>commands.

              For example, <i>gxditview</i> is not able to display a proper
              <b>\[em] </b>character because the standard X11 fonts do not
              provide it; this problem can be overcome by executing the
              following request

                     .char \[em] \X'ps: invis'\
                     \Z'\v'-.25m'\h'.05m'\D'l .9m 0'\h'.05m''\
                     \X'ps: endinvis'\[em]

              In this case, <i>gxditview</i> is unable to display the <b>\[em]</b>
              character and draws the line, whereas <i>grops</i> prints the
              <b>\[em] </b>character and ignores the line (this code is already
              in file <i>Xps.tmac</i>, which is loaded if a document intended
              for <i>grops</i> is previewed with <i>gxditview</i>).

       If a PostScript procedure <b>BPhook </b>has been defined via a “<b>ps: def</b>”
       or “<b>ps: mdef</b>” device control command, it is executed at the
       beginning of every page (before anything is drawn or written by
       <i>groff</i>).  For example, to underlay the page contents with the word
       “DRAFT” in light gray, you might use

              .de XX
              ps: def
              /BPhook
              { gsave .9 setgray clippath pathbbox exch 2 copy
                .5 mul exch .5 mul translate atan rotate pop pop
                /NewCenturySchlbk-Roman findfont 200 scalefont setfont
                (DRAFT) dup stringwidth pop -.5 mul -70 moveto show
                grestore }
              def
              ..
              .devicem XX

       Or, to cause lines and polygons to be drawn with square linecaps
       and mitered linejoins instead of the round linecaps and linejoins
       normally used by <i>grops</i>, use
              .de XX
              ps: def
              /BPhook { 2 setlinecap 0 setlinejoin } def
              ..
              .devicem XX
       (square linecaps, as opposed to butt linecaps (“<b>0 setlinecap</b>”),
       give true corners in boxed tables even though the lines are drawn
       unconnected).

   <b>Encapsulated PostScript</b>
       <i>grops</i> itself doesn't emit bounding box information.  The
       following script, <i>groff2eps</i>, produces an EPS file.

              #!/bin/sh
              groff -P-b16 "$1" &gt; "$1".ps
              gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=bbox -- "$1".ps 2&gt; "$1".bbox
              sed -e "/^%%Orientation/r $1.bbox" \
                  -e "/^%!PS-Adobe-3.0/s/$/ EPSF-3.0/" "$1".ps &gt; "$1".eps
              rm "$1".ps "$1".bbox

       You can then use “<b>groff2eps foo</b>” to convert file <i>foo</i> to <i>foo.eps</i>.

   <b>TrueType and other font formats</b>
       TrueType fonts can be used with <i>grops</i> if converted first to
       Type 42 format, a PostScript wrapper equivalent to the PFA format
       described in <i>pfbtops</i>(1).  Several methods exist to generate a
       Type 42 wrapper; some of them involve the use of a PostScript
       interpreter such as Ghostscript—see <i>gs</i>(1).

       One approach is to use FontForge ⟨<a href="https://fontforge.org/">https://fontforge.org/</a>⟩, a font
       editor that can convert most outline font formats.  Here's an
       example of using the Roboto Slab Serif font with <i>groff</i>.  Several
       variables are used so that you can more easily adapt it into your
       own script.

           MAP=/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/generate/text.map
           TTF=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/roboto/slab/RobotoSlab-Regular.ttf
           BASE=$(basename "$TTF")
           INT=${BASE%.ttf}
           PFA=$INT.pfa
           AFM=$INT.afm
           GFN=RSR
           DIR=$HOME/.local/groff/font
           mkdir -p "$DIR"/devps
           fontforge -lang=ff -c "Open(\"$TTF\");\
           Generate(\"$DIR/devps/$PFA\");"
           afmtodit "$DIR/devps/$AFM" "$MAP" "$DIR/devps/$GFN"
           printf "$BASE\t$PFA\n" &gt;&gt; "$DIR/devps/download"

       <i>fontforge</i> and <i>afmtodit</i> may generate warnings depending on the
       attributes of the font.  The test procedure is simple.

           printf ".ft RSR\nHello, world!\n" | groff -F "$DIR" &gt; hello.ps

       Once you're satisfied that the font works, you may want to
       generate any available related styles (for instance, Roboto Slab
       also has “Bold”, “Light”, and “Thin” styles) and set up
       <i>GROFF_FONT_PATH</i> in your environment to include the directory you
       keep the generated fonts in so that you don't have to use the <b>-F</b>
       option.
</pre> <h2>
Font installation </h2>
<pre>
       The following is a step-by-step font installation guide for
       <i>grops.</i>

       •  Convert your font to something <i>groff</i> understands.  This is a
          PostScript Type 1 font in PFA format or a PostScript Type 42
          font, together with an AFM file.  A PFA file begins as
          follows.
                 %!PS-AdobeFont-1.0:
          A PFB file contains this string as well, preceded by some non-
          printing bytes.  If your font is in PFB format, use <i>groff</i>'s
          <i>pfbtops</i>(1) program to convert it to PFA.  For TrueType and
          other font formats, we recommend <i>fontforge</i>, which can convert
          most outline font formats.  A Type 42 font file begins as
          follows.
                 %!PS-TrueTypeFont
          This is a wrapper format for TrueType fonts.  Old PostScript
          printers might not support them (that is, they might not have
          a built-in TrueType font interpreter).  In the following
          steps, we will consider the use of CTAN's BrushScriptX-Italic
          ⟨<a href="https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/brushscr">https://ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/brushscr</a>⟩ font in PFA
          format.

       •  Convert the AFM file to a <i>groff</i> font description file with the
          <i>afmtodit</i>(1) program.  For instance,
                 $ <b>afmtodit BrushScriptX-Italic.afm text.map BSI</b>
          converts the Adobe Font Metric file <i>BrushScriptX-Italic.afm</i> to
          the <i>groff</i> font description file <i>BSI</i>.

          If you have a font family which provides regular upright
          (roman), bold, italic, and bold-italic styles (where “italic”
          may be “oblique” or “slanted”), we recommend using the letters
          <b>R</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>BI</b>, respectively, as suffixes to the <i>groff</i> font
          family name to enable <i>groff</i>'s font family and style selection
          features.  An example is <i>groff</i>'s built-in support for Times:
          the font family name is abbreviated as <b>T</b>, and the <i>groff</i> font
          names are therefore <b>TR</b>, <b>TB</b>, <b>TI</b>, and <b>TBI</b>.  In our example,
          however, the BrushScriptX font is available in a single style
          only, italic.

       •  Install the <i>groff</i> font description file(s) in a <i>devps</i>
          subdirectory in the search path that <i>groff</i> uses for device and
          font file descriptions.  See the <i>GROFF_FONT_PATH</i> entry in
          section “Environment” of <i>troff</i>(1) for the current value of the
          font search path.  While <i>groff</i> doesn't directly use AFM files,
          it is a good idea to store them alongside its font description
          files.

       •  Register fonts in the <i>devps/download</i> file so they can be
          located for embedding in PostScript files <i>grops</i> generates.
          Only the first <i>download</i> file encountered in the font search
          path is read.  If in doubt, copy the default <i>download</i> file
          (see section “Files” below) to the first directory in the font
          search path and add your fonts there.  The PostScript font
          name used by <i>grops</i> is stored in the <b>internalname </b>field in the
          <i>groff</i> font description file.  (This name does not necessarily
          resemble the font's file name.)  We add the following line to
          <i>download</i>.
                 BrushScriptX-Italic→BrushScriptX-Italic.pfa
          A tab character, depicted as →, separates the fields.

       •  Test the selection and embedding of the new font.
                 printf "\\f[BSI]Hello, world!\n" | groff -T ps -P -e &gt;hello.ps
                 see hello.pdf
</pre> <h2>
Old fonts </h2>
<pre>
       <i>groff</i> versions 1.19.2 and earlier contained descriptions of a
       slightly different set of the base 35 PostScript level 2 fonts
       defined by Adobe.  The older set has 229 glyphs and a larger set
       of kerning pairs; the newer one has 314 glyphs, including the
       Euro sign.  For backwards compatibility, these old font
       descriptions are also installed in the <i>/usr/local/share/groff/</i>
       <i>1.23.0/oldfont/devps</i> directory.

       To use them, make sure that <i>grops</i> finds the fonts before the
       default system fonts (with the same names): either give <i>grops</i> the
       <b>-F </b>command-line option,
              $ <b>groff -Tps -P-F -P/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/oldfont </b>...
       or add the directory to <i>groff</i>'s font and device description
       search path environment variable,
              $ <b>GROFF_FONT_PATH=/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/oldfont \</b>
                     <b>groff -Tps </b>...
       when the command runs.
</pre> <h2>
Environment </h2>
<pre>
       <i>GROFF_FONT_PATH</i>
              A list of directories in which to seek the selected output
              device's directory of device and font description files.
              See <i>troff</i>(1) and <i>groff_font</i>(5).

       <i>GROPS_PROLOGUE</i>
              If this is set to <i>foo</i>, then <i>grops</i> uses the file <i>foo</i> (in
              the font path) instead of the default prologue file
              <i>prologue</i>.  The option <b>-P </b>overrides this environment
              variable.

       <i>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</i>
              A timestamp (expressed as seconds since the Unix epoch) to
              use as the output creation timestamp in place of the
              current time.  The time is converted to human-readable
              form using <i>gmtime</i>(3) and <i>asctime</i>(3), and recorded in a
              PostScript comment.

       <i>TZ</i>     The time zone to use when converting the current time to
              human-readable form; see <i>tzset</i>(3).  If <i>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</i>
              is used, it is always converted to human-readable form
              using UTC.
</pre> <h2>
Files </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/DESC</i>
              describes the <b>ps </b>output device.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/</i>F
              describes the font known as <i>F</i> on device <b>ps</b>.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/download</i>
              lists fonts available for embedding within the PostScript
              document (or download to the device).

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/prologue</i>
              is the default PostScript prologue prefixed to every
              output file.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/text.enc</i>
              describes the encoding scheme used by most PostScript
              Type 1 fonts; the <b>encoding </b>directive of font description
              files for the <b>ps </b>device refers to it.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/ps.tmac</i>
              defines macros for use with the <b>ps </b>output device.  It is
              automatically loaded by <i>troffrc</i> when the <b>ps </b>output device
              is selected.

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/pspic.tmac</i>
              defines the <b>PSPIC </b>macro for embedding images in a
              document; see <i>groff_tmac</i>(5).  It is automatically loaded
              by <i>troffrc.</i>

       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/psold.tmac</i>
              provides replacement glyphs for text fonts that lack
              complete coverage of the ISO Latin-1 character set; using
              it, <i>groff</i> can produce glyphs like eth (ð) and thorn (þ)
              that older PostScript printers do not natively support.

       <i>grops</i> creates temporary files using the template “<i>grops</i>XXXXXX”;
       see <i>groff</i>(1) for details on their storage location.
