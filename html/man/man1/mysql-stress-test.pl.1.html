       mysql-stress-test.pl - server stress test program
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>mysql-stress-test.pl [</b><i>options</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>mysql-stress-test.pl </b>Perl script performs stress-testing of
       the MariaDB server.

       <b>mysql-stress-test.pl </b>requires a version of Perl that has been
       built with threads support.

       Invoke <b>mysql-stress-test.pl </b>like this:

           shell&gt; <b>mysql-stress-test.pl [</b><i>options</i><b>]</b>

       <b>mysql-stress-test.pl </b>supports the following options:

       •   <b>--help</b>

           Display a help message and exit.

       •   <b>--abort-on-error=</b><i>N</i>

           Causes the program to abort if an error with severity less
           than or equal to N was encountered. Set to 1 to abort on any
           error.

       •   <b>--check-tests-file</b>

           Periodically check the file that lists the tests to be run.
           If it has been modified, reread the file. This can be useful
           if you update the list of tests to be run during a stress
           test.

       •   <b>--cleanup</b>

           Force cleanup of the working directory.

       •   <b>--log-error-details</b>

           Log error details in the global error log file.

       •   <b>--loop-count=</b><i>N</i>

           In sequential test mode, the number of loops to execute
           before exiting.

       •   <b>--mysqltest=</b><i>path</i>

           The path name to the <b>mysqltest </b>program.

       •   <b>--server-database=</b><i>db_name</i>

           The database to use for the tests. The default is test.

       •   <b>--server-host=</b><i>host_name</i>

           The host name of the local host to use for making a TCP/IP
           connection to the local server. By default, the connection is
           made to localhost using a Unix socket file.

       •   <b>--server-logs-dir=</b><i>path</i>

           This option is required.  <i>path</i> is the directory where all
           client session logs will be stored. Usually this is the
           shared directory that is associated with the server used for
           testing.

       •   <b>--server-password=</b><i>password</i>

           The password to use when connecting to the server.

       •   <b>--server-port=</b><i>port_num</i>

           The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to the server.
           The default is 3306.

       •   <b>--server-socket=</b><i>file_name</i>

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use,
           or, on Windows, the name of the named pipe to use. The
           default is /tmp/mysql.sock.

       •   <b>--server-user=</b><i>user_name</i>

           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.
           The default is root.

       •   <b>--sleep-time=</b><i>N</i>

           The delay in seconds between test executions.

       •   <b>--stress-basedir=</b><i>path</i>

           This option is required.  <i>path</i> is the working directory for
           the test run. It is used as the temporary location for result
           tracking during testing.

       •   <b>--stress-datadir=</b><i>path</i>

           The directory of data files to be used during testing. The
           default location is the data directory under the location
           given by the <b>--stress-suite-basedir </b>option.

       •   <b>--stress-init-file[=</b><i>path</i><b>]</b>

           <i>file_name</i> is the location of the file that contains the list
           of tests to be run once to initialize the database for the
           testing. If missing, the default file is stress_init.txt in
           the test suite directory.

       •   <b>--stress-mode=</b><i>mode</i>

           This option indicates the test order in stress-test mode. The
           <i>mode</i> value is either random to select tests in random order
           or seq to run tests in each thread in the order specified in
           the test list file. The default mode is random.

       •   <b>--stress-suite-basedir=</b><i>path</i>

           This option is required.  <i>path</i> is the directory that has the
           t and <i>r</i> subdirectories containing the test case and result
           files. This directory is also the default location of the
           stress-test.txt file that contains the list of tests. (A
           different location can be specified with the
           <b>--stress-tests-file </b>option.)

       •   <b>--stress-tests-file[=</b><i>file_name</i><b>]</b>

           Use this option to run the stress tests.  <i>file_name</i> is the
           location of the file that contains the list of tests. If
           <i>file_name</i> is omitted, the default file is stress-test.txt in
           the stress suite directory. (See <b>--stress-suite-basedir</b>.)

       •   <b>--suite=</b><i>suite_name</i>

           Run the named test suite. The default name is main (the
           regular test suite located in the mysql-test directory).

       •   <b>--test-count=</b><i>N</i>

           The number of tests to execute before exiting.

       •   <b>--test-duration=</b><i>N</i>

           The duration of stress testing in seconds.

       •   <b>--threads=</b><i>N</i>

           The number of threads. The default is 1.

       •   <b>--verbose</b>

           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program
           does.
