NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dbpmda </b>- debugger for Performance Co-Pilot PMDAs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dbpmda </b>[<b>-efiv?</b>]  [<b>-n </b><i>pmnsfile</i>] [<b>-q </b><i>timeout</i>] [<b>-U </b><i>username</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dbpmda </b>is an interactive interface to the interactions between a
       Performance Metric Domain Agent (<a href="../man3/pmda.3.html">PMDA(3)</a>) and the Performance
       Metric Collector Daemon (<a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>).  This allows PMDAs to be
       attached, initialized and exercised to test for correctness.

       <b>dbpmda </b>interactively prompts the user for commands, many of which
       emulate the Protocol Data Units (PDUs) that may be sent by a
       <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> process.  After running <b>dbpmda</b>, enter the command <b>help </b>to
       get a list of the available commands.  The example section below
       illustrates a session using <b>dbpmda </b>to test a PMDA.

       To simplify repetitive testing of a PMDA, the file <i>.dbpmdarc</i> in
       the current working directory can contain a list of commands that
       will be executed by <b>dbpmda </b>on startup, before the user is
       prompted to enter further commands interactively.  While
       processing the <i>.dbpmdarc</i> file, interactive mode and command
       echoing are enabled and then reset at the end of the <i>.dbpmdarc</i>
       file (see the <b>-i </b>and <b>-e </b>command line options below).

       The <b>-f </b>command line option prevents startup processing of a
       <i>.dbpmdarc</i> file (if it exists).

       If the system supports <a href="../man3/readline.3.html">readline(3)</a> then this will be used to read
       commands when input is from a tty device, so history and command
       line editing are available.

       As there are no timeout constraints on a PMDA while using <b>dbpmda</b>
       (as compared to <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>), another debugger like <a href="gdb.1.html">gdb(1)</a> can be
       used on the PMDA process once it has been attached to <b>dbpmda</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--echo-input</b>
            Echo the input to <b>stdout</b>.  This is useful when the input is
            redirected from a file.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--norc</b>
            Do not process the <b>.dbpmdarc </b>file.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interactive</b>
            Emulate interactive behavior and prompt for new commands,
            even if standard input is not a tty device.

       <b>-n </b><i>pmnsfile</i>, <b>--namespace</b>=<i>pmnsfile</i>
            Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (<a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">PMNS(5)</a>)
            from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       <b>-q </b><i>timeout</i>, <b>--creds-timeout</b>=<i>timeout</i>
            The pmcd to agent version exchange protocol (new in PCP 2.0
            - introduced to provide backward compatibility) uses this
            timeout to specify how long <b>dbpmda </b>should wait before
            assuming that no version response is coming from an agent.
            If this timeout is reached, the agent is assumed to be an
            agent which does not understand the PCP 2.0 protocol.  The
            default timeout interval is three seconds, but the <b>-q </b>option
            allows an alternative timeout interval (which must be
            greater than zero) to be specified.  The unit of time is
            seconds.

       <b>-U </b><i>username</i>, <b>--username</b>=<i>username</i>
            User account under which to run <b>dbpmda</b>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--valgrind</b>
            Useful when running <b>dbpmda </b>under the control of <a href="valgrind.1.html">valgrind(1)</a>
            to triage problems in a DSO PMDA.  If the <b>-v </b>option is used
            then <b>dbpmda </b>will do not call <a href="../man3/dlclose.3.html">dlclose(3)</a> before exiting, this
            allows <a href="valgrind.1.html">valgrind(1)</a> to access the symbol table of the DSO
            PMDA when reporting which makes debugging much easier.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Below is a <b>dbpmda </b>session using the <i>simple</i> PMDA.  A <b>.dbpmdarc</b>
       file is used to set the debugging option, open the PMDA and
       display the current status of the debugger:

            $ cat .dbpmdarc
            debug libpmda
            open dso pmda_simple.so simple_init 253
            status

       When <b>dbpmda </b>is run, the commands in the <b>.dbpmdarc </b>file are
       executed first:

            $ dbpmda
            .dbpmdarc&gt; debug libpmda
            .dbpmdarc&gt; open dso pmda_simple.so simple_init 253

       To examine the metric and instance domain metadata, the <b>desc </b>and
       <b>instance </b>commands can be used.  Metrics may be identified either
       by name, or using the numeric ``dotted'' notation to specify the
       domain, cluster and item fields of a PMID.  Instance domains must
       be identified using a numeric ``dotted'' notation to specify the
       domain and serial fields.  The syntax for most commands will be
       displayed if the command is given without any arguments:

            dbpmda&gt; desc 253.0.0
            PMID: 253.0.0
                Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
                Semantics: instant  Units: none
            dbpmda&gt; instance
            instance indom# [ number | name | "name" ]
            dbpmda&gt; instance 253.0
            pmInDom: 253.0
            [  0] inst: 0 name: "red"
            [  1] inst: 1 name: "green"
            [  2] inst: 2 name: "blue"

       To test the most important component of a PMDA, the <b>fetch</b>, it is
       often useful to determine the time it takes the PMDA to respond.
       The <b>timer </b>may be turned on before giving a <b>fetch</b>:

            dbpmda&gt; timer on
            dbpmda&gt; fetch simple.numfetch 253.0.1
            PMID(s): 253.0.0 253.0.1
            pmResult dump from 0x100078e0 timestamp: 0.000000 11:00:00.000 numpmid: 2
              253.0.0 (simple.numfetch): numval: 1 valfmt: 0 vlist[]:
               value 1 1.4012985e-45 0x1
              253.0.1 (simple.color): numval: 3 valfmt: 0 vlist[]:
                inst [0 or ???] value 1 1 1.4012985e-45 0x1
                inst [1 or ???] value 101 1.4153114e-43 0x65
                inst [2 or ???] value 201 2.8166099e-43 0xc9
            Timer: 0.003921 seconds
            dbpmda&gt; timer off

       The integer, floating point and hex translations of the values in
       the <i>pmResult</i> structure are dumped if <b>getdesc </b>is set to <b>off </b>(the
       default).  Setting <b>getdesc </b>to <b>on </b>also fetches the metric metadata
       (or <b>pmDesc</b>) and this would result in only integer values being
       dumped in the above fetch as the metric metadata describes the
       metric type to be 32-bit unsigned integers.

       Similarly, the <b>getiname </b>setting controls the lookup of external
       instance names for metrics with an associated instance domain.
       When <b>off </b>(the default) the output is as above.  When <b>on </b>the
       instance ``names'' ??? are translated into their external
       instance names by the PMDA and reported as below:

            dbpmda&gt; getiname on
            dbpmda&gt; fetch simple.color
            PMID(s): 253.0.1
            pmResult dump from 0x100078e0 timestamp: 0.000000 11:00:00.000 numpmid: 1
              253.0.1 (simple.color): numval: 3 valfmt: 0 vlist[]:
                inst [0 or "red"] value 4
                inst [1 or "green"] value 104
                inst [2 or "blue"] value 204

       Because the metric metadata is required to do the instance name
       lookup, setting <b>getiname </b>to <b>on </b>implicitly sets <b>getdesc </b>to <b>on</b>.

       Note that if either <b>getdesc </b>or <b>getiname </b>are set <b>on </b>then each
       <b>fetch </b>involves additional calls on the PMDA.  For a PMDA under
       development this may not be a good idea, which is why both
       settings default to <b>off</b>.

       The simple PMDA also supports the <b>store </b>operation which can be
       tested with subsequent <b>fetch </b>commands:

            dbpmda&gt; store simple.numfetch "42"
            PMID: 253.0.0
            Getting description...
            Getting Result Structure...
            253.0.0: 2 -&gt; 42
            dbpmda&gt; fetch simple.numfetch
            PMID(s): 253.0.0
            pmResult dump from 0x100078e0 timestamp: 0.000000 11:00:00.000 numpmid: 1
              253.0.0 (simple.numfetch): numval: 1 valfmt: 0 vlist[]:
               value 43

       The value argument in the <b>store </b>command must be a string, which
       is enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes (").

       A <b>profile </b>can be specified for each instance domain which
       includes all, some or no instances:

            dbpmda&gt; help profile

            profile indom# [ all | none ]
            profile indom# [ add | delete ] number

            For the instance domain specified, the profile may be changed to
            include 'all' instances, no instances, add an instance or delete
            an instance.

       The <b>watch </b>command (usage: <b>watch </b><i>filename</i> ) opens an xterm window
       which tails the specified log file.  This window must be closed
       by the user when no longer required.

       The <b>wait </b>command is equivalent to <a href="sleep.1.html">sleep(1)</a> and takes a single
       integer argument (wait time in seconds).

       The introduction of dynamic subtrees in the PMNS and
       PMDA_INTERFACE_4 in <i>libpcp_pmda</i> has led to additional commands
       being supported in <b>dbpmda </b>to exercise the associated dynamic PMNS
       services.  The examples below are based on the <i>sample</i> PMDA.

            $ dbpmda
            dbpmda&gt; open pipe /var/lib/pcp/pmdas/sample/pmdasample -d 29
            Start pmdasample PMDA: /var/lib/pcp/pmdas/sample/pmdasample -d 29

            dbpmda&gt; name 29.0.1006

       The <b>children </b>command returns the next name component for all the
       direct descendants of a node within a dynamic subtree of the
       PMNS.  The related <b>traverse </b>command returns the full metric names
       for all leaf nodes in the PMNS below the specified non-leaf node
       in a dynamic subtree of the PMNS.

       The <b>name </b>and <b>pmid </b>commands exercise the translation of metric
       names to PMIDs (and vice versa) for metrics within a dynamic
       subtree of the PMNS.

       If the commands <b>children</b>, <b>traverse</b>, <b>pmid </b>or <b>name </b>are used with a
       PMDA that is <b>not </b>using PMDA_INTERFACE_4 or with performance
       metric names that are not part of a dynamic subtree of the PMNS,
       then the PMDA would be expected to return errors (PM_ERR_NAME or
       PM_ERR_PMID) to reflect the fact that the operation is in error
       (outside a dynamic subtree of the PMNS it is <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and not the
       PMDA that is responsible for implementing these functions).

       Client authentication mechanisms have been incorporated into the
       PMCS, providing per-user (and per-connection) information that is
       available to PMDAs.  A PMDA using PMDA_INTERFACE_6 or later in
       <i>libpcp_pmda</i> is able to make use of the "attribute" method to gain
       visibility into these authenticated connections, with access to
       information including user and group identifiers, user name, and
       so on.  The need to exercise and debug this interface has led to
       a new <b>dbpmda </b>command.  The following example is based on the
       <i>sample</i> PMDA.

            $ dbpmda
            dbpmda&gt; open pipe pmdasample -D AUTH -l logfile
            Start pmdasample PMDA: pmdasample -D AUTH -l logfile
            dbpmda&gt; attr "username" "tanya"
            Attribute: username=tanya
            Success
            dbpmda&gt; attr 11 "0"
            Attribute: userid=0
            Success
            dbpmda&gt;

       The <b>attr </b>command passes connection attributes (PCP_ATTR_XXXX
       keys) and their values into a PMDA in much the same way that PMCD
       would for a client connection.  <b>dbpmda </b>always passes a client
       context identifier of zero, and while no validity checking on
       values is performed only recognised attributes can be set.

       In the example above the <i>AUTH</i> debugging option is set for the
       PMDA, which uses this in its attribute callback and records each
       attribute and value pair sent to it in its <i>logfile</i>.

       Note that authentication checks have already been performed by
       PMCD by the time a PMDA is presented with these attributes, so no
       further verification is necessary by the PMDA.

       The <b>debug </b>command takes one or more debug options separated by
       whitespace or a comma.  This can be used to selectively enable
       debugging output from various modules of the PCP libraries that
       the PMDA will be linked with.  If the option is prefixed by a
       minus ``-'' the corresponding debugging option is disabled.  The
       options are the same debug names as reported by the <b>-l </b>option to
       <a href="pmdbg.1.html">pmdbg(1)</a> and/or their deprecated equivalent numeric values as
       reported by the <b>-ol </b>options to <a href="pmdbg.1.html">pmdbg(1)</a>.  The special ``option''
       <b>none </b>turns all debugging off and the special ``option'' <b>all</b>
       enables all the debugging options.

       <b>dbpmda </b>uses <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and <b>exec</b>(2) to attach to daemon PMDAs.
       <b>dbpmda </b>makes no attempt to detect the termination of the daemon
       PMDA process, so it is possible for a PMDA to exit unexpectedly
       without any notification.  However, any further communication
       attempts with the PMDA will result in errors which will indicate
       that the PMDA is no longer responding.

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
       <a href="../man3/pmgetoptions.3.html">pmGetOptions(3)</a>.
