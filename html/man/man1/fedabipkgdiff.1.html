NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fedabipkgdiff - compare ABIs of Fedora packages

       <b>fedabipkgdiff </b>compares the ABI of shared libraries in <i>Fedora</i>
       packages.  It's a convenient way to do so without having to
       manually download packages from the <i>Fedora Build System</i>.

       <b>fedabipkgdiff </b>knows how to talk with the <i>Fedora Build System</i> to
       find the right packages versions, their associated debug
       information and development packages, download them, compare
       their ABI locally, and report about the possible ABI changes.

       Note that by default, this tool reports ABI changes about types
       that are defined in public header files found in the development
       packages associated with the packages being compared.  It also
       reports ABI changes about functions and global variables whose
       symbols are defined and exported in the ELF binaries found in the
       packages being compared.
</pre> <h2>
INVOCATION </h2>
<pre>
          fedabipkgdiff [option] &lt;NVR&gt; ...
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       fedabipkgdiff loads two default <i>suppression specifications files</i>,
       merges their content and use it to filter out ABI change reports
       that might be considered as false positives to users.

       • Default system-wide suppression specification file

         It's located by the optional environment variable
         LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_SYSTEM_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that
         environment variable is not set, then fedabipkgdiff tries to
         load the suppression file
         $libdir/libabigail/libabigail-default.abignore.  If that file
         is not present, then no default system-wide suppression
         specification file is loaded.

       • Default user suppression specification file.

         It's located by the optional environment
         LIBABIGAIL_DEFAULT_USER_SUPPRESSION_FILE.  If that environment
         variable is not set, then fedabipkgdiff tries to load the
         suppression file $HOME/.abignore.  If that file is not present,
         then no default user suppression specification is loaded.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
          • <b>--help | -h</b>

            Display a short help about the command and exit.

          • <b>--dry-run</b>

            Don't actually perform the ABI comparison.  Details about
            what is going to be done are emitted on standard output.

          • <b>--debug</b>

            Emit debugging messages about the execution of the program.
            Details about each method invocation, including input
            parameters and returned values, are emitted.

          • <b>--traceback</b>

            Show traceback when an exception raised. This is useful for
            developers of the tool itself to know more exceptional
            errors.

          • <b>--server </b>&lt;URL&gt;

            Specifies the URL of the <i>Koji</i> XMLRPC service the tool talks
            to.  The default value of this option is
            <i><a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/kojihub">http://koji.fedoraproject.org/kojihub</a> </i>.

          • <b>--topurl </b>&lt;URL&gt;

            Specifies the URL of the package store the tool downloads
            RPMs from.  The default value of this option is
            <i><a href="https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org">https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org</a> </i>.

          • <b>--from </b>&lt;distro&gt;

            Specifies the name of the baseline <i>Fedora</i> distribution in
            which to find the first <i>build</i> that is used for comparison.
            The <b>distro </b>value can be any valid value of the RPM macro
            <b>%{?dist} </b>for <i>Fedora</i>, for example, <b>fc4</b>, <b>fc23</b>, <b>fc25</b>.

          • <b>--to </b>&lt;distro&gt;

            Specifies the name of the <i>Fedora</i> distribution in which to
            find the <i>build</i> that is compared against the baseline
            specified by option <b>--from</b>.  The <b>distro </b>value could be any
            valid value of the RPM macro <b>%{?dist} </b>for <i>Fedora</i>, for
            example, <b>fc4</b>, <b>fc23</b>.

          • <b>--all-subpackages</b>

            Instructs the tool to also compare the ABI of the binaries
            in the sub-packages of the packages specified.

          • <b>--dso-only</b>

            Compares the ABI of shared libraries only.  If this option
            is not provided, the tool compares the ABI of all ELF
            binaries found in the packages.

          • <b>--suppressions </b>&lt;<i>path-to-suppresions</i>&gt;

            Use a <i>suppression specification</i> file located at
            <i>path-to-suppressions</i>.

          • <b>--no-default-suppression</b>

            Do not load the <i>default suppression specification files</i>.

          • <b>--no-devel-pkg</b>

            Do not take associated development packages into account
            when performing the ABI comparison.  This makes the tool
            report ABI changes about all types that are reachable from
            functions and global variables which symbols are defined and
            publicly exported in the binaries being compared, even if
            those types are not defined in public header files available
            from the packages being compared.

          • <b>--show-identical-binaries</b>
              Show the names of the all binaries compared, including the
              binaries whose ABI compare equal.  By default, when this
              option is not provided, only binaries with ABI changes are
              mentionned in the output.

          • <b>--abipkgdiff </b>&lt;path/to/abipkgdiff&gt;

            Specify an alternative abipkgdiff instead of the one
            installed in system.

          • <b>--clean-cache-before</b>

            Clean cache before ABI comparison.

          • <b>--clean-cache-after</b>

            Clean cache after ABI comparison.

          • <b>--clean-cache</b>

            If you want to clean cache both before and after ABI
            comparison, <b>--clean-cache </b>is the convenient way for you to
            save typing of two options at same time.

       Note that a build is a specific version and release of an RPM
       package.  It's specified by its the package name, version and
       release. These are specified by the <i>Fedora Naming Guidelines</i>
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       The exit code of the <b>abipkgdiff </b>command is either 0 if the ABI of
       the binaries compared are equivalent, or non-zero if they differ
       or if the tool encountered an error.

       In the later case, the value of the exit code is the same as for
       the <i>abidiff tool</i>.
</pre> <h2>
USE CASES </h2>
<pre>
       Below are some usage examples currently supported by
       <b>fedabipkgdiff</b>.

          1. Compare the ABI of binaries in a local package against the
             ABI of the latest stable package in <i>Fedora</i> 23.

             Suppose you have built just built the <b>httpd </b>package and you
             want to compare the ABI of the binaries in this locally
             built package against the ABI of the binaries in the latest
             <b>http </b>build from <i>Fedora</i> 23.  The command line invocation
             would be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff --from fc23 ./httpd-2.4.18-2.fc24.x86_64.rpm

          2. Compare the ABI of binaries in two local packages.

             Suppose you have built two versions of package httpd, and
             you want to see what ABI differences between these two
             versions of RPM files. The command line invocation would
             be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff path/to/httpd-2.4.23-3.fc23.x86_64.rpm another/path/to/httpd-2.4.23-4.fc24.x86_64.rpm

             All what fedabipkgdiff does happens on local machine
             without the need of querying or downloading RPMs from Koji.

          3. Compare the ABI of binaries in the latest build of the
             <b>httpd </b>package in <b>Fedora 23 </b>against the ABI of the binaries
             in the latest build of the same package in 24.

             In this case, note that neither of the two packages are
             available locally.  The tool is going to talk with the
             <i>Fedora Build System</i>, determine what the versions and
             releases of the latest packages are, download them and
             perform the comparison locally.  The command line
             invocation would be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff --from fc23 --to fc24 httpd

          4. Compare the ABI of binaries of two builds of the <b>httpd</b>
             package, designated their versions and releases.

             If we want to do perform the ABI comparison for all the
             processor architectures supported by <i>Fedora</i> the command
             line invocation would be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff httpd-2.8.14.fc23 httpd-2.8.14.fc24

             But if we want to perform the ABI comparison for a specific
             architecture, say, x86_64, then the command line invocation
             would be:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff httpd-2.8.14.fc23.x86_64 httpd-2.8.14.fc24.x86_64

          5. If the use wants to also compare the sub-packages of a
             given package, she can use the --all-subpackages option.
             The first command of the previous example would thus look
             like:

                 $ fedabipkgdiff --all-subpackages httpd-2.8.14.fc23 httpd-2.8.14.fc24
