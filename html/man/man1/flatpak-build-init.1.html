NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-build-init - Initialize a build directory
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak build-init </b>[OPTION...] DIRECTORY APPNAME SDK RUNTIME
                          [BRANCH]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Initializes a separate build directory.  DIRECTORY is the name of
       the directory.  APPNAME is the application id of the app that
       will be built.  SDK and RUNTIME specify the sdk and runtime that
       the application should be built against and run in.  BRANCH
       specify the version of sdk and runtime

       Initializes a directory as build directory which can be used as
       target directory of <b>flatpak build</b>. It creates a metadata inside
       the given directory. Additionally, empty files and var
       subdirectories are created.

       It is an error to run build-init on a directory that has already
       been initialized as a build directory.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>--arch=ARCH</b>
           The architecture to use. See <b>flatpak --supported-arches </b>for
           architectures supported by the host.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--var=RUNTIME</b>
           Initialize var from the named runtime.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--writable-sdk</b>
           Initialize /usr with a copy of the sdk, which is writable
           during flatpak build. This can be used if you need to install
           build tools in /usr during the build. This is stored in the
           usr subdirectory of the app dir, but will not be part of the
           final app.

       <b>--tag=TAG</b>
           Add a tag to the metadata file. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--sdk-extension=EXTENSION</b>
           When using <b>--writable-sdk</b>, in addition to the sdk, also
           install the specified extension. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--extension=NAME=VARIABLE[=VALUE]</b>
           Add extension point info.

       <b>--sdk-dir</b>
           Specify a custom subdirectory to use instead of usr for
           <b>--writable-sdk</b>.

       <b>--update</b>
           Re-initialize the sdk and var, don't fail if already
           initialized.

       <b>--base=APP</b>
           Initialize the application with files from another specified
           application.

       <b>--base-version=VERSION</b>
           Specify the version to use for <b>--base</b>. If not specified, will
           default to "master".

       <b>--base-extension=EXTENSION</b>
           When using <b>--base</b>, also install the specified extension from
           the app. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--type=TYPE</b>
           This can be used to build different types of things. The
           default is "app" which is a regular app, but "runtime"
           creates a runtime based on an existing runtime, and
           "extension" creates an extension for an app or runtime.

       <b>--extension-tag=EXTENSION_TAG</b>
           If building an extension, the tag to use when searching for
           the mount point of the extension.

       <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
