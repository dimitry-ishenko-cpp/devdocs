NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmieconf </b>- display and set configurable pmie rule variables
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmieconf </b>[<b>-cFv?</b>]  [<b>-f </b><i>file</i>] [<b>-r </b><i>rulepath</i>] [<i>command</i> [<i>args...</i>]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmieconf </b>is a utility for viewing and configuring variables from
       generalized <a href="pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> rules.  The set of generalized rules is read
       in from <i>rulepath</i>, and the output <i>file</i> produced by <b>pmieconf </b>is a
       valid input file for <b>pmie</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-c   </b>When run from automated <b>pmie </b>setup processes, this option is
            used to add a specific message and timestamp indicating that
            this is the case.  Unless over-ridden by the <b>-f </b>flag, the
            default configuration file to be written or updated when the
            <b>-c </b>flag is given and <b>pmieconf </b>is run by the root user, is
            <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmie/config.default</i>.  This is also the
            default configuration file used by the <b>pmie </b>service, see
            <a href="pmie_daily.1.html">pmie_daily(1)</a>.  This flag is not appropriate when using the
            tool interactively.

       <b>-f </b><i>file</i>, <b>--config</b>=<i>file</i>
            Any rule modifications resulting from <b>pmieconf </b>manipulation
            of variable values will be written to <i>file</i>.  The default
            value of <i>file</i> is dependent on the user ID - for the root
            user (when the <b>-c </b>flag is <b>not </b>also given, see above) the
            file is <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmie/config.default</i>.  For other
            users the default is <i>$HOME/.pcp/pmie/config.pmie</i>.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--force</b>
            Forces the <b>pmieconf </b>output <i>file</i> to be created (or updated),
            after which <b>pmieconf </b>immediately exits.

       <b>-r </b><i>rulepath</i>, <b>--rules</b>=<i>rulepath</i>
            Allows the source of generalized <b>pmie </b>rules to be changed -
            <i>rulepath</i> is a colon-delimited list of <a href="../man5/pmieconf.5.html">pmieconf(5)</a> rule files
            and/or subdirectories.  The default value for <i>rulepath</i> is
            <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmieconf</i>.  Use of this option overrides
            the <b>PMIECONF_PATH </b>environment variable which has a similar
            function.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            Enable verbose mode.  associated variables will be
            displayed.  This is the complete list of variables which
            affects any given rule (by default, global variables are not
            displayed with the rule).

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.

       The <b>pmieconf </b><i>command</i>s allow information related to the various
       rules and configurable variables to be displayed or modified.  If
       no <b>pmieconf </b><i>command</i>s are presented on the command line, <b>pmieconf</b>
       prompts for <i>command</i>s interactively.
</pre> <h2>
COMMAND LANGUAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pmieconf </b><i>command</i> language is described here:

       <b>help  [ { . | all | global | &lt;rule&gt; | &lt;group&gt; } [&lt;variable&gt;] ]</b>
               Without arguments, the <b>help </b>command displays the syntax
               for all of the available <b>pmieconf </b>commands.  With one
               argument, a description of one or more of the generalized
               rules is displayed.  With two arguments, a description of
               a specific variable relating to one or more of the
               generalized rules is displayed.

       <b>rules  [ enabled | disabled ]</b>
               Display the name and short summary for all of the
               generalized rules found on <i>rulepath</i>.  Each of the rule
               names can be used in place of the keyword <b>&lt;rule&gt; </b>in this
               command syntax description.  The <b>enabled </b>and <b>disabled</b>
               options can be used to filter the set of rules displayed
               to just those which are enabled or disabled respectfully.

       <b>groups  </b>Display the name of all of the rule groups that were
               found on <i>rulepath</i>.  Each of the group names can be used
               in place of the keyword <b>&lt;group&gt; </b>in this command syntax
               description, which applies the command to all rules
               within the rule group.

       <b>status  </b>Display status information relating to the current
               <b>pmieconf </b>session, including a list of running <b>pmie</b>
               processes which are currently using <i>file</i>.

       <b>enable  { . | all | &lt;rule&gt; | &lt;group&gt; }</b>
               Enables the specified rule or group of rules.  An enabled
               rule is one which will be included in the <b>pmie</b>
               configuration file generated by <b>pmieconf</b>.  Any enabled
               "actions" will be appended to the rule's "predicate", in
               a manner conforming to the <b>pmie </b>syntax ("actions" can be
               viewed using the <b>list global </b>command, described below).

       <b>disable  { . | all | &lt;rule&gt; | &lt;group&gt; }</b>
               Disables the specified rule or group of rules.  If the
               rule was previously enabled, it will be removed from the
               <b>pmie </b>configuration file generated by <b>pmieconf</b>, and hence
               no longer evaluated when <b>pmie </b>is restarted (using
               <b>pmieconf </b>does not affect any existing <b>pmie </b>processes
               using <i>file</i>).

       <b>list  { . | all | global | &lt;rule&gt; | &lt;group&gt; } [&lt;variable&gt;]</b>
               Display the values for a specific rule variable; or for
               all variables of a rule, a rule group, all rules, or the
               global variables.

       <b>modify  { . | all | global | &lt;rule&gt; | &lt;group&gt; } &lt;variable&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
               Enable, disable, or otherwise change the value for one or
               more rule variables.  This value must be consistent with
               the type of the variable, which can be inferred from the
               format of the printed value - e.g. strings will be
               enclosed in double-quotes, percentages have the ``%''
               symbol appended, etc.  Note that certain rule variables
               cannot be modified through <b>pmieconf </b>- "predicate" and
               "help", for example.

       <b>undo  { . | all | global | &lt;rule&gt; | &lt;group&gt; } [&lt;variable&gt;]</b>
               Applicable only to a variable whose value has been
               modified - this <i>command</i> simply reverts to the default
               value for the given variable.

       <b>quit    </b>Save any changes made to <i>file</i> and then exit <b>pmieconf</b>.

       <b>abort   </b>Exit <b>pmieconf </b>immediately without saving any changes to
               <i>file</i>.

       Each of the commands above can be shortened by simply using the
       first character of the command name, and also ``?'' for help.

       Use of the <b>all </b>keyword causes the command to be applied to all of
       the rules.  The <b>global </b>keyword refers to those variables which
       are applied to every rule.  Such variables can be changed either
       globally or locally, for example:

         pmieconf&gt; modify global delta "5 minutes"
         pmieconf&gt; modify memory delta "1 minute"

       causes all rules to now be evaluated once every five minutes,
       except for rules in the "memory" group which are to be evaluated
       once per minute.

       The ``.'' character is special to <b>pmieconf </b>- it refers to the
       last successfully used value of <b>all</b>, <b>global</b>, <b>&lt;rule&gt; </b>or <b>&lt;group&gt;</b>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Specify that all of the rules in the "memory" group should be
       evaluated:

         pmieconf&gt; modify memory enabled yes

       Change your mind, and revert to using only the "memory" rules
       which were enabled by default:

         pmieconf&gt; undo memory enabled

       Specify that notification of rules which evaluate to true should
       be sent to <b>syslogd</b>(1):

         pmieconf&gt; modify global syslog_action yes

       Specify that rules in the "per_cpu" group should use a different
       holdoff value to other rules:

         pmieconf&gt; help global holdoff
           rule: global  [generic parameters applied to all rules]
            var: holdoff
           help: Once the predicate is true and the action is executed,
              this variable allows suppression of further action
              execution until the specified interval has elapsed.
              A value of zero enables execution of the action if
              the rule predicate is true at the next sample. Default
              units are seconds and common units are "second", "sec",
              "minute", "min" and "hour".

         pmieconf&gt; modify per_cpu holdoff "1 hour"

       Lower the threshold associated with a particular variable for a
       specified rule:

         pmieconf&gt; l cpu.syscall predicate
           rule: cpu.syscall  [High aggregate system call rate]
             predicate =
                  some_host (
                   ( kernel.all.syscall $hosts$ )
                     &gt; $threshold$ count/sec * hinv.ncpu $hosts$
                  )

         pmieconf&gt; m . threshold 7000

         pmieconf&gt; l . threshold
           rule: cpu.syscall  [High aggregate system call rate]
                threshold = 7000

ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The environment variable <b>PMIECONF_PATH </b>has a similar function to

       no <b>-r </b>option is presented.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
