NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rsync-ssl - a helper script for connecting to an ssl rsync daemon
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       rsync-ssl [--type=SSL_TYPE] RSYNC_ARGS

       The online version of this manpage (that includes cross-linking
       of topics) is available at 
       ⟨<a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync-ssl.1">https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync-ssl.1</a>⟩.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The rsync-ssl script helps you to run an rsync copy to/from an
       rsync daemon that requires ssl connections.

       The script requires that you specify an rsync-daemon arg in the
       style of either <b>hostname:: </b>(with 2 colons) or <b>rsync://hostname/</b>.
       The default port used for connecting is 874 (one higher than the
       normal 873) unless overridden in the environment.  You can
       specify an overriding port via <b>--port </b>or by including it in the
       normal spot in the URL format, though both of those require your
       rsync version to be at least 3.2.0.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>first </b>arg is a <b>--type=SSL_TYPE </b>option, the script will
       only use that particular program to open an ssl connection
       instead of trying to find an openssl or stunnel executable via a
       simple heuristic (assuming that the <b>RSYNC_SSL_TYPE </b>environment
       variable is not set as well -- see below).  This option must
       specify one of <b>openssl </b>or <b>stunnel</b>.  The equal sign is required
       for this particular option.

       All the other options are passed through to the rsync command, so
       consult the <a href="rsync.1.html">rsync(1)</a> manpage for more information on how it
       works.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The ssl helper scripts are affected by the following environment
       variables:

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_TYPE</b>
              Specifies the program type that should be used to open the
              ssl connection.  It must be one of <b>openssl </b>or <b>stunnel</b>.
              The <b>--type=SSL_TYPE </b>option overrides this, when specified.

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_PORT</b>
              If specified, the value is the port number that is used as
              the default when the user does not specify a port in their
              rsync command.  When not specified, the default port
              number is 874.  (Note that older rsync versions (prior to
              3.2.0) did not communicate an overriding port number value
              to the helper script.)

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_CERT</b>
              If specified, the value is a filename that contains a
              certificate to use for the connection.

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_KEY</b>
              If specified, the value is a filename that contains a key
              for the provided certificate to use for the connection.

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_CA_CERT</b>
              If specified, the value is a filename that contains a
              certificate authority certificate that is used to validate
              the connection.

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_OPENSSL</b>
              Specifies the openssl executable to run when the
              connection type is set to openssl.  If unspecified, the
              $PATH is searched for "openssl".

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_GNUTLS</b>
              Specifies the gnutls-cli executable to run when the
              connection type is set to gnutls.  If unspecified, the
              $PATH is searched for "gnutls-cli".

       <b>RSYNC_SSL_STUNNEL</b>
              Specifies the stunnel executable to run when the
              connection type is set to stunnel.  If unspecified, the
              $PATH is searched first for "stunnel4" and then for
              "stunnel".
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
           rsync-ssl -aiv example.com::mod/ dest

           rsync-ssl --type=openssl -aiv example.com::mod/ dest

           rsync-ssl -aiv --port 9874 example.com::mod/ dest

           rsync-ssl -aiv rsync://example.com:9874/mod/ dest

THE SERVER SIDE </h2>
<pre>
       For help setting up an SSL/TLS supporting rsync, see the
       instructions in rsyncd.conf.

</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       Note that using an stunnel connection requires at least version 4
       of stunnel, which should be the case on modern systems.  Also, it
       does not verify a connection against the CA certificate
       collection, so it only encrypts the connection without any cert
       validation unless you have specified the certificate environment
       options.

       This script also supports a <b>--type=gnutls </b>option, but at the time
       of this release the gnutls-cli command was dropping output,
       making it unusable.  If that bug has been fixed in your version,
       feel free to put gnutls into an exported RSYNC_SSL_TYPE
       environment variable to make its use the default.
