</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogctl </b>may be used to manage <i>non-primary</i> instances of the
       Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archiver <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  This would be
       most relevant in a PCP archiver ``farm'' where many <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
       instances would be creating archives of performance data
       collected from <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on many remote hosts.

       The <i>primary</i> <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance is closely linked to the local
       <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> process and as a consequence shares the same control
       infrastructure, namely <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> or the PCP <a href="init.1.html">init(1)</a> ``rc
       scripts''.  This is why the <i>primary</i> <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance <i>cannot</i>
       be managed with <b>pmlogctl</b>.

       For brevity in the description below, the term ``instance'' means
       a <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance.

       All instances managed by <b>pmlogctl</b>, <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> and
       <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> abide by the following rules:

       1. Each instance is fetching performance data from a single
          <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> (i.e. one host), but each <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> may be providing
          performance data to zero, one or more <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> processes
          running on one or more hosts.

       2. On the local host, each <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance must be specified
          once in a <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> control file and <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
          creates archives in a unique directory, named in the 4th
          parameter of the associated control file entry (see the
          CONFIGURATION section of <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>).

       3. Each instance belongs to exactly one <b>class</b>, optionally named
          using a <b>$class=...  </b>assignment in the associated control file.
          The special <b>default </b>class is reserved for all instances that
          do not have an associated <b>$class=...  </b>assignment.  For
          reporting purposes (refer to the <b>summary </b>command below), the
          <i>primary</i> <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instance is automatically assigned to the
          special <b>primary </b>class.

       Each <b>pmlogctl </b>execution manages one or more instances updating
       the associated control files and then running <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>
       to effect the desired change.

       The <i>host</i> arguments are usually valid host names.  For all
       commands <i>except</i> <b>create </b>and <b>cond-create </b>(described below) the <i>host</i>
       arguments may also be <b>egrep</b>(1) regular expressions that match the
       <i>whole</i> of a valid host name, so the pattern used is actually
       <b>^</b><i>host</i><b>$</b>.  For example <b>foo.*  </b>(matches all host names beginning
       with ``foo'') or <b>.*foo </b>(matches all host names ending with
       ``foo'') or <b>.*[fF][oO][oO].*  </b>(matches all host names containing
       ``foo'' in upper, lower or mixed case).

       The combination of a <i>class</i> from the optional <b>-c </b>option (or
       <b>default</b>) and the <i>host</i> arguments to each <i>command</i> identifies a
       <i>target of set</i> instances to which the <i>command</i> operation should be
       applied.

       The <b>-i </b>option may be used with the <b>create </b>or <b>cond-create </b>commands
       to override the instance identity that is specified in the ident
       section of the class policy file (see the CLASS POLICY FILE
       section below).  Since the identifier must be unique across all
       instances and all classes, it only makes sense to use this option
       when there is a single <i>host</i> argument.

       Given the tasks that <b>pmlogctl </b>is undertaking it usually must be
       run as ``root'', the exceptions being the <b>status </b>command or when
       the <b>-N </b>option is specified.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>command</i> is one of the following:

       <b>check</b>
           Check the status of all currently configured pmlogger
           instances and restart any that have failed.  If the <b>-m </b>flag
           is given on systemd(1) platforms, also migrate matching (and
           new) processes to the <b>pmlogger_farm </b>service.

       <b>create</b>
           Create new instances in the class <i>classname</i> (<b>default </b>by
           default) for the <i>host</i> hosts.  The name of the class is used
           to identify a class policy file (see the CLASS POLICY FILE
           section below) which provides a template for each new control
           file with <b>%h </b>replaced by <i>host</i> and <b>%i </b>replaced by the
           instance's (unique) identifier from the ident section of the
           class policy file or <i>ident</i> from the <b>-i </b>option.

           The <b>-p </b>option may be used to identify a class policy file
           other than the one found in the standard place, i.e.
           <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/class.d/classname</i>.

           At least one <i>host</i> must be specified for the <b>create </b>command.

       <b>cond-create</b>
           Similar to <b>create </b>but the instance will only be created if
           one of the conditions in the create section of associated
           class policy file(s) evaluates to true.

           If a <b>-c </b>option is specified, then only the class <i>classname</i>
           will be considered, otherwise <b>all </b>classes will be considered.
           In the latter case, if none of the conditions in any of the
           classes evaluates to true, the the special <b>pmfind </b>class is
           used (this is the ``default'' class for the <b>cond-create</b>
           command when all else fails).

           If more than one class evaluates to true then a composite
           <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> configuration file is created and the instance is
           also assigned to the special <b>pmfind </b>class.  The composite
           configuration file may contain a mix of explicit
           configuration clauses and the more general conditional
           configuration clauses as understood by the <a href="pmlogconf.1.html">pmlogconf(1)</a> tool.

       <b>start</b>
           Start the target set of instances.

           If the target set intentionally contains more than one
           instance, then the <b>-a </b>option should be used (this is designed
           to reduce the risk of accidentally starting a potentially
           large number of <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> processes).

           If an instance in the target set is already started, no
           change is made (see the <b>restart </b>command to force new
           instances to be launched).

       <b>stop</b>
           Stop the target set of instances.

           If the target set intentionally contains more than one
           instance, then the <b>-a </b>option should be used (this is designed
           to reduce the risk of accidentally stopping a potentially
           large number of <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> processes).

           If an instance in the target set is already stopped, no
           change is made but a warning is issued.

       <b>restart</b>
           Stop and then start the target set of instances.

           If the target set intentionally contains more than one
           instance, then the <b>-a </b>option should be used (this is designed
           to reduce the risk of accidentally stopping and starting a
           potentially large number of <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> processes).

           If an instance in the target set is already stopped, a
           warning is issued before the instance is started.

       <b>status</b>
           Report the status of the target set of instances.  If there
           is no <b>-c </b>option specified and no <i>host</i> arguments, i.e. the
           target set is empty, then <i>all</i> instances will be reported.

       <b>destroy</b>
           Destroy the target set of instances.  At the end of this
           operation the associated <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> processes will have been
           stopped and the relevant control file information removed.

           If the target set intentionally contains more than one
           instance, then the <b>-a </b>option should be used (this is designed
           to reduce the risk of accidentally terminating a potentially
           large number of <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> processes and removing their
           <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> configurations).

           The policy file linked to the class of an instance to be
           destroyed may contain a <b>destroy </b>section that may influence if
           and how the destroy operation should be performed.  This may
           require a <b>-p </b>option to find the associated class policy file.

           The class policy checking can be by-passed using the <b>-f</b>
           (force) command line option.
</pre> <h2>
CLASS POLICY FILE </h2>
<pre>
       A class policy file contains a number of sections, each section
       begins with a line that simply starts with the name of the
       section followed enclosed by ``['' and ``]''.

       Lines beginning with a hash (#) are treated as comments and
       ignored.  Blank or empty lines are also ignored.

       The typical location of the policy file for the class <i>foo</i> is
       <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/class.d/foo</i>.

       <b>[class]</b>
           The optional class name section names the class.  If it is
           missing, the name of the policy file (stripped of any
           directory prefix) is used as the name of the class.

       <b>[ident]</b>
           The ident section specifies the template to be used for the
           instance identifier to be given to each member of the class.
           This identifier needs to be unique across all instances and
           all classes, and it needs to be a valid file name in the
           local filesystem, so would normally contain the class name
           and the macro <b>%h</b>, e.g. <b>foo-%h</b>.  The macro is replaced by the
           <i>host</i> when each instance is created.

       <b>[control]</b>
           The control section consists of one or more lines of template
           text that will be used to create the control file for each
           instance.  This must at least include the <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>
           control line to specify how to start the associated
           <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> process; this line contains fields separated by
           white space as follows:
           1.  the hostname, usually the macro <b>%h</b>
           2.  <b>n </b>to indicate this is a non-primary instance
           3.  the ``socks'' flag, typically <b>n</b>
           4.  the directory in which the <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> archives will be
               created; this needs to be unique and is usually specified
               using the <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> macro <b>PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR </b>as the
               start of the path, followed by the instance identifier,
               usually the macro <b>%i</b>, e.g. <b>PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/%i</b>
           5.  additional parameters to <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> which probably
               include at least a <b>-c </b>option to provide a configuration
               file that describes which metrics should be logged for
               instances of this class, which may be the same for all
               instances in this class, or it may include the <b>%i </b>macro
               to use a different configuration file for each instance.
               Note that if this configuration file does not exist, it
               will be created using <a href="pmlogconf.1.html">pmlogconf(1)</a> the first time
               <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> is run.

           <i>Before</i> the control line there should be a line that defines
           the version of the control line that follows, i.e.
           <b>$version=1.1</b>
           If this is missing, <b>pmlogctl </b>will assume the version is 1.1
           and insert the line when the instance is created.

           <b>pmlogctl </b>will also add the class name during creation. e.g.
           <b>$class=foo</b>

       <b>[create]</b>
           The create section defines the conditions that must be met
           before an instance will be created with the <b>cond-create</b>
           command.  The intent is to allow different decisions to be
           made when a new host running <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> is discovered, e.g. by
           <a href="pmfind.1.html">pmfind(1)</a>.

           Each non-blank line in the create section is a condition of
           the form <i>function</i>(<i>arg</i>), where <i>function</i> is one of the
           following:

           <i>exists</i>
               <i>arg</i> is the name of a performance metric and <i>exits</i>
               evaluates to true if that metric exists in the
               Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) on the remote host

           <i>values</i>
               <i>arg</i> is the name of a performance metric in the remote
               PMNS and <i>values</i> evaluates to true if some instance of
               that metric has a value on the remote host

           <i>condition</i>
               <i>arg</i> is a derived metric expression in the format
               supported by <a href="../man3/pmregisterderived.3.html">pmRegisterDerived(3)</a>, and <i>condition</i>
               evaluates to true if the value of that expression on the
               remote host is greater than zero

           <i>hostname</i>
               <i>arg</i> is a regular expression in the style of <b>egrep</b>(1) and
               <i>hostname</i> evaluates to true if the remote host name
               matches <i>arg</i>

       <b>[destroy]</b>
           The destroy section defines the policy to be applied when an
           instance is destroyed.

           The intent is to allow different decisions to be made when
           discovery service, e.g.  <a href="pmfind.1.html">pmfind(1)</a>, notices that a host
           associated with an instance is no longer present.  But in the
           current version this is not implemented and the destroy
           section syntax and semantics is not yet defined.

       A sample class policy file is as follows:

           # policy file for the foo class
           [class]
           foo
           [ident]
           foo-%h

           [control]
           $version=1.1
           %h n n PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/%i -c foo-metrics.config

           [create]
           # matches all hosts
           hostname(.*)

           [destroy]
           # still to be defined
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
            Apply action to all matching instances.  By default only one
            instance definition is expected and acted upon.

       <b>-c </b><i>class</i>, <b>--class</b>=<i>class</i>
            Set the name of the class for which <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instances
            belong to as <i>class</i>.

       <b>-C </b><i>check_args</i>, <b>--checkargs</b>=<i>check_args</i>
            <i>check_args</i> are additional command line arguments for
            <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a> when it is called.  This is most useful
            for options like <b>-V</b>.  Multiple <b>-C </b>options may be used and
            the various <i>check_args</i> options will be accumulated and all
            passed to <a href="pmlogger_check.1.html">pmlogger_check(1)</a>.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
            Force action if possible.

       <b>-i </b><i>ident</i>, <b>--ident</b>=<i>ident</i>
            Override instance identifier with <i>ident</i>.  This option
            applies only for the commands <b>create </b>and <b>cond-create</b>.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--showme</b>
            Runs <b>pmlogctl </b>in a ``show me'' or ``dry run'' mode where the
            intent of the command is shown, but no changes are made.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--migrate</b>
            When used with the <b>create </b>or <b>check </b>commands on <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>
            platforms, also migrate new or existing non-primary <b>pmlogger</b>
            processes to the <b>pmlogger_farm </b>service.  This is normally
            done automatically by the <b>pmlogger_farm_check </b>service, which
            is timer driven (so there may be a few minutes delay before
            automatic migration is initiated).

       <b>-p </b><i>policy</i>, <b>--policy</b>=<i>policy</i>
            Use <i>policy</i> as the class policy file.  Defaults to
            <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmlogger/class.d/&lt;class&gt;</i>.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            Enable verbose mode.  Using this option twice increases
            verbosity.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
