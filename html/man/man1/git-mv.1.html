NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-mv - Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git mv</i> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;source&gt;... &lt;destination&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Move or rename a file, directory, or symlink.

           git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;
           git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] &lt;source&gt; ... &lt;destination-directory&gt;

       In the first form, it renames &lt;source&gt;, which must exist and be
       either a file, symlink or directory, to &lt;destination&gt;. In the
       second form, the last argument has to be an existing directory;
       the given sources will be moved into this directory.

       The index is updated after successful completion, but the change
       must still be committed.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -f, --force
           Force renaming or moving of a file even if the &lt;destination&gt;
           exists.

       -k
           Skip move or rename actions which would lead to an error
           condition. An error happens when a source is neither existing
           nor controlled by Git, or when it would overwrite an existing
           file unless <b>-f </b>is given.

       -n, --dry-run
           Do nothing; only show what would happen

       -v, --verbose
           Report the names of files as they are moved.
</pre> <h2>
SUBMODULES </h2>
<pre>
       Moving a submodule using a gitfile (which means they were cloned
       with a Git version 1.7.8 or newer) will update the gitfile and
       core.worktree setting to make the submodule work in the new
       location. It also will attempt to update the
       submodule.&lt;name&gt;.path setting in the <a href="../man5/gitmodules.5.html">gitmodules(5)</a> file and stage
       that file (unless -n is used).
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Each time a superproject update moves a populated submodule (e.g.
       when switching between commits before and after the move) a stale
       submodule checkout will remain in the old location and an empty
       directory will appear in the new location. To populate the
       submodule again in the new location the user will have to run
       "git submodule update" afterwards. Removing the old directory is
       only safe when it uses a gitfile, as otherwise the history of the
       submodule will be deleted too. Both steps will be obsolete when
       recursive submodule update has been implemented.
