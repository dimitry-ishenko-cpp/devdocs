DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If no <i>option</i>s or <i>argument</i>s are specified, <i>set</i> shall write the
       names and values of all shell variables in the collation sequence
       of the current locale. Each <i>name</i> shall start on a separate line,
       using the format:

           "%s=%s\n", &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>value</i>&gt;

       The <i>value</i> string shall be written with appropriate quoting; see
       the description of shell quoting in <i>Section 2.2</i>, <i>Quoting</i>.  The
       output shall be suitable for reinput to the shell, setting or
       resetting, as far as possible, the variables that are currently
       set; read-only variables cannot be reset.

       When options are specified, they shall set or unset attributes of
       the shell, as described below. When <i>argument</i>s are specified, they
       cause positional parameters to be set or unset, as described
       below. Setting or unsetting attributes and positional parameters
       are not necessarily related actions, but they can be combined in
       a single invocation of <i>set</i>.

       The <i>set</i> special built-in shall support the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>
       except that options can be specified with either a leading
       &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (meaning enable the option) or &lt;plus-sign&gt;
       (meaning disable it) unless otherwise specified.

       Implementations shall support the options in the following list
       in both their &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; and &lt;plus-sign&gt; forms. These options
       can also be specified as options to <i>sh</i>.

       <b>-a    </b>When this option is on, the <i>export</i> attribute shall be set
             for each variable to which an assignment is performed; see
             the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 4.23</i>,
             <i>Variable Assignment</i>.  If the assignment precedes a utility
             name in a command, the <i>export</i> attribute shall not persist
             in the current execution environment after the utility
             completes, with the exception that preceding one of the
             special built-in utilities causes the <i>export</i> attribute to
             persist after the built-in has completed. If the assignment
             does not precede a utility name in the command, or if the
             assignment is a result of the operation of the <i>getopts</i> or
             <i>read</i> utilities, the <i>export</i> attribute shall persist until
             the variable is unset.

       <b>-b    </b>This option shall be supported if the implementation
             supports the User Portability Utilities option. It shall
             cause the shell to notify the user asynchronously of
             background job completions. The following message is
             written to standard error:

                 "[%d]%c %s%s\n", &lt;<i>job-number</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>current</i>&gt;, &lt;status&gt;, &lt;job-name&gt;

             where the fields shall be as follows:

             &lt;<i>current</i>&gt;   The character <b>'+' </b>identifies the job that would
                         be used as a default for the <i>fg</i> or <i>bg</i>
                         utilities; this job can also be specified using
                         the <i>job_id</i> <b>"%+" </b>or <b>"%%"</b>.  The character <b>'-'</b>
                         identifies the job that would become the
                         default if the current default job were to
                         exit; this job can also be specified using the
                         <i>job_id</i> <b>"%-"</b>.  For other jobs, this field is a
                         &lt;space&gt;.  At most one job can be identified
                         with <b>'+' </b>and at most one job can be identified
                         with <b>'-'</b>.  If there is any suspended job, then
                         the current job shall be a suspended job. If
                         there are at least two suspended jobs, then the
                         previous job also shall be a suspended job.

             &lt;<i>job-number</i>&gt;
                         A number that can be used to identify the
                         process group to the <i>wait</i>, <i>fg</i>, <i>bg</i>, and <i>kill</i>
                         utilities. Using these utilities, the job can
                         be identified by prefixing the job number with
                         <b>'%'</b>.

             &lt;<i>status</i>&gt;    Unspecified.

             &lt;<i>job-name</i>&gt;  Unspecified.

             When the shell notifies the user a job has been completed,
             it may remove the job's process ID from the list of those
             known in the current shell execution environment; see
             <i>Section 2.9.3.1</i>, <i>Examples</i>.  Asynchronous notification shall
             not be enabled by default.

       <b>-C    </b>(Uppercase C.) Prevent existing files from being
             overwritten by the shell's <b>'&gt;' </b>redirection operator (see
             <i>Section 2.7.2</i>, <i>Redirecting Output</i>); the <b>"&gt;|" </b>redirection
             operator shall override this <i>noclobber</i> option for an
             individual file.

       <b>-e    </b>When this option is on, when any command fails (for any of
             the reasons listed in <i>Section 2.8.1</i>, <i>Consequences of Shell</i>
             <i>Errors</i> or by returning an exit status greater than zero),
             the shell immediately shall exit, as if by executing the
             <i>exit</i> special built-in utility with no arguments, with the
             following exceptions:

              1. The failure of any individual command in a multi-
                 command pipeline shall not cause the shell to exit.
                 Only the failure of the pipeline itself shall be
                 considered.

              2. The <b>-e </b>setting shall be ignored when executing the
                 compound list following the <b>while</b>, <b>until</b>, <b>if</b>, or <b>elif</b>
                 reserved word, a pipeline beginning with the <b>!</b>
                 reserved word, or any command of an AND-OR list other
                 than the last.

              3. If the exit status of a compound command other than a
                 subshell command was the result of a failure while <b>-e</b>
                 was being ignored, then <b>-e </b>shall not apply to this
                 command.

             This requirement applies to the shell environment and each
             subshell environment separately. For example, in:

                 set -e; (false; echo one) | cat; echo two

             the <i>false</i> command causes the subshell to exit without
             executing <i>echo one</i>; however, <i>echo two</i> is executed because
             the exit status of the pipeline <i>(false; echo one) | cat</i> is
             zero.

       <b>-f    </b>The shell shall disable pathname expansion.

       <b>-h    </b>Locate and remember utilities invoked by functions as those
             functions are defined (the utilities are normally located
             when the function is executed).

       <b>-m    </b>This option shall be supported if the implementation
             supports the User Portability Utilities option. All jobs
             shall be run in their own process groups. Immediately
             before the shell issues a prompt after completion of the
             background job, a message reporting the exit status of the
             background job shall be written to standard error. If a
             foreground job stops, the shell shall write a message to
             standard error to that effect, formatted as described by
             the <i>jobs</i> utility. In addition, if a job changes status
             other than exiting (for example, if it stops for input or
             output or is stopped by a SIGSTOP signal), the shell shall
             write a similar message immediately prior to writing the
             next prompt. This option is enabled by default for
             interactive shells.

       <b>-n    </b>The shell shall read commands but does not execute them;
             this can be used to check for shell script syntax errors.
             An interactive shell may ignore this option.

       <b>-o    </b>Write the current settings of the options to standard
             output in an unspecified format.

       <b>+o    </b>Write the current option settings to standard output in a
             format that is suitable for reinput to the shell as
             commands that achieve the same options settings.

       <b>-o </b><i>option</i>
             This option is supported if the system supports the User
             Portability Utilities option. It shall set various options,
             many of which shall be equivalent to the single option
             letters. The following values of <i>option</i> shall be supported:

             <i>allexport</i> Equivalent to <b>-a</b>.

             <i>errexit</i>   Equivalent to <b>-e</b>.

             <i>ignoreeof</i> Prevent an interactive shell from exiting on end-
                       of-file. This setting prevents accidental logouts
                       when &lt;control&gt;‐D is entered. A user shall
                       explicitly <i>exit</i> to leave the interactive shell.

             <i>monitor</i>   Equivalent to <b>-m</b>.  This option is supported if
                       the system supports the User Portability
                       Utilities option.

             <i>noclobber</i> Equivalent to <b>-C </b>(uppercase C).

             <i>noglob</i>    Equivalent to <b>-f</b>.

             <i>noexec</i>    Equivalent to <b>-n</b>.

             <i>nolog</i>     Prevent the entry of function definitions into
                       the command history; see <i>Command History List</i>.

             <i>notify</i>    Equivalent to <b>-b</b>.

             <i>nounset</i>   Equivalent to <b>-u</b>.

             <i>verbose</i>   Equivalent to <b>-v</b>.

             <i>vi</i>        Allow shell command line editing using the built-
                       in <i>vi</i> editor. Enabling <i>vi</i> mode shall disable any
                       other command line editing mode provided as an
                       implementation extension.

                       It need not be possible to set <i>vi</i> mode on for
                       certain block-mode terminals.

             <i>xtrace</i>    Equivalent to <b>-x</b>.

       <b>-u    </b>When the shell tries to expand an unset parameter other
             than the <b>'@' </b>and <b>'*' </b>special parameters, it shall write a
             message to standard error and the expansion shall fail with
             the consequences specified in <i>Section 2.8.1</i>, <i>Consequences</i>
             <i>of Shell Errors</i>.

       <b>-v    </b>The shell shall write its input to standard error as it is
             read.

       <b>-x    </b>The shell shall write to standard error a trace for each
             command after it expands the command and before it executes
             it. It is unspecified whether the command that turns
             tracing off is traced.

       The default for all these options shall be off (unset) unless
       stated otherwise in the description of the option or unless the
       shell was invoked with them on; see <i>sh</i>.

       The remaining arguments shall be assigned in order to the
       positional parameters. The special parameter <b>'#' </b>shall be set to
       reflect the number of positional parameters. All positional
       parameters shall be unset before any new values are assigned.

       If the first argument is <b>'-'</b>, the results are unspecified.

       The special argument <b>"--" </b>immediately following the <i>set</i> command
       name can be used to delimit the arguments if the first argument
       begins with <b>'+' </b>or <b>'-'</b>, or to prevent inadvertent listing of all
       shell variables when there are no arguments. The command <i>set</i> <b>--</b>
       without <i>argument</i> shall unset all positional parameters and set
       the special parameter <b>'#' </b>to zero.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Application writers should avoid relying on <i>set</i> <b>-e </b>within
       functions. For example, in the following script:

           set -e
           start() {
               some_server
               echo some_server started successfully
           }
           start || echo &gt;&amp;2 some_server failed

       the <b>-e </b>setting is ignored within the function body (because the
       function is a command in an AND-OR list other than the last).
       Therefore, if <i>some_server</i> fails, the function carries on to echo
       <b>"some_server</b>started<b>successfully"</b>, and the exit status of the
       function is zero (which means <b>"some_server</b>failed" is not output).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Write out all variables and their values:

           set

       Set $1, $2, and $3 and set <b>"$#" </b>to 3:

           set c a b

       Turn on the <b>-x </b>and <b>-v </b>options:

           set -xv

       Unset all positional parameters:

           set --

       Set $1 to the value of <i>x</i>, even if it begins with <b>'-' </b>or <b>'+'</b>:

           set -- "$x"

       Set the positional parameters to the expansion of <i>x</i>, even if <i>x</i>
       expands with a leading <b>'-' </b>or <b>'+'</b>:

           set -- $x
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>set</i> -- form is listed specifically in the SYNOPSIS even
       though this usage is implied by the Utility Syntax Guidelines.
       The explanation of this feature removes any ambiguity about
       whether the <i>set</i> -- form might be misinterpreted as being
       equivalent to <i>set</i> without any options or arguments. The
       functionality of this form has been adopted from the KornShell.
       In System V, <i>set</i> -- only unsets parameters if there is at least
       one argument; the only way to unset all parameters is to use
       <i>shift</i>.  Using the KornShell version should not affect System V
       scripts because there should be no reason to issue it without
       arguments deliberately; if it were issued as, for example:

           set -- "$@"

       and there were in fact no arguments resulting from <b>"$@"</b>,
       unsetting the parameters would have no result.

       The <i>set</i> + form in early proposals was omitted as being an
       unnecessary duplication of <i>set</i> alone and not widespread
       historical practice.

       The <i>noclobber</i> option was changed to allow <i>set</i> <b>-C </b>as well as the
       <i>set</i> <b>-o </b><i>noclobber</i> option. The single-letter version was added so
       that the historical <b>"$-" </b>paradigm would not be broken; see
       <i>Section 2.5.2</i>, <i>Special Parameters</i>.

       The description of the <b>-e </b>option is intended to match the
       behavior of the 1988 version of the KornShell.

       The <b>-h </b>flag is related to command name hashing. See <a href="hash.1p.html">hash(1p)</a>.

       The following <i>set</i> flags were omitted intentionally with the
       following rationale:

       <b>-k    </b>The <b>-k </b>flag was originally added by the author of the
             Bourne shell to make it easier for users of pre-release
             versions of the shell. In early versions of the Bourne
             shell the construct <i>set name</i>=<i>value</i> had to be used to assign
             values to shell variables. The problem with <b>-k </b>is that the
             behavior affects parsing, virtually precluding writing any
             compilers. To explain the behavior of <b>-k</b>, it is necessary
             to describe the parsing algorithm, which is implementation-
             defined. For example:

                 set -k; echo <i>name</i>=<i>value</i>

             and:

                 set -k
                 echo <i>name</i>=<i>value</i>

             behave differently. The interaction with functions is even
             more complex. What is more, the <b>-k </b>flag is never needed,
             since the command line could have been reordered.

       <b>-t    </b>The <b>-t </b>flag is hard to specify and almost never used. The
             only known use could be done with here-documents. Moreover,
             the behavior with <i>ksh</i> and <i>sh</i> differs. The reference page
             says that it exits after reading and executing one command.
             What is one command? If the input is <i>date</i>;<i>date</i>, <i>sh</i> executes
             both <i>date</i> commands while <i>ksh</i> does only the first.

       Consideration was given to rewriting <i>set</i> to simplify its
       confusing syntax. A specific suggestion was that the <i>unset</i>
       utility should be used to unset options instead of using the non-
       <i>getopt</i>()-able +<i>option</i> syntax. However, the conclusion was reached
       that the historical practice of using +<i>option</i> was satisfactory
       and that there was no compelling reason to modify such widespread
       historical practice.

       The <b>-o </b>option was adopted from the KornShell to address user
       needs. In addition to its generally friendly interface, <b>-o </b>is
       needed to provide the <i>vi</i> command line editing mode, for which
       historical practice yields no single-letter option name.
       (Although it might have been possible to invent such a letter, it
       was recognized that other editing modes would be developed and <b>-o</b>
       provides ample name space for describing such extensions.)

       Historical implementations are inconsistent in the format used
       for <b>-o </b>option status reporting. The <b>+o </b>format without an option-
       argument was added to allow portable access to the options that
       can be saved and then later restored using, for instance, a dot
       script.

       Historically, <i>sh</i> did trace the command <i>set</i> <b>+x</b>, but <i>ksh</i> did not.

       The <i>ignoreeof</i> setting prevents accidental logouts when the end-
       of-file character (typically &lt;control&gt;‐D) is entered. A user
       shall explicitly <i>exit</i> to leave the interactive shell.

       The <i>set</i> <b>-m </b>option was added to apply only to the UPE because it
       applies primarily to interactive use, not shell script
       applications.

       The ability to do asynchronous notification became available in
       the 1988 version of the KornShell. To have it occur, the user had
       to issue the command:

           trap "jobs -n" CLD

       The C shell provides two different levels of an asynchronous
       notification capability. The environment variable <i>notify</i> is
       analogous to what is done in <i>set</i> <b>-b </b>or <i>set</i> <b>-o </b><i>notify</i>.  When set,
       it notifies the user immediately of background job completions.
       When unset, this capability is turned off.

       The other notification ability comes through the built-in utility
       <i>notify</i>.  The syntax is:

           notify <b>[</b>%job ... <b>]</b>

       By issuing <i>notify</i> with no operands, it causes the C shell to
       notify the user asynchronously when the state of the current job
       changes. If given operands, <i>notify</i> asynchronously informs the
       user of changes in the states of the specified jobs.

       To add asynchronous notification to the POSIX shell, neither the
       KornShell extensions to <i>trap</i>, nor the C shell <i>notify</i> environment
       variable seemed appropriate (<i>notify</i> is not a proper POSIX
       environment variable name).

       The <i>set</i> <b>-b </b>option was selected as a compromise.

       The <i>notify</i> built-in was considered to have more functionality
       than was required for simple asynchronous notification.

       Historically, some shells applied the <b>-u </b>option to all parameters
       including <i>$@</i> and <i>$*</i>.  The standard developers felt that this was
       a misfeature since it is normal and common for <i>$@</i> and <i>$*</i> to be
       used in shell scripts regardless of whether they were passed any
       arguments. Treating these uses as an error when no arguments are
       passed reduces the value of <b>-u </b>for its intended purpose of
       finding spelling mistakes in variable names and uses of unset
       positional parameters.
