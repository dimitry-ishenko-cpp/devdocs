Description </h2>
<pre>
       <i>afmtodit</i> adapts an Adobe Font Metric file, <i>afm-file</i>, for use with
       the <b>ps </b>and <b>pdf </b>output devices of <i>troff</i>(1).  <i>map-file</i> associates a
       <i>groff</i> ordinary or special character name with a PostScript glyph
       name.  Output is written in <i>groff_font</i>(5) format to <i>font-</i>
       <i>description-file,</i> a file named for the intended <i>groff</i> font name
       (but see the <b>-o </b>option).

       <i>map-file</i> should contain a sequence of lines of the form
              <i>ps-glyph groff-char</i>
       where <i>ps-glyph</i> is the PostScript glyph name and <i>groff-char</i> is a
       <i>groff</i> ordinary (if of unit length) or special (if longer)
       character identifier.  The same <i>ps-glyph</i> can occur multiple times
       in the file; each <i>groff-char</i> must occur at most once.  Lines
       starting with “#” and blank lines are ignored.  If the file isn't
       found in the current directory, it is sought in the
       <i>devps/generate</i> subdirectory of the default font directory.

       If a PostScript glyph is not mentioned in <i>map-file</i>, and a <i>groff</i>
       character name can't be deduced using the Adobe Glyph List (AGL,
       built into <i>afmtodit</i>), then <i>afmtodit</i> puts the PostScript glyph
       into the <i>groff</i> font description file as an unnamed glyph which
       can only be accessed by the “\N” escape sequence in a <i>roff</i>
       document.  In particular, this is true for glyph variants named
       in the form “<i>foo</i>.<i>bar</i>”; all glyph names containing one or more
       periods are mapped to unnamed entities.  Unless <b>-e </b>is specified,
       the encoding defined in the AFM file (i.e., entries with non-
       negative codes) is used.  Refer to section “Using Symbols” in
       <i>Groff: The GNU Implementation of troff</i>, the <i>groff</i> Texinfo manual,
       or <i>groff_char</i>(7), which describe how <i>groff</i> character identifiers
       are constructed.

       Glyphs not encoded in the AFM file (i.e., entries indexed as
       “-1”) are still available in <i>groff</i>; they get glyph index values
       greater than 255 (or greater than the biggest code used in the
       AFM file in the unlikely case that it is greater than 255) in the
       <i>groff</i> font description file.  Unencoded glyph indices don't have
       a specific order; it is best to access them only via special
       character identifiers.

       If the font file proper (not just its metrics) is available,
       listing it in the files <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devps/</i>
       <i>download</i> and <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devpdf/download</i>
       enables it to be embedded in the output produced by <i>grops</i>(1) and
       <i>gropdf</i>(1), respectively.

       If the <b>-i </b>option is used, <i>afmtodit</i> automatically generates an
       italic correction, a left italic correction, and a subscript
       correction for each glyph (the significance of these is explained
       in <i>groff_font</i>(5)); they can be specified for individual glyphs by
       adding to the <i>afm-file</i> lines of the form:
              italicCorrection <i>ps-glyph n</i>
              leftItalicCorrection <i>ps-glyph n</i>
              subscriptCorrection <i>ps-glyph n</i>
       where <i>ps-glyph</i> is the PostScript glyph name, and <i>n</i> is the desired
       value of the corresponding parameter in thousandths of an em.
       Such parameters are normally needed only for italic (or oblique)
       fonts.

       The <b>-s </b>option should be given if the font is “special”, meaning
       that <i>groff</i> should search it whenever a glyph is not found in the
       current font.  To enable this search, <i>font-description-file</i> can
       be listed as an argument to the <b>fonts </b>directive in the output
       device's <i>DESC</i> file; alternatively, a document can designate it
       with the <b>special </b>request.  If the font is not special, there is
       no need to do either, since <i>troff</i>(1) will automatically mount it
       when it is first used.

Options </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b>displays a usage message, while <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>show
       version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-a </b><i>slant</i>
              Use <i>slant</i> as the slant (“angle”) parameter in the font
              description file; this is used by <i>groff</i> in the positioning
              of accents.  By default <i>afmtodit</i> uses the negative of the
              <b>ItalicAngle </b>specified in the AFM file; with true italic
              fonts it is sometimes desirable to use a slant that is
              less than this.  If you find that an italic font places
              accents over base glyphs too far to the right, use <b>-a </b>to
              give it a smaller slant.

       <b>-c     </b>Include comments in the font description file identifying
              the PostScript font.

       <b>-d </b><i>device-description-file</i>
              The device description file is <i>desc-file</i> rather than the
              default <i>DESC</i>.  If not found in the current directory, the
              <i>devps</i> subdirectory of the default font directory is
              searched (this is true for both the default device
              description file and a file given with option <b>-d</b>).

       <b>-e </b><i>encoding-file</i>
              The PostScript font should be reencoded to use the
              encoding described in <i>enc-file</i>.  The format of <i>enc-file</i> is
              described in <i>grops</i>(1).  If not found in the current
              directory, the <i>devps</i> subdirectory of the default font
              directory is searched.

       <b>-f </b><i>internal-name</i>
              The internal name of the <i>groff</i> font is set to <i>name</i>.

       <b>-i </b><i>italic-correction-factor</i>
              Generate an italic correction for each glyph so that its
              width plus its italic correction is equal to <i>italic-</i>
              <i>correction-factor</i> thousandths of an em plus the amount by
              which the right edge of the glyph's bounding box is to the
              right of its origin.  If this would result in a negative
              italic correction, use a zero italic correction instead.

              Also generate a subscript correction equal to the product
              of the tangent of the slant of the font and four fifths of
              the x-height of the font.  If this would result in a
              subscript correction greater than the italic correction,
              use a subscript correction equal to the italic correction
              instead.

              Also generate a left italic correction for each glyph
              equal to <i>italic-correction-factor</i> thousandths of an em
              plus the amount by which the left edge of the glyph's
              bounding box is to the left of its origin.  The left
              italic correction may be negative unless option <b>-m </b>is
              given.

              This option is normally needed only with italic (or
              oblique) fonts.  The font description files distributed
              with <i>groff</i> were created using an option of <b>-i50 </b>for italic
              fonts.

       <b>-o </b><i>output-file</i>
              Write to <i>output-file</i> instead of <i>font-description-file.</i>

       <b>-k     </b>Omit any kerning data from the <i>groff</i> font; use only for
              monospaced (constant-width) fonts.

       <b>-m     </b>Prevent negative left italic correction values.  Font
              description files for roman styles distributed with <i>groff</i>
              were created with “<b>-i0 -m</b>” to improve spacing with <i>eqn</i>(1).

       <b>-n     </b>Don't output a <b>ligatures </b>command for this font; use with
              monospaced (constant-width) fonts.

       <b>-s     </b>Add the <b>special </b>directive to the font description file.

       <b>-w </b><i>space-width</i>
              Use <i>space-width</i> as the width of inter-word spaces.

       <b>-x     </b>Don't use the built-in Adobe Glyph List.

Diagnostics </h2>
<pre>
       AGL name '<i>x</i>' already mapped to groff name '<i>y</i>'; ignoring AGL name
       'uni<i>XXXX</i>'
              You can disregard these if they're in the form shown,
              where the ignored AGL name contains four hexadecimal
              digits <i>XXXX</i>.  The Adobe Glyph List (AGL) has its own names
              for glyphs; they are often different from <i>groff</i>'s special
              character names.  <i>afmtodit</i> is constructing a mapping from
              <i>groff</i> special character names to AGL names; this can be a
              one-to-one or many-to-one mapping, but one-to-many will
              not work, so <i>afmtodit</i> discards the excess mappings.  For
              example, if <i>x</i> is <b>Delta</b>, <i>y</i> is <b>*D</b>, and <i>XXXX</i> is <b>0394</b>,
              <i>afmtodit</i> is telling you that the <i>groff</i> font description
              that it is writing cannot map the <i>groff</i> special character
              <b>\[*D] </b>to AGL glyphs <b>Delta </b>and <b>uni0394 </b>at the same time.

              If you get a message like this but are unhappy with which
              mapping is ignored, a remedy is to craft an alternative
              <i>map-file</i> and re-run <i>afmtodit</i> using it.
