DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dlltool </b>reads its inputs, which can come from the <b>-d </b>and <b>-b</b>
       options as well as object files specified on the command line.
       It then processes these inputs and if the <b>-e </b>option has been
       specified it creates a exports file.  If the <b>-l </b>option has been
       specified it creates a library file and if the <b>-z </b>option has been
       specified it creates a def file.  Any or all of the <b>-e</b>, <b>-l </b>and <b>-z</b>
       options can be present in one invocation of dlltool.

       When creating a DLL, along with the source for the DLL, it is
       necessary to have three other files.  <b>dlltool </b>can help with the
       creation of these files.

       The first file is a <i>.def</i> file which specifies which functions are
       exported from the DLL, which functions the DLL imports, and so
       on.  This is a text file and can be created by hand, or <b>dlltool</b>
       can be used to create it using the <b>-z </b>option.  In this case
       <b>dlltool </b>will scan the object files specified on its command line
       looking for those functions which have been specially marked as
       being exported and put entries for them in the <i>.def</i> file it
       creates.

       In order to mark a function as being exported from a DLL, it
       needs to have an <b>-export:&lt;name_of_function&gt; </b>entry in the <b>.drectve</b>
       section of the object file.  This can be done in C by using the
       <b>asm() </b>operator:

                 asm (".section .drectve");
                 asm (".ascii \"-export:my_func\"");

                 int my_func (void) { ... }

       The second file needed for DLL creation is an exports file.  This
       file is linked with the object files that make up the body of the
       DLL and it handles the interface between the DLL and the outside
       world.  This is a binary file and it can be created by giving the
       <b>-e </b>option to <b>dlltool </b>when it is creating or reading in a <i>.def</i>
       file.

       The third file needed for DLL creation is the library file that
       programs will link with in order to access the functions in the
       DLL (an `import library').  This file can be created by giving
       the <b>-l </b>option to dlltool when it is creating or reading in a <i>.def</i>
       file.

       If the <b>-y </b>option is specified, dlltool generates a delay-import
       library that can be used instead of the normal import library to
       allow a program to link to the dll only as soon as an imported
       function is called for the first time. The resulting executable
       will need to be linked to the static delayimp library containing
       _<b>_delayLoadHelper2()</b>, which in turn will import LoadLibraryA and
       GetProcAddress from kernel32.

       <b>dlltool </b>builds the library file by hand, but it builds the
       exports file by creating temporary files containing assembler
       statements and then assembling these.  The <b>-S </b>command-line option
       can be used to specify the path to the assembler that dlltool
       will use, and the <b>-f </b>option can be used to pass specific flags to
       that assembler.  The <b>-n </b>can be used to prevent dlltool from
       deleting these temporary assembler files when it is done, and if
       <b>-n </b>is specified twice then this will prevent dlltool from
       deleting the temporary object files it used to build the library.

       Here is an example of creating a DLL from a source file <b>dll.c </b>and
       also creating a program (from an object file called <b>program.o</b>)
       that uses that DLL:

                 gcc -c dll.c
                 dlltool -e exports.o -l dll.lib dll.o
                 gcc dll.o exports.o -o dll.dll
                 gcc program.o dll.lib -o program

       <b>dlltool </b>may also be used to query an existing import library to
       determine the name of the DLL to which it is associated.  See the
       description of the <b>-I </b>or <b>--identify </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The command-line options have the following meanings:

       <b>-d </b><i>filename</i>
       <b>--input-def </b><i>filename</i>
           Specifies the name of a <i>.def</i> file to be read in and
           processed.

       <b>-b </b><i>filename</i>
       <b>--base-file </b><i>filename</i>
           Specifies the name of a base file to be read in and
           processed.  The contents of this file will be added to the
           relocation section in the exports file generated by dlltool.

       <b>-e </b><i>filename</i>
       <b>--output-exp </b><i>filename</i>
           Specifies the name of the export file to be created by
           dlltool.

       <b>-z </b><i>filename</i>
       <b>--output-def </b><i>filename</i>
           Specifies the name of the <i>.def</i> file to be created by dlltool.

       <b>-l </b><i>filename</i>
       <b>--output-lib </b><i>filename</i>
           Specifies the name of the library file to be created by
           dlltool.

       <b>-y </b><i>filename</i>
       <b>--output-delaylib </b><i>filename</i>
           Specifies the name of the delay-import library file to be
           created by dlltool.

       <b>--deterministic-libraries</b>
       <b>--non-deterministic-libraries</b>
           When creating output libraries in response to either the
           <b>--output-lib </b>or <b>--output-delaylib </b>options either use the
           value of zero for any timestamps, user ids and group ids
           created (<b>--deterministic-libraries</b>) or the actual timestamps,
           user ids and group ids (<b>--non-deterministic-libraries</b>).

       <b>--export-all-symbols</b>
           Treat all global and weak defined symbols found in the input
           object files as symbols to be exported.  There is a small
           list of symbols which are not exported by default; see the
           <b>--no-default-excludes </b>option.  You may add to the list of
           symbols to not export by using the <b>--exclude-symbols </b>option.

       <b>--no-export-all-symbols</b>
           Only export symbols explicitly listed in an input <i>.def</i> file
           or in <b>.drectve </b>sections in the input object files.  This is
           the default behaviour.  The <b>.drectve </b>sections are created by
           <b>dllexport </b>attributes in the source code.

       <b>--exclude-symbols </b><i>list</i>
           Do not export the symbols in <i>list</i>.  This is a list of symbol
           names separated by comma or colon characters.  The symbol
           names should not contain a leading underscore.  This is only
           meaningful when <b>--export-all-symbols </b>is used.

       <b>--no-default-excludes</b>
           When <b>--export-all-symbols </b>is used, it will by default avoid
           exporting certain special symbols.  The current list of
           symbols to avoid exporting is <b>DllMain@12</b>, <b>DllEntryPoint@0</b>,
           <b>impure_ptr</b>.  You may use the <b>--no-default-excludes </b>option to
           go ahead and export these special symbols.  This is only
           meaningful when <b>--export-all-symbols </b>is used.

       <b>-S </b><i>path</i>
       <b>--as </b><i>path</i>
           Specifies the path, including the filename, of the assembler
           to be used to create the exports file.

       <b>-f </b><i>options</i>
       <b>--as-flags </b><i>options</i>
           Specifies any specific command-line options to be passed to
           the assembler when building the exports file.  This option
           will work even if the <b>-S </b>option is not used.  This option
           only takes one argument, and if it occurs more than once on
           the command line, then later occurrences will override
           earlier occurrences.  So if it is necessary to pass multiple
           options to the assembler they should be enclosed in double
           quotes.

       <b>-D </b><i>name</i>
       <b>--dll-name </b><i>name</i>
           Specifies the name to be stored in the <i>.def</i> file as the name
           of the DLL when the <b>-e </b>option is used.  If this option is not
           present, then the filename given to the <b>-e </b>option will be
           used as the name of the DLL.

       <b>-m </b><i>machine</i>
       <b>-machine </b><i>machine</i>
           Specifies the type of machine for which the library file
           should be built.  <b>dlltool </b>has a built in default type,
           depending upon how it was created, but this option can be
           used to override that.  This is normally only useful when
           creating DLLs for an ARM processor, when the contents of the
           DLL are actually encode using Thumb instructions.

       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--add-indirect</b>
           Specifies that when <b>dlltool </b>is creating the exports file it
           should add a section which allows the exported functions to
           be referenced without using the import library.  Whatever the
           hell that means!

       <b>-U</b>
       <b>--add-underscore</b>
           Specifies that when <b>dlltool </b>is creating the exports file it
           should prepend an underscore to the names of <i>all</i> exported
           symbols.

       <b>--no-leading-underscore</b>
       <b>--leading-underscore</b>
           Specifies whether standard symbol should be forced to be
           prefixed, or not.

       <b>--add-stdcall-underscore</b>
           Specifies that when <b>dlltool </b>is creating the exports file it
           should prepend an underscore to the names of exported <i>stdcall</i>
           functions. Variable names and non-stdcall function names are
           not modified.  This option is useful when creating GNU-
           compatible import libs for third party DLLs that were built
           with MS-Windows tools.

       <b>-k</b>
       <b>--kill-at</b>
           Specifies that <b>@&lt;number&gt; </b>suffixes should be omitted from the
           names of stdcall functions that will be imported from the
           DLL.  This is useful when creating an import library for a
           DLL which exports stdcall functions but without the usual
           <b>@&lt;number&gt; </b>symbol name suffix.

           This does not change the naming of symbols provided by the
           import library to programs linked against it, but only the
           entries in the import table (ie the .idata section).

       <b>-A</b>
       <b>--add-stdcall-alias</b>
           Specifies that when <b>dlltool </b>is creating the exports file it
           should add aliases for stdcall symbols without <b>@ &lt;number&gt; </b>in
           addition to the symbols with <b>@ &lt;number&gt;</b>.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--ext-prefix-alias </b><i>prefix</i>
           Causes <b>dlltool </b>to create external aliases for all DLL imports
           with the specified prefix.  The aliases are created for both
           external and import symbols with no leading underscore.

       <b>-x</b>
       <b>--no-idata4</b>
           Specifies that when <b>dlltool </b>is creating the exports and
           library files it should omit the ".idata4" section.  This is
           for compatibility with certain operating systems.

       <b>--use-nul-prefixed-import-tables</b>
           Specifies that when <b>dlltool </b>is creating the exports and
           library files it should prefix the ".idata4" and ".idata5" by
           zero an element. This emulates old gnu import library
           generation of "dlltool". By default this option is turned
           off.

       <b>-c</b>
       <b>--no-idata5</b>
           Specifies that when <b>dlltool </b>is creating the exports and
           library files it should omit the ".idata5" section.  This is
           for compatibility with certain operating systems.

       <b>-I </b><i>filename</i>
       <b>--identify </b><i>filename</i>
           Specifies that <b>dlltool </b>should inspect the import library
           indicated by <i>filename</i> and report, on "stdout", the name(s) of
           the associated DLL(s).  This can be performed in addition to
           any other operations indicated by the other options and
           arguments.  <b>dlltool </b>fails if the import library does not
           exist or is not actually an import library. See also
           <b>--identify-strict</b>.

       <b>--identify-strict</b>
           Modifies the behavior of the <b>--identify </b>option, such that an
           error is reported if <i>filename</i> is associated with more than
           one DLL.

       <b>-i</b>
       <b>--interwork</b>
           Specifies that <b>dlltool </b>should mark the objects in the library
           file and exports file that it produces as supporting
           interworking between ARM and Thumb code.

       <b>-n</b>
       <b>--nodelete</b>
           Makes <b>dlltool </b>preserve the temporary assembler files it used
           to create the exports file.  If this option is repeated then
           dlltool will also preserve the temporary object files it uses
           to create the library file.

       <b>-t </b><i>prefix</i>
       <b>--temp-prefix </b><i>prefix</i>
           Makes <b>dlltool </b>use <i>prefix</i> when constructing the names of
           temporary assembler and object files.  By default, the temp
           file prefix is generated from the pid.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
           Make dlltool describe what it is doing.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>
           Displays a list of command-line options and then exits.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Displays dlltool's version number and then exits.

       <b>@</b><i>file</i>
           Read command-line options from <i>file</i>.  The options read are
           inserted in place of the original @<i>file</i> option.  If <i>file</i> does
           not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
           literally, and not removed.

           Options in <i>file</i> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
           character may be included in an option by surrounding the
           entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any
           character (including a backslash) may be included by
           prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The
           <i>file</i> may itself contain additional @<i>file</i> options; any such
           options will be processed recursively.
