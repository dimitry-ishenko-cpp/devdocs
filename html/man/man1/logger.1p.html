PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       logger — log messages
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       logger <i>string</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>logger</i> utility saves a message, in an unspecified manner and
       format, containing the <i>string</i> operands provided by the user. The
       messages are expected to be evaluated later by personnel
       performing system administration tasks.

       It is implementation-defined whether messages written in locales
       other than the POSIX locale are effective.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>string</i>    One of the string arguments whose contents are
                 concatenated together, in the order specified,
                 separated by single &lt;space&gt; characters.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>logger</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error. (This means diagnostics from <i>logger</i> to
                 the user or application, not diagnostic messages that
                 the user is sending to the system administrator.)

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       This utility allows logging of information for later use by a
       system administrator or programmer in determining why non-
       interactive utilities have failed. The locations of the saved
       messages, their format, and retention period are all unspecified.
       There is no method for a conforming application to read messages,
       once written.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       A batch application, running non-interactively, tries to read a
       configuration file and fails; it may attempt to notify the system
       administrator with:

           logger myname: unable to read file foo. [timestamp]
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The standard developers believed strongly that some method of
       alerting administrators to errors was necessary. The obvious
       example is a batch utility, running non-interactively, that is
       unable to read its configuration files or that is unable to
       create or write its results file. However, the standard
       developers did not wish to define the format or delivery
       mechanisms as they have historically been (and will probably
       continue to be) very system-specific, as well as involving
       functionality clearly outside the scope of this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017.

       The text with <i>LC_MESSAGES</i> about diagnostic messages means
       diagnostics from <i>logger</i> to the user or application, not
       diagnostic messages that the user is sending to the system
       administrator.

       Multiple <i>string</i> arguments are allowed, similar to <i>echo</i>, for ease-
       of-use.

       Like the utilities <i>mailx</i> and <i>lp</i>, <i>logger</i> is admittedly difficult
       to test. This was not deemed sufficient justification to exclude
       these utilities from this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. It is also
       arguable that they are, in fact, testable, but that the tests
       themselves are not portable.
