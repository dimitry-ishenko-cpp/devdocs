DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>tset - initialization</b>
       This program initializes terminals.

       First, <b>@TSET@ </b>retrieves the current terminal mode settings for
       your terminal.  It does this by successively testing

       •   the standard error,

       •   standard output,

       •   standard input and

       •   ultimately “/dev/tty”

       to obtain terminal settings.  Having retrieved these settings,
       <b>@TSET@ </b>remembers which file descriptor to use when updating
       settings.

       Next, <b>@TSET@ </b>determines the type of terminal that you are using.
       This determination is done as follows, using the first terminal
       type found.

       1. The <b>terminal </b>argument specified on the command line.

       2. The value of the <b>TERM </b>environmental variable.

       3. (BSD systems only.) The terminal type associated with the
       standard error output device in the <i>/etc/ttys</i> file.  (On
       System-V-like UNIXes and systems using that convention, <b>getty</b>(1)
       does this job by setting <b>TERM </b>according to the type passed to it
       by <i>/etc/inittab</i>.)

       4. The default terminal type, “unknown”.

       If the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the
       <b>-m </b>option mappings are then applied (see the section <b>TERMINAL</b>
       <b>TYPE MAPPING </b>for more information).  Then, if the terminal type
       begins with a question mark (“?”), the user is prompted for
       confirmation of the terminal type.  An empty response confirms
       the type, or, another type can be entered to specify a new type.
       Once the terminal type has been determined, the terminal
       description for the terminal is retrieved.  If no terminal
       description is found for the type, the user is prompted for
       another terminal type.

       Once the terminal description is retrieved,

       •   if the “<b>-w</b>” option is enabled, <b>@TSET@ </b>may update the
           terminal's window size.

           If the window size cannot be obtained from the operating
           system, but the terminal description (or environment, e.g.,
           <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS </b>variables specify this), use this to set
           the operating system's notion of the window size.

       •   if the “<b>-c</b>” option is enabled, the backspace, interrupt and
           line kill characters (among many other things) are set

       •   unless the “<b>-I</b>” option is enabled, the terminal and tab
           <i>initialization</i> strings are sent to the standard error output,
           and <b>@TSET@ </b>waits one second (in case a hardware reset was
           issued).

       •   Finally, if the erase, interrupt and line kill characters
           have changed, or are not set to their default values, their
           values are displayed to the standard error output.

   <b>reset - reinitialization</b>
       When invoked as <b>@RESET@</b>, <b>@TSET@ </b>sets the terminal modes to “sane”
       values:

       •   sets cooked and echo modes,

       •   turns off cbreak and raw modes,

       •   turns on newline translation and

       •   resets any unset special characters to their default values

       before doing the terminal initialization described above.  Also,
       rather than using the terminal <i>initialization</i> strings, it uses
       the terminal <i>reset</i> strings.

       The <b>@RESET@ </b>command is useful after a program dies leaving a
       terminal in an abnormal state:

       •   you may have to type

               <i>&lt;LF&gt;</i><b>@RESET@</b><i>&lt;LF&gt;</i>

           (the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the
           terminal to work, as carriage-return may no longer work in
           the abnormal state.

       •   Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The options are as follows:

       <b>-c   </b>Set control characters and modes.

       <b>-e </b><i>ch</i>
            Set the erase character to <i>ch</i>.

       <b>-I   </b>Do not send the terminal or tab initialization strings to
            the terminal.

       <b>-i </b><i>ch</i>
            Set the interrupt character to <i>ch</i>.

       <b>-k </b><i>ch</i>
            Set the line kill character to <i>ch</i>.

       <b>-m </b><i>mapping</i>
            Specify a mapping from a port type to a terminal.  See the
            section <b>TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING </b>for more information.

       <b>-Q   </b>Do not display any values for the erase, interrupt and line
            kill characters.  Normally <b>@TSET@ </b>displays the values for
            control characters which differ from the system's default
            values.

       <b>-q   </b>The terminal type is displayed to the standard output, and
            the terminal is not initialized in any way.  The option “-”
            by itself is equivalent but archaic.

       <b>-r   </b>Print the terminal type to the standard error output.

       <b>-s   </b>Print the sequence of shell commands to initialize the
            environment variable <b>TERM </b>to the standard output.  See the
            section <b>SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT </b>for details.

       <b>-V   </b>reports the version of ncurses which was used in this
            program, and exits.

       <b>-w   </b>Resize the window to match the size deduced via
            <b>setupterm</b>(3X).  Normally this has no effect, unless
            <b>setupterm </b>is not able to detect the window size.

       The arguments for the <b>-e</b>, <b>-i</b>, and <b>-k </b>options may either be
       entered as actual characters or by using the “hat” notation,
       i.e., control-h may be specified as “^H” or “^h”.

       If neither <b>-c </b>or <b>-w </b>is given, both options are assumed.
</pre> <h2>
SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and information
       about the terminal's capabilities into the shell's environment.
       This is done using the <b>-s </b>option.

       When the <b>-s </b>option is specified, the commands to enter the
       information into the shell's environment are written to the
       standard output.  If the <b>SHELL </b>environmental variable ends in
       “csh”, the commands are for <b>csh</b>, otherwise, they are for <b>sh</b>(1).
       Note, the <b>csh </b>commands set and unset the shell variable <b>noglob</b>,
       leaving it unset.  The following line in the <b>.login </b>or <b>.profile</b>
       files will initialize the environment correctly:

           eval `@TSET@ -s options ... `
</pre> <h2>
TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING </h2>
<pre>
       When the terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the
       current system information is incorrect) the terminal type
       derived from the <i>/etc/ttys</i> file or the <b>TERM </b>environmental
       variable is often something generic like <b>network</b>, <b>dialup</b>, or
       <b>unknown</b>.  When <b>@TSET@ </b>is used in a startup script it is often
       desirable to provide information about the type of terminal used
       on such ports.

       The <b>-m </b>options maps from some set of conditions to a terminal
       type, that is, to tell <b>@TSET@ </b>“If I'm on this port at a
       particular speed, guess that I'm on that kind of terminal”.

       The argument to the <b>-m </b>option consists of an optional port type,
       an optional operator, an optional baud rate specification, an
       optional colon (“:”) character and a terminal type.  The port
       type is a string (delimited by either the operator or the colon
       character).  The operator may be any combination of “&gt;”, “&lt;”,
       “@”, and “!”; “&gt;” means greater than, “&lt;” means less than, “@”
       means equal to and “!” inverts the sense of the test.  The baud
       rate is specified as a number and is compared with the speed of
       the standard error output (which should be the control terminal).
       The terminal type is a string.

       If the terminal type is not specified on the command line, the <b>-m</b>
       mappings are applied to the terminal type.  If the port type and
       baud rate match the mapping, the terminal type specified in the
       mapping replaces the current type.  If more than one mapping is
       specified, the first applicable mapping is used.

       For example, consider the following mapping: <b>dialup&gt;9600:vt100</b>.
       The port type is dialup , the operator is &gt;, the baud rate
       specification is 9600, and the terminal type is vt100.  The
       result of this mapping is to specify that if the terminal type is
       <b>dialup</b>, and the baud rate is greater than 9600 baud, a terminal
       type of <b>vt100 </b>will be used.

       If no baud rate is specified, the terminal type will match any
       baud rate.  If no port type is specified, the terminal type will
       match any port type.  For example, <b>-m dialup:vt100 -m :?xterm</b>
       will cause any dialup port, regardless of baud rate, to match the
       terminal type vt100, and any non-dialup port type to match the
       terminal type ?xterm.  Note, because of the leading question
       mark, the user will be queried on a default port as to whether
       they are actually using an xterm terminal.

       No whitespace characters are permitted in the <b>-m </b>option argument.
       Also, to avoid problems with meta-characters, it is suggested
       that the entire <b>-m </b>option argument be placed within single quote
       characters, and that <b>csh </b>users insert a backslash character (“\”)
       before any exclamation marks (“!”).
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       A <b>reset </b>command appeared in 1BSD (March 1978), written by Kurt
       Shoens.  This program set the <i>erase</i> and <i>kill</i> characters to <b>^H</b>
       (backspace) and <b>@ </b>respectively.  Mark Horton improved that in
       3BSD (October 1979), adding <i>intr</i>, <i>quit</i>, <i>start</i>/<i>stop</i> and <i>eof</i>
       characters as well as changing the program to avoid modifying any
       user settings.  That version of <b>reset </b>did not use the termcap
       database.

       A separate <b>tset </b>command was provided in 1BSD by Eric Allman,
       using the termcap database.  Allman's comments in the source code
       indicate that he began work in October 1977, continuing
       development over the next few years.

       According to comments in the source code, the <b>tset </b>program was
       modified in September 1980, to use logic copied from the 3BSD
       “reset” when it was invoked as <b>reset</b>.  This version appeared in
       4.1cBSD, late in 1982.

       Other developers (e.g., Keith Bostic and Jim Bloom) continued to
       modify <b>tset </b>until 4.4BSD was released in 1993.

       The <b>ncurses </b>implementation was lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD
       sources for a terminfo environment by Eric S. Raymond
       &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;.
</pre> <h2>
COMPATIBILITY </h2>
<pre>
       Neither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open Group Base Specifications Issue
       7 (POSIX.1-2008) nor X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents <b>@TSET@ </b>or
       <b>@RESET@</b>.

       The AT&amp;T <b>tput </b>utility (AIX, HPUX, Solaris) incorporated the
       terminal-mode manipulation as well as termcap-based features such
       as resetting tabstops from <b>tset </b>in BSD (4.1c), presumably with
       the intention of making <b>tset </b>obsolete.  However, each of those
       systems still provides <b>tset</b>.  In fact, the commonly-used <b>reset</b>
       utility is always an alias for <b>tset</b>.

       The <b>@TSET@ </b>utility provides for backward-compatibility with BSD
       environments (under most modern UNIXes, <b>/etc/inittab </b>and <b>getty</b>(1)
       can set <b>TERM </b>appropriately for each dial-up line; this obviates
       what was <b>@TSET@</b>'s most important use).  This implementation
       behaves like 4.4BSD <b>tset</b>, with a few exceptions specified here.

       A few options are different because the <b>TERMCAP </b>variable is no
       longer supported under terminfo-based <b>ncurses</b>:

       •   The <b>-S </b>option of BSD <b>tset </b>no longer works; it prints an error
           message to the standard error and dies.

       •   The <b>-s </b>option only sets <b>TERM</b>, not <b>TERMCAP</b>.

       There was an undocumented 4.4BSD feature that invoking <b>tset </b>via a
       link named “TSET” (or via any other name beginning with an upper-
       case letter) set the terminal to use upper-case only.  This
       feature has been omitted.

       The <b>-A</b>, <b>-E</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-u </b>and <b>-v </b>options were deleted from the <b>@TSET@</b>
       utility in 4.4BSD.  None of them were documented in 4.3BSD and
       all are of limited utility at best.  The <b>-a</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-p </b>options
       are similarly not documented or useful, but were retained as they
       appear to be in widespread use.  It is strongly recommended that
       any usage of these three options be changed to use the <b>-m </b>option
       instead.  The <b>-a</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-p </b>options are therefore omitted from
       the usage summary above.

       Very old systems, e.g., 3BSD, used a different terminal driver
       which was replaced in 4BSD in the early 1980s.  To accommodate
       these older systems, the 4BSD <b>@TSET@ </b>provided a <b>-n </b>option to
       specify that the new terminal driver should be used.  This
       implementation does not provide that choice.

       It is still permissible to specify the <b>-e</b>, <b>-i</b>, and <b>-k </b>options
       without arguments, although it is strongly recommended that such
       usage be fixed to explicitly specify the character.

       As of 4.4BSD, executing <b>@TSET@ </b>as <b>@RESET@ </b>no longer implies the
       <b>-Q </b>option.  Also, the interaction between the - option and the
       <i>terminal</i> argument in some historic implementations of <b>@TSET@ </b>has
       been removed.

       The <b>-c </b>and <b>-w </b>options are not found in earlier implementations.
       However, a different window size-change feature was provided in
       4.4BSD.

       •   In 4.4BSD, <b>tset </b>uses the window size from the termcap
           description to set the window size if <b>tset </b>is not able to
           obtain the window size from the operating system.

       •   In ncurses, <b>@TSET@ </b>obtains the window size using <b>setupterm</b>,
           which may be from the operating system, the <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS</b>
           environment variables or the terminal description.

       Obtaining the window size from the terminal description is common
       to both implementations, but considered obsolescent.  Its only
       practical use is for hardware terminals.  Generally speaking, a
       window size would be unset only if there were some problem
       obtaining the value from the operating system (and <b>setupterm</b>
       would still fail).  For that reason, the <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS</b>
       environment variables may be useful for working around window-
       size problems.  Those have the drawback that if the window is
       resized, those variables must be recomputed and reassigned.  To
       do this more easily, use the <b>resize</b>(1) program.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>@TSET@ </b>command uses these environment variables:

       SHELL
            tells <b>@TSET@ </b>whether to initialize <b>TERM </b>using <b>sh</b>(1) or
            <b>csh</b>(1) syntax.

       TERM Denotes your terminal type.  Each terminal type is distinct,
            though many are similar.

       TERMCAP
            may denote the location of a termcap database.  If it is not
            an absolute pathname, e.g., begins with a “/”, <b>@TSET@</b>
            removes the variable from the environment before looking for
            the terminal description.
