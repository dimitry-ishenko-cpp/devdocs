</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>od</i> utility shall write the contents of its input files to
       standard output in a user-specified format.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>od</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       that the order of presentation of the <b>-t </b>options and the <b>-bcdosx</b>
       options is significant.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-A </b><i>address_base</i>
                 Specify the input offset base. See the EXTENDED
                 DESCRIPTION section.  The application shall ensure that
                 the <i>address_base</i> option-argument is a character. The
                 characters <b>'d'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, and <b>'x' </b>specify that the offset
                 base shall be written in decimal, octal, or
                 hexadecimal, respectively. The character <b>'n' </b>specifies
                 that the offset shall not be written.

       <b>-b        </b>Interpret bytes in octal. This shall be equivalent to
                 <b>-t o1</b>.

       <b>-c        </b>Interpret bytes as characters specified by the current
                 setting of the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> category. Certain non-graphic
                 characters appear as C escapes: <b>"NUL=\0"</b>, <b>"BS=\b"</b>,
                 <b>"FF=\f"</b>, <b>"NL=\n"</b>, <b>"CR=\r"</b>, <b>"HT=\t"</b>; others appear as
                 3-digit octal numbers.

       <b>-d        </b>Interpret <i>word</i>s (two-byte units) in unsigned decimal.
                 This shall be equivalent to <b>-t u2</b>.

       <b>-j </b><i>skip</i>   Jump over <i>skip</i> bytes from the beginning of the input.
                 The <i>od</i> utility shall read or seek past the first <i>skip</i>
                 bytes in the concatenated input files. If the combined
                 input is not at least <i>skip</i> bytes long, the <i>od</i> utility
                 shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and
                 exit with a non-zero exit status.

                 By default, the <i>skip</i> option-argument shall be
                 interpreted as a decimal number. With a leading 0x or
                 0X, the offset shall be interpreted as a hexadecimal
                 number; otherwise, with a leading <b>'0'</b>, the offset shall
                 be interpreted as an octal number. Appending the
                 character <b>'b'</b>, <b>'k'</b>, or <b>'m' </b>to offset shall cause it to
                 be interpreted as a multiple of 512, 1024, or 1048576
                 bytes, respectively. If the <i>skip</i> number is hexadecimal,
                 any appended <b>'b' </b>shall be considered to be the final
                 hexadecimal digit.

       <b>-N </b><i>count</i>  Format no more than <i>count</i> bytes of input. By default,
                 <i>count</i> shall be interpreted as a decimal number. With a
                 leading 0x or 0X, <i>count</i> shall be interpreted as a
                 hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading <b>'0'</b>, it
                 shall be interpreted as an octal number. If <i>count</i> bytes
                 of input (after successfully skipping, if <b>-j </b><i>skip</i> is
                 specified) are not available, it shall not be
                 considered an error; the <i>od</i> utility shall format the
                 input that is available.

       <b>-o        </b>Interpret <i>word</i>s (two-byte units) in octal. This shall
                 be equivalent to <b>-t o2</b>.

       <b>-s        </b>Interpret <i>word</i>s (two-byte units) in signed decimal.
                 This shall be equivalent to <b>-t d2</b>.

       <b>-t </b><i>type_string</i>
                 Specify one or more output types. See the EXTENDED
                 DESCRIPTION section. The application shall ensure that
                 the <i>type_string</i> option-argument is a string specifying
                 the types to be used when writing the input data. The
                 string shall consist of the type specification
                 characters <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x</b>, specifying named
                 character, character, signed decimal, floating point,
                 octal, unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal, respectively.
                 The type specification characters <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x </b>can
                 be followed by an optional unsigned decimal integer
                 that specifies the number of bytes to be transformed by
                 each instance of the output type. The type
                 specification character <b>f </b>can be followed by an
                 optional <b>F</b>, <b>D</b>, or <b>L </b>indicating that the conversion
                 should be applied to an item of type <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, or
                 <b>long double</b>, respectively. The type specification
                 characters <b>d</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x </b>can be followed by an
                 optional <b>C</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>I</b>, or <b>L </b>indicating that the conversion
                 should be applied to an item of type <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>,
                 or <b>long</b>, respectively. Multiple types can be
                 concatenated within the same <i>type_string</i> and multiple
                 <b>-t </b>options can be specified. Output lines shall be
                 written for each type specified in the order in which
                 the type specification characters are specified.

       <b>-v        </b>Write all input data. Without the <b>-v </b>option, any number
                 of groups of output lines, which would be identical to
                 the immediately preceding group of output lines (except
                 for the byte offsets), shall be replaced with a line
                 containing only an &lt;asterisk&gt; (<b>'*'</b>).

       <b>-x        </b>Interpret <i>word</i>s (two-byte units) in hexadecimal. This
                 shall be equivalent to <b>-t x2</b>.

       Multiple types can be specified by using multiple <b>-bcdostx</b>
       options. Output lines are written for each type specified in the
       order in which the types are specified.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file to be read. If no <i>file</i> operands
                 are specified, the standard input shall be used.

                 If there are no more than two operands, none of the <b>-A</b>,
                 <b>-j</b>, <b>-N</b>, <b>-t</b>, or <b>-v </b>options is specified, and either of
                 the following is true: the first character of the last
                 operand is a &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>), or there are two
                 operands and the first character of the last operand is
                 numeric; the last operand shall be interpreted as an
                 offset operand on XSI-conformant systems.  Under these
                 conditions, the results are unspecified on systems that
                 are not XSI-conformant systems.

       <b>[+]</b><i>offset</i><b>[.][b]</b>
                 The <i>offset</i> operand specifies the offset in the file
                 where dumping is to commence.  This operand is normally
                 interpreted as octal bytes. If <b>'.'  </b>is appended, the
                 offset shall be interpreted in decimal. If <b>'b' </b>is
                 appended, the offset shall be interpreted in units of
                 512 bytes.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used if no <i>file</i> operands are
       specified, and shall be used if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-' </b>and the
       implementation treats the <b>'-' </b>as meaning standard input.
       Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT
       FILES section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files can be any file type.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>od</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>
                 Determine the locale for selecting the radix character
                 used when writing floating-point formatted output.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>od</i> utility shall copy sequentially each input file to
       standard output, transforming the input data according to the
       output types specified by the <b>-t </b>option or the <b>-bcdosx </b>options.
       If no output type is specified, the default output shall be as if
       <b>-t oS </b>had been specified.

       The number of bytes transformed by the output type specifier <b>c</b>
       may be variable depending on the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> category.

       The default number of bytes transformed by output type specifiers
       <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x </b>corresponds to the various C-language types as
       follows. If the <i>c99</i> compiler is present on the system, these
       specifiers shall correspond to the sizes used by default in that
       compiler. Otherwise, these sizes may vary among systems that
       conform to POSIX.1‐2008.

        *  For the type specifier characters <b>d</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x</b>, the default
           number of bytes shall correspond to the size of the
           underlying implementation's basic integer type. For these
           specifier characters, the implementation shall support values
           of the optional number of bytes to be converted corresponding
           to the number of bytes in the C-language types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>,
           <b>int</b>, and <b>long</b>.  These numbers can also be specified by an
           application as the characters <b>'C'</b>, <b>'S'</b>, <b>'I'</b>, and <b>'L'</b>,
           respectively. The implementation shall also support the
           values 1, 2, 4, and 8, even if it provides no C-Language
           types of those sizes. The implementation shall support the
           decimal value corresponding to the C-language type <b>long long</b>.
           The byte order used when interpreting numeric values is
           implementation-defined, but shall correspond to the order in
           which a constant of the corresponding type is stored in
           memory on the system.

        *  For the type specifier character <b>f</b>, the default number of
           bytes shall correspond to the number of bytes in the
           underlying implementation's basic double precision floating-
           point data type. The implementation shall support values of
           the optional number of bytes to be converted corresponding to
           the number of bytes in the C-language types <b>float, double</b>,
           and <b>long double</b>.  These numbers can also be specified by an
           application as the characters <b>'F'</b>, <b>'D'</b>, and <b>'L'</b>,
           respectively.

       The type specifier character <b>a </b>specifies that bytes shall be
       interpreted as named characters from the International Reference
       Version (IRV) of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. Only the least
       significant seven bits of each byte shall be used for this type
       specification. Bytes with the values listed in the following
       table shall be written using the corresponding names for those
       characters.

       <b>Note:  </b>The <b>"\012" </b>value may be written either as <b>lf </b>or <b>nl</b>.

       The type specifier character <b>c </b>specifies that bytes shall be
       interpreted as characters specified by the current setting of the
       <i>LC_CTYPE</i> locale category. Characters listed in the table in the
       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 5</i>, <i>File Format</i>
       <i>Notation</i> (<b>'\\'</b>, <b>'\a'</b>, <b>'\b'</b>, <b>'\f'</b>, <b>'\n'</b>, <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>) shall
       be written as the corresponding escape sequences, except that
       &lt;backslash&gt; shall be written as a single &lt;backslash&gt; and a NUL
       shall be written as <b>'\0'</b>.  Other non-printable characters shall
       be written as one three-digit octal number for each byte in the
       character. Printable multi-byte characters shall be written in
       the area corresponding to the first byte of the character; the
       two-character sequence <b>"**" </b>shall be written in the area
       corresponding to each remaining byte in the character, as an
       indication that the character is continued. When either the <b>-j</b>
       <i>skip</i> or <b>-N </b><i>count</i> option is specified along with the <b>c </b>type
       specifier, and this results in an attempt to start or finish in
       the middle of a multi-byte character, the result is
       implementation-defined.

       The input data shall be manipulated in blocks, where a block is
       defined as a multiple of the least common multiple of the number
       of bytes transformed by the specified output types. If the least
       common multiple is greater than 16, the results are unspecified.
       Each input block shall be written as transformed by each output
       type, one per written line, in the order that the output types
       were specified. If the input block size is larger than the number
       of bytes transformed by the output type, the output type shall
       sequentially transform the parts of the input block, and the
       output from each of the transformations shall be separated by one
       or more &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       If, as a result of the specification of the <b>-N </b>option or end-of-
       file being reached on the last input file, input data only
       partially satisfies an output type, the input shall be extended
       sufficiently with null bytes to write the last byte of the input.

       Unless <b>-A n </b>is specified, the first output line produced for each
       input block shall be preceded by the input offset, cumulative
       across input files, of the next byte to be written. The format of
       the input offset is unspecified; however, it shall not contain
       any &lt;blank&gt; characters, shall start at the first character of the
       output line, and shall be followed by one or more &lt;blank&gt;
       characters. In addition, the offset of the byte following the
       last byte written shall be written after all the input data has
       been processed, but shall not be followed by any &lt;blank&gt;
       characters.

       If no <b>-A </b>option is specified, the input offset base is
       unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were processed successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       XSI-conformant applications are warned not to use filenames
       starting with <b>'+' </b>or a first operand starting with a numeric
       character so that the old functionality can be maintained by
       implementations, unless they specify one of the <b>-A</b>, <b>-j</b>, or <b>-N</b>
       options. To guarantee that one of these filenames is always
       interpreted as a filename, an application could always specify
       the address base format with the <b>-A </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       If a file containing 128 bytes with decimal values zero to 127,
       in increasing order, is supplied as standard input to the
       command:

           od -A d -t a

       on an implementation using an input block size of 16 bytes, the
       standard output, independent of the current locale setting, would
       be similar to:

           0000000 nul soh stx etx eot enq ack bel  bs  ht  nl  vt  ff  cr  so  si

       Note that this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 allows <b>nl </b>or <b>lf </b>to be used
       as the name for the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV character with
       decimal value 10. The IRV names this character <b>lf </b>(line feed),
       but traditional implementations have referred to this character
       as newline (<b>nl</b>) and the POSIX locale character set symbolic name
       for the corresponding character is a &lt;newline&gt;.

       The command:

       on a system with 32-bit words and an implementation using an
       input block size of 16 bytes could write 18 bytes in
       approximately the following format:

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>od</i> utility went through several names in early proposals,
       including <i>hd</i>, <i>xd</i>, and most recently <i>hexdump</i>.  There were several
       objections to all of these based on the following reasons:

        *  The <i>hd</i> and <i>xd</i> names conflicted with historical utilities that
           behaved differently.

        *  The <i>hexdump</i> description was much more complex than needed for
           a simple dump utility.

        *  The <i>od</i> utility has been available on all historical
           implementations and there was no need to create a new name
           for a utility so similar to the historical <i>od</i> utility.

       The original reasons for not standardizing historical <i>od</i> were
       also fairly widespread. Those reasons are given below along with
       rationale explaining why the standard developers believe that
       this version does not suffer from the indicated problem:

        *  The BSD and System V versions of <i>od</i> have diverged, and the
           intersection of features provided by both does not meet the
           needs of the user community. In fact, the System V version
           only provides a mechanism for dumping octal bytes and <b>short</b>s,
           signed and unsigned decimal <b>short</b>s, hexadecimal <b>short</b>s, and
           ASCII characters. BSD added the ability to dump <b>float</b>s,
           <b>double</b>s, named ASCII characters, and octal, signed decimal,
           unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal <b>long</b>s.  The version
           presented here provides more normalized forms for dumping
           bytes, <b>short</b>s, <b>int</b>s, and <b>long</b>s in octal, signed decimal,
           unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal; <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>long</b>
           <b>double</b>; and named ASCII as well as current locale characters.

        *  It would not be possible to come up with a compatible
           superset of the BSD and System V flags that met the
           requirements of the standard developers. The historical
           default <i>od</i> output is the specified default output of this
           utility. None of the option letters chosen for this version
           of <i>od</i> conflict with any of the options to historical versions
           of <i>od</i>.

        *  On systems with different sizes for <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, and <b>long</b>,
           there was no way to ask for dumps of <b>int</b>s, even in the BSD
           version. Because of the way options are named, the name space
           could not be extended to solve these problems. This is why
           the <b>-t </b>option was added (with type specifiers more closely
           matched to the <i>printf</i>() formats used in the rest of this
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017) and the optional field sizes were
           added to the <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x </b>type specifiers. It is also
           one of the reasons why the historical practice was not
           mandated as a required obsolescent form of <i>od</i>.  (Although the
           old versions of <i>od</i> are not listed as an obsolescent form,
           implementations are urged to continue to recognize the older
           forms for several more years.) The <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, and <b>x </b>types
           match the meaning of the corresponding format characters in
           the historical implementations of <i>od</i> except for the default
           sizes of the fields converted. The <b>d </b>format is signed in this
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to match the <i>printf</i>() notation.
           (Historical versions of <i>od</i> used <b>d </b>as a synonym for <b>u </b>in this
           version. The System V implementation uses <b>s </b>for signed
           decimal; BSD uses <b>i </b>for signed decimal and <b>s </b>for null-
           terminated strings.) Other than <b>d </b>and <b>u</b>, all of the type
           specifiers match format characters in the historical BSD
           version of <b>od</b>.

           The sizes of the C-language types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, <b>long</b>,
           <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>long double </b>are used even though it is
           recognized that there may be zero or more than one compiler
           for the C language on an implementation and that they may use
           different sizes for some of these types. (For example, one
           compiler might use 2 bytes <b>short</b>s, 2 bytes <b>int</b>s, and 4 bytes
           <b>long</b>s, while another compiler (or an option to the same
           compiler) uses 2 bytes <b>short</b>s, 4 bytes <b>int</b>s, and 4 bytes
           <b>long</b>s.)  Nonetheless, there has to be a basic size known by
           the implementation for these types, corresponding to the
           values reported by invocations of the <i>getconf</i> utility when
           called with <i>system_var</i> operands {UCHAR_MAX}, {USHORT_MAX},
           {UINT_MAX}, and {ULONG_MAX} for the types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>,
           and <b>long</b>, respectively. There are similar constants required
           by the ISO C standard, but not required by the System
           Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 or this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017. They are {FLT_MANT_DIG}, {DBL_MANT_DIG}, and
           {LDBL_MANT_DIG} for the types <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>long double</b>,
           respectively. If the optional <i>c99</i> utility is provided by the
           implementation and used as specified by this volume of
           POSIX.1‐2017, these are the sizes that would be provided. If
           an option is used that specifies different sizes for these
           types, there is no guarantee that the <i>od</i> utility is able to
           interpret binary data output by such a program correctly.

           This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that the numeric values
           of these lengths be recognized by the <i>od</i> utility and that
           symbolic forms also be recognized. Thus, a conforming
           application can always look at an array of <b>unsigned long </b>data
           elements using <i>od</i> <b>-t </b><i>uL</i>.

        *  The method of specifying the format for the address field
           based on specifying a starting offset in a file unnecessarily
           tied the two together. The <b>-A </b>option now specifies the
           address base and the <b>-S </b>option specifies a starting offset.

        *  It would be difficult to break the dependence on US ASCII to
           achieve an internationalized utility. It does not seem to be
           any harder for <i>od</i> to dump characters in the current locale
           than it is for the <i>ed</i> or <i>sed</i> <b>l </b>commands. The <b>c </b>type specifier
           does this without difficulty and is completely compatible
           with the historical implementations of the <b>c </b>format character
           when the current locale uses a superset of the
           ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard as a codeset. The <b>a </b>type specifier
           (from the BSD <b>a </b>format character) was left as a portable
           means to dump ASCII (or more correctly ISO/IEC 646:1991
           standard (IRV)) so that headers produced by <i>pax</i> could be
           deciphered even on systems that do not use the
           ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard as a subset of their base codeset.

       The use of <b>"**" </b>as an indication of continuation of a multi-byte
       character in <b>c </b>specifier output was chosen based on seeing an
       implementation that uses this method. The continuation bytes have
       to be marked in a way that is not ambiguous with another single-
       byte or multi-byte character.

       An early proposal used <b>-S </b>and <b>-n</b>, respectively, for the <b>-j </b>and <b>-N</b>
       options eventually selected. These were changed to avoid
       conflicts with historical implementations.

       The original standard specified <b>-t o2 </b>as the default when no
       output type was given. This was changed to <b>-t oS </b>(the length of a
       <b>short</b>) to accommodate a supercomputer implementation that
       historically used 64 bits as its default (and that defined shorts
       as 64 bits). This change should not affect conforming
       applications. The requirement to support lengths of 1, 2, and 4
       was added at the same time to address an historical
       implementation that had no two-byte data types in its C compiler.

       The use of a basic integer data type is intended to allow the
       implementation to choose a word size commonly used by
       applications on that architecture.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations
       with bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in
       this version.
