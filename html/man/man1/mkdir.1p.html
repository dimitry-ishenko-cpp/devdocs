<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mkdir — make directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       mkdir <b>[</b>-p<b>] [</b>-m <i>mode</i><b>] </b><i>dir</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mkdir</i> utility shall create the directories specified by the
       operands, in the order specified.

       For each <i>dir</i> operand, the <i>mkdir</i> utility shall perform actions
       equivalent to the <i>mkdir</i>() function defined in the System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, called with the following
       arguments:

        1. The <i>dir</i> operand is used as the <i>path</i> argument.

        2. The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG,
           and S_IRWXO is used as the <i>mode</i> argument. (If the <b>-m </b>option
           is specified, the value of the <i>mkdir</i>() <i>mode</i> argument is
           unspecified, but the directory shall at no time have
           permissions less restrictive than the <b>-m </b><i>mode</i> option-
           argument.)
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>mkdir</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-m </b><i>mode</i>   Set the file permission bits of the newly-created
                 directory to the specified <i>mode</i> value. The <i>mode</i> option-
                 argument shall be the same as the <i>mode</i> operand defined
                 for the <i>chmod</i> utility. In the <i>symbolic_mode</i> strings,
                 the <i>op</i> characters <b>'+' </b>and <b>'-' </b>shall be interpreted
                 relative to an assumed initial mode of <i>a</i>=<i>rwx</i>; <b>'+' </b>shall
                 add permissions to the default mode, <b>'-' </b>shall delete
                 permissions from the default mode.

       <b>-p        </b>Create any missing intermediate pathname components.

                 For each <i>dir</i> operand that does not name an existing
                 directory, before performing the actions described in
                 the DESCRIPTION above, the <i>mkdir</i> utility shall create
                 any pathname components of the path prefix of <i>dir</i> that
                 do not name an existing directory by performing actions
                 equivalent to first calling the <i>mkdir</i>() function with
                 the following arguments:

                  1. A pathname naming the missing pathname component,
                     ending with a trailing &lt;slash&gt; character, as the
                     <i>path</i> argument

                  2. The value zero as the <i>mode</i> argument

                 and then calling the <i>chmod</i>() function with the
                 following arguments:

                  1. The same <i>path</i> argument as in the <i>mkdir</i>() call

                  2. The value <i>(S_IWUSR|S_IXUSR|~filemask)&amp;0777</i> as the
                     <i>mode</i> argument, where <i>filemask</i> is the file mode
                     creation mask of the process (see the System
                     Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <a href="../man3/umask.3p.html">umask(3p)</a>)

                 Each <i>dir</i> operand that names an existing directory shall
                 be ignored without error.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>dir</i>       A pathname of a directory to be created.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>mkdir</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All the specified directories were created successfully, or
             the <b>-p </b>option was specified and all the specified
             directories either already existed or were created
             successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The default file mode for directories is <i>a</i>=<i>rwx</i> (777 on most
       systems) with selected permissions removed in accordance with the
       file mode creation mask. For intermediate pathname components
       created by <i>mkdir</i>, the mode is the default modified by <i>u</i>+<i>wx</i> so
       that the subdirectories can always be created regardless of the
       file mode creation mask; if different ultimate permissions are
       desired for the intermediate directories, they can be changed
       afterwards with <i>chmod</i>.

       Note that some of the requested directories may have been created
       even if an error occurs.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The System V <b>-m </b>option was included to control the file mode.

       The System V <b>-p </b>option was included to create any needed
       intermediate directories and to complement the functionality
       provided by <i>rmdir</i> for removing directories in the path prefix as
       they become empty.  Because no error is produced if any path
       component already exists, the <b>-p </b>option is also useful to ensure
       that a particular directory exists.

       The functionality of <i>mkdir</i> is described substantially through a
       reference to the <i>mkdir</i>() function in the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017. For example, by default, the mode of the
       directory is affected by the file mode creation mask in
       accordance with the specified behavior of the <i>mkdir</i>() function.
       In this way, there is less duplication of effort required for
       describing details of the directory creation.
