NAME </h2>
<pre>
       taskset - set or retrieve a process's CPU affinity
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>taskset </b>[options] <i>mask command</i> [<i>argument</i>...]

       <b>taskset </b>[options] <b>-p </b>[<i>mask</i>] <i>pid</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>taskset </b>command is used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity
       of a running process given its <i>pid</i>, or to launch a new <i>command</i>
       with a given CPU affinity. CPU affinity is a scheduler property
       that "bonds" a process to a given set of CPUs on the system. The
       Linux scheduler will honor the given CPU affinity and the process
       will not run on any other CPUs. Note that the Linux scheduler
       also supports natural CPU affinity: the scheduler attempts to
       keep processes on the same CPU as long as practical for
       performance reasons. Therefore, forcing a specific CPU affinity
       is useful only in certain applications. The affinity of some
       processes like kernel per-CPU threads cannot be set.

       The CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the lowest
       order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the highest
       order bit corresponding to the last logical CPU. Not all CPUs may
       exist on a given system but a mask may specify more CPUs than are
       present. A retrieved mask will reflect only the bits that
       correspond to CPUs physically on the system. If an invalid mask
       is given (i.e., one that corresponds to no valid CPUs on the
       current system) an error is returned. The masks may be specified
       in hexadecimal (with or without a leading "0x"), or as a CPU list
       with the <b>--cpu-list </b>option. For example,

       <b>0x00000001</b>
           is processor #0,

       <b>0x00000003</b>
           is processors #0 and #1,

       <b>FFFFFFFF</b>
           is processors #0 through #31,

       <b>0x32</b>
           is processors #1, #4, and #5,

       <b>--cpu-list 0-2,6</b>
           is processors #0, #1, #2, and #6.

       <b>--cpu-list 0-10:2</b>
           is processors #0, #2, #4, #6, #8 and #10. The suffix ":N"
           specifies stride in the range, for example 0-10:3 is
           interpreted as 0,3,6,9 list.

       When <b>taskset </b>returns, it is guaranteed that the given program has
       been scheduled to a legal CPU.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all-tasks</b>
           Set or retrieve the CPU affinity of all the tasks (threads)
           for a given PID.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cpu-list</b>
           Interpret <i>mask</i> as numerical list of processors instead of a
           bitmask. Numbers are separated by commas and may include
           ranges. For example: <b>0,5,8-11</b>.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--pid</b>
           Operate on an existing PID and do not launch a new task.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The default behavior is to run a new command with a given
       affinity mask:
           <b>taskset </b><i>mask command</i> [<i>arguments</i>]

       You can also retrieve the CPU affinity of an existing task:
           <b>taskset -p </b><i>pid</i>

       Or set it:
           <b>taskset -p </b><i>mask pid</i>

       When a cpu-list is specified for an existing process, the <b>-p </b>and
       <b>-c </b>options must be grouped together:
           <b>taskset -pc </b><i>cpu-list pid</i>

       The <b>--cpu-list </b>form is applicable only for launching new
       commands:
           <b>taskset --cpu-list </b><i>cpu-list command</i>
</pre> <h2>
PERMISSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A user can change the CPU affinity of a process belonging to the
       same user. A user must possess <b>CAP_SYS_NICE </b>to change the CPU
       affinity of a process belonging to another user. A user can
       retrieve the affinity mask of any process.
</pre> <h2>
RETURN VALUE </h2>
<pre>
       <b>taskset </b>returns 0 in its affinity-getting mode as long as the
       provided PID exists.

       <b>taskset </b>returns 0 in its affinity-setting mode as long as the
       underlying <a href="../man2/sched_setaffinity.2.html">sched_setaffinity(2)</a> system call does. The success of
       the command does not guarantee that the specified thread has
       actually migrated to the indicated CPU(s), but only that the
       thread will not migrate to a CPU outside the new affinity mask.
       For example, the affinity of the kernel thread kswapd can be set,
       but the thread may not immediately migrate and is not guaranteed
       to ever do so:

       $ ps ax -o comm,psr,pid | grep kswapd
       kswapd0           4      82
       $ sudo taskset -p 1 82
       pid 82’s current affinity mask: 1
       pid 82’s new affinity mask: 1
       $ echo $?
       0
       $ ps ax -o comm,psr,pid | grep kswapd
       kswapd0           4      82
       $ taskset -p 82
       pid 82’s current affinity mask: 1

       In contrast, when the user specifies an illegal affinity, taskset
       will print an error and return 1:

       $ ps ax -o comm,psr,pid | grep ksoftirqd/0
       ksoftirqd/0       0      14
       $ sudo taskset -p 1 14
       pid 14’s current affinity mask: 1
       taskset: failed to set pid 14’s affinity: Invalid argument
       $ echo $?
       1
