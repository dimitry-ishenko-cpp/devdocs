NAME </h2>
<pre>
       trace-cmd-set - set a configuration parameter of the Ftrace Linux
       internal tracer
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>trace-cmd set </b>[<i>OPTIONS</i>] [<i>command</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The trace-cmd(1) set command will set a configuration parameter
       of the Ftrace Linux kernel tracer. The specified <b>command </b>will be
       run after the ftrace state is set. The configured ftrace state
       can be restored to default using the trace-cmd-reset(1) command.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-p </b><i>tracer</i>
           Specify a tracer. Tracers usually do more than just trace an
           event. Common tracers are: <b>function</b>, <b>function_graph</b>,
           <b>preemptirqsoff</b>, <b>irqsoff</b>, <b>preemptoff </b>and <b>wakeup</b>. A tracer must
           be supported by the running kernel. To see a list of
           available tracers, see trace-cmd-list(1).

       <b>-e </b><i>event</i>
           Specify an event to trace. Various static trace points have
           been added to the Linux kernel. They are grouped by subsystem
           where you can enable all events of a given subsystem or
           specify specific events to be enabled. The <i>event</i> is of the
           format "subsystem:event-name". You can also just specify the
           subsystem without the <i>:event-name</i> or the event-name without
           the "subsystem:". Using "-e sched_switch" will enable the
           "sched_switch" event where as, "-e sched" will enable all
           events under the "sched" subsystem.

               The 'event' can also contain glob expressions. That is, "*stat*" will
               select all events (or subsystems) that have the characters "stat" in their
               names.

               The keyword 'all' can be used to enable all events.

       <b>-T</b>
           Enable a stacktrace on each event. For example:

                         &lt;idle&gt;-0     [003] 58549.289091: sched_switch:         kworker/0:1:0 [120] R ==&gt; trace-cmd:2603 [120]
                         &lt;idle&gt;-0     [003] 58549.289092: kernel_stack:         &lt;stack trace&gt;
               =&gt; schedule (ffffffff814b260e)
               =&gt; cpu_idle (ffffffff8100a38c)
               =&gt; start_secondary (ffffffff814ab828)

       <b>--func-stack</b>
           Enable a stack trace on all functions. Note this is only
           applicable for the "function" plugin tracer, and will only
           take effect if the -l option is used and succeeds in limiting
           functions. If the function tracer is not filtered, and the
           stack trace is enabled, you can live lock the machine.

       <b>-f </b><i>filter</i>
           Specify a filter for the previous event. This must come after
           a <b>-e</b>. This will filter what events get recorded based on the
           content of the event. Filtering is passed to the kernel
           directly so what filtering is allowed may depend on what
           version of the kernel you have. Basically, it will let you
           use C notation to check if an event should be processed or
           not.

               ==, &gt;=, &lt;=, &gt;, &lt;, &amp;, |, &amp;&amp; and ||

           The above are usually safe to use to compare fields.

       <b>-R </b><i>trigger</i>
           Specify a trigger for the previous event. This must come
           after a <b>-e</b>. This will add a given trigger to the given event.
           To only enable the trigger and not the event itself, then
           place the event after the <b>-v </b>option.

               See Documentation/trace/events.txt in the Linux kernel source for more
               information on triggers.

       <b>-v</b>
           This will negate options specified after it on the command
           line. It affects:

                <b>-e</b>: Causes all specified events to not be traced. This is useful for
                      selecting a subsystem to be traced but to leave out various events.
                      For example: "-e sched -v -e "*stat*"" will enable all events in
                      the sched subsystem except those that have "stat" in their names.
                <b>-B</b>: Deletes the specified ftrace instance. There must be no
                      configuration options related to this instance in the command line.
                      For example: "-v -B bar -B foo" will delete instance bar and create
                      a new instance foo.
               Note: the <b>-v </b>option was taken from the way grep(1) inverts the following
               matches.

       <b>-P </b><i>pid</i>
           This will filter only the specified process IDs. Using <b>-P</b>
           will let you trace only events that are caused by the
           process.

       <b>-c</b>
           Used <b>-P </b>to trace the process' children too (if kernel
           supports it).

       <b>--user</b>
           Execute the specified <b>command </b>as given user.

       <b>-C </b><i>clock</i>
           Set the trace clock to "clock".

               Use trace-cmd(1) list -C to see what clocks are available.

       <b>-l </b><i>function-name</i>
           This will limit the <i>function</i> and <i>function_graph</i> tracers to
           only trace the given function name. More than one <b>-l </b>may be
           specified on the command line to trace more than one
           function. The limited use of glob expressions are also
           allowed. These are <i>match*</i> to only filter functions that start
           with <i>match</i>.  <i>*match</i> to only filter functions that end with
           <i>match</i>.  <i>*match\*</i> to only filter on functions that contain
           <i>match</i>.

       <b>-g </b><i>function-name</i>
           This option is for the function_graph plugin. It will graph
           the given function. That is, it will only trace the function
           and all functions that it calls. You can have more than one
           <b>-g </b>on the command line.

       <b>-n </b><i>function-name</i>
           This has the opposite effect of <b>-l</b>. The function given with
           the <b>-n </b>option will not be traced. This takes precedence, that
           is, if you include the same function for both <b>-n </b>and <b>-l</b>, it
           will not be traced.

       <b>-d</b>
           Some tracer plugins enable the function tracer by default.
           Like the latency tracers. This option prevents the function
           tracer from being enabled at start up.

       <b>-D</b>
           The option <b>-d </b>will try to use the function-trace option to
           disable the function tracer (if available), otherwise it
           defaults to the proc file: /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled,
           but will not touch it if the function-trace option is
           available. The <b>-D </b>option will disable both the ftrace_enabled
           proc file as well as the function-trace option if it exists.

               Note, this disable function tracing for all users, which includes users
               outside of ftrace tracers (stack_tracer, perf, etc).

       <b>-O </b><i>option</i>
           Ftrace has various options that can be enabled or disabled.
           This allows you to set them. Appending the text <i>no</i> to an
           option disables it. For example: "-O nograph-time" will
           disable the "graph-time" Ftrace option.

       <b>-b </b><i>size</i>
           This sets the ring buffer size to <i>size</i> kilobytes. Because the
           Ftrace ring buffer is per CPU, this size is the size of each
           per CPU ring buffer inside the kernel. Using "-b 10000" on a
           machine with 4 CPUs will make Ftrace have a total buffer size
           of 40 Megs.

       <b>-B </b><i>buffer-name</i>
           If the kernel supports multiple buffers, this will add a
           buffer with the given name. If the buffer name already
           exists, that buffer is just reset.

               After a buffer name is stated, all events added after that will be
               associated with that buffer. If no buffer is specified, or an event
               is specified before a buffer name, it will be associated with the
               main (toplevel) buffer.

               trace-cmd set -e sched -B block -e block -B time -e timer sleep 1

               The above is will enable all sched events in the main buffer. It will
               then create a 'block' buffer instance and enable all block events within
               that buffer. A 'time' buffer instance is created and all timer events
               will be enabled for that event.

       <b>-m </b><i>size</i>
           The max size in kilobytes that a per cpu buffer should be.
           Note, due to rounding to page size, the number may not be
           totally correct. Also, this is performed by switching between
           two buffers that are half the given size thus the output may
           not be of the given size even if much more was written.

               Use this to prevent running out of diskspace for long runs.

       <b>-M </b><i>cpumask</i>
           Set the cpumask for to trace. It only affects the last buffer
           instance given. If supplied before any buffer instance, then
           it affects the main buffer. The value supplied must be a hex
           number.

               trace-cmd set -p function -M c -B events13 -e all -M 5

               If the -M is left out, then the mask stays the same. To enable all
               CPUs, pass in a value of '-1'.

       <b>-i</b>
           By default, if an event is listed that trace-cmd does not
           find, it will exit with an error. This option will just
           ignore events that are listed on the command line but are not
           found on the system.

       <b>-q </b>| <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppresses normal output, except for errors.

       <b>--max-graph-depth </b><i>depth</i>
           Set the maximum depth the function_graph tracer will trace
           into a function. A value of one will only show where
           userspace enters the kernel but not any functions called in
           the kernel. The default is zero, which means no limit.

       <b>--cmdlines-size </b><i>size</i>
           Set the number of entries the kernel tracing file
           "saved_cmdlines" can contain. This file is a circular buffer
           which stores the mapping between cmdlines and PIDs. If full,
           it leads to unresolved cmdlines ("&lt;...&gt;") within the trace.
           The kernel default value is 128.

       <b>--module </b><i>module</i>
           Filter a module’s name in function tracing. It is equivalent
           to adding <i>:mod:module</i> after all other functions being
           filtered. If no other function filter is listed, then all
           modules functions will be filtered in the filter.

               '--module snd'  is equivalent to  '-l :mod:snd'

               '--module snd -l "*jack*"' is equivalent to '-l "*jack*:mod:snd"'

               '--module snd -n "*"' is equivalent to '-n :mod:snd'

       <b>--stderr</b>
           Have output go to stderr instead of stdout, but the output of
           the command executed will not be changed. This is useful if
           you want to monitor the output of the command being executed,
           but not see the output from trace-cmd.

       <b>--fork</b>
           If a command is listed, then trace-cmd will wait for that
           command to finish, unless the <b>--fork </b>option is specified.
           Then it will fork the command and return immediately.

       <b>--verbose</b>[=<i>level</i>]
           Set the log level. Supported log levels are "none",
           "critical", "error", "warning", "info", "debug", "all" or
           their identifiers "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6". Setting
           the log level to specific value enables all logs from that
           and all previous levels. The level will default to "info" if
           one is not specified.

               Example: enable all critical, error and warning logs

               trace-cmd set --verbose=warning
