NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rstream - streaming over RDMA ping-pong test.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>rstream</i> [-s server_address] [-b bind_address] [-f address_format]
                      [-B buffer_size] [-I iterations] [-C transfer_count]
                      [-S transfer_size] [-p server_port] [-T test_option]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Uses the streaming over RDMA protocol (rsocket) to connect and
       exchange data between a client and server application.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -s server_address
              The network name or IP address of the server system
              listening for connections.  The used name or address must
              route over an RDMA device.  This option must be specified
              by the client.

       -b bind_address
              The local network address to bind to.

       -f address_format
              Supported address formats are ip, ipv6, gid, or name.

       -B buffer_size
              Indicates the size of the send and receive network
              buffers.

       -I iterations
              The number of times that the specified number of messages
              will be exchanged between the client and server.  (default
              1000)

       -C transfer_count
              The number of messages to transfer from the client to the
              server and back again on each iteration.  (default 1000)

       -S transfer_size
              The size of each send transfer, in bytes.  (default 1000)
              If 'all' is specified, rstream will run a series of tests
              of various sizes.

       -p server_port
              The server's port number.

       -T test_option
              Specifies test parameters.  Available options are:

       s | socket  - uses standard socket calls to transfer data

       a | async - uses asynchronous operation (e.g. select / poll)

       b | blocking - uses blocking calls

       f | fork - fork server processing (forces -T s option)

       n | nonblocking - uses non-blocking calls

       r | resolve - use rdma cm to resolve address

       v | verify - verifies data transfers
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Basic usage is to start rstream on a server system, then run
       rstream -s server_name on a client system.  By default, rstream
       will run a series of latency and bandwidth performance tests.
       Specifying a different iterations, transfer_count, or
       transfer_size will run a user customized test using default
       values where none have been specified.

       Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace, users must
       ensure that they have available system resources and permissions.
       See the libibverbs README file for additional details.
