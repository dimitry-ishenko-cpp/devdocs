       <b>networkctl </b>[OPTIONS...] COMMAND [LINK...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>networkctl </b>may be used to query or modify the state of the
       network links as seen by <b>systemd-networkd</b>. Please refer to
       <a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service(8)</a> for an introduction to the basic
       concepts, functionality, and configuration syntax.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>list </b>[<i>PATTERN...</i>]
           Show a list of existing links and their status. If one or
           more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only links matching one of them
           are shown. If no further arguments are specified shows all
           links, otherwise just the specified links. Produces output
           similar to:

               IDX LINK         TYPE     OPERATIONAL SETUP
                 1 lo           loopback carrier     unmanaged
                 2 eth0         ether    routable    configured
                 3 virbr0       ether    no-carrier  unmanaged
                 4 virbr0-nic   ether    off         unmanaged

               4 links listed.

           The operational status is one of the following:

           missing
               The device is missing.

               Added in version 245.

           off
               The device is powered down.

               Added in version 240.

           no-carrier
               The device is powered up, but does not yet have a
               carrier.

               Added in version 240.

           dormant
               The device has a carrier, but is not yet ready for normal
               traffic.

               Added in version 240.

           degraded-carrier
               One of the bonding or bridge slave network interfaces is
               in off, no-carrier, or dormant state, and the master
               interface has no address.

               Added in version 242.

           carrier
               The link has carrier, or for bond or bridge master, all
               bonding or bridge slave network interfaces are enslaved
               to the master.

               Added in version 240.

           degraded
               The link has carrier and addresses valid on the local
               link configured. For bond or bridge master this means
               that not all slave network interfaces have carrier but at
               least one does.

               Added in version 240.

           enslaved
               The link has carrier and is enslaved to bond or bridge
               master network interface.

               Added in version 242.

           routable
               The link has carrier and routable address configured. For
               bond or bridge master it is not necessary for all slave
               network interfaces to have carrier, but at least one
               must.

               Added in version 240.

           The setup status is one of the following:

           pending
               <a href="../man8/systemd-udevd.8.html">systemd-udevd(8)</a> is still processing the link, we don't
               yet know if we will manage it.

               Added in version 240.

           initialized
               <a href="../man8/systemd-udevd.8.html">systemd-udevd(8)</a> has processed the link, but we don't yet
               know if we will manage it.

               Added in version 251.

           configuring
               Configuration for the link is being retrieved or the link
               is being configured.

               Added in version 240.

           configured
               Link has been configured successfully.

               Added in version 240.

           unmanaged
               <b>systemd-networkd </b>is not handling the link.

               Added in version 240.

           failed
               <b>systemd-networkd </b>failed to configure the link.

               Added in version 240.

           linger
               The link is gone, but has not yet been dropped by
               <b>systemd-networkd</b>.

               Added in version 240.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>status </b>[<i>PATTERN...</i>]
           Show information about the specified links: type, state,
           kernel module driver, hardware and IP address, configured DNS
           servers, etc. If one or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only
           links matching one of them are shown.

           When no links are specified, an overall network status is
           shown. Also see the option <b>--all</b>.

           Produces output similar to:

               ●        State: routable
                 Online state: online
                      Address: 10.193.76.5 on eth0
                               192.168.122.1 on virbr0
                               169.254.190.105 on eth0
                               fe80::5054:aa:bbbb:cccc on eth0
                      Gateway: 10.193.11.1 (CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.) on eth0
                          DNS: 8.8.8.8
                               8.8.4.4

           In the overall network status, the online state depends on
           the individual online state of all required links. Managed
           links are required for online by default. In this case, the
           online state is one of the following:

           unknown
               All links have unknown online status (i.e. there are no
               required links).

               Added in version 249.

           offline
               All required links are offline.

               Added in version 249.

           partial
               Some, but not all, required links are online.

               Added in version 249.

           online
               All required links are online.

               Added in version 249.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>lldp </b>[<i>PATTERN...</i>]
           Show discovered LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)
           neighbors. If one or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified only
           neighbors on those interfaces are shown. Otherwise shows
           discovered neighbors on all interfaces. Note that for this
           feature to work, <i>LLDP=</i> must be turned on for the specific
           interface, see <a href="../man5/systemd.network.5.html">systemd.network(5)</a> for details.

           Produces output similar to:

               1 neighbor(s) listed.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>label</b>
           Show numerical address labels that can be used for address
           selection. This is the same information that <a href="../man8/ip-addrlabel.8.html">ip-addrlabel(8)</a>
           shows. See <b>RFC 3484</b>[1] for a discussion of address labels.

           Produces output similar to:

           Added in version 234.

       <b>delete </b><i>DEVICE...</i>
           Deletes virtual netdevs. Takes interface name or index
           number.

           Added in version 243.

       <b>up </b><i>DEVICE...</i>
           Bring devices up. Takes interface name or index number.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>down </b><i>DEVICE...</i>
           Bring devices down. Takes interface name or index number.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>renew </b><i>DEVICE...</i>
           Renew dynamic configurations e.g. addresses received from
           DHCP server. Takes interface name or index number.

           Added in version 244.

       <b>forcerenew </b><i>DEVICE...</i>
           Send a FORCERENEW message to all connected clients,
           triggering DHCP reconfiguration. Takes interface name or
           index number.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>reconfigure </b><i>DEVICE...</i>
           Reconfigure network interfaces. Takes interface name or index
           number. Note that this does not reload .netdev or .network
           corresponding to the specified interface. So, if you edit
           config files, it is necessary to call <b>networkctl reload </b>first
           to apply new settings.

           Added in version 244.

       <b>reload</b>
           Reload .netdev and .network files. If a new .netdev file is
           found, then the corresponding netdev is created. Note that
           even if an existing .netdev is modified or removed,
           <b>systemd-networkd </b>does not update or remove the netdev. If a
           new, modified or removed .network file is found, then all
           interfaces which match the file are reconfigured.

           Added in version 244.

       <b>edit </b><i>FILE</i>|<i>@DEVICE</i>...
           Edit network configuration files, which include .network,
           .netdev, and .link files. If no network config file matching
           the given name is found, a new one will be created under
           /etc/ or /run/, depending on whether <b>--runtime </b>is specified.
           Specially, if the name is prefixed by "@", it will be treated
           as a network interface, and editing will be performed on the
           network config files associated with it. Additionally, the
           interface name can be suffixed with ":network" (default) or
           ":link", in order to choose the type of network config to
           operate on.

           If <b>--drop-in= </b>is specified, edit the drop-in file instead of
           the main configuration file. Unless <b>--no-reload </b>is specified,
           <b>systemd-networkd </b>will be reloaded after the edit of the
           .network or .netdev files finishes. The same applies for
           .link files and <a href="../man8/systemd-udevd.8.html">systemd-udevd(8)</a>. Note that the changed link
           settings are not automatically applied after reloading. To
           achieve that, trigger uevents for the corresponding
           interface. Refer to <a href="../man5/systemd.link.5.html">systemd.link(5)</a> for more information.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>cat </b>[<i>FILE</i>|<i>@DEVICE</i>...]
           Show network configuration files. This command honors the "@"
           prefix in the same way as <b>edit</b>. When no argument is
           specified, <a href="../man5/networkd.conf.5.html">networkd.conf(5)</a> and its drop-in files will be
           shown.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>mask </b><i>FILE</i>...
           Mask network configuration files, which include .network,
           .netdev, and .link files. A symlink of the given name will be
           created under /etc/ or /run/, depending on whether <b>--runtime</b>
           is specified, that points to /dev/null. If a non-empty config
           file with the specified name exists under the target
           directory or a directory with higher priority (e.g.
           <b>--runtime </b>is used while an existing config resides in /etc/),
           the operation is aborted.

           This command honors <b>--no-reload </b>in the same way as <b>edit</b>.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>unmask </b><i>FILE</i>...
           Unmask network configuration files, i.e. reverting the effect
           of <b>mask</b>. Note that this command operates regardless of the
           scope of the directory, i.e.  <b>--runtime </b>is of no effect.

           This command honors <b>--no-reload </b>in the same way as <b>edit </b>and
           <b>mask</b>.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>persistent-storage </b><i>BOOL</i>
           Notify systemd-networkd.service that the persistent storage
           for the service is ready. This is called by
           systemd-networkd-persistent-storage.service. Usually, this
           command should not be called manually by users or
           administrators.

           Added in version 256.
