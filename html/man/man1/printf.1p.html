SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       printf <i>format</i> <b>[</b><i>argument</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>printf</i> utility shall write formatted operands to the standard
       output. The <i>argument</i> operands shall be formatted under control of
       the <i>format</i> operand.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>format</i>    A string describing the format to use to write the
                 remaining operands.  See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
                 section.

       <i>argument</i>  The strings to be written to standard output, under the
                 control of <i>format</i>.  See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
                 section.

STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>printf</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>
                 Determine the locale for numeric formatting. It shall
                 affect the format of numbers written using the <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>,
                 <b>g</b>, and <b>G </b>conversion specifier characters (if
                 supported).

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>format</i> operand shall be used as the <i>format</i> string described
       in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 5</i>, <i>File</i>
       <i>Format Notation</i> with the following exceptions:

        1. A &lt;space&gt; in the format string, in any context other than a
           flag of a conversion specification, shall be treated as an
           ordinary character that is copied to the output.

        2. A <b>'</b>' character in the format string shall be treated as a <b>'</b>'
           character, not as a &lt;space&gt;.

        3. In addition to the escape sequences shown in the Base
           Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 5</i>, <i>File Format</i>
           <i>Notation</i> (<b>'\\'</b>, <b>'\a'</b>, <b>'\b'</b>, <b>'\f'</b>, <b>'\n'</b>, <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>),
           <b>"\ddd"</b>, where <i>ddd</i> is a one, two, or three-digit octal number,
           shall be written as a byte with the numeric value specified
           by the octal number.

        4. The implementation shall not precede or follow output from
           the <b>d </b>or <b>u </b>conversion specifiers with &lt;blank&gt; characters not
           specified by the <i>format</i> operand.

        5. The implementation shall not precede output from the <b>o</b>
           conversion specifier with zeros not specified by the <i>format</i>
           operand.

        6. The <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, and <b>G </b>conversion specifiers need not
           be supported.

        7. An additional conversion specifier character, <b>b</b>, shall be
           supported as follows. The argument shall be taken to be a
           string that can contain &lt;backslash&gt;-escape sequences. The
           following &lt;backslash&gt;-escape sequences shall be supported:

           --  The escape sequences listed in the Base Definitions
               volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 5</i>, <i>File Format Notation</i>
               (<b>'\\'</b>, <b>'\a'</b>, <b>'\b'</b>, <b>'\f'</b>, <b>'\n'</b>, <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>), which
               shall be converted to the characters they represent

           --  <b>"\0ddd"</b>, where <i>ddd</i> is a zero, one, two, or three-digit
               octal number that shall be converted to a byte with the
               numeric value specified by the octal number

           --  <b>'\c'</b>, which shall not be written and shall cause <i>printf</i>
               to ignore any remaining characters in the string operand
               containing it, any remaining string operands, and any
               additional characters in the <i>format</i> operand

           The interpretation of a &lt;backslash&gt; followed by any other
           sequence of characters is unspecified.

           Bytes from the converted string shall be written until the
           end of the string or the number of bytes indicated by the
           precision specification is reached. If the precision is
           omitted, it shall be taken to be infinite, so all bytes up to
           the end of the converted string shall be written.

        8. For each conversion specification that consumes an argument,
           the next <i>argument</i> operand shall be evaluated and converted to
           the appropriate type for the conversion as specified below.

        9. The <i>format</i> operand shall be reused as often as necessary to
           satisfy the <i>argument</i> operands. Any extra <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>s</b>
           conversion specifiers shall be evaluated as if a null string
           argument were supplied; other extra conversion specifications
           shall be evaluated as if a zero argument were supplied. If
           the <i>format</i> operand contains no conversion specifications and
           <i>argument</i> operands are present, the results are unspecified.

       10. If a character sequence in the <i>format</i> operand begins with a
           <b>'%' </b>character, but does not form a valid conversion
           specification, the behavior is unspecified.

       11. The argument to the <b>c </b>conversion specifier can be a string
           containing zero or more bytes. If it contains one or more
           bytes, the first byte shall be written and any additional
           bytes shall be ignored. If the argument is an empty string,
           it is unspecified whether nothing is written or a null byte
           is written.

       The <i>argument</i> operands shall be treated as strings if the
       corresponding conversion specifier is <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>s</b>, and shall be
       evaluated as if by the <i>strtod</i>() function if the corresponding
       conversion specifier is <b>a</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>g</b>, or <b>G</b>.  Otherwise,
       they shall be evaluated as unsuffixed C integer constants, as
       described by the ISO C standard, with the following extensions:

        *  A leading &lt;plus-sign&gt; or &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; shall be allowed.

        *  If the leading character is a single-quote or double-quote,
           the value shall be the numeric value in the underlying
           codeset of the character following the single-quote or
           double-quote.

        *  Suffixed integer constants may be allowed.

       If an <i>argument</i> operand cannot be completely converted into an
       internal value appropriate to the corresponding conversion
       specification, a diagnostic message shall be written to standard
       error and the utility shall not exit with a zero exit status, but
       shall continue processing any remaining operands and shall write
       the value accumulated at the time the error was detected to
       standard output.

       It shall not be considered an error if an <i>argument</i> operand is not
       completely used for a <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>s </b>conversion.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The floating-point formatting conversion specifications of
       <i>printf</i>() are not required because all arithmetic in the shell is
       integer arithmetic. The <i>awk</i> utility performs floating-point
       calculations and provides its own <b>printf </b>function. The <i>bc</i> utility
       can perform arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic, but
       does not provide extensive formatting capabilities. (This <i>printf</i>
       utility cannot really be used to format <i>bc</i> output; it does not
       support arbitrary precision.) Implementations are encouraged to
       support the floating-point conversions as an extension.

       Note that this <i>printf</i> utility, like the <i>printf</i>() function defined
       in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 on which it is
       based, makes no special provision for dealing with multi-byte
       characters when using the <b>%c </b>conversion specification or when a
       precision is specified in a <b>%b </b>or <b>%s </b>conversion specification.
       Applications should be extremely cautious using either of these
       features when there are multi-byte characters in the character
       set.

       No provision is made in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 which allows
       field widths and precisions to be specified as <b>'*' </b>since the <b>'*'</b>
       can be replaced directly in the <i>format</i> operand using shell
       variable substitution. Implementations can also provide this
       feature as an extension if they so choose.

       Hexadecimal character constants as defined in the ISO C standard
       are not recognized in the <i>format</i> operand because there is no
       consistent way to detect the end of the constant. Octal character
       constants are limited to, at most, three octal digits, but
       hexadecimal character constants are only terminated by a non-hex-
       digit character. In the ISO C standard, the <b>"##" </b>concatenation
       operator can be used to terminate a constant and follow it with a
       hexadecimal character to be written. In the shell, concatenation
       occurs before the <i>printf</i> utility has a chance to parse the end of
       the hexadecimal constant.

       The <b>%b </b>conversion specification is not part of the ISO C
       standard; it has been added here as a portable way to process
       &lt;backslash&gt;-escapes expanded in string operands as provided by
       the <i>echo</i> utility. See also the APPLICATION USAGE section of
       <a href="echo.1p.html">echo(1p)</a> for ways to use <i>printf</i> as a replacement for all of the
       traditional versions of the <i>echo</i> utility.

       If an argument cannot be parsed correctly for the corresponding
       conversion specification, the <i>printf</i> utility is required to
       report an error. Thus, overflow and extraneous characters at the
       end of an argument being used for a numeric conversion shall be
       reported as errors.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To alert the user and then print and read a series of prompts:

           printf "\aPlease fill in the following: \nName: "
           read name
           printf "Phone number: "
           read phone

       To read out a list of right and wrong answers from a file,
       calculate the percentage correctly, and print them out. The
       numbers are right-justified and separated by a single &lt;tab&gt;.  The
       percentage is written to one decimal place of accuracy:

           while read right wrong ; do
               percent=$(echo "scale=1;($right*100)/($right+$wrong)" | bc)
               printf "%2d right\t%2d wrong\t(%s%%)\n" \
                   $right $wrong $percent
           done &lt; database_file

       The command:

           printf "%5d%4d\n" 1 21 321 4321 54321

       produces:

               1  21
             3214321
           54321   0

       Note that the <i>format</i> operand is used three times to print all of
       the given strings and that a <b>'0' </b>was supplied by <i>printf</i> to
       satisfy the last <b>%4d </b>conversion specification.

       The <i>printf</i> utility is required to notify the user when conversion
       errors are detected while producing numeric output; thus, the
       following results would be expected on an implementation with
       32-bit twos-complement integers when <b>%d </b>is specified as the
       <i>format</i> operand:
   ┌─────────────┬─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │             │  <b>Standard   </b>│                                           │
   │  <b>Argument   </b>│   <b>Output    </b>│             <b>Diagnostic Output             </b>│
   ├─────────────┼─────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ 5a          │ 5           │ printf: "5a" not completely converted     │
   │ 9999999999  │ 2147483647  │ printf: "9999999999" arithmetic overflow  │
   │ -9999999999 │ -2147483648 │ printf: "-9999999999" arithmetic overflow │
   │ ABC         │ 0           │ printf: "ABC" expected numeric value      │
   └─────────────┴─────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────┘

       The diagnostic message format is not specified, but these
       examples convey the type of information that should be reported.
       Note that the value shown on standard output is what would be
       expected as the return value from the <i>strtol</i>() function as
       defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. A
       similar correspondence exists between <b>%u </b>and <i>strtoul</i>() and <b>%e</b>,
       <b>%f</b>, and <b>%g </b>(if the implementation supports floating-point
       conversions) and <i>strtod</i>().

       In a locale using the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard as the underlying
       codeset, the command:

           printf "%d\n" 3 +3 -3 \'3 \"+3 "'-3"

       produces:

       3     Numeric value of constant 3

       3     Numeric value of constant 3

       -3    Numeric value of constant -3

       51    Numeric value of the character <b>'3' </b>in the ISO/IEC 646:1991
             standard codeset

       43    Numeric value of the character <b>'+' </b>in the ISO/IEC 646:1991
             standard codeset

       45    Numeric value of the character <b>'-' </b>in the ISO/IEC 646:1991
             standard codeset

       Note that in a locale with multi-byte characters, the value of a
       character is intended to be the value of the equivalent of the
       <b>wchar_t </b>representation of the character as described in the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>printf</i> utility was added to provide functionality that has
       historically been provided by <i>echo</i>.  However, due to
       irreconcilable differences in the various versions of <i>echo</i>
       extant, the version has few special features, leaving those to
       this new <i>printf</i> utility, which is based on one in the Ninth
       Edition system.

       The EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section almost exactly matches the
       <i>printf</i>() function in the ISO C standard, although it is described
       in terms of the file format notation in the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 5</i>, <i>File Format Notation</i>.

       Earlier versions of this standard specified that arguments for
       all conversions other than <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, and <b>s </b>were evaluated in the same
       way (as C constants, but with stated exceptions). For
       implementations supporting the floating-point conversions it was
       not clear whether integer conversions need only accept integer
       constants and floating-point conversions need only accept
       floating-point constants, or whether both types of conversions
       should accept both types of constants. Also by not distinguishing
       between them, the requirement relating to a leading single-quote
       or double-quote applied to floating-point conversions even though
       this provided no useful functionality to applications that was
       not already available through the integer conversions. The
       current standard clarifies the situation by specifying that the
       arguments for floating-point conversions are evaluated as if by
       <i>strtod</i>(), and the arguments for integer conversions are evaluated
       as C integer constants, with the special treatment of leading
       single-quote and double-quote applying only to integer
       conversions.
