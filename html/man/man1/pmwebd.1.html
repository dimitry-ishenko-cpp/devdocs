NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>PCPCompat</b>, <b>pcp-collectl</b>, <b>pmmgr</b>, <b>pmwebd </b>- backward-compatibility
       in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
</pre> <h2>
INTRODUCTION </h2>
<pre>
       The Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a toolkit designed for
       monitoring and managing system-level performance.  These services
       are distributed and scalable to accommodate the most complex
       system configurations and performance problems.

       In order to achieve these goals effectively, protocol and on-disk
       compatibility is provided between different versions of PCP.  It
       is feasible (and indeed encouraged) to use current PCP tools to
       interrogate any remote, down-rev or up-rev <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and also to
       replay any historical PCP archive (the PCP testsuite includes PCP
       archives created over 20 years ago!).

       From time to time the PCP developers deprecate and remove PCP
       utilities, replacing them with new versions of utilities
       providing comparable features.  This page describes replacement
       utilities for historical PCP tools.
</pre> <h2>
PYTHON2 </h2>
<pre>
       PCP provides <b>python</b>(1) interfaces for the <a href="../man3/pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> (Performance
       Metrics API), the <a href="../man3/pmda.3.html">PMDA(3)</a> API (Performance Metrics Domain
       Agents), the <b>mmv_stats_register</b>(3) API (Memory-Mapped Values) and
       PCP archive creation <a href="../man3/logimport.3.html">LOGIMPORT(3)</a> API.

       With <b>python </b>version 2 reaching end-of-life in 2020 we have
       deprecated the <b>python </b>version 2 interfaces in PCP (shipped, but
       no longer supported).  In the next major release of PCP (v7)
       version 2 support will be retired (completely removed).  All PCP
       APIs and <b>python</b>-based tools support <b>python </b>version 3 and have for
       several years - upgrading is strongly recommended.
</pre> <h2>
QT4 </h2>
<pre>
       PCP provides optional graphical user interfaces built on the
       cross-platform Qt library, particularly <a href="pmchart.1.html">pmchart(1)</a> and <a href="pmtime.1.html">pmtime(1)</a>.

       With Qt v4 reaching end-of-life in 2015 we have removed support
       for all versions before Qt v5.  In addition, some features are
       missing in early versions of Qt v5 that are now mandatory when
       building and using PCP Qt tools.  As a result the minimum
       required version of Qt for PCP v6 and beyond is now Qt 5.6.
</pre> <h2>
NSS </h2>
<pre>
       Versions of PCP before v6 used a combination of both Mozilla NSS
       (Network Security Services) and OpenSSL for the encryption
       component of the secure sockets functionality.  Starting with PCP
       v6 this has been simplified into exclusive use of OpenSSL for all
       use of encryption across PCP.  This change affects configuration
       of optional functionality in <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and <a href="../man3/pmapi.3.html">PMAPI(3)</a> client tools
       using secure sockets.

       The net effect of this change is that encryption is configured in
       the same ways, using the same certificates, across the HTTPS
       functionality in <a href="pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a>, as well as the encrypted PCP
       protocol functionality between <b>pmcd</b>, <b>pmproxy </b>and <b>PMAPI </b>client
       tools.  Additionally, the Redis service used by <a href="pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a> and
       <b>pmproxy </b>also exclusively uses OpenSSL, and in a manner similar to
       PCP, which makes administering these services significantly
       simpler.
</pre> <h2>
SAR2PCP, IOSTAT2PCP </h2>
<pre>
       The <a href="sar2pcp.1.html">sar2pcp(1)</a> and <a href="iostat2pcp.1.html">iostat2pcp(1)</a> utilities are deprecated, and
       will be retired in a future version of PCP (v7).  This is being
       replaced by native support for generating PCP archives within the
       tools of the <i>sysstat</i> package (which provides <b>sar </b>itself, as well
       as the <b>sadf </b>utility which produces PCP archives via the <b>-l</b>
       option).
</pre> <h2>
PMLOGCONF-SETUP </h2>
<pre>
       Earlier versions of PCP (prior to v5.1.1) provided a shell script
       that was used internally by <a href="pmlogconf.1.html">pmlogconf(1)</a>, located in the
       <b>PCP_BINADM_DIR </b>directory, named <b>pmlogconf-setup</b>.  This script has
       been retired.  The equivalent functionality remains available in
       the unlikely event it should be needed via the <b>-s </b>or <b>--setup</b>
       option to <a href="pmlogconf.1.html">pmlogconf(1)</a>.

       The version 1 <b>pmlogconf-setup </b>configuration file format (from
       IRIX) was also retired in this release, after more than 10 years
       of automatic transition to version 2 format by <b>pmlogconf</b>.
</pre> <h2>
PMMGR </h2>
<pre>
       The stand-alone PCP daemon manager <b>pmmgr </b>has been retired from
       PCP v5.2.0 onward.  It was phased out in favour of the simpler
       <a href="pmfind.1.html">pmfind(1)</a> service for setting up <a href="pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> and <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
       ``farms'' of discovered PCP collector systems with
       <a href="pmfind_check.1.html">pmfind_check(1)</a>.  The new mechanisms, especially when integrated
       with <b>systemd</b>, require no additional daemons and are better
       integrated with the <b>pmie </b>and <b>pmlogger </b>service management used
       elsewhere in PCP.
</pre> <h2>
PCP-COLLECTL </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pcp-collectl </b>utility has been superseded by <a href="pmrep.1.html">pmrep(1)</a> from PCP
       v5 onward.

       The equivalent of <b>pcp-collectl </b>subsystem reporting is achieved as
       follows:

       <b>pmrep :collectl-sc</b>
              Processor subsystem view.

       <b>pmrep :collectl-sm</b>
              Memory subsystem view.

       <b>pmrep :collectl-sd</b>
              Aggregate disks view.

       <b>pmrep :collectl-sD</b>
              Per-disk-device view.

       <b>pmrep :collectl-dm-sD</b>
              Device mapper view.

       <b>pmrep :collectl-sn</b>
              Network subsystem view.
</pre> <h2>
PCP-WEBAPPS </h2>
<pre>
       The stand-alone web applications packaged with older PCP versions
       have been superseded by <b>grafana-server</b>(1) with the <b>grafana-pcp</b>
       plugin <b><a href="https://github.com/performancecopilot/grafana-pcp">https://github.com/performancecopilot/grafana-pcp</a> </b>.

       This plugin provides an implementation of the Vector application,
       as well as data sources for <a href="pmdabpftrace.1.html">pmdabpftrace(1)</a> (<b>bpftrace</b>(8) scripts)
       and <a href="pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a> (fast, scalable Redis-based time series
       analysis).
</pre> <h2>
PMWEBD </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pmwebd </b>daemon has been superseded by <a href="pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a> from PCP v5
       onward.

       By default, <b>pmproxy </b>will now listen on both its original port
       (44322) and the PCP web API port (44323) when the time series
       support is built.

       <b>pmproxy </b>provides a compatible implementation of the live
       <a href="../man3/pmwebapi.3.html">PMWEBAPI(3)</a> interfaces used traditionally by the Vector web
       application (see the ``PCP-WEBAPPS'' section).  It also provides
       extensions to the original <b>pmwebd </b>REST APIs (such as derived
       metrics, namespace lookups and instance domain profiles), support
       for the HTTPS protocol, and fast, scalable time series querying
       using the <a href="pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a> REST API and <b>redis-server</b>(1).

       The partial Graphite API emulation provided by <b>pmwebd </b>has not
       been re-implemented - applications wishing to use similar
       services could use the scalable time series REST APIs described
       on <a href="../man3/pmwebapi.3.html">PMWEBAPI(3)</a>.
