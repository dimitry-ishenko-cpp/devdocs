</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pstree  </b>shows running processes as a tree.  The tree is rooted at
       either <i>pid</i> or <b>init  </b>if  <i>pid</i>  is  omitted.   If  a  user  name  is
       specified,  all  process  trees rooted at processes owned by that
       user are shown.

       <b>pstree </b>visually merges identical  branches  by  putting  them  in
       square  brackets  and  prefixing  them with the repetition count,
       e.g.

           init-+-getty
                |-getty
                |-getty
                `-getty

       becomes

           init---4*[getty]

       Child threads of a process are found under the parent process and
       are shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.

           icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]

       If <b>pstree </b>is called as <b>pstree.x11 </b>then it will prompt the user at
       the end of the line to press return and  will  not  return  until
       that  has  happened.   This is useful for when <b>pstree </b>is run in a
       xterminal.

       Certain kernel or mount parameters, such as  the  <i>hidepid</i>  option
       for  procfs,  will  hide information for some processes. In these
       situations <b>pstree </b>will attempt to build  the  tree  without  this
       information, showing process names as question marks.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-a     </b>Show command line arguments.  If the command line of a
              process is swapped out, that process is shown in
              parentheses.  <b>-a </b>implicitly disables compaction for
              processes but not threads.

       <b>-A     </b>Use ASCII characters to draw the tree.

       <b>-c     </b>Disable compaction of identical subtrees.  By default,
              subtrees are compacted whenever possible.

       <b>-C     </b>Color the process name by given attribute. Currently
              <b>pstree </b>only accepts the value <b>age </b>which colors by process
              age.  Processes newer than 60 seconds are green, newer
              than an hour yellow and the remaining red.

       <b>-g     </b>Show PGIDs.  Process Group IDs are shown as decimal
              numbers in parentheses after each process name.  If both
              PIDs and PGIDs are displayed then PIDs are shown first.

       <b>-G     </b>Use VT100 line drawing characters.

       <b>-h     </b>Highlight the current process and its ancestors.  This is
              a no-op if the terminal doesn't support highlighting or if
              neither the current process nor any of its ancestors are
              in the subtree being shown.

       <b>-H     </b>Like <b>-h</b>, but highlight the specified process instead.
              Unlike with <b>-h</b>, <b>pstree </b>fails when using <b>-H </b>if highlighting
              is not available.

       <b>-l     </b>Display long lines.  By default, lines are truncated to
              either the COLUMNS environment variable or the display
              width.  If neither of these methods work, the default of
              132 columns is used.

       <b>-n     </b>Sort processes with the same parent by PID instead of by
              name.  (Numeric sort.)

       <b>-N     </b>Show individual trees for each namespace of the type
              specified.  The available types are: <i>ipc</i>, <i>mnt</i>, <i>net</i>, <i>pid</i>,
              <i>time</i>, <i>user</i>, <i>uts</i>.  Regular users don't have access to other
              users' processes information, so the output will be
              limited.

       <b>-p     </b>Show PIDs.  PIDs are shown as decimal numbers in
              parentheses after each process name.  <b>-p </b>implicitly
              disables compaction.

       <b>-s     </b>Show parent processes of the specified process.

       <b>-S     </b>Show namespaces transitions.  Like <b>-N</b>, the output is
              limited when running as a regular user.

       <b>-t     </b>Show full names for threads when available.

       <b>-T     </b>Hide threads and only show processes.

       <b>-u     </b>Show uid transitions.  Whenever the uid of a process
              differs from the uid of its parent, the new uid is shown
              in parentheses after the process name.

       <b>-U     </b>Use UTF-8 (Unicode) line drawing characters.  Under Linux
              1.1-54 and above, UTF-8 mode is entered on the console
              with <b>echo -e ' 33%8' </b>and left with <b>echo -e ' 33%@'</b>.

       <b>-V     </b>Display version information.

       <b>-Z     </b>Show the current security attributes of the process. For
              SELinux systems this will be the security context.
