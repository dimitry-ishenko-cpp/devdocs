NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-replay - EXPERIMENTAL: Replay commits on a new base, works
       with bare repos too
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       (EXPERIMENTAL!) <i>git replay</i> ([--contained] --onto &lt;newbase&gt; | --advance &lt;branch&gt;) &lt;revision-range&gt;...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Takes ranges of commits and replays them onto a new location.
       Leaves the working tree and the index untouched, and updates no
       references. The output of this command is meant to be used as
       input to <b>git update-ref --stdin</b>, which would update the relevant
       branches (see the OUTPUT section below).

       THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --onto &lt;newbase&gt;
           Starting point at which to create the new commits. May be any
           valid commit, and not just an existing branch name.

           When <b>--onto </b>is specified, the update-ref command(s) in the
           output will update the branch(es) in the revision range to
           point at the new commits, similar to the way how <b>git rebase</b>
           <b>--update-refs </b>updates multiple branches in the affected
           range.

       --advance &lt;branch&gt;
           Starting point at which to create the new commits; must be a
           branch name.

           When <b>--advance </b>is specified, the update-ref command(s) in the
           output will update the branch passed as an argument to
           <b>--advance </b>to point at the new commits (in other words, this
           mimics a cherry-pick operation).

       &lt;revision-range&gt;
           Range of commits to replay. More than one &lt;revision-range&gt;
           can be passed, but in <b>--advance &lt;branch&gt; </b>mode, they should
           have a single tip, so that it’s clear where &lt;branch&gt; should
           point to. See "Specifying Ranges" in <a href="git-rev-parse.1.html">git-rev-parse(1)</a> and the
           "Commit Limiting" options below.

   <b>Commit Limiting</b>
       Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using
       the special notations explained in the description, additional
       commit limiting may be applied.

       Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
       <b>--since=&lt;date1&gt; </b>limits to commits newer than <b>&lt;date1&gt;</b>, and using
       it with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt; </b>further limits to commits whose log
       message has a line that matches <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>), unless otherwise
       noted.

       Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting
       options, such as <b>--reverse</b>.

       -&lt;number&gt;, -n &lt;number&gt;, --max-count=&lt;number&gt;
           Limit the number of commits to output.

       --skip=&lt;number&gt;
           Skip <i>number</i> commits before starting to show the commit
           output.

       --since=&lt;date&gt;, --after=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits more recent than a specific date.

       --since-as-filter=&lt;date&gt;
           Show all commits more recent than a specific date. This
           visits all commits in the range, rather than stopping at the
           first commit which is older than a specific date.

       --until=&lt;date&gt;, --before=&lt;date&gt;
           Show commits older than a specific date.

       --author=&lt;pattern&gt;, --committer=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header
           lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression).
           With more than one <b>--author=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose author
           matches any of the given patterns are chosen (similarly for
           multiple <b>--committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>).

       --grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that
           match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more
           than one <b>--grep-reflog</b>, commits whose reflog message matches
           any of the given patterns are chosen. It is an error to use
           this option unless <b>--walk-reflogs </b>is in use.

       --grep=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that
           matches the specified pattern (regular expression). With more
           than one <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose message matches any
           of the given patterns are chosen (but see <b>--all-match</b>).

           When <b>--notes </b>is in effect, the message from the notes is
           matched as if it were part of the log message.

       --all-match
           Limit the commits output to ones that match all given <b>--grep</b>,
           instead of ones that match at least one.

       --invert-grep
           Limit the commits output to ones with a log message that do
           not match the pattern specified with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>.

       -i, --regexp-ignore-case
           Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard
           to letter case.

       --basic-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular
           expressions; this is the default.

       -E, --extended-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular
           expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions.

       -F, --fixed-strings
           Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don’t
           interpret pattern as a regular expression).

       -P, --perl-regexp
           Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible regular
           expressions.

           Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional
           compile-time dependency. If Git wasn’t compiled with support
           for them providing this option will cause it to die.

       --remove-empty
           Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.

       --merges
           Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as
           <b>--min-parents=2</b>.

       --no-merges
           Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is
           exactly the same as <b>--max-parents=1</b>.

       --min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --max-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --no-min-parents,
       --no-max-parents
           Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many
           parent commits. In particular, <b>--max-parents=1 </b>is the same as
           <b>--no-merges</b>, <b>--min-parents=2 </b>is the same as <b>--merges</b>.
           <b>--max-parents=0 </b>gives all root commits and <b>--min-parents=3</b>
           all octopus merges.

           <b>--no-min-parents </b>and <b>--no-max-parents </b>reset these limits (to
           no limit) again. Equivalent forms are <b>--min-parents=0 </b>(any
           commit has 0 or more parents) and <b>--max-parents=-1 </b>(negative
           numbers denote no upper limit).

       --first-parent
           When finding commits to include, follow only the first parent
           commit upon seeing a merge commit. This option can give a
           better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular
           topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be
           only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time,
           and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits
           brought in to your history by such a merge.

       --exclude-first-parent-only
           When finding commits to exclude (with a <i>^</i>), follow only the
           first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This can be
           used to find the set of changes in a topic branch from the
           point where it diverged from the remote branch, given that
           arbitrary merges can be valid topic branch changes.

       --not
           Reverses the meaning of the <i>^</i> prefix (or lack thereof) for
           all following revision specifiers, up to the next <b>--not</b>. When
           used on the command line before --stdin, the revisions passed
           through stdin will not be affected by it. Conversely, when
           passed via standard input, the revisions passed on the
           command line will not be affected by it.

       --all
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/</b>, along with <b>HEAD</b>, are
           listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>.

       --branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/heads </b>are listed on the
           command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given, limit
           branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks
           <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.

       --tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/tags </b>are listed on the
           command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given, limit tags
           to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or
           <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.

       --remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]
           Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/remotes </b>are listed on the
           command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is given, limit
           remote-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob.
           If pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.

       --glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;
           Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i>
           are listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. Leading <i>refs/</i>, is
           automatically prepended if missing. If pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or
           <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.

       --exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;
           Do not include refs matching <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i> that the next
           <b>--all</b>, <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob </b>would
           otherwise consider. Repetitions of this option accumulate
           exclusion patterns up to the next <b>--all</b>, <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>,
           <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob </b>option (other options or arguments do
           not clear accumulated patterns).

           The patterns given should not begin with <b>refs/heads</b>,
           <b>refs/tags</b>, or <b>refs/remotes </b>when applied to <b>--branches</b>,
           <b>--tags</b>, or <b>--remotes</b>, respectively, and they must begin with
           <b>refs/ </b>when applied to <b>--glob </b>or <b>--all</b>. If a trailing <i>/*</i> is
           intended, it must be given explicitly.

       --exclude-hidden=[fetch|receive|uploadpack]
           Do not include refs that would be hidden by <b>git-fetch</b>,
           <b>git-receive-pack </b>or <b>git-upload-pack </b>by consulting the
           appropriate <b>fetch.hideRefs</b>, <b>receive.hideRefs </b>or
           <b>uploadpack.hideRefs </b>configuration along with
           <b>transfer.hideRefs </b>(see <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>). This option affects
           the next pseudo-ref option <b>--all </b>or <b>--glob </b>and is cleared
           after processing them.

       --reflog
           Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed on
           the command line as <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>.

       --alternate-refs
           Pretend as if all objects mentioned as ref tips of alternate
           repositories were listed on the command line. An alternate
           repository is any repository whose object directory is
           specified in <b>objects/info/alternates</b>. The set of included
           objects may be modified by <b>core.alternateRefsCommand</b>, etc.
           See <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>.

       --single-worktree
           By default, all working trees will be examined by the
           following options when there are more than one (see
           <a href="git-worktree.1.html">git-worktree(1)</a>): <b>--all</b>, <b>--reflog </b>and <b>--indexed-objects</b>. This
           option forces them to examine the current working tree only.

       --ignore-missing
           Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as
           if the bad input was not given.

       --bisect
           Pretend as if the bad bisection ref <b>refs/bisect/bad </b>was
           listed and as if it was followed by <b>--not </b>and the good
           bisection refs <b>refs/bisect/good-* </b>on the command line.

       --stdin
           In addition to getting arguments from the command line, read
           them from standard input as well. This accepts commits and
           pseudo-options like <b>--all </b>and <b>--glob=</b>. When a <b>-- </b>separator is
           seen, the following input is treated as paths and used to
           limit the result. Flags like <b>--not </b>which are read via
           standard input are only respected for arguments passed in the
           same way and will not influence any subsequent command line
           arguments.

       --cherry-mark
           Like <b>--cherry-pick </b>(see below) but mark equivalent commits
           with <b>= </b>rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
           <b>+</b>.

       --cherry-pick
           Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another
           commit on the “other side” when the set of commits are
           limited with symmetric difference.

           For example, if you have two branches, <b>A </b>and <b>B</b>, a usual way
           to list all commits on only one side of them is with
           <b>--left-right </b>(see the example below in the description of the
           <b>--left-right </b>option). However, it shows the commits that were
           cherry-picked from the other branch (for example, “3rd on b”
           may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this option, such
           pairs of commits are excluded from the output.

       --left-only, --right-only
           List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric
           difference, i.e. only those which would be marked <b>&lt; </b>resp.  <b>&gt;</b>
           by <b>--left-right</b>.

           For example, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only A...B </b>omits those
           commits from <b>B </b>which are in <b>A </b>or are patch-equivalent to a
           commit in <b>A</b>. In other words, this lists the <b>+ </b>commits from
           <b>git cherry A B</b>. More precisely, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only</b>
           <b>--no-merges </b>gives the exact list.

       --cherry
           A synonym for <b>--right-only --cherry-mark --no-merges</b>; useful
           to limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those
           that have been applied to the other side of a forked history
           with <b>git log --cherry upstream...mybranch</b>, similar to <b>git</b>
           <b>cherry upstream mybranch</b>.

       -g, --walk-reflogs
           Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog
           entries from the most recent one to older ones. When this
           option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that
           is, <i>^commit</i>, <i>commit1..commit2</i>, and <i>commit1...commit2</i>
           notations cannot be used).

           With <b>--pretty </b>format other than <b>oneline </b>and <b>reference </b>(for
           obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two extra
           lines of information taken from the reflog. The reflog
           designator in the output may be shown as <b>ref@{&lt;Nth&gt;} </b>(where
           <i>&lt;Nth&gt;</i> is the reverse-chronological index in the reflog) or as
           <b>ref@{&lt;timestamp&gt;} </b>(with the <i>&lt;timestamp&gt;</i> for that entry),
           depending on a few rules:

            1. If the starting point is specified as <b>ref@{&lt;Nth&gt;}</b>, show
               the index format.

            2. If the starting point was specified as <b>ref@{now}</b>, show
               the timestamp format.

            3. If neither was used, but <b>--date </b>was given on the command
               line, show the timestamp in the format requested by
               <b>--date</b>.

            4. Otherwise, show the index format.

           Under <b>--pretty=oneline</b>, the commit message is prefixed with
           this information on the same line. This option cannot be
           combined with <b>--reverse</b>. See also <a href="git-reflog.1.html">git-reflog(1)</a>.

           Under <b>--pretty=reference</b>, this information will not be shown
           at all.

       --merge
           Show commits touching conflicted paths in the range
           <b>HEAD...&lt;other&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;other&gt; </b>is the first existing pseudoref
           in <b>MERGE_HEAD</b>, <b>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</b>, <b>REVERT_HEAD </b>or <b>REBASE_HEAD</b>.
           Only works when the index has unmerged entries. This option
           can be used to show relevant commits when resolving conflicts
           from a 3-way merge.

       --boundary
           Output excluded boundary commits. Boundary commits are
           prefixed with <b>-</b>.

   <b>History Simplification</b>
       Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for
       example the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are
       two parts of <i>History Simplification</i>, one part is selecting the
       commits and the other is how to do it, as there are various
       strategies to simplify the history.

       The following options select the commits to be shown:

       &lt;paths&gt;
           Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are selected.

       --simplify-by-decoration
           Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected.

       Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful
       history.

       The following options affect the way the simplification is
       performed:

       Default mode
           Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the
           final state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side
           branches if the end result is the same (i.e. merging branches
           with the same content)

       --show-pulls
           Include all commits from the default mode, but also any merge
           commits that are not TREESAME to the first parent but are
           TREESAME to a later parent. This mode is helpful for showing
           the merge commits that "first introduced" a change to a
           branch.

       --full-history
           Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history.

       --dense
           Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a
           meaningful history.

       --sparse
           All commits in the simplified history are shown.

       --simplify-merges
           Additional option to <b>--full-history </b>to remove some needless
           merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected
           commits contributing to this merge.

       --ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]
           When given a range of commits to display (e.g.
           <i>commit1..commit2</i> or <i>commit2 ^commit1</i>), only display commits
           in that range that are ancestors of &lt;commit&gt;, descendants of
           &lt;commit&gt;, or &lt;commit&gt; itself. If no commit is specified, use
           <i>commit1</i> (the excluded part of the range) as &lt;commit&gt;. Can be
           passed multiple times; if so, a commit is included if it is
           any of the commits given or if it is an ancestor or
           descendant of one of them.

       A more detailed explanation follows.

       Suppose you specified <b>foo </b>as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall call commits
       that modify <b>foo </b>!TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME. (In a diff
       filtered for <b>foo</b>, they look different and equal, respectively.)

       In the following, we will always refer to the same example
       history to illustrate the differences between simplification
       settings. We assume that you are filtering for a file <b>foo </b>in this
       commit graph:

                     .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
                    /     /   /   /   /   /
                   I     B   C   D   E   Y
                    \   /   /   /   /   /
                     `-------------'   X

       The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first
       parent of each merge. The commits are:

       •   <b>I </b>is the initial commit, in which <b>foo </b>exists with contents
           “asdf”, and a file <b>quux </b>exists with contents “quux”. Initial
           commits are compared to an empty tree, so <b>I </b>is !TREESAME.

       •   In <b>A</b>, <b>foo </b>contains just “foo”.

       •   <b>B </b>contains the same change as <b>A</b>. Its merge <b>M </b>is trivial and
           hence TREESAME to all parents.

       •   <b>C </b>does not change <b>foo</b>, but its merge <b>N </b>changes it to
           “foobar”, so it is not TREESAME to any parent.

       •   <b>D </b>sets <b>foo </b>to “baz”. Its merge <b>O </b>combines the strings from <b>N</b>
           and <b>D </b>to “foobarbaz”; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.

       •   <b>E </b>changes <b>quux </b>to “xyzzy”, and its merge <b>P </b>combines the
           strings to “quux xyzzy”.  <b>P </b>is TREESAME to <b>O</b>, but not to <b>E</b>.

       •   <b>X </b>is an independent root commit that added a new file <b>side</b>,
           and <b>Y </b>modified it.  <b>Y </b>is TREESAME to <b>X</b>. Its merge <b>Q </b>added
           <b>side </b>to <b>P</b>, and <b>Q </b>is TREESAME to <b>P</b>, but not to <b>Y</b>.

       <b>rev-list </b>walks backwards through history, including or excluding
       commits based on whether <b>--full-history </b>and/or parent rewriting
       (via <b>--parents </b>or <b>--children</b>) are used. The following settings
       are available.

       Default mode
           Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent
           (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse </b>below). If the
           commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow
           only that parent. (Even if there are several TREESAME
           parents, follow only one of them.) Otherwise, follow all
           parents.

           This results in:

                         .-A---N---O
                        /     /   /
                       I---------D

           Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one
           is available, removed <b>B </b>from consideration entirely.  <b>C </b>was
           considered via <b>N</b>, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared
           to an empty tree, so <b>I </b>is !TREESAME.

           Parent/child relations are only visible with <b>--parents</b>, but
           that does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so
           we have shown the parent lines.

       --full-history without parent rewriting
           This mode differs from the default in one point: always
           follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one
           of them. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits
           that are included, this does not imply that the merge itself
           is! In the example, we get

                       I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q

           <b>M </b>was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents.  <b>E</b>, <b>C</b>
           and <b>B </b>were all walked, but only <b>B </b>was !TREESAME, so the
           others do not appear.

           Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible
           to talk about the parent/child relationships between the
           commits, so we show them disconnected.

       --full-history with parent rewriting
           Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME
           (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse </b>below).

           Merges are always included. However, their parent list is
           rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are not
           included themselves. This results in

                         .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
                        /     /   /   /   /
                       I     B   /   D   /
                        \   /   /   /   /
                         `-------------'

           Compare to <b>--full-history </b>without rewriting above. Note that
           <b>E </b>was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list
           of P was rewritten to contain <b>E</b>'s parent <b>I</b>. The same happened
           for <b>C </b>and <b>N</b>, and <b>X</b>, <b>Y </b>and <b>Q</b>.

       In addition to the above settings, you can change whether
       TREESAME affects inclusion:

       --dense
           Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME
           to any parent.

       --sparse
           All commits that are walked are included.

           Note that without <b>--full-history</b>, this still simplifies
           merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only
           that one, so the other sides of the merge are never walked.

       --simplify-merges
           First, build a history graph in the same way that
           <b>--full-history </b>with parent rewriting does (see above).

           Then simplify each commit <b>C </b>to its replacement <b>C' </b>in the
           final history according to the following rules:

           •   Set <b>C' </b>to <b>C</b>.

           •   Replace each parent <b>P </b>of <b>C' </b>with its simplification <b>P'</b>.
               In the process, drop parents that are ancestors of other
               parents or that are root commits TREESAME to an empty
               tree, and remove duplicates, but take care to never drop
               all parents that we are TREESAME to.

           •   If after this parent rewriting, <b>C' </b>is a root or merge
               commit (has zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or
               !TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its
               only parent.

           The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
           <b>--full-history </b>with parent rewriting. The example turns into:

                         .-A---M---N---O
                        /     /       /
                       I     B       D
                        \   /       /
                         `---------'

           Note the major differences in <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>Q </b>over
           <b>--full-history</b>:

           •   <b>N</b>'s parent list had <b>I </b>removed, because it is an ancestor
               of the other parent <b>M</b>. Still, <b>N </b>remained because it is
               !TREESAME.

           •   <b>P</b>'s parent list similarly had <b>I </b>removed.  <b>P </b>was then
               removed completely, because it had one parent and is
               TREESAME.

           •   <b>Q</b>'s parent list had <b>Y </b>simplified to <b>X</b>.  <b>X </b>was then
               removed, because it was a TREESAME root.  <b>Q </b>was then
               removed completely, because it had one parent and is
               TREESAME.

       There is another simplification mode available:

       --ancestry-path[=&lt;commit&gt;]
           Limit the displayed commits to those which are an ancestor of
           &lt;commit&gt;, or which are a descendant of &lt;commit&gt;, or are
           &lt;commit&gt; itself.

           As an example use case, consider the following commit
           history:

                           D---E-------F
                          /     \       \
                         B---C---G---H---I---J
                        /                     \
                       A-------K---------------L--M

           A regular <i>D..M</i> computes the set of commits that are ancestors
           of <b>M</b>, but excludes the ones that are ancestors of <b>D</b>. This is
           useful to see what happened to the history leading to <b>M </b>since
           <b>D</b>, in the sense that “what does <b>M </b>have that did not exist in
           <b>D</b>”. The result in this example would be all the commits,
           except <b>A </b>and <b>B </b>(and <b>D </b>itself, of course).

           When we want to find out what commits in <b>M </b>are contaminated
           with the bug introduced by <b>D </b>and need fixing, however, we
           might want to view only the subset of <i>D..M</i> that are actually
           descendants of <b>D</b>, i.e. excluding <b>C </b>and <b>K</b>. This is exactly
           what the <b>--ancestry-path </b>option does. Applied to the <i>D..M</i>
           range, it results in:

                               E-------F
                                \       \
                                 G---H---I---J
                                              \
                                               L--M

           We can also use <b>--ancestry-path=D </b>instead of <b>--ancestry-path</b>
           which means the same thing when applied to the <i>D..M</i> range but
           is just more explicit.

           If we instead are interested in a given topic within this
           range, and all commits affected by that topic, we may only
           want to view the subset of <b>D..M </b>which contain that topic in
           their ancestry path. So, using <b>--ancestry-path=H D..M </b>for
           example would result in:

                               E
                                \
                                 G---H---I---J
                                              \
                                               L--M

           Whereas <b>--ancestry-path=K D..M </b>would result in

                               K---------------L--M

       Before discussing another option, <b>--show-pulls</b>, we need to create
       a new example history.

       A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is
       that a commit they know changed a file somehow does not appear in
       the file’s simplified history. Let’s demonstrate a new example
       and show how options such as <b>--full-history </b>and <b>--simplify-merges</b>
       works in that case:

                     .-A---M-----C--N---O---P
                    /     / \  \  \/   /   /
                   I     B   \  R-'`-Z'   /
                    \   /     \/         /
                     \ /      /\        /
                      `---X--'  `---Y--'

       For this example, suppose <b>I </b>created <b>file.txt </b>which was modified
       by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X </b>in different ways. The single-parent commits <b>C</b>, <b>Z</b>,
       and <b>Y </b>do not change <b>file.txt</b>. The merge commit <b>M </b>was created by
       resolving the merge conflict to include both changes from <b>A </b>and <b>B</b>
       and hence is not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <b>R</b>, however,
       was created by ignoring the contents of <b>file.txt </b>at <b>M </b>and taking
       only the contents of <b>file.txt </b>at <b>X</b>. Hence, <b>R </b>is TREESAME to <b>X </b>but
       not <b>M</b>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create <b>N </b>is to
       take the contents of <b>file.txt </b>at <b>R</b>, so <b>N </b>is TREESAME to <b>R </b>but not
       <b>C</b>. The merge commits <b>O </b>and <b>P </b>are TREESAME to their first parents,
       but not to their second parents, <b>Z </b>and <b>Y </b>respectively.

       When using the default mode, <b>N </b>and <b>R </b>both have a TREESAME parent,
       so those edges are walked and the others are ignored. The
       resulting history graph is:

                   I---X

       When using <b>--full-history</b>, Git walks every edge. This will
       discover the commits <b>A </b>and <b>B </b>and the merge <b>M</b>, but also will
       reveal the merge commits <b>O </b>and <b>P</b>. With parent rewriting, the
       resulting graph is:

                     .-A---M--------N---O---P
                    /     / \  \  \/   /   /
                   I     B   \  R-'`--'   /
                    \   /     \/         /
                     \ /      /\        /
                      `---X--'  `------'

       Here, the merge commits <b>O </b>and <b>P </b>contribute extra noise, as they
       did not actually contribute a change to <b>file.txt</b>. They only
       merged a topic that was based on an older version of <b>file.txt</b>.
       This is a common issue in repositories using a workflow where
       many contributors work in parallel and merge their topic branches
       along a single trunk: many unrelated merges appear in the
       <b>--full-history </b>results.

       When using the <b>--simplify-merges </b>option, the commits <b>O </b>and <b>P</b>
       disappear from the results. This is because the rewritten second
       parents of <b>O </b>and <b>P </b>are reachable from their first parents. Those
       edges are removed and then the commits look like single-parent
       commits that are TREESAME to their parent. This also happens to
       the commit <b>N</b>, resulting in a history view as follows:

                     .-A---M--.
                    /     /    \
                   I     B      R
                    \   /      /
                     \ /      /
                      `---X--'

       In this view, we see all of the important single-parent changes
       from <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b>. We also see the carefully-resolved merge <b>M </b>and
       the not-so-carefully-resolved merge <b>R</b>. This is usually enough
       information to determine why the commits <b>A </b>and <b>B </b>"disappeared"
       from history in the default view. However, there are a few issues
       with this approach.

       The first issue is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
       <b>--simplify-merges </b>option requires walking the entire commit
       history before returning a single result. This can make the
       option difficult to use for very large repositories.

       The second issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are
       working on the same repository, it is important which merge
       commits introduced a change into an important branch. The
       problematic merge <b>R </b>above is not likely to be the merge commit
       that was used to merge into an important branch. Instead, the
       merge <b>N </b>was used to merge <b>R </b>and <b>X </b>into the important branch. This
       commit may have information about why the change <b>X </b>came to
       override the changes from <b>A </b>and <b>B </b>in its commit message.

       --show-pulls
           In addition to the commits shown in the default history, show
           each merge commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent
           but is TREESAME to a later parent.

           When a merge commit is included by <b>--show-pulls</b>, the merge is
           treated as if it "pulled" the change from another branch.
           When using <b>--show-pulls </b>on this example (and no other
           options) the resulting graph is:

                       I---X---R---N

           Here, the merge commits <b>R </b>and <b>N </b>are included because they
           pulled the commits <b>X </b>and <b>R </b>into the base branch,
           respectively. These merges are the reason the commits <b>A </b>and <b>B</b>
           do not appear in the default history.

           When <b>--show-pulls </b>is paired with <b>--simplify-merges</b>, the graph
           includes all of the necessary information:

                         .-A---M--.   N
                        /     /    \ /
                       I     B      R
                        \   /      /
                         \ /      /
                          `---X--'

           Notice that since <b>M </b>is reachable from <b>R</b>, the edge from <b>N </b>to <b>M</b>
           was simplified away. However, <b>N </b>still appears in the history
           as an important commit because it "pulled" the change <b>R </b>into
           the main branch.

       The <b>--simplify-by-decoration </b>option allows you to view only the
       big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits
       that are not referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME
       (in other words, kept after history simplification rules
       described above) if (1) they are referenced by tags, or (2) they
       change the contents of the paths given on the command line. All
       other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified
       away).

   <b>Commit Ordering</b>
       By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order.

       --date-order
           Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but
           otherwise show commits in the commit timestamp order.

       --author-date-order
           Show no parents before all of its children are shown, but
           otherwise show commits in the author timestamp order.

       --topo-order
           Show no parents before all of its children are shown, and
           avoid showing commits on multiple lines of history
           intermixed.

           For example, in a commit history like this:

                   ---1----2----4----7
                       \              \
                        3----5----6----8---

           where the numbers denote the order of commit timestamps, <b>git</b>
           <b>rev-list </b>and friends with <b>--date-order </b>show the commits in
           the timestamp order: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1.

           With <b>--topo-order</b>, they would show 8 6 5 3 7 4 2 1 (or 8 7 4
           2 6 5 3 1); some older commits are shown before newer ones in
           order to avoid showing the commits from two parallel
           development track mixed together.

       --reverse
           Output the commits chosen to be shown (see Commit Limiting
           section above) in reverse order. Cannot be combined with
           <b>--walk-reflogs</b>.

   <b>Object Traversal</b>
       These options are mostly targeted for packing of Git
       repositories.

       --no-walk[=(sorted|unsorted)]
           Only show the given commits, but do not traverse their
           ancestors. This has no effect if a range is specified. If the
           argument <b>unsorted </b>is given, the commits are shown in the
           order they were given on the command line. Otherwise (if
           <b>sorted </b>or no argument was given), the commits are shown in
           reverse chronological order by commit time. Cannot be
           combined with <b>--graph</b>.

       --do-walk
           Overrides a previous <b>--no-walk</b>.

   <b>Commit Formatting</b>
       --pretty[=&lt;format&gt;], --format=&lt;format&gt;
           Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given
           format, where <i>&lt;format&gt;</i> can be one of <i>oneline</i>, <i>short</i>, <i>medium</i>,
           <i>full</i>, <i>fuller</i>, <i>reference</i>, <i>email</i>, <i>raw</i>, <i>format:&lt;string&gt;</i> and
           <i>tformat:&lt;string&gt;</i>. When <i>&lt;format&gt;</i> is none of the above, and has
           <i>%placeholder</i> in it, it acts as if <i>--pretty=tformat:&lt;format&gt;</i>
           were given.

           See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section for some additional details
           for each format. When <i>=&lt;format&gt;</i> part is omitted, it defaults
           to <i>medium</i>.

           Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the
           repository configuration (see <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>).

       --abbrev-commit
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object
           name, show a prefix that names the object uniquely.
           "--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;" (which also modifies diff output, if it is
           displayed) option can be used to specify the minimum length
           of the prefix.

           This should make "--pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable
           for people using 80-column terminals.

       --no-abbrev-commit
           Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name. This
           negates <b>--abbrev-commit</b>, either explicit or implied by other
           options such as "--oneline". It also overrides the
           <b>log.abbrevCommit </b>variable.

       --oneline
           This is a shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit"
           used together.

       --encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;
           Commit objects record the character encoding used for the log
           message in their encoding header; this option can be used to
           tell the command to re-code the commit log message in the
           encoding preferred by the user. For non plumbing commands
           this defaults to UTF-8. Note that if an object claims to be
           encoded in <b>X </b>and we are outputting in <b>X</b>, we will output the
           object verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the
           original commit may be copied to the output. Likewise, if
           iconv(3) fails to convert the commit, we will quietly output
           the original object verbatim.

       --expand-tabs=&lt;n&gt;, --expand-tabs, --no-expand-tabs
           Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough spaces
           to fill to the next display column that is a multiple of <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>)
           in the log message before showing it in the output.
           <b>--expand-tabs </b>is a short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=8</b>, and
           <b>--no-expand-tabs </b>is a short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=0</b>, which
           disables tab expansion.

           By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent
           the log message by 4 spaces (i.e.  <i>medium</i>, which is the
           default, <i>full</i>, and <i>fuller</i>).

       --notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]
           Show the notes (see <a href="git-notes.1.html">git-notes(1)</a>) that annotate the commit,
           when showing the commit log message. This is the default for
           <b>git log</b>, <b>git show </b>and <b>git whatchanged </b>commands when there is
           no <b>--pretty</b>, <b>--format</b>, or <b>--oneline </b>option given on the
           command line.

           By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in
           the <b>core.notesRef </b>and <b>notes.displayRef </b>variables (or
           corresponding environment overrides). See <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> for
           more details.

           With an optional <i>&lt;ref&gt;</i> argument, use the ref to find the
           notes to display. The ref can specify the full refname when
           it begins with <b>refs/notes/</b>; when it begins with <b>notes/</b>, <b>refs/</b>
           and otherwise <b>refs/notes/ </b>is prefixed to form the full name
           of the ref.

           Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which
           notes are being displayed. Examples: "--notes=foo" will show
           only notes from "refs/notes/foo"; "--notes=foo --notes" will
           show both notes from "refs/notes/foo" and from the default
           notes ref(s).

       --no-notes
           Do not show notes. This negates the above <b>--notes </b>option, by
           resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown.
           Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so
           e.g. "--notes --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar" will only
           show notes from "refs/notes/bar".

       --show-notes-by-default
           Show the default notes unless options for displaying specific
           notes are given.

       --show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;], --[no-]standard-notes
           These options are deprecated. Use the above
           --notes/--no-notes options instead.

       --show-signature
           Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the
           signature to <b>gpg --verify </b>and show the output.

       --relative-date
           Synonym for <b>--date=relative</b>.

       --date=&lt;format&gt;
           Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable format,
           such as when using <b>--pretty</b>.  <b>log.date </b>config variable sets a
           default value for the log command’s <b>--date </b>option. By
           default, dates are shown in the original time zone (either
           committer’s or author’s). If <b>-local </b>is appended to the format
           (e.g., <b>iso-local</b>), the user’s local time zone is used
           instead.

           <b>--date=relative </b>shows dates relative to the current time,
           e.g. “2 hours ago”. The <b>-local </b>option has no effect for
           <b>--date=relative</b>.

           <b>--date=local </b>is an alias for <b>--date=default-local</b>.

           <b>--date=iso </b>(or <b>--date=iso8601</b>) shows timestamps in a ISO
           8601-like format. The differences to the strict ISO 8601
           format are:

           •   a space instead of the <b>T </b>date/time delimiter

           •   a space between time and time zone

           •   no colon between hours and minutes of the time zone

           <b>--date=iso-strict </b>(or <b>--date=iso8601-strict</b>) shows timestamps
           in strict ISO 8601 format.

           <b>--date=rfc </b>(or <b>--date=rfc2822</b>) shows timestamps in RFC 2822
           format, often found in email messages.

           <b>--date=short </b>shows only the date, but not the time, in
           <b>YYYY-MM-DD </b>format.

           <b>--date=raw </b>shows the date as seconds since the epoch
           (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), followed by a space, and then the
           timezone as an offset from UTC (a <b>+ </b>or <b>- </b>with four digits;
           the first two are hours, and the second two are minutes).
           I.e., as if the timestamp were formatted with <b>strftime("%s</b>
           <b>%z")</b>). Note that the <b>-local </b>option does not affect the
           seconds-since-epoch value (which is always measured in UTC),
           but does switch the accompanying timezone value.

           <b>--date=human </b>shows the timezone if the timezone does not
           match the current time-zone, and doesn’t print the whole date
           if that matches (ie skip printing year for dates that are
           "this year", but also skip the whole date itself if it’s in
           the last few days and we can just say what weekday it was).
           For older dates the hour and minute is also omitted.

           <b>--date=unix </b>shows the date as a Unix epoch timestamp (seconds
           since 1970). As with <b>--raw</b>, this is always in UTC and
           therefore <b>-local </b>has no effect.

           <b>--date=format:...  </b>feeds the format <b>...  </b>to your system
           <b>strftime</b>, except for %s, %z, and %Z, which are handled
           internally. Use <b>--date=format:%c </b>to show the date in your
           system locale’s preferred format. See the <b>strftime </b>manual for
           a complete list of format placeholders. When using <b>-local</b>,
           the correct syntax is <b>--date=format-local:...</b>.

           <b>--date=default </b>is the default format, and is based on
           ctime(3) output. It shows a single line with three-letter day
           of the week, three-letter month, day-of-month,
           hour-minute-seconds in "HH:MM:SS" format, followed by 4-digit
           year, plus timezone information, unless the local time zone
           is used, e.g.  <b>Thu Jan 1 00:00:00 1970 +0000</b>.

       --parents
           Print also the parents of the commit (in the form "commit
           parent..."). Also enables parent rewriting, see <i>History</i>
           <i>Simplification</i> above.

       --children
           Print also the children of the commit (in the form "commit
           child..."). Also enables parent rewriting, see <i>History</i>
           <i>Simplification</i> above.

       --left-right
           Mark which side of a symmetric difference a commit is
           reachable from. Commits from the left side are prefixed with
           <b>&lt; </b>and those from the right with <b>&gt;</b>. If combined with
           <b>--boundary</b>, those commits are prefixed with <b>-</b>.

           For example, if you have this topology:

                            y---b---b  branch B
                           / \ /
                          /   .
                         /   / \
                        o---x---a---a  branch A

           you would get an output like this:

                       $ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B

                       &gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b
                       &gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
                       &lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
                       &lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
                       -yyyyyyy... 1st on b
                       -xxxxxxx... 1st on a

       --graph
           Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit
           history on the left hand side of the output. This may cause
           extra lines to be printed in between commits, in order for
           the graph history to be drawn properly. Cannot be combined
           with <b>--no-walk</b>.

           This enables parent rewriting, see <i>History Simplification</i>
           above.

           This implies the <b>--topo-order </b>option by default, but the
           <b>--date-order </b>option may also be specified.

       --show-linear-break[=&lt;barrier&gt;]
           When --graph is not used, all history branches are flattened
           which can make it hard to see that the two consecutive
           commits do not belong to a linear branch. This option puts a
           barrier in between them in that case. If <b>&lt;barrier&gt; </b>is
           specified, it is the string that will be shown instead of the
           default one.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       When there are no conflicts, the output of this command is usable
       as input to <b>git update-ref --stdin</b>. It is of the form:

           update refs/heads/branch1 ${NEW_branch1_HASH} ${OLD_branch1_HASH}
           update refs/heads/branch2 ${NEW_branch2_HASH} ${OLD_branch2_HASH}
           update refs/heads/branch3 ${NEW_branch3_HASH} ${OLD_branch3_HASH}

       where the number of refs updated depends on the arguments passed
       and the shape of the history being replayed. When using
       <b>--advance</b>, the number of refs updated is always one, but for
       <b>--onto</b>, it can be one or more (rebasing multiple branches
       simultaneously is supported).
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       For a successful, non-conflicted replay, the exit status is 0.
       When the replay has conflicts, the exit status is 1. If the
       replay is not able to complete (or start) due to some kind of
       error, the exit status is something other than 0 or 1.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To simply rebase <b>mybranch </b>onto <b>target</b>:

           $ git replay --onto target origin/main..mybranch
           update refs/heads/mybranch ${NEW_mybranch_HASH} ${OLD_mybranch_HASH}

       To cherry-pick the commits from mybranch onto target:

           $ git replay --advance target origin/main..mybranch
           update refs/heads/target ${NEW_target_HASH} ${OLD_target_HASH}

       Note that the first two examples replay the exact same commits
       and on top of the exact same new base, they only differ in that
       the first provides instructions to make mybranch point at the new
       commits and the second provides instructions to make target point
       at them.

       What if you have a stack of branches, one depending upon another,
       and you’d really like to rebase the whole set?

           $ git replay --contained --onto origin/main origin/main..tipbranch
           update refs/heads/branch1 ${NEW_branch1_HASH} ${OLD_branch1_HASH}
           update refs/heads/branch2 ${NEW_branch2_HASH} ${OLD_branch2_HASH}
           update refs/heads/tipbranch ${NEW_tipbranch_HASH} ${OLD_tipbranch_HASH}

       When calling <b>git replay</b>, one does not need to specify a range of
       commits to replay using the syntax <b>A..B</b>; any range expression
       will do:

           $ git replay --onto origin/main ^base branch1 branch2 branch3
           update refs/heads/branch1 ${NEW_branch1_HASH} ${OLD_branch1_HASH}
           update refs/heads/branch2 ${NEW_branch2_HASH} ${OLD_branch2_HASH}
           update refs/heads/branch3 ${NEW_branch3_HASH} ${OLD_branch3_HASH}

       This will simultaneously rebase <b>branch1</b>, <b>branch2</b>, and <b>branch3</b>,
       all commits they have since <b>base</b>, playing them on top of
       <b>origin/main</b>. These three branches may have commits on top of <b>base</b>
       that they have in common, but that does not need to be the case.
