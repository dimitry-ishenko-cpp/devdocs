NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-pull - Pull changes from a remote repository
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg pull</i> [OPTIONS] [repository]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Pull the latest changes from a remote repository.

       The remote repository may be specified on the command line, but
       defaults to branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote from the git configuration, or
       "origin" if not configured.

       This command works by popping all currently applied patches from
       the stack, pulling the changes from the remote repository,
       updating the stack base to the new remote HEAD, and finally
       pushing all formerly applied patches back onto the stack. Merge
       conflicts may occur during the final push step. Those conflicts
       need to be resolved manually.

       See <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> for the format of remote repository argument.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -n, --nopush
           Do not push back patches after pulling

       -m, --merged
           Check for patches that may have been merged upstream.

           When pushing-back patches, each patch is checked to see if
           its changes already exist in the just-pulled upstream
           changes. If a patch’s changes have already been merged
           upstream, the patch will still exist in the stack, but become
           empty after the pull operation.

       --conflicts[=&lt;policy&gt;]
           Either "allow" or "disallow" pushing a patch with conflicts.

           Using <b>--conflicts=allow </b>(or just <b>--conflicts</b>) allows pushing
           a patch that may result in unresolved merge conflicts. The
           patch will be pushed and files with conflicts will be left
           with conflict markers to be resolved manually; or the
           operation undone with <b>stg undo --hard</b>. This is the default
           behavior and also corresponds to the
           "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" variable being set to "true".

           Using <b>--conflicts=disallow </b>disallows pushing any patch that
           would result in merge conflicts. The operation will stop on
           the last patch that can be pushed without conflicts. This
           behavior can be configured by setting
           "stgit.push.allow-conflicts" to "false".
