DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       StGit (Stacked Git) is an application that provides a convenient
       way to maintain a <i>patch stack</i> on top of a Git branch:

       •   The topmost (most recent) commits of a branch are given
           names. Such a named commit is called a <i>patch</i>.

       •   After making changes to the worktree, you can incorporate the
           changes into an existing patch; this is called <i>refreshing</i>.
           You may refresh any patch, not just the topmost one.

       •   You can <i>pop</i> a patch: temporarily putting it aside, so that
           the patch below it becomes the topmost patch. Later you may
           <i>push</i> it onto the stack again. Pushing and popping can be used
           to reorder patches.

       •   You can easily <i>rebase</i> your patch stack on top of any other
           Git commit. (The <i>base</i> of a patch stack is the most recent Git
           commit that is not an StGit patch.) For example, if you
           started making patches on top of someone else’s branch, and
           that person publishes an updated branch, you can take all
           your patches and apply them on top of the updated branch.

       •   As you would expect, changing what is below a patch can cause
           that patch to no longer apply cleanly — this can occur when
           you reorder patches, rebase patches, or refresh a non-topmost
           patch. StGit uses Git’s rename-aware three-way merge
           capability to automatically fix up what it can; if it still
           fails, it lets you manually resolve the conflict just like
           you would resolve a merge conflict in Git.

       •   The patch stack is just some extra metadata attached to
           regular Git commits, so you can continue to use most Git
           tools along with StGit.

   <b>Typical uses</b>
       Tracking branch
           Tracking changes from a remote branch, while maintaining
           local modifications against that branch, possibly with the
           intent of sending some patches upstream. You can modify your
           patch stack as much as you want, and when your patches are
           finally accepted upstream, the permanent recorded Git history
           will contain just the final sequence of patches, and not the
           messy sequence of edits that produced them.

           Commands of interest in this workflow are e.g. rebase and
           mail.

       Development branch
           Even if you have no "upstream" to send patches to, you can
           use StGit as a convenient way to modify the recent history of
           a Git branch. For example, instead of first committing change
           <i>A</i>, then change <i>B</i>, and then <i>A2</i> to fix <i>A</i> because it wasn’t
           quite right, you could incorporate the fix directly into <i>A</i>.
           This way of working results in a much more readable Git
           history than if you had immortalized every misstep you made
           on your way to the right solution.

           Commands of interest in this workflow are e.g. uncommit,
           which can be used to move the patch stack base downwards —
           i.e., turn Git commits into StGit patches after the fact —
           and commit, its inverse.

       For more information, see the <b>tutorial</b>[1].

   <b>Specifying patches</b>
       Most StGit commands have patch arguments. Patches in the stack
       may be specified in a variety of ways. A patch in the current
       branch may simply referred to by its name, or, alternatively, be
       located by a relative offset from the topmost patch (e.g. <b>+3</b>), as
       an absolute index into the stack (e.g. <b>7</b>), or as an offset from
       the last visible patch (e.g. <b>^1</b>).

       Some commands allow you to specify a patch in another branch of
       the repository; this is done by prefixing the patch name with the
       branch name and a colon (e.g. <b>otherbranch:thatpatch</b>).

       Commands that take multiple patch arguments may be supplied with
       patch ranges of the form <b>patch1..patchN </b>as an alternative to
       specifying each patch individually. For example, <b>stg delete</b>
       <b>p0..p4 </b>would be equivalent to <b>stg delete p0 p1 p2 p3 p4</b>. Patch
       ranges may be open on either or both ends. For example, <b>stg</b>
       <b>delete ..p2 </b>would delete the first applied patch up to and
       including patch <b>p2</b>. Alternatively, <b>stg delete p2.. </b>would delete
       patch <b>p2 </b>up to and including the topmost applied patch. And <b>stg</b>
       <b>delete .. </b>would delete all applied patches.

       The complete syntax for locating patches follows:

       <i>&lt;patchname&gt;</i>, e.g. <i>patch</i>
           The name of a patch.

       <i>@</i>
           Refers to the topmost applied patch, or the base of the stack
           if no patches are applied.

       <i>[&lt;patchname&gt;]~[&lt;n&gt;]</i>, e.g. <i>~2</i>, <i>patch~</i>, <i>patch~3</i>
           The &lt;n&gt;th previous patch from the named patch. If &lt;patchname&gt;
           is not supplied, <i>@</i> is implied. A single <i>~</i> represents the
           first previous patch. Multiple <i>~</i> may be specified, e.g.
           <i>patch~~~</i> is the same as <i>patch~3</i>. This is similar to git’s
           revision syntax where <i>&lt;rev&gt;~[&lt;n&gt;]</i> means the &lt;n&gt;th ancestor
           commit from &lt;rev&gt; following first parents.

       <i>[&lt;patchname&gt;]+[&lt;n&gt;]</i>, e.g. <i>+</i>, <i>+3</i>, <i>patch+</i>, <i>patch+3</i>
           The &lt;n&gt;th next patch from the named patch. If &lt;patchname&gt; is
           not supplied, <i>@</i> is implied. A single <i>+</i> represents the next
           patch in the series. Multiple <i>+</i> may be specified, e.g.
           <i>patch+++</i> is the same as <i>patch+3</i>.

       <i>-[&lt;n&gt;]</i>, e.g. <i>-3</i>, <i>-</i>
           References the &lt;n&gt;th previously applied patch. This is
           similar to <i>~&lt;n&gt;</i>, except it is only valid without a patch name
           prefix. Note that certain commands with other options taking
           numeric values may require escaping <i>-</i> with <i>\-</i>, e.g.  <i>\-10</i>.

       <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>, e.g. <i>3</i>
           The patch at absolute index &lt;n&gt; in the stack. This is a
           zero-based index, so <i>0</i> refers to the bottommost patch in the
           stack.

       <i>^[&lt;n&gt;]</i>, e.g. <i>^</i>, <i>^3</i>
           The patch at offset &lt;n&gt; from the last visible patch in the
           stack. This is a zero-based offset, so <i>^0</i> refers to the last
           visible patch in the stack, which is equivalent to just <i>^</i>.
           Negative values of &lt;n&gt; are allowed and refer to hidden
           patches which are after the last visible patch in the stack.

       <i>{base}+[&lt;n&gt;]</i>, e.g. <i>{base}+</i>, <i>{base}+3</i>
           The patch at offset &lt;n&gt; from the stack’s base commit. Since
           the stack base is not a commit, a positive offset is
           required.

       Take note that numeric patch locations of the form <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>, <i>-&lt;n&gt;</i>, and
       <i>+&lt;n&gt;</i>, e.g. <i>3</i>, <i>-3</i>, or <i>+3</i> are also valid patch names. I.e. it is
       possible (but not recommended) to name a patch, for example,
       "-3". In the case where a patch name could also be interpreted as
       a numeric index or offset, the literal patch name will take
       precidence when resolving the patch location.

   <b>Specifying commits</b>
       Some StGit commands take Git commits as arguments. StGit accepts
       all revision specifications that Git does (see <a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>);
       and additionally, the patch specifiers from above. The usual Git
       modifiers, including ^, are also allowed; e.g.
       <b>some-branch:a-patch^^ </b>refers to the grandparent of the commit
       that is patch <b>a-patch </b>on branch <b>some-branch</b>.

       If you need to pass a given StGit reference to a Git command,
       <a href="stg-id.1.html">stg-id(1)</a> will convert it to a Git commit id for you.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following generic option flags are available. Additional
       options are available for (and documented with) the different
       subcommands.

       --version
           Print version information

       --help
           Print help information.

       -C
           Run as if stg was started in <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> instead of the current
           working directory. When multiple <b>-C </b>options are given, each
           subsequent non-absolute <b>-C &lt;path&gt; </b>is interpreted relative to
           the preceding <b>-C &lt;path&gt;</b>.

           This option affects arguments that expect path names or path
           specs in that their interpretations of the path names would
           be made relative to the working directory caused by the <b>-C</b>
           option.

       --color &lt;when&gt;
           Specify when to colorize the output.

           <b>auto </b>(the default) enables colored output only when
           outputting to a terminal or TTY. The <b>NO_COLOR </b>environment
           variable is respected.

           <b>always </b>and <b>never </b>unconditionlly enable/disable colored
           output, respectively.

           <b>ansi </b>forces color to be output using ANSI escape sequences,
           even in a Windows console.

</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION MECHANISM </h2>
<pre>
       StGit uses the same configuration mechanism as Git. See
       <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> for more details.

   <b>Variables</b>
       branch.&lt;name&gt;.stgit.autostash, branch.&lt;name&gt;.stgit.fetchcmd,
       branch.&lt;name&gt;.stgit.pull-policy, branch.&lt;name&gt;.stgit.pullcmd,
       branch.&lt;name&gt;.stgit.rebasecmd
           Branch-specific configuration values. These take precedence
           over the corresponding non-branch specific configuration
           values (see below).

       branch.&lt;name&gt;.stgit.parentbranch
           Specifies the parent branch of a branch with a StGit stack.
           This value is set by <a href="stg-branch.1.html">stg-branch(1)</a> when creating or cloning
           branches, and not typically set by the user. The parent
           branch is used by <a href="stg-pull.1.html">stg-pull(1)</a> when <i>stgit.pull-policy</i> is
           either <i>rebase</i> or <i>fetch-rebase</i> to determine the target of the
           rebase.

       stgit.alias.*
           Command aliases for <i>stg</i>. For example, after defining
           <b>stgit.alias.list = series -d</b>, running <b>stg list </b>is equivalent
           to <b>stg series -d</b>. Arguments are split by spaces and the usual
           shell quoting and escaping is supported. A quote pair or
           backslash may be used to quote them.

           If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point
           (<b>!</b>), it will be treated as a shell command. For example,
           defining <b>stgit.alias.outgoing = !git log @{u}</b>, running <b>stg</b>
           <b>outgoing </b>is equivalent to running the shell command <b>git log</b>
           <b>@{u}</b>. Note that shell commands will be executed from the
           top-level directory of the working tree, which may not
           necessarily be the current directory.  <b>GIT_PREFIX </b>is set as
           returned by running <b>git rev-parse --show-prefix </b>from the
           original current directory. See <a href="git-rev-parse.1.html">git-rev-parse(1)</a>.

           Aliases that would hide existing StGit commands are ignored.

       stgit.autoimerge
           When set to <i>true</i>, if conflicts occur when pushing a patch,
           <a href="git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool(1)</a> is automatically run to attempt to resolve
           the conflicts.

       stgit.autosign
           Automatically add "Signed-off-by:" trailer to commit messages
           for new patches created with <a href="stg-new.1.html">stg-new(1)</a> or lingstg:import[].

       stgit.autostash
           When running <a href="stg-rebase.1.html">stg-rebase(1)</a>, if any modified files are found
           in the working tree, a temporary stash is created with
           <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a> before the operation begins and is applied after
           the operation completes.

       stgit.diff-opts
           Options to pass-through to <b>git diff-tree </b>for <a href="stg-diff.1.html">stg-diff(1)</a>,
           <a href="stg-export.1.html">stg-export(1)</a>, <a href="stg-patches.1.html">stg-patches(1)</a>, and <a href="stg-show.1.html">stg-show(1)</a>. Multiple
           space-separated options may be specified. See
           <a href="git-diff-tree.1.html">git-diff-tree(1)</a> for information about the various available
           options.

       stgit.edit.verbose
           When set to <i>true</i>, the patch’s diff will be shown when
           interactively editing a patch description with, for example,
           <a href="stg-edit.1.html">stg-edit(1)</a>.

       stgit.editor
           Commands such as <a href="stg-edit.1.html">stg-edit(1)</a> and <a href="stg-new.1.html">stg-new(1)</a> open an editor to
           edit the patch description and commit message. The editor set
           by this variable is launched when the <i>GIT_EDITOR</i> environment
           variable is not set. This variable takes precedence over the
           <b>core.editor </b>configuration variable as well as the <i>VISUAL</i> and
           <i>EDITOR</i> environment variables.

       stgit.fetchcmd
           The command specified by this variable will be run by
           <a href="stg-pull.1.html">stg-pull(1)</a> to fetch from the remote repository when
           <i>stgit.pull-policy</i> is <i>fetch-rebase</i>. When not set, the default
           command is <b>git fetch</b>.

       stgit.gpgsign
           A boolean to specify whether StGit stack metadata commits
           should be GPG signed.

           N.B. Set <i>commit.gpgsign</i> to determine whether patch commits
           themselves are GPG signed. See <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> for more
           information about <i>commit.gpgsign</i>.

       stgit.import.message-id
           When set to <i>true</i>, create <i>Message-ID:</i> trailer in the patch
           description of patches imported from email using
           <a href="stg-import.1.html">stg-import(1)</a>.

       stgit.keepoptimized
           When set to <i>true</i>, after pulling changes with <a href="stg-pull.1.html">stg-pull(1)</a>, the
           repository’s object database will be optimized by running
           <a href="git-repack.1.html">git-repack(1)</a>.

       stgit.namelength
           An integer used to determine the maximum length, in
           characters, of automatically generated patch names. The
           default value is <i>30</i>. This option does not affect
           user-specified patch names. Setting to a value less than or
           equal to <i>0</i> will allow automatically generated patch names of
           unlimited length.

           Automatically generated patch names are truncated at word
           boundaries less than or equal to the value of
           <i>stgit.namelength</i>. As a result, patch names will typically not
           be truncated at exactly this number of characters. It is also
           possible for automatically generated patch names to be longer
           than this value if a work boundary cannot be found within
           this bound, or if additional characters need to be added to
           the patch name to make it unique.

       stgit.pick.expose-format
           Format of the commit message for patches picked using the
           <i>--expose</i> option with <a href="stg-pick.1.html">stg-pick(1)</a>. The value of this option is
           as may be specified to the <i>--pretty</i> option of <a href="git-show.1.html">git-show(1)</a>.
           The default is <i>format:%B%n(imported from commit %H)</i>.

       stgit.pull-policy
           Policy used by <a href="stg-pull.1.html">stg-pull(1)</a> for pulling changes from a remote
           repository. Valid values include:

           •   <b>pull</b>, the default, uses <a href="git-pull.1.html">git-pull(1)</a> or <i>stgit.pullcmd</i>, if
               set, to pull changes from the remote repository.

           •   <b>rebase </b>uses <a href="git-reset.1.html">git-reset(1)</a> or <i>stgit.rebasecmd</i>, if set, to
               rebase the patch stack before reapplying patches.

           •   <b>fetch-rebase </b>first fetches commits from the remote
               repository using <a href="git-fetch.1.html">git-fetch(1)</a> or <i>stgit.fetchcmd</i>, if set,
               before performing the rebase as described above.

       stgit.pullcmd
           The command to be run by <a href="stg-pull.1.html">stg-pull(1)</a> to pull changes from the
           remote repository when <i>stgit.pull-policy</i> is <i>pull</i> (the
           default). The default value is <b>git pull</b>.

       stgit.push.allow-conflicts
           A boolean to specify whether <a href="stg-push.1.html">stg-push(1)</a> and other commands
           that push patches will push patches that may result in merge
           conflicts. The default is <i>true</i>, which means that a patch with
           conflicts will be pushed and if the conflicts cannot be
           automatically resolved, the operation will stop and with the
           conflicts left to be resolved manually.

           When set to <i>false</i>, a patch that would have merge conflicts
           will not be pushed, thus leaving the stack on the last patch
           that could be pushed without conflicts.

           This configuration variable may be overridden on the command
           line with either <b>--conflicts[=allow] </b>or <b>--conflicts=disallow</b>.

           N.B.: <i>stgit.autoimerge</i> only has an affect when push conflicts
           are allowed.

       stgit.rebasecmd
           The command to be run by <a href="stg-pull.1.html">stg-pull(1)</a> to set the new stack
           base when <i>stgit.pull-policy</i> is either <i>rebase</i> or <i>fetch-rebase</i>.
           The default is <b>git reset --hard</b>.

       stgit.refreshsubmodules
           A boolean to specify whether <a href="stg-refresh.1.html">stg-refresh(1)</a> includes
           submodules in patch content. This value may be overridden by
           the <i>--submodules</i> or <i>--no-submodules</i> option to <a href="stg-refresh.1.html">stg-refresh(1)</a>.
           By default, submodule content is not included in patch
           content.

       stgit.shortnr
           The number of patches listed by <a href="stg-series.1.html">stg-series(1)</a> when the
           <i>-s</i>/<i>--short</i> option is specified. Defaults to <i>5</i>.

TEMPLATES </h2>
<pre>
       A number of StGit commands make use of template files to provide
       useful default texts to be edited by the user. These <b>&lt;name&gt;.tmpl</b>
       template files are searched in the following directories:

        1. <b>$GITDIR/ </b>(in practice, the <b>.git/ </b>directory in your
           repository)

        2. <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/stgit/templates/</b>

        3. <b>$HOME/.stgit/templates/</b>
