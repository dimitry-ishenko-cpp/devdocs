PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       write — write to another user
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       write <i>user_name</i> <b>[</b><i>terminal</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>write</i> utility shall read lines from the standard input and
       write them to the terminal of the specified user. When first
       invoked, it shall write the message:

           <b>Message from </b><i>sender-login-id</i> (<i>sending-terminal</i>) <b>[</b><i>date</i><b>]</b>...

       to <i>user_name</i>.  When it has successfully completed the connection,
       the sender's terminal shall be alerted twice to indicate that
       what the sender is typing is being written to the recipient's
       terminal.

       If the recipient wants to reply, this can be accomplished by
       typing:

           write <i>sender-login-id</i> <b>[</b><i>sending-terminal</i><b>]</b>

       upon receipt of the initial message. Whenever a line of input as
       delimited by an NL, EOF, or EOL special character (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal</i>
       <i>Interface</i>) is accumulated while in canonical input mode, the
       accumulated data shall be written on the other user's terminal.
       Characters shall be processed as follows:

        *  Typing &lt;alert&gt; shall write the &lt;alert&gt; character to the
           recipient's terminal.

        *  Typing the erase and kill characters shall affect the
           sender's terminal in the manner described by the <b>termios</b>
           interface in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
           <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i>.

        *  Typing the interrupt or end-of-file characters shall cause
           <i>write</i> to write an appropriate message (<b>"EOT\n" </b>in the POSIX
           locale) to the recipient's terminal and exit.

        *  Typing characters from <i>LC_CTYPE</i> classifications <b>print </b>or
           <b>space </b>shall cause those characters to be sent to the
           recipient's terminal.

        *  When and only when the <i>stty</i> <b>iexten </b>local mode is enabled, the
           existence and processing of additional special control
           characters and multi-byte or single-byte functions is
           implementation-defined.

        *  Typing other non-printable characters shall cause
           implementation-defined sequences of printable characters to
           be written to the recipient's terminal.

       To write to a user who is logged in more than once, the <i>terminal</i>
       argument can be used to indicate which terminal to write to;
       otherwise, the recipient's terminal is selected in an
       implementation-defined manner and an informational message is
       written to the sender's standard output, indicating which
       terminal was chosen.

       Permission to be a recipient of a <i>write</i> message can be denied or
       granted by use of the <i>mesg</i> utility. However, a user's privilege
       may further constrain the domain of accessibility of other users'
       terminals. The <i>write</i> utility shall fail when the user lacks
       appropriate privileges to perform the requested action.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>user_name</i> Login name of the person to whom the message shall be
                 written. The application shall ensure that this operand
                 is of the form returned by the <i>who</i> utility.

       <i>terminal</i>  Terminal identification in the same format provided by
                 the <i>who</i> utility.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Lines to be copied to the recipient's terminal are read from
       standard input.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>write</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files). If the
                 recipient's locale does not use an <i>LC_CTYPE</i> equivalent
                 to the sender's, the results are undefined.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error and informative messages written to
                 standard output.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       If an interrupt signal is received, <i>write</i> shall write an
       appropriate message on the recipient's terminal and exit with a
       status of zero. It shall take the standard action for all other
       signals.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       An informational message shall be written to standard output if a
       recipient is logged in more than once.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The recipient's terminal is used for output.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    The addressed user is not logged on or the addressed user
             denies permission.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>talk</i> utility is considered by some users to be a more usable
       utility on full-screen terminals.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>write</i> utility was included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       since it can be implemented on all terminal types. The standard
       developers considered the <i>talk</i> utility, which cannot be
       implemented on certain terminals, to be a ``better''
       communications interface. Both of these programs are in
       widespread use on historical implementations. Therefore, the
       standard developers decided that both utilities should be
       specified.

       The format of the terminal name is unspecified, but the
       descriptions of <i>ps</i>, <i>talk</i>, <i>who</i>, and <i>write</i> require that they all
       use or accept the same format.
