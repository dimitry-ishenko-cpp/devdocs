NAME </h2>
<pre>
       blkparse - produce formatted output of event streams of block
       devices
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>blkparse [ </b><i>options</i> ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>blkparse</i> utility will attempt to combine streams of events
       for various devices on various CPUs, and produce a formatted
       output of the event information.  Specifically, it will take the
       (machine-readable) output of the <i>blktrace</i> utility and convert it
       to a nicely formatted and human-readable form.

       As with <i>blktrace</i>, some details concerning <i>blkparse</i> will help in
       understanding the command line options presented below.

       - By default, <i>blkparse</i> expects to run in a post-processing mode;
         one where the trace events have been saved by a previous run of
         blktrace, and blkparse is combining event streams and dumping
         formatted data.

         blkparse may be run in a live manner concurrently with blktrace
         by specifying <b>-i - </b>to blkparse, and combining it with the live
         option for blktrace.  An example would be:

            % blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -i -

       - You can set how many blkparse batches event reads via the <b>-b</b>
         option, the default is to handle events in batches of 512.

       - If you have saved event traces in blktrace with different
         output names (via the <b>-o </b>option to blktrace), you must specify
         the same input name via the <b>-i </b>option.

       - The format of the output data can be controlled via the <b>-f </b>or
         <b>-F </b>options -- see OUTPUT DESCRIPTION AND FORMATTING for
         details.

       By default, blkparse sends formatted data to standard output.
       This may be changed via the <b>-o </b>option, or text output can be
       disabled via the <b>-O </b>option. A merged binary stream can be
       produced using the <b>-d </b>option.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -A <i>hex-mask</i>
       --set-mask=<i>hex-mask</i>
              Set filter mask to <i>hex-mask</i>, see blktrace (8) for masks

       -a <i>mask</i>
       --act-mask=<i>mask</i>
              Add <i>mask</i> to current filter, see blktrace (8) for masks

       -D <i>dir</i>
       --input-directory=<i>dir</i>
              Prepend <i>dir</i> to input file names

       -b <i>batch</i>
       --batch={batch}
              Standard input read batching

       -i <i>file</i>
       --input=<i>file</i>
              Specifies base name for input files -- default is
              <i>device</i>.blktrace.<i>cpu</i>.

              As noted above, specifying <b>-i - </b>runs in live mode with
              blktrace (reading data from standard in).

       -F <i>typ,fmt</i>
       --format=<i>typ,fmt</i>
       -f <i>fmt</i>
       --format-spec=<i>fmt</i>
              Sets output format (See OUTPUT DESCRIPTION AND FORMATTING
              for details.)

              The -f form specifies a format for all events

              The -F form allows one to specify a format for a specific
              event type. The single-character <i>typ</i> field is one of the
              action specifiers described in ACTION IDENTIFIERS.

       -M
       --no-msgs
              When -d is specified, this will stop messages from being
              output to the file. (Can seriously reduce the size of the
              resultant file when using the CFQ I/O scheduler.)

       -h
       --hash-by-name
              Hash processes by name, not by PID

       -o <i>file</i>
       --output=<i>file</i>
              Output file

       -O
       --no-text-output
              Do <i>not</i> produce text output, used for binary (<b>-d</b>) only

       -d <i>file</i>
       --dump-binary=<i>file</i>
              Binary output file

       -q
       --quiet
              Quiet mode

       -s
       --per-program-stats
              Displays data sorted by program

       -S <i>event</i>
       --sort-program-stats=<i>event</i>
              Displays each program's data sorted by program name or io
              event, like Queued, Read, Write and Complete. When -S is
              specified the -s will be ignored.  The capital letters
              Q,R,W,C stand for KB, then q/r/w/c stand for IO.

              If you want to soct programs by how many data they queued,
              you can use:

              blkparse -i sda.blktrace. -q -S Q -o sda.parse

       -t
       --track-ios
              Display time deltas per IO

       -w <i>span</i>
       --stopwatch=<i>span</i>
              Display traces for the <i>span</i> specified -- where span can
              be:
              <i>end-time</i> -- Display traces from time 0 through <i>end-time</i>
              (in ns)
              or
              <i>start:end-time</i> -- Display traces from time <i>start</i> through
              end-time (in ns).

       -v
       --verbose
              More verbose marginal on marginal errors

       -V
       --version
              Display version
</pre> <h2>
TRACE ACTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following trace actions are recognised:

       <b>C -- complete </b>A previously issued request has been completed.
           The output will detail the sector and size of that request,
           as well as the success or failure of it.

       <b>D -- issued </b>A request that previously resided on the block layer
           queue or in the i/o scheduler has been sent to the driver.

       <b>I -- inserted </b>A request is being sent to the i/o scheduler for
           addition to the internal queue and later service by the
           driver. The request is fully formed at this time.

       <b>Q -- queued </b>This notes intent to queue i/o at the given location.
           No real requests exists yet.

       <b>B -- bounced </b>The data pages attached to this <i>bio</i> are not
           reachable by the hardware and must be bounced to a lower
           memory location. This causes a big slowdown in i/o
           performance, since the data must be copied to/from kernel
           buffers. Usually this can be fixed with using better hardware
           -- either a better i/o controller, or a platform with an
           IOMMU.

       <b>M -- back merge </b>A previously inserted request exists that ends on
           the boundary of where this i/o begins, so the i/o scheduler
           can merge them together.

       <b>F -- front merge </b>Same as the back merge, except this i/o ends
           where a previously inserted requests starts.

       <b>M -- front or back merge </b>One of the above.

       <b>G -- get request </b>To send any type of request to a block device, a
           <i>struct request</i> container must be allocated first.

       <b>S -- sleep </b>No available request structures were available, so the
           issuer has to wait for one to be freed.

       <b>P -- plug </b>When i/o is queued to a previously empty block device
           queue, Linux will plug the queue in anticipation of future
           ios being added before this data is needed.

       <b>U -- unplug </b>Some request data already queued in the device, start
           sending requests to the driver. This may happen automatically
           if a timeout period has passed (see next entry) or if a
           number of requests have been added to the queue.

       <b>T -- unplug due to timer </b>If nobody requests the i/o that was
           queued after plugging the queue, Linux will automatically
           unplug it after a defined period has passed.

       <b>X -- split </b>On raid or device mapper setups, an incoming i/o may
           straddle a device or internal zone and needs to be chopped up
           into smaller pieces for service. This may indicate a
           performance problem due to a bad setup of that raid/dm
           device, but may also just be part of normal boundary
           conditions. dm is notably bad at this and will clone lots of
           i/o.

       <b>A -- remap </b>For stacked devices, incoming i/o is remapped to
           device below it in the i/o stack. The remap action details
           what exactly is being remapped to what.

       <b>R -- requeue </b>Put a request back on queue.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT DESCRIPTION AND FORMATTING </h2>
<pre>
       The output from blkparse can be tailored for specific use -- in
       particular, to ease parsing of output, and/or limit output fields
       to those the user wants to see. The data for fields which can be
       output include:

       <b>a   </b>Action, a (small) string (1 or 2 characters) -- see table
           below for more details

       <b>c   </b>CPU id

       <b>C   </b>Command

       <b>d   </b>RWBS field, a (small) string (1-3 characters)  -- see section
           below for more details

       <b>D   </b>7-character string containing the major and minor numbers of
           the event's device (separated by a comma).

       <b>e   </b>Error value

       <b>g   </b>Cgroup identifier of the cgroup that generated the IO. Note
           that this requires appropriate kernel support (kernel version
           at least 4.14).

       <b>m   </b>Minor number of event's device.

       <b>M   </b>Major number of event's device.

       <b>n   </b>Number of blocks

       <b>N   </b>Number of bytes

       <b>p   </b>Process ID

       <b>P   </b>Display packet data -- series of hexadecimal values

       <b>s   </b>Sequence numbers

       <b>S   </b>Sector number

       <b>t   </b>Time stamp (nanoseconds)

       <b>T   </b>Time stamp (seconds)

       <b>u   </b>Elapsed value in microseconds (<i>-t</i> command line option)

       <b>U   </b>Payload unsigned integer

       <b>z   </b>The absolute time, as local time in your time zone, with no
           date displayed

       Note that the user can optionally specify field display width,
       and optionally a left-aligned specifier. These precede field
       specifiers, with a '%' character, followed by the optional left-
       alignment specifier (-) followed by the width (a decimal number)
       and then the field.

       Thus, to specify the command in a 12-character field that is left
       aligned:

           -f "%-12C"
</pre> <h2>
ACTION IDENTIFIERS </h2>
<pre>
       The following table shows the various actions which may be
       output:

       A      IO was remapped to a different device

       B      IO bounced

       C      IO completion

       D      IO issued to driver

       F      IO front merged with request on queue

       G      Get request

       I      IO inserted onto request queue

       M      IO back merged with request on queue

       P      Plug request

       Q      IO handled by request queue code

       S      Sleep request

       T      Unplug due to timeout

       U      Unplug request

       X      Split
</pre> <h2>
RWBS DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This is a small string containing at least one character ('R' for
       read, 'W' for write, or 'D' for block discard operation), and
       optionally either a 'B' (for barrier operations) or 'S' (for
       synchronous operations).
</pre> <h2>
DEFAULT OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       The standard header (or initial fields displayed) include:

           "%D %2c %8s %5T.%9t %5p %2a %3d"

       Breaking this down:

       <b>%D     </b>Displays the event's device major/minor as: %3d,%-3d.

       <b>%2c    </b>CPU ID (2-character field).

       <b>%8s    </b>Sequence number

       <b>%5T.%9t</b>
              5-character field for the seconds portion of the time
              stamp and a 9-character field for the nanoseconds in the
              time stamp.

       <b>%5p    </b>5-character field for the process ID.

       <b>%2a    </b>2-character field for one of the actions.

       <b>%3d    </b>3-character field for the RWBS data.

              Seeing this in action:

                  8,0    3        1     0.000000000   697  G   W 223490
              + 8 [kjournald]

              The header is the data in this line up to the 223490
              (starting block).  The default output for all event types
              includes this header.
</pre> <h2>
DEFAULT OUTPUT PER ACTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>C -- complete</b>
           If a payload is present, this is presented between
           parenthesis following the header, followed by the error
           value.

           If no payload is present, the sector and number of blocks are
           presented (with an intervening plus (+) character). If the <b>-t</b>
           option was specified, then the elapsed time is presented. In
           either case, it is followed by the error value for the
           completion.

       <b>B -- bounced</b>
       <b>D -- issued</b>
       <b>I -- inserted</b>
       <b>Q -- queued</b>
           If a payload is present, the number of payload bytes is
           output, followed by the payload in hexadecimal between
           parenthesis.

           If no payload is present, the sector and number of blocks are
           presented (with an intervening plus (+) character). If the <b>-t</b>
           option was specified, then the elapsed time is presented (in
           parenthesis). In either case, it is followed by the command
           associated with the event (surrounded by square brackets).

       <b>F -- front merge</b>
       <b>G -- get request</b>
       <b>M -- back merge</b>
       <b>S -- sleep</b>
           The starting sector and number of blocks is output (with an
           intervening plus (+) character), followed by the command
           associated with the event (surrounded by square brackets).

       <b>P -- plug</b>
           The command associated with the event (surrounded by square
           brackets) is output.

       <b>U -- unplug</b>
       <b>T -- unplug due to timer</b>
           The command associated with the event (surrounded by square
           brackets) is output, followed by the number of requests
           outstanding.

       <b>X -- split</b>
           The original starting sector followed by the new sector
           (separated by a slash (/) is output, followed by the command
           associated with the event (surrounded by square brackets).

       <b>A -- remap</b>
           Sector and length is output, along with the original device
           and sector offset.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To trace the i/o on the device <i>/dev/sda</i> <b>and parse the output to</b>
       <b>human readable form, use the following command:</b>

           <b>% blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -i -</b>

       <b>(see </b><i>blktrace</i> (8) for more information).  This same behaviour can
       be achieve with the convenience script <i>btrace</i>.  The command

           % btrace /dev/sda

       has exactly the same effect as the previous command. See <i>btrace</i>
       (8) for more information.

       To trace the i/o on a device and save the output for later
       processing with <i>blkparse</i>, use <i>blktrace</i> like this:

           % blktrace /dev/sda /dev/sdb

       This will trace i/o on the devices <i>/dev/sda</i> and <i>/dev/sdb</i> and save
       the recorded information in the files <i>sda</i> and <i>sdb</i> in the current
       directory, for the two different devices, respectively.  This
       trace information can later be parsed by the <i>blkparse</i> utility:

           % blkparse sda sdb

       which will output the previously recorded tracing information in
       human readable form to stdout.
