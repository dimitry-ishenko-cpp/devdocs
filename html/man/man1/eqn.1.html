Description </h2>
<pre>
       The GNU implementation of <i>eqn</i> is part of the <i>groff</i>(7) document
       formatting system.  <i>eqn</i> is a <i>troff</i>(1) preprocessor that
       translates expressions in its own language, embedded in <i>roff</i>(7)
       input files, into mathematical notation typeset by <i>troff</i>(1).  It
       copies each <i>file</i>'s contents to the standard output stream,
       translating each <i>equation</i> between lines starting with <b>.EQ </b>and
       <b>.EN</b>, or within a pair of user-specified delimiters.  Normally,
       <i>eqn</i> is not executed directly by the user, but invoked by
       specifying the <b>-e </b>option to <i>groff</i>(1).  While GNU <i>eqn</i>'s input
       syntax is highly compatible with AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i>, the output <i>eqn</i>
       produces cannot be processed by AT&amp;T <i>troff</i>; GNU <i>troff</i> (or a <i>troff</i>
       implementing relevant GNU extensions) must be used.  If no <i>file</i>
       operands are present, or if <i>file</i> is “<b>-</b>”, <i>eqn</i> reads the standard
       input stream.

       Unless the <b>-R </b>option is used, <i>eqn</i> searches for the file <i>eqnrc</i> in
       the directories given with the <b>-M </b>option first, then in <i>/usr/</i>
       <i>local/share/groff/site-tmac</i>, and finally in the standard macro
       directory <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac</i>.  If it exists and
       is readable, <i>eqn</i> processes it before any input files.

       This man page primarily discusses the differences between GNU <i>eqn</i>
       and AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i>.  Most of the new features of the GNU <i>eqn</i> input
       language are based on TeX.  There are some references to the
       differences between TeX and GNU <i>eqn</i> below; these may safely be
       ignored if you do not know TeX.  Four points are worth note.

       •  GNU <i>eqn</i> emits Presentation MathML output when invoked with the
          “<b>-T MathML</b>” option.

       •  GNU <i>eqn</i> does not support terminal devices well, though it may
          suffice for simple inputs.

       •  GNU <i>eqn</i> sets the input token “<b>...</b>” as an ellipsis on the text
          baseline, not the three centered dots of AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i>.  Set an
          ellipsis on the math axis with the GNU extension macro <b>cdots</b>.

       •  GNU <i>eqn</i>'s <b>delim </b>command does not treat an “<b>on</b>” argument as a
          pair of equation delimiters.

   <b>Anatomy of an equation</b>
       <i>eqn</i> input consists of tokens.  Consider a form of Newton's second
       law of motion.  The input

              .EQ
              F =
              m a
              .EN

       becomes <i>F</i>=<i>ma</i>.  Each of <b>F</b>, <b>=</b>, <b>m</b>, and <b>a </b>is a token.  Spaces and
       newlines are interchangeable; they separate tokens but do not
       break lines or produce space in the output.

       Beyond their primary functions, the following input characters
       separate tokens as well.

       <b>{ }    </b>Braces perform grouping.  Whereas “<b>e sup a b</b>” expresses
              “(<i>e</i> to the <i>a</i>) times <i>b</i>”, “<b>e sup { a b }</b>” means “<i>e</i> to
              the (<i>a</i> times <i>b</i>)”.  When immediately preceded by a “<b>left</b>”
              or “<b>right</b>” primitive, a brace loses its special meaning.

       <b>^ ~    </b>are the <i>half space</i> and <i>full space,</i> respectively.  Use them
              to tune the appearance of the output.

       Tab and leader characters separate tokens as well as advancing
       the drawing position to the next tab stop, but are seldom used in
       <i>eqn</i> input.  When they occur, they must appear at the outermost
       lexical scope.  This roughly means that they can't appear within
       braces that are necessary to disambiguate the input; <i>eqn</i> will
       diagnose an error in this event.  (See subsection “Macros” below
       for additional token separation rules.)

       Other tokens are primitives, macros, an argument to either of the
       foregoing, or components of an equation.

       <i>Primitives</i> are fundamental keywords of the <i>eqn</i> language.  They
       can configure an aspect of the preprocessor's state, as when
       setting a “global” font selection or type size (<b>gifont </b>and
       <b>gsize</b>), or declaring or deleting macros (“<b>define</b>” and <b>undef</b>);
       these are termed <i>commands.</i>  Other primitives perform formatting
       operations on the tokens around them (as with <b>fat</b>, <b>over</b>, <b>sqrt</b>, or
       <b>up</b>).

       Equation <i>components</i> include mathematical variables, constants,
       numeric literals, and operators.  <i>eqn</i> remaps some input character
       sequences to <i>groff</i> special character escape sequences for economy
       in equation entry and to ensure that glyphs from an unstyled font
       are used; see <i>groff_char</i>(7).

              +   \[pl]                '    \[fm]
              -   \[mi]                &lt;=   \[&lt;=]
              =   \[eq]                &gt;=   \[&gt;=]

       <i>Macros</i> permit primitives, components, and other macros to be
       collected and used together as a single token.  Predefined macros
       make convenient the preparation of <i>eqn</i> input in a form resembling
       its spoken expression; for example, consider <b>cos</b>, <b>hat</b>, <b>inf</b>, and
       <b>lim</b>.

   <b>Spacing and typeface</b>
       GNU <i>eqn</i> imputes types to the components of an equation, adjusting
       the spacing between them accordingly.  Recognized types are as
       follows; most affect spacing only, whereas the “<b>letter</b>” subtype
       of “<b>ordinary</b>” also assigns a style.

         ordinary      character such as “1”, “a”, or “!”
           letter      character to be italicized by default
           digit       <i>n/a</i>
         operator      large operator such as “Σ”
         binary        binary operator such as “+”
         relation      relational operator such as “=”
         opening       opening bracket such as “(”
         closing       closing bracket such as “)”
         punctuation   punctuation character such as “,”
         inner         sub-formula contained within brackets
         suppress      component to which automatic spacing is not applied

       Two primitives apply types to equation components.

       <b>type </b><i>t e</i>
              Apply type <i>t</i> to expression <i>e</i>.

       <b>chartype </b><i>t text</i>
              Assign each character in (unquoted) <i>text</i> type <i>t</i>,
              persistently.

       <i>eqn</i> sets up spacings and styles as if by the following commands.

              chartype "letter"      abcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxyz
              chartype "letter"      ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
              chartype "letter"      \[*a]\[*b]\[*g]\[*d]\[*e]\[*z]
              chartype "letter"      \[*y]\[*h]\[*i]\[*k]\[*l]\[*m]
              chartype "letter"      \[*n]\[*c]\[*o]\[*p]\[*r]\[*s]
              chartype "letter"      \[*t]\[*u]\[*f]\[*x]\[*q]\[*w]
              chartype "binary"      *\[pl]\[mi]
              chartype "relation"    &lt;&gt;\[eq]\[&lt;=]\[&gt;=]
              chartype "opening"     {([
              chartype "closing"     })]
              chartype "punctuation" ,;:.
              chartype "suppress"    ^~

       <i>eqn</i> assigns all other ordinary and special <i>roff</i> characters,
       including numerals 0–9, the “<b>ordinary</b>” type.  (The “<b>digit</b>” type
       is not used, but is available for customization.)  In keeping
       with common practice in mathematical typesetting, lowercase, but
       not uppercase, Greek letters are assigned the “<b>letter</b>” type to
       style them in italics.  The macros for producing ellipses, “<b>...</b>”,
       <b>cdots</b>, and <b>ldots</b>, use the “<b>inner</b>” type.

   <b>Primitives</b>
       <i>eqn</i> supports without alteration the AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i> primitives <b>above</b>,
       <b>back</b>, <b>bar</b>, <b>bold</b>, <b>define</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>fat</b>, <b>font</b>, <b>from</b>, <b>fwd</b>, <b>gfont</b>,
       <b>gsize</b>, <b>italic</b>, <b>left</b>, <b>lineup</b>, <b>mark</b>, <b>matrix</b>, <b>ndefine</b>, <b>over</b>, <b>right</b>,
       <b>roman</b>, <b>size</b>, <b>sqrt</b>, <b>sub</b>, <b>sup</b>, <b>tdefine</b>, <b>to</b>, <b>under</b>, and <b>up</b>.

   <b>New primitives</b>
       We describe the GNU extension primitives “<b>type</b>” and <b>chartype </b>in
       subsection “Spacing and typeface” above; “<b>set</b>” and “<b>reset</b>” in
       subsection “Customization” below; and <b>gbfont</b>, <b>gifont</b>, and <b>grfont</b>
       in subsection “Fonts” below.  In the following synopses, <i>X</i> can be
       any character not appearing in the parameter thus bracketed.

       <i>e1</i> <b>accent </b><i>e2</i>
              Set <i>e2</i> as an accent over <i>e1</i>.  <i>eqn</i> assumes that <i>e2</i> is at
              the appropriate height for a lowercase letter without an
              ascender, and shifts it vertically based on <i>e1</i>'s height.
              For example, <i>eqn</i> defines <b>hat </b>as follows.

                     accent { roman "^" }

              <b>dotdot</b>, <b>dot</b>, <b>tilde</b>, <b>vec</b>, and <b>dyad </b>are also defined using
              the <b>accent </b>primitive.

       <b>big </b><i>e</i>  Enlarge the expression <i>e</i>; semantics like those of CSS
              “large” are intended.  In <i>troff</i> output, the type size is
              increased by 5 scaled points.  MathML output emits the
              following.

                     &lt;mstyle mathsize='big'&gt;

       <b>copy </b><i>file</i>
       <b>include </b><i>file</i>
              Interpolate the contents of <i>file</i>, omitting lines beginning
              with <b>.EQ </b>or <b>.EN</b>.  If a relative path name, <i>file</i> is sought
              relative to the current working directory.

       <b>ifdef </b><i>name X anything X</i>
              If <i>name</i> is defined as a primitive or macro, interpret
              <i>anything</i>.

       <b>nosplit </b><i>text</i>
              As "<i>text</i>", but since <i>text</i> is not quoted it is subject to
              macro expansion; it is not split up and the spacing
              between characters not adjusted per subsection “Spacing
              and typeface” above.

       <i>e</i> <b>opprime</b>
              As <b>prime</b>, but set the prime symbol as an operator on <i>e</i>.
              In the input “<b>A opprime sub 1</b>”, the “1” is tucked under
              the prime as a subscript to the “A” (as is conventional in
              mathematical typesetting), whereas when <b>prime </b>is used,
              the “1” is a subscript to the prime character.  The
              precedence of <b>opprime </b>is the same as that of <b>bar </b>and
              “<b>under</b>”, and higher than that of other primitives except
              <b>accent </b>and <b>uaccent</b>.  In unquoted text, a neutral
              apostrophe (<b>'</b>) that is not the first character on the
              input line is treated like <b>opprime</b>.

       <b>sdefine </b><i>name X anything X</i>
              As “<b>define</b>”, but <i>name</i> is not recognized as a macro if
              called with arguments.

       <i>e1</i> <b>smallover </b><i>e2</i>
              As <b>over</b>, but reduce the type size of <i>e1</i> and <i>e2</i>, and put
              less vertical space between <i>e1</i> and <i>e2</i> and the fraction
              bar.  The <b>over </b>primitive corresponds to the TeX <b>\over</b>
              primitive in displayed equation styles; <b>smallover</b>
              corresponds to <b>\over </b>in non-display (“inline”) styles.

       <b>space </b><i>n</i>
              Set extra vertical spacing around the equation, replacing
              the default values, where <i>n</i> is an integer in hundredths of
              an em.  If positive, <i>n</i> increases vertical spacing before
              the equation; if negative, it does so after the equation.
              This primitive provides an interface to <i>groff</i>'s <b>\x </b>escape
              sequence, but with the opposite sign convention.  It has
              no effect if the equation is part of a <i>pic</i>(1) picture.

       <b>special </b><i>troff-macro e</i>
              Construct an object by calling <i>troff-macro</i> on <i>e</i>.  The
              <i>troff</i> string <b>0s </b>contains the <i>eqn</i> output for <i>e</i>, and the
              registers <b>0w</b>, <b>0h</b>, <b>0d</b>, <b>0skern</b>, and <b>0skew </b>the width, height,
              depth, subscript kern, and skew of <i>e</i>, respectively.  (The
              <i>subscript kern</i> of an object indicates how much a subscript
              on that object should be “tucked in”, or placed to the
              left relative to a non-subscripted glyph of the same size.
              The <i>skew</i> of an object is how far to the right of the
              center of the object an accent over it should be placed.)
              The macro must modify <b>0s </b>so that it outputs the desired
              result, returns the drawing position to the text baseline
              at the beginning of <i>e</i>, and updates the foregoing registers
              to correspond to the new dimensions of the result.

              Suppose you want a construct that “cancels” an expression
              by drawing a diagonal line through it.

                     .de Ca
                     .  ds 0s \
                     \Z'\\*(0s'\
                     \v'\\n(0du'\
                     \D'l \\n(0wu -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du'\
                     \v'\\n(0hu'
                     ..
                     .EQ
                     special Ca "x \[mi] 3 \[pl] x" ~ 3
                     .EN

              We use the <b>\[mi] </b>and <b>\[pl] </b>special characters instead of +
              and - because they are part of the argument to a <i>troff</i>
              macro, so <i>eqn</i> does not transform them to mathematical
              glyphs for us.  Here's a more complicated construct that
              draws a box around an expression; the bottom of the box
              rests on the text baseline.  We define the <i>eqn</i> macro <b>box</b>
              to wrap the call of the <i>troff</i> macro <b>Bx</b>.

                     .de Bx
                     .ds 0s \
                     \Z'\\h'1n'\\*[0s]'\
                     \v'\\n(0du+1n'\
                     \D'l \\n(0wu+2n 0'\
                     \D'l 0 -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du-2n'\
                     \D'l -\\n(0wu-2n 0'\
                     \D'l 0 \\n(0hu+\\n(0du+2n'\
                     \h'\\n(0wu+2n'
                     .nr 0w +2n
                     .nr 0d +1n
                     .nr 0h +1n
                     ..
                     .EQ
                     define box ' special Bx $1 '
                     box(foo) ~ "bar"
                     .EN

       <b>split "</b><i>text</i><b>"</b>
              As <i>text</i>, but since <i>text</i> is quoted, it is not subject to
              macro expansion; it is split up and the spacing between
              characters adjusted per subsection “Spacing and typeface”
              above.

       <i>e1</i> <b>uaccent </b><i>e2</i>
              Set <i>e2</i> as an accent under <i>e1</i>.  <i>e2</i> is assumed to be at the
              appropriate height for a letter without a descender;  <i>eqn</i>
              vertically shifts it depending on whether <i>e1</i> has a
              descender.  <b>utilde </b>is predefined using <b>uaccent </b>as a tilde
              accent below the baseline.

       <b>undef </b><i>name</i>
              Remove definition of macro or primitive <i>name</i>, making it
              undefined.

       <b>vcenter </b><i>e</i>
              Vertically center <i>e</i> about the <i>math axis</i>, a horizontal line
              upon which fraction bars and characters such as “+” and
              “−” are aligned.  MathML already behaves this way, so <i>eqn</i>
              ignores this primitive when producing that output format.
              The built-in <b>sum </b>macro is defined as if by the following.

                     define sum ! { type "operator" vcenter size +5 \(*S } !

   <b>Extended primitives</b>
       GNU <i>eqn</i> extends the syntax of some AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i> primitives,
       introducing one deliberate incompatibility.

       <b>delim on</b>
              <i>eqn</i> recognizes an “<b>on</b>” argument to the <b>delim </b>primitive
              specially, restoring any delimiters previously disabled
              with “<b>delim off</b>”.  If delimiters haven't been specified,
              neither command has effect.  Few <i>eqn</i> documents are
              expected to use “o” and “n” as left and right delimiters,
              respectively.  If yours does, swap them, or select others.

       <b>col </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>ccol </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>lcol </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>rcol </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>pile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>cpile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>lpile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
       <b>rpile </b><i>n</i> <b>{ </b>... <b>}</b>
              The integer value <i>n</i>, in hundredths of an em, uses the
              formatter's <b>\x </b>escape sequence to increase the vertical
              spacing between rows; <i>eqn</i> ignores it when producing
              MathML.  Negative values are accepted but have no effect.
              If more than one <i>n</i> occurs in a matrix or pile, the largest
              is used.

   <b>Customization</b>
       When <i>eqn</i> generates <i>troff</i> input, the appearance of equations is
       controlled by a large number of parameters.  They have no effect
       when generating MathML, which delegates typesetting to a MathML
       rendering engine.  Configure these parameters with the “<b>set</b>” and
       “<b>reset</b>” primitives.

       <b>set </b><i>p n</i>
              assigns parameter <i>p</i> the integer value <i>n</i>; <i>n</i> is interpreted
              in units of hundredths of an em unless otherwise stated.
              For example,
                     set x_height 45
              says that <i>eqn</i> should assume that the font's x-height is
              0.45 ems.

       <b>reset </b><i>p</i>
              restores the default value of parameter <i>p.</i>

       Available parameters <i>p</i> are as follows; defaults are shown in
       parentheses.  We intend these descriptions to be expository
       rather than rigorous.

       <b>minimum_size</b>
              sets a floor for the type size (in scaled points) at which
              equations are set (<b>5</b>).

       <b>fat_offset</b>
              The <b>fat </b>primitive emboldens an equation by overprinting
              two copies of the equation horizontally offset by this
              amount (<b>4</b>).  In MathML mode, components to which
              <b>fat_offset </b>applies instead use the following.
                     &lt;mstyle mathvariant='double-struck'&gt;

       <b>over_hang</b>
              A fraction bar is longer by twice this amount than the
              maximum of the widths of the numerator and denominator; in
              other words, it overhangs the numerator and denominator by
              at least this amount (<b>0</b>).

       <b>accent_width</b>
              When <b>bar </b>or <b>under </b>is applied to a single character, the
              line is this long (<b>31</b>).  Normally, <b>bar </b>or <b>under </b>produces a
              line whose length is the width of the object to which it
              applies; in the case of a single character, this tends to
              produce a line that looks too long.

       <b>delimiter_factor</b>
              Extensible delimiters produced with the <b>left </b>and <b>right</b>
              primitives have a combined height and depth of at least
              this many thousandths of twice the maximum amount by which
              the sub-equation that the delimiters enclose extends away
              from the axis (<b>900</b>).

       <b>delimiter_shortfall</b>
              Extensible delimiters produced with the <b>left </b>and <b>right</b>
              primitives have a combined height and depth not less than
              the difference of twice the maximum amount by which the
              sub-equation that the delimiters enclose extends away from
              the axis and this amount (<b>50</b>).

       <b>null_delimiter_space</b>
              This much horizontal space is inserted on each side of a
              fraction (<b>12</b>).

       <b>script_space</b>
              The width of subscripts and superscripts is increased by
              this amount (<b>5</b>).

       <b>thin_space</b>
              This amount of space is automatically inserted after
              punctuation characters (<b>17</b>).

       <b>medium_space</b>
              This amount of space is automatically inserted on either
              side of binary operators (<b>22</b>).

       <b>thick_space</b>
              This amount of space is automatically inserted on either
              side of relations (<b>28</b>).

       <b>half_space</b>
              configures the width of the space produced by the <b>^ </b>token
              (<b>17</b>).

       <b>full_space</b>
              configures the width of the space produced by the <b>~ </b>token
              (<b>28</b>).

       <b>x_height</b>
              The height of lowercase letters without ascenders such as
              “x” (<b>45</b>).

       <b>axis_height</b>
              The height above the baseline of the center of characters
              such as “+” and “−” (<b>26</b>).  It is important that this value
              is correct for the font you are using.

       <b>default_rule_thickness</b>
              This should be set to the thickness of the <b>\[ru]</b>
              character, or the thickness of horizontal lines produced
              with the <b>\D </b>escape sequence (<b>4</b>).

       <b>num1   </b>The <b>over </b>primitive shifts up the numerator by at least
              this amount (<b>70</b>).

       <b>num2   </b>The <b>smallover </b>primitive shifts up the numerator by at
              least this amount (<b>36</b>).

       <b>denom1 </b>The <b>over </b>primitive shifts down the denominator by at least
              this amount (<b>70</b>).

       <b>denom2 </b>The <b>smallover </b>primitive shifts down the denominator by at
              least this amount (<b>36</b>).

       <b>sup1   </b>Normally superscripts are shifted up by at least this
              amount (<b>42</b>).

       <b>sup2   </b>Superscripts within superscripts or upper limits or
              numerators of <b>smallover </b>fractions are shifted up by at
              least this amount (<b>37</b>).  Conventionally, this is less than
              <b>sup1</b>.

       <b>sup3   </b>Superscripts within denominators or square roots or
              subscripts or lower limits are shifted up by at least this
              amount (<b>28</b>).  Conventionally, this is less than <b>sup2</b>.

       <b>sub1   </b>Subscripts are normally shifted down by at least this
              amount (<b>20</b>).

       <b>sub2   </b>When there is both a subscript and a superscript, the
              subscript is shifted down by at least this amount (<b>23</b>).

       <b>sup_drop</b>
              The baseline of a superscript is no more than this much
              below the top of the object on which the superscript is
              set (<b>38</b>).

       <b>sub_drop</b>
              The baseline of a subscript is at least this much below
              the bottom of the object on which the subscript is set
              (<b>5</b>).

       <b>big_op_spacing1</b>
              The baseline of an upper limit is at least this much above
              the top of the object on which the limit is set (<b>11</b>).

       <b>big_op_spacing2</b>
              The baseline of a lower limit is at least this much below
              the bottom of the object on which the limit is set (<b>17</b>).

       <b>big_op_spacing3</b>
              The bottom of an upper limit is at least this much above
              the top of the object on which the limit is set (<b>20</b>).

       <b>big_op_spacing4</b>
              The top of a lower limit is at least this much below the
              bottom of the object on which the limit is set (<b>60</b>).

       <b>big_op_spacing5</b>
              This much vertical space is added above and below limits
              (<b>10</b>).

       <b>baseline_sep</b>
              The baselines of the rows in a pile or matrix are normally
              this far apart (<b>140</b>).  Usually equal to the sum of <b>num1</b>
              and <b>denom1</b>.

       <b>shift_down</b>
              The midpoint between the top baseline and the bottom
              baseline in a matrix or pile is shifted down by this much
              from the axis (<b>26</b>).  Usually equal to <b>axis_height</b>.

       <b>column_sep</b>
              This much space is added between columns in a matrix
              (<b>100</b>).

       <b>matrix_side_sep</b>
              This much space is added at each side of a matrix (<b>17</b>).

       <b>draw_lines</b>
              If non-zero, <i>eqn</i> draws lines using the <i>troff</i> <b>\D </b>escape
              sequence, rather than the <b>\l </b>escape sequence and the <b>\[ru]</b>
              special character.  The <i>eqnrc</i> file sets the default: <b>1 </b>on
              <b>ps</b>, <b>html</b>, and the X11 devices, otherwise <b>0</b>.

       <b>body_height</b>
              is the presumed height of an equation above the text
              baseline; <i>eqn</i> adds any excess as extra pre-vertical line
              spacing with <i>troff</i>'s <b>\x </b>escape sequence (<b>85</b>).

       <b>body_depth</b>
              is the presumed depth of an equation below the text
              baseline; <i>eqn</i> adds any excess as extra post-vertical line
              spacing with <i>troff</i>'s <b>\x </b>escape sequence (<b>35</b>).

       <b>nroff  </b>If non-zero, then <b>ndefine </b>behaves like <b>define </b>and <b>tdefine</b>
              is ignored, otherwise <b>tdefine </b>behaves like <b>define </b>and
              <b>ndefine </b>is ignored.  The <i>eqnrc</i> file sets the default: <b>1 </b>on
              <b>ascii</b>, <b>latin1</b>, <b>utf8</b>, and <b>cp1047 </b>devices, otherwise <b>0</b>.

   <b>Macros</b>
       In GNU <i>eqn</i>, macros can take arguments.  A word defined by any of
       the <b>define</b>, <b>ndefine</b>, or <b>tdefine </b>primitives followed immediately
       by a left parenthesis is treated as a <i>parameterized macro call:</i>
       subsequent tokens up to a matching right parenthesis are treated
       as comma-separated arguments.  In this context only, commas and
       parentheses also serve as token separators.  A macro argument is
       not terminated by a comma inside parentheses nested within it.
       In a macro definition, <b>$</b><i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is between 1 and 9 inclusive,
       is replaced by the <i>n</i>th argument; if there are fewer than
       <i>n</i> arguments, it is replaced by nothing.

   <b>Predefined macros</b>
       GNU <i>eqn</i> supports the predefined macros offered by AT&amp;T <i>eqn</i>: <b>and</b>,
       <b>approx</b>, <b>arc</b>, <b>cos</b>, <b>cosh</b>, <b>del</b>, <b>det</b>, <b>dot</b>, <b>dotdot</b>, <b>dyad</b>, <b>exp</b>, <b>for</b>,
       <b>grad</b>, <b>half</b>, <b>hat</b>, <b>if</b>, <b>inter</b>, <b>Im</b>, <b>inf</b>, <b>int</b>, <b>lim</b>, <b>ln</b>, <b>log</b>, <b>max</b>, <b>min</b>,
       <b>nothing</b>, <b>partial</b>, <b>prime</b>, <b>prod</b>, <b>Re</b>, <b>sin</b>, <b>sinh</b>, <b>sum</b>, <b>tan</b>, <b>tanh</b>,
       <b>tilde</b>, <b>times</b>, <b>union</b>, <b>vec</b>, <b>==</b>, <b>!=</b>, <b>+=</b>, <b>-&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;-</b>, <b>&lt;&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;&gt;</b>, and “<b>...</b>”.
       The lowercase classical Greek letters are available as <b>alpha</b>,
       <b>beta</b>, <b>chi</b>, <b>delta</b>, <b>epsilon</b>, <b>eta</b>, <b>gamma</b>, <b>iota</b>, <b>kappa</b>, <b>lambda</b>, <b>mu</b>,
       <b>nu</b>, <b>omega</b>, <b>omicron</b>, <b>phi</b>, <b>pi</b>, <b>psi</b>, <b>rho</b>, <b>sigma</b>, <b>tau</b>, <b>theta</b>,
       <b>upsilon</b>, <b>xi</b>, and <b>zeta</b>.  Spell them with an initial capital letter
       (<b>Alpha</b>) or in full capitals (<b>ALPHA</b>) to obtain uppercase forms.

       GNU <i>eqn</i> further defines the macros <b>cdot</b>, <b>cdots</b>, and <b>utilde </b>(all
       discussed above), <b>dollar</b>, which sets a dollar sign, and <b>ldots</b>,
       which sets an ellipsis on the text baseline.

   <b>Fonts</b>
       <i>eqn</i> uses up to three typefaces to set an equation: italic
       (oblique), roman (upright), and bold.  Assign each a <i>groff</i>
       typeface with the GNU extension primitives <b>grfont</b>, <b>gifont</b>, and
       <b>gbfont.  </b>The defaults are the styles <b>R</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>B </b>(applied to the
       current font family).  The <b>chartype </b>primitive (see above) sets a
       character's type, which determines the face used to set it.  The
       “<b>letter</b>” type is set in italics; others are set in roman.  Use
       the <b>bold </b>primitive to select an (upright) bold style.

       <b>gbfont </b><i>f</i>
              Select <i>f</i> as the bold font.

       <b>gifont </b><i>f</i>
              Select <i>f</i> as the italic font.  GNU <i>eqn</i> recognizes <b>gfont </b>as
              a synonym for AT&amp;T compatibility.

       <b>grfont </b><i>f</i>
              Select <i>f</i> as the roman font.

Options </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--help </b>displays a usage message, while <b>-v </b>and <b>--version </b>show
       version information; all exit afterward.

       <b>-C     </b>Recognize <b>.EQ </b>and <b>.EN </b>even when followed by a character
              other than space or newline.

       <b>-d </b><i>xy</i>  Specify delimiters <i>x</i> for left and <i>y</i> for right ends of
              equations not bracketed by <b>.EQ</b>/<b>.EN</b>.  <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> need not be
              distinct.  Any “<b>delim </b><i>xy</i>” statements in the source file
              override this option.

       <b>-f </b><i>F</i>   is equivalent to “<b>gifont </b><i>F</i>”.

       <b>-m </b><i>n</i>   is equivalent to “<b>set minimum_size </b><i>n</i>”.

       <b>-M </b><i>dir</i> Search <i>dir</i> for <i>eqnrc</i> before those listed in section
              “Description” above.

       <b>-N     </b>Prohibit newlines within delimiters, allowing <i>eqn</i> to
              recover better from missing closing delimiters.

       <b>-p </b><i>n</i>   Set sub- and superscripts <i>n</i> points smaller than the
              surrounding text.  This option is deprecated.  <i>eqn</i>
              normally sets sub- and superscripts at 70% of the type
              size of the surrounding text.

       <b>-r     </b>Reduce the type size of super- and subscripts at most once
              relative to the base type size.

       <b>-R     </b>Don't load <i>eqnrc</i>.

       <b>-s </b><i>n</i>   is equivalent to “<b>gsize </b><i>n</i>”.  This option is deprecated.

       <b>-T </b><i>dev</i> Prepare output for the device <i>dev</i>.  This option defines a
              macro <i>dev</i> with the value <b>1</b>; <i>eqnrc</i> thereby provides
              definitions appropriate to the device.  However, if <i>dev</i> is
              “<b>MathML</b>”, <i>eqn</i> produces output in that language rather than
              <i>roff</i>, and <i>eqnrc</i> is not loaded.  The default device is <b>ps</b>.
</pre> <h2>
Files </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/eqnrc</i>
              initializes the preprocessor for <i>troff</i> output.  Any valid
              <i>eqn</i> input is accepted.
</pre> <h2>
MathML mode limitations </h2>
<pre>
       MathML's design assumes that it cannot know the exact physical
       characteristics of the media and devices on which it will be
       rendered.  It does not support control of motions and sizes to
       the same degree <i>troff</i> does.

       •  GNU <i>eqn</i>'s rendering parameters (see section “Customziation”
          above) have no effect on generated MathML.

       •  The <b>special</b>, <b>up</b>, <b>down</b>, <b>fwd</b>, and <b>back </b>primitives cannot be
          implemented, and yield a MathML “&lt;merror&gt;” message instead.

       •  The <b>vcenter </b>primitive is silently ignored, as centering on the
          math axis is the MathML default.

       •  Characters that <i>eqn</i> sets extra large in <i>troff</i> mode—notably the
          integral sign—may appear too small and need to have their
          “&lt;mstyle&gt;” wrappers adjusted by hand.

       As in its <i>troff</i> mode, <i>eqn</i> in MathML mode leaves the <b>.EQ </b>and <b>.EN</b>
       tokens in place, but emits nothing corresponding to <b>delim</b>
       delimiters.  They can, however, be recognized as character
       sequences that begin with “&lt;math&gt;”, end with “&lt;/math&gt;”, and do
       not cross line boundaries.
</pre> <h2>
Caveats </h2>
<pre>
       Tokens must be double-quoted in <i>eqn</i> input if they are not to be
       recognized as names of macros or primitives, or if they are to be
       interpreted by <i>troff</i>.  In particular, short ones, like “<b>pi</b>” and
       “<b>PI</b>”, can collide with <i>troff</i> identifiers.  For instance, the <i>eqn</i>
       command “<b>gifont PI</b>” does not select <i>groff</i>'s Palatino italic font
       for the global italic face; you must use “<b>gifont "PI"</b>” instead.

       Delimited equations are set at the type size current at the
       beginning of the input line, not necessarily that immediately
       preceding the opening delimiter.

       Unlike TeX, <i>eqn</i> does not inherently distinguish displayed and
       inline equation styles; see the <b>smallover </b>primitive above.
       However, macro packages frequently define <b>EQ </b>and <b>EN </b>macros such
       that the equation within is displayed.  These macros may accept
       arguments permitting the equation to be labeled or captioned; see
       the package's documentation.
</pre> <h2>
Bugs </h2>
<pre>
       <i>eqn</i> abuses terminology—its “equations” can be inequalities, bare
       expressions, or unintelligible gibberish.  But there's no
       changing it now.

       In <i>nroff</i> mode, lowercase Greek letters are rendered in roman
       instead of italic style.

       In MathML mode, the <b>mark </b>and <b>lineup </b>features don't work.  These
       could, in theory, be implemented with “&lt;maligngroup&gt;” elements.

       In MathML mode, each digit of a numeric literal gets a separate
       “&lt;mn&gt;&lt;/mn&gt;” pair, and decimal points are tagged with “&lt;mo&gt;&lt;/mo&gt;”.
       This is allowed by the specification, but inefficient.
</pre> <h2>
Examples </h2>
<pre>
       We first illustrate <i>eqn</i> usage with a trigonometric identity.

              .EQ
              sin ( alpha + beta ) = sin alpha cos beta + cos alpha sin beta
              .EN

       It can be convenient to set up delimiters if mathematical content
       will appear frequently in running text.

              .EQ
              delim $$
              .EN
              Having cached a table of logarithms,
              the property $ln ( x y ) = ln x + ln y$ sped calculations.

       The quadratic formula affords an opportunity to use fractions,
       radicals, and the full space token <b>~</b>.

              .EQ
              x = { - b ~ \[+-] ~ sqrt { b sup 2 - 4 a c } } over { 2 a }
              .EN

       Alternatively, we could define the plus-minus sign as a binary
       operator.  Automatic spacing puts 0.06 em less space on either
       side of the plus-minus than ~ does, this being the difference
       between the widths of the <b>medium_space </b>parameter used by binary
       operators and that of the full space.  Independently, we can
       define a macro “frac” for setting fractions.

              .EQ
              chartype "binary" \[+-]
              define frac ! { $1 } over { $2 } !
              x = frac(- b \[+-] sqrt { b sup 2 - 4 a c }, 2 a)
              .EN
