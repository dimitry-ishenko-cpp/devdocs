PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       csplit — split files based on context
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       csplit <b>[</b>-ks<b>] [</b>-f <i>prefix</i><b>] [</b>-n <i>number</i><b>] </b><i>file arg</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>csplit</i> utility shall read the file named by the <i>file</i> operand,
       write all or part of that file into other files as directed by
       the <i>arg</i> operands, and write the sizes of the files.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>csplit</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-f </b><i>prefix</i> Name the created files <i>prefix</i><b>00</b>, <i>prefix</i><b>01</b>, ...,
                 <i>prefixn</i>.  The default is <b>xx00 </b>...  <b>xx</b><i>n</i>.  If the <i>prefix</i>
                 argument would create a filename exceeding {NAME_MAX}
                 bytes, an error shall result, <i>csplit</i> shall exit with a
                 diagnostic message, and no files shall be created.

       <b>-k        </b>Leave previously created files intact. By default,
                 <i>csplit</i> shall remove created files if an error occurs.

       <b>-n </b><i>number</i> Use <i>number</i> decimal digits to form filenames for the
                 file pieces. The default shall be 2.

       <b>-s        </b>Suppress the output of file size messages.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      The pathname of a text file to be split. If <i>file</i> is
                 <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall be used.

       Each <i>arg</i> operand can be one of the following:

       /<i>rexp</i>/<b>[</b><i>offset</i><b>]</b>
                 A file shall be created using the content of the lines
                 from the current line up to, but not including, the
                 line that results from the evaluation of the regular
                 expression with <i>offset</i>, if any, applied. The regular
                 expression <i>rexp</i> shall follow the rules for basic
                 regular expressions described in the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 9.3</i>, <i>Basic Regular</i>
                 <i>Expressions</i>.  The application shall use the sequence
                 <b>"\/" </b>to specify a &lt;slash&gt; character within the <i>rexp</i>.
                 The optional offset shall be a positive or negative
                 integer value representing a number of lines. A
                 positive integer value can be preceded by <b>'+'</b>.  If the
                 selection of lines from an <i>offset</i> expression of this
                 type would create a file with zero lines, or one with
                 greater than the number of lines left in the input
                 file, the results are unspecified. After the section is
                 created, the current line shall be set to the line that
                 results from the evaluation of the regular expression
                 with any offset applied. If the current line is the
                 first line in the file and a regular expression
                 operation has not yet been performed, the pattern match
                 of <i>rexp</i> shall be applied from the current line to the
                 end of the file.  Otherwise, the pattern match of <i>rexp</i>
                 shall be applied from the line following the current
                 line to the end of the file.

       %<i>rexp</i>%<b>[</b><i>offset</i><b>]</b>
                 Equivalent to /<i>rexp</i>/<b>[</b><i>offset</i><b>]</b>, except that no file shall
                 be created for the selected section of the input file.
                 The application shall use the sequence <b>"\%" </b>to specify
                 a &lt;percent-sign&gt; character within the <i>rexp</i>.

       <i>line_no</i>   Create a file from the current line up to (but not
                 including) the line number <i>line_no</i>.  Lines in the file
                 shall be numbered starting at one. The current line
                 becomes <i>line_no</i>.

       {<i>num</i>}     Repeat operand. This operand can follow any of the
                 operands described previously. If it follows a <i>rexp</i>
                 type operand, that operand shall be applied <i>num</i> more
                 times. If it follows a <i>line_no</i> operand, the file shall
                 be split every <i>line_no</i> lines, <i>num</i> times, from that
                 point.

       An error shall be reported if an operand does not reference a
       line between the current position and the end of the file.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       See the INPUT FILES section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input file shall be a text file.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>csplit</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                 elements within regular expressions.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files) and the
                 behavior of character classes within regular
                 expressions.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>-k </b>option is specified, created files shall be retained.
       Otherwise, the default action occurs.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Unless the <b>-s </b>option is used, the standard output shall consist
       of one line per file created, with a format as follows:

           "%d\n", &lt;<i>file size in bytes</i>&gt;
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The output files shall contain portions of the original input
       file; otherwise, unchanged.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       By default, created files shall be removed if an error occurs.
       When the <b>-k </b>option is specified, created files shall not be
       removed if an error occurs.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. This example creates four files, <b>cobol00 </b>...  <b>cobol03</b>:

               csplit -f cobol file '/procedure division/' /par5./ /par16./

           After editing the split files, they can be recombined as
           follows:

               cat cobol0[0-3] &gt; file

           Note that this example overwrites the original file.

        2. This example would split the file after the first 99 lines,
           and every 100 lines thereafter, up to 9999 lines; this is
           because lines in the file are numbered from 1 rather than
           zero, for historical reasons:

               csplit -k file  100  {99}

        3. Assuming that <b>prog.c </b>follows the C-language coding convention
           of ending routines with a <b>'}' </b>at the beginning of the line,
           this example creates a file containing each separate C
           routine (up to 21) in <b>prog.c</b>:

               csplit -k prog.c '%main(%'  '/^}/+1' {20}
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-n </b>option was added to extend the range of filenames that
       could be handled.

       Consideration was given to adding a <b>-a </b>flag to use the alphabetic
       filename generation used by the historical <i>split</i> utility, but the
       functionality added by the <b>-n </b>option was deemed to make
       alphabetic naming unnecessary.
