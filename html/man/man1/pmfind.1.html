</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmfind </b>- find PCP services on the network
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmfind </b>[<b>-CqrSV?</b>]  [<b>-m </b><i>mechanism</i>] [<b>-s </b><i>service</i>] [<b>-t </b><i>timeout</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmfind </b>searches for instances of the specified PCP service being
       advertised on the network and prints a list of URLs corresponding
       to the services discovered.  It can be used in conjunction with
       <a href="pmfind_check.1.html">pmfind_check(1)</a> to automate the monitoring of remote PCP
       collector systems.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--containers</b>
            Performs containers discovery as well, for each discovered
            <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> service.

       <b>-m </b><i>mechanism</i>, <b>--mechanism</b>=<i>mechanism</i>
            This option sets the <i>mechanism</i> that <b>pmfind </b>uses when
            performing service discovery.  By default, or if the keyword
            <i>all</i> is specified, every available mechanism will be used
            (iteratively).  See the ``MECHANISMS'' section for a
            description of each available discovery mechanism.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
            This option suppresses all output on the standard output
            stream.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--resolve</b>
            Requests that DNS name resolution be attempted for the
            addresses of any discovered services.  The default is to
            display the network addresses of any discovered services.

       <b>-s </b><i>service</i>, <b>--service</b>=<i>service</i>
            By default <b>pmfind </b>will search for all supported PCP
            services, however a specific PCP <i>service</i> to discover can be
            specified using the <b>-s </b>option.  Supported services are
            <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, and <a href="pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy(1)</a>.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--sources</b>
            Reports source identifiers for each discovered <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            service.  These identifiers are unique for each host, and
            are formed using the (non-optional) context labels available
            for every PCP collector.  Because the discovery process will
            often identify multiple paths to an individual collector
            host, this option is an important part of the process of
            using <b>pmfind </b>in conjunction with <a href="pmfind_check.1.html">pmfind_check(1)</a>, to ensure
            only one <a href="pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> and/or <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> process is started for
            each discovered collector host.  The source identifiers
            reported by <b>pmfind </b>are the same as the source identifiers
            reported by the <a href="pminfo.1.html">pminfo(1)</a> and <a href="pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a> commands.

       <b>-t </b><i>seconds</i>, <b>--timeout</b>=<i>seconds</i>
            Sets the maximum amount of time in <i>seconds</i> that <b>pmfind </b>will
            take before interrupting the service discovery.  The <i>time</i>
            argument is a floating point number representing the number
            of seconds before timing out.  The default is to take as
            much time as is needed to complete the process.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Display version number and exit.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
MECHANISMS </h2>
<pre>
       Supported mechanisms for service discovery are:

       <b>avahi  </b>Searches for services which are broadcasting using mDNS
              via <b>avahi-daemon</b>(8).  An optional suffix <b>",timeout=N" </b>may
              be added to limit the amount of time waiting for the
              avahi-daemon.  <b>N </b>is a floating point number specifying the
              number of seconds to wait.  The default is 0.5 seconds.
              This timeout may also be specified by setting the
              environment variable <b>AVAHI_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT </b>to the
              desired number of seconds.  If both are specified, then
              the value specified in the environment variable takes
              precedence.

       <b>probe=&lt;net-address&gt;/&lt;mask-bits&gt;</b>
              Actively probes the given subnet for the requested PCP
              service(s).  <b>&lt;net-address&gt; </b>is an Inet or IPv6 network
              address and <b>&lt;mask-bits&gt; </b>is the number of bits used to
              define the subnet.  For example, 192.168.1.0/24 defines an
              8 bit subnet consisting of the addresses 192.168.1.0
              through 192.168.1.255.  An optional suffix <b>",maxThreads=N"</b>
              may be added to limit the number of threads used while
              probing.  The default is the value of FD_SETSIZE (which is
              typically 1024) or the number of addresses in the subnet,
              whichever is less.  An optional suffix <b>",timeout=N" </b>may be
              added to limit the amount of time spent waiting for each
              connection attempt.  N is a floating point number
              specifying the number of seconds to wait.  The default is
              0.02 seconds (20 milliseconds).

       <b>shell  </b>Probes the list of addresses provided by scripts for
              requested PCP service(s).  Several optional, comma-
              separated parameters can also be provided.  The <b>"path=DIR"</b>
              option specifies the directory where commands like
              <a href="pcp-kube-pods.1.html">pcp-kube-pods(1)</a> are located (defaults to
              <i>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover/</i>).  This setting can be further
              restricted to an individual command using the <b>command=CMD</b>
              option, but the default is to use all available commands
              from the <b>path</b>.  The <b>"maxThreads=N" </b>option limits the
              number of threads used while probing.  The default is the
              value of FD_SETSIZE (which is typically 1024) or the
              number of addresses returned by the scripts, whichever is
              less.  The <b>"timeout=N" </b>option may be added to limit the
              amount of time spent waiting for each connection attempt.
              N is a floating point number specifying the number of
              seconds to wait.  The default is 0.02 seconds (20
              milliseconds).
</pre> <h2>
SIGNALS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmfind </b>will interrupt the service discovery process when one of
       the following signals is received: SIGHUP, SIGPIPE, SIGINT,
       SIGTERM, SIGXFSZ, SIGXCPU.  <b>pmfind </b>will report any results which
       were discovered up to point of the interruption.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       The value of the exit status from the command is zero when
       services were successfully located, one if no services were
       found, and two if an error occurred.

       In the event of an error a message will be generated on standard
       error that is intended to be self-explanatory.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover</i>
            default path to address discovery scripts
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
