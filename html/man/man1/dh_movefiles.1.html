</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_movefiles - move files out of debian/tmp into subpackages
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_movefiles </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>--sourcedir=</b><i>dir</i>] [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>]
       [<i>file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_movefiles </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       moving files out of <i>debian/tmp</i> or some other directory and into
       other package build directories. This may be useful if your
       package has a <i>Makefile</i> that installs everything into <i>debian/tmp</i>,
       and you need to break that up into subpackages.

       Note: <b>dh_install </b>is a much better program, and you are
       recommended to use it instead of <b>dh_movefiles</b>.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.files
           Lists the files to be moved into a package, separated by
           whitespace. The filenames listed should be relative to
           <i>debian/tmp/</i>. You can also list directory names, and the whole
           directory will be moved.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--sourcedir=</b><i>dir</i>
           Instead of moving files out of <i>debian/tmp</i> (the default), this
           option makes it move files out of some other directory. Since
           the entire contents of the sourcedir is moved, specifying
           something like <b>--sourcedir=/ </b>is very unsafe, so to prevent
           mistakes, the sourcedir must be a relative filename; it
           cannot begin with a `<b>/</b>'.

       <b>-Xitem</b>, <b>--exclude=item</b>
           Exclude files that contain <b>item </b>anywhere in their filename
           from being installed.

       <i>file</i> ...
           Lists files to move. The filenames listed should be relative
           to <i>debian/tmp/</i>. You can also list directory names, and the
           whole directory will be moved. It is an error to list files
           here unless you use <b>-p</b>, <b>-i</b>, or <b>-a </b>to tell <b>dh_movefiles </b>which
           subpackage to put them in.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Note that files are always moved out of <i>debian/tmp</i> by default
       (even if you have instructed debhelper to use a compatibility
       level higher than one, which does not otherwise use debian/tmp
       for anything at all). The idea behind this is that the package
       that is being built can be told to install into <i>debian/tmp</i>, and
       then files can be moved by <b>dh_movefiles </b>from that directory. Any
       files or directories that remain are ignored, and get deleted by
       <b>dh_clean </b>later.
