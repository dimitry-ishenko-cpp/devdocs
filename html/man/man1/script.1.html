NAME </h2>
<pre>
       script - make typescript of terminal session
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>script </b>[options] [<i>file</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>script </b>makes a typescript of everything on your terminal session.
       The terminal data are stored in raw form to the log file and
       information about timing to another (optional) structured log
       file. The timing log file is necessary to replay the session
       later by <a href="scriptreplay.1.html">scriptreplay(1)</a> and to store additional information
       about the session.

       Since version 2.35, <b>script </b>supports multiple streams and allows
       the logging of input and output to separate files or all the one
       file. This version also supports a new timing file which records
       additional information. The command <b>scriptreplay --summary </b>then
       provides all the information.

       If the argument <i>file</i> or option <b>--log-out </b><i>file</i> is given, <b>script</b>
       saves the dialogue in this <i>file</i>. If no filename is given, the
       dialogue is saved in the file <i>typescript</i>.

       Note that logging input using <b>--log-in </b>or <b>--log-io </b>may record
       security-sensitive information as the log file contains all
       terminal session input (e.g., passwords) independently of the
       terminal echo flag setting.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       Below, the <i>size</i> argument may be followed by the multiplicative
       suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB,
       PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the
       same meaning as "KiB"), or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB
       (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--append</b>
           Append the output to <i>file</i> or to <i>typescript</i>, retaining the
           prior contents.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--command </b><i>command</i>
           Run the <i>command</i> rather than an interactive shell. This makes
           it easy for a script to capture the output of a program that
           behaves differently when its stdout is not a tty.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--echo </b><i>when</i>
           This option controls the <b>ECHO </b>flag for the slave end of the
           session’s pseudoterminal. The supported modes are <i>always</i>,
           <i>never</i>, or <i>auto</i>.

           The default is <i>auto</i> — in this case, <b>ECHO </b>enabled for the
           pseudoterminal slave; if the current standard input is a
           terminal, <b>ECHO </b>is disabled for it to prevent double echo; if
           the current standard input is not a terminal (for example
           pipe: <b>echo date | script</b>) then keeping <b>ECHO </b>enabled for the
           pseudoterminal slave enables the standard input data to be
           viewed on screen while being recorded to session log
           simultaneously.

           Note that 'never' mode affects content of the session output
           log, because users input is not repeated on output.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--return</b>
           Return the exit status of the child process. Uses the same
           format as bash termination on signal termination (i.e., exit
           status is 128 + the signal number). The exit status of the
           child process is always stored in the type script file too.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--flush</b>
           Flush output after each write. This is nice for
           telecooperation: one person does <b>mkfifo </b><i>foo</i>; <b>script -f </b><i>foo</i>,
           and another can supervise in real-time what is being done
           using <b>cat </b><i>foo</i>. Note that flush has an impact on performance;
           it’s possible to use <b>SIGUSR1 </b>to flush logs on demand.

       <b>--force</b>
           Allow the default output file <i>typescript</i> to be a hard or
           symbolic link. The command will follow a symbolic link.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--log-io </b><i>file</i>
           Log input and output to the same <i>file</i>. Note, this option
           makes sense only if <b>--log-timing </b>is also specified, otherwise
           it’s impossible to separate output and input streams from the
           log <i>file</i>.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--log-in </b><i>file</i>
           Log input to the <i>file</i>. The log output is disabled if only
           <b>--log-in </b>specified.

           Use this logging functionality carefully as it logs all
           input, including input when terminal has disabled echo flag
           (for example, password inputs).

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--log-out </b><i>file</i>
           Log output to the <i>file</i>. The default is to log output to the
           file with name <i>typescript</i> if the option <b>--log-out </b>or <b>--log-in</b>
           is not given. The log output is disabled if only <b>--log-in</b>
           specified.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--log-timing </b><i>file</i>
           Log timing information to the <i>file</i>. Two timing file formats
           are supported now. The classic format is used when only one
           stream (input or output) logging is enabled. The multi-stream
           format is used on <b>--log-io </b>or when <b>--log-in </b>and <b>--log-out </b>are
           used together. See also <b>--logging-format</b>.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--logging-format </b><i>format</i>
           Force use of <i>advanced</i> or <i>classic</i> timing log format. The
           default is the classic format to log only output and the
           advanced format when input as well as output logging is
           requested.

           <b>Classic format</b>
               The timing log contains two fields, separated by a space.
               The first field indicates how much time elapsed since the
               previous output. The second field indicates how many
               characters were output this time.

           <b>Advanced (multi-stream) format</b>
               The first field is an entry type identifier ('I’nput,
               'O’utput, 'H’eader, 'S’ignal). The second field is how
               much time elapsed since the previous entry, and the rest
               of the entry is type-specific data.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output-limit </b><i>size</i>
           Limit the size of the typescript and timing files to <i>size</i> and
           stop the child process after this size is exceeded. The
           calculated file size does not include the start and done
           messages that the <b>script </b>command prepends and appends to the
           child process output. Due to buffering, the resulting output
           file might be larger than the specified value.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Be quiet (do not write start and done messages to standard
           output).

       <b>-t</b>[<i>file</i>], <b>--timing</b>[=<i>file</i>]
           Output timing data to standard error, or to <i>file</i> when given.
           This option is deprecated in favour of <b>--log-timing </b>where the
           <i>file</i> argument is not optional.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
SIGNALS </h2>
<pre>
       Upon receiving <b>SIGUSR1</b>, <b>script </b>immediately flushes the output
       files.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variable is utilized by <b>script</b>:

       <b>SHELL</b>
           If the variable <b>SHELL </b>exists, the shell forked by <b>script </b>will
           be that shell. If <b>SHELL </b>is not set, the Bourne shell is
           assumed. (Most shells set this variable automatically).
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The script ends when the forked shell exits (a <i>control-D</i> for the
       Bourne shell (<a href="sh.1p.html">sh(1p)</a>), and <i>exit</i>, <i>logout</i> or <i>control-d</i> (if
       <i>ignoreeof</i> is not set) for the C-shell, <b>csh</b>(1)).

       Certain interactive commands, such as <b>vi</b>(1), create garbage in
       the typescript file. <b>script </b>works best with commands that do not
       manipulate the screen, the results are meant to emulate a
       hardcopy terminal.

       It is not recommended to run <b>script </b>in non-interactive shells.
       The inner shell of <b>script </b>is always interactive, and this could
       lead to unexpected results. If you use <b>script </b>in the shell
       initialization file, you have to avoid entering an infinite loop.
       You can use for example the <b>.profile </b>file, which is read by login
       shells only:

           if test -t 0 ; then
               script
               exit
           fi

       You should also avoid use of <b>script </b>in command pipes, as <b>script</b>
       can read more input than you would expect.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>script </b>command appeared in 3.0BSD.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>script </b>places <i>everything</i> in the log file, including linefeeds and
       backspaces. This is not what the naive user expects.

       <b>script </b>is primarily designed for interactive terminal sessions.
       When stdin is not a terminal (for example: <b>echo foo | script</b>),
       then the session can hang, because the interactive shell within
       the script session misses EOF and <b>script </b>has no clue when to
       close the session. See the <b>NOTES </b>section for more information.
