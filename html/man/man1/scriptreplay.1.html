NAME </h2>
<pre>
       scriptreplay - play back typescripts, using timing information
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>scriptreplay </b>[options] [<b>-t</b>] <i>timingfile</i> [<i>typescript</i> [<i>divisor</i>]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This program replays a typescript, using timing information to
       ensure that output happens in the same rhythm as it originally
       appeared when the script was recorded.

       The replay simply displays the information again; the programs
       that were run when the typescript was being recorded are <b>not run</b>
       <b>again</b>. Since the same information is simply being displayed,
       <b>scriptreplay </b>is only guaranteed to work properly if run on the
       same type of terminal the typescript was recorded on. Otherwise,
       any escape characters in the typescript may be interpreted
       differently by the terminal to which <b>scriptreplay </b>is sending its
       output.

       The timing information is what <a href="script.1.html">script(1)</a> outputs to file
       specified by <b>--log-timing</b>.

       By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named
       <i>typescript</i>, but other filenames may be specified, as the second
       parameter or with option <b>--log-out</b>.

       If the third parameter or <b>--divisor </b>is specified, it is used as a
       speed-up multiplier. For example, a speed-up of 2 makes
       <b>scriptreplay </b>go twice as fast, and a speed-down of 0.1 makes it
       go ten times slower than the original session.

       During the replay, you can interactively speed up, slow down, or
       pause the playback using key bindings.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-I</b>, <b>--log-in </b><i>file</i>
           File containing <b>script</b>'s terminal input.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--log-out </b><i>file</i>
           File containing <b>script</b>'s terminal output.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--log-io </b><i>file</i>
           File containing <b>script</b>'s terminal output and input.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--timing </b><i>file</i>
           File containing <b>script</b>'s timing output. This option overrides
           old-style arguments.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--log-timing </b><i>file</i>
           This is an alias for <b>-t</b>, maintained for compatibility with
           <a href="script.1.html">script(1)</a> command-line options.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--typescript </b><i>file</i>
           File containing <b>script</b>'s terminal output. Deprecated alias to
           <b>--log-out</b>. This option overrides old-style arguments.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cr-mode </b><i>mode</i>
           Specifies how to use the CR (0x0D, carriage return) character
           from log files. The default mode is <i>auto</i>, in this case CR is
           replaced with line break for stdin log, because otherwise
           <b>scriptreplay </b>would overwrite the same line. The other modes
           are <i>never</i> and <i>always</i>.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--divisor </b><i>number</i>
           Speed up the replay displaying this <i>number</i> of times. The
           argument is a floating-point number. It’s called divisor
           because it divides the timings by this factor. This option
           overrides old-style arguments.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--maxdelay </b><i>number</i>
           Set the maximum delay between updates to <i>number</i> of seconds.
           The argument is a floating-point number. This can be used to
           avoid long pauses in the typescript replay.

       <b>--summary</b>
           Display details about the session recorded in the specified
           timing file and exit. The session has to be recorded using
           <i>advanced</i> format (see <a href="script.1.html">script(1)</a> option <b>--logging-format </b>for
           more details).

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--stream </b><i>type</i>
           Forces <b>scriptreplay </b>to print only the specified stream. The
           supported stream types are <i>in</i>, <i>out</i>, <i>signal</i>, or <i>info</i>. This
           option is recommended for multi-stream logs (e.g., <b>--log-io</b>)
           in order to print only specified data.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Display help text and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print version and exit.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
           % script --log-timing file.tm --log-out script.out
           Script started, file is script.out
           % ls
           &lt;etc, etc&gt;
           % exit
           Script done, file is script.out
           % scriptreplay --log-timing file.tm --log-out script.out
</pre> <h2>
KEY BINDINGS </h2>
<pre>
       The following keys control the playback of the script:

       •   <b>Space</b>: Toggles pause and unpause. Press this key to pause the
           playback, and press it again to resume.

       •   <b>Up Arrow</b>: Increases the playback speed. Each press of this
           key will make the script replay faster by x0.1.

       •   <b>Down Arrow</b>: Decreases the playback speed. Each press of this
           key will slow down the script replay by x0.1.
