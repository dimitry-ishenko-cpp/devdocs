       trace-cmd-report - show in ASCII a trace created by trace-cmd
       record
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>trace-cmd report </b>[<i>OPTIONS</i>] [<i>input-file</i> [<i>input-file</i> ...]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The trace-cmd(1) report command will output a human readable
       report of a trace created by trace-cmd record.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-i </b><i>input-file</i>
           By default, trace-cmd report will read the file <i>trace.dat</i>.
           But the <b>-i </b>option open up the given <i>input-file</i> instead. Note,
           the input file may also be specified as the last item on the
           command line.

       <b>-e</b>
           This outputs the endianess of the file. trace-cmd report is
           smart enough to be able to read big endian files on little
           endian machines, and vise versa.

       <b>-f</b>
           This outputs the list of all functions that have been mapped
           in the trace.dat file. Note, this list may contain functions
           that may not appear in the trace, as it is the list of
           mappings to translate function addresses into function names.

       <b>-P</b>
           This outputs the list of "trace_printk()" data. The raw trace
           data points to static pointers in the kernel. This must be
           stored in the trace.dat file.

       <b>-E</b>
           This lists the possible events in the file (but this list is
           not necessarily the list of events in the file).

       <b>--events</b>
           This will list the event formats that are stored in the
           trace.dat file.

       <b>--event </b>regex
           This will print events that match the given regex. If a colon
           is specified, then the characters before the colon will be
           used to match the system and the characters after the colon
           will match the event.

               trace-cmd report --event sys:read

               The above will only match events where the system name contains "sys"
               and the event name contains "read".

               trace-cmd report --event read

               The above will match all events that contain "read" in its name. Also it
               may list all events of a system that contains "read" as well.

       <b>--check-events</b>
           This will parse the event format strings that are stored in
           the trace.dat file and return whether the formats can be
           parsed correctly. It will load plugins unless <b>-N </b>is
           specified.

       <b>-t</b>
           Print the full timestamp. The timestamps in the data file are
           usually recorded to the nanosecond. But the default display
           of the timestamp is only to the microsecond. To see the full
           timestamp, add the <b>-t </b>option.

       <b>-F </b><i>filter</i>
           Add a filter to limit what events are displayed. Filters
           defined after an input file (specified with <b>-i</b>) only apply to
           that input file. Filters provided before any input file is
           given are considered global and apply to all input files.

               The format of the filter is:

               &lt;events&gt; ':' &lt;filter&gt;
               &lt;events&gt; = SYSTEM'/'EVENT  | SYSTEM | EVENT | &lt;events&gt; ',' &lt;events&gt;
               &lt;filter&gt; = EVENT_FIELD &lt;op&gt; &lt;value&gt; | &lt;filter&gt; '&amp;&amp;' &lt;filter&gt; |
                          &lt;filter&gt; '||' &lt;filter&gt; | '(' &lt;filter&gt; ')' | '!' &lt;filter&gt;
               &lt;op&gt; = '==' | '!=' | '&gt;=' | '&lt;=' | '&gt;' | '&lt;' | '&amp;' | '|' | '^' |
                      '+' | '-' | '*' | '/' | '%'
               &lt;value&gt; = NUM | STRING | EVENT_FIELD

           SYSTEM is the name of the system to filter on. If the EVENT is left out,
           then it applies to all events under the SYSTEM. If only one string is used
           without the '/' to deliminate between SYSTEM and EVENT, then the filter
           will be applied to all systems and events that match the given string.

           Whitespace is ignored, such that "sched:next_pid==123" is equivalent to
           "sched : next_pid == 123".

           STRING is defined with single or double quotes (single quote must end with
           single quote, and double with double). Whitespace within quotes are not
           ignored.

           The representation of a SYSTEM or EVENT may also be a regular expression
           as defined by 'regcomp(3)'.

           The EVENT_FIELD is the name of the field of an event that is being
           filtered. If the event does not contain the EVENT_FIELD, that part of the
           equation will be considered false.

               -F 'sched : bogus == 1 || common_pid == 2'

           The "bogus == 1" will always evaluate to FALSE because no event has a
           field called "bogus", but the "common_pid == 2" will still be evaluated
           since all events have the field "common_pid". Any "sched" event that was
           traced by the process with the PID of 2 will be shown.

           Note, the EVENT_FIELD is the field name as shown by an events format
           (as displayed with *--events*), and not what is found in the output.
           If the output shows "ID:foo" but the field that "foo" belongs to was
           called "name" in the event format, then "name" must be used in the filter.
           The same is true about values. If the value that is displayed is converted
           by to a string symbol, the filter checks the original value and not the
           value displayed. For example, to filter on all tasks that were in the
           running state at a context switch:

               -F 'sched/sched_switch : prev_state==0'

           Although the output displays 'R', having 'prev_stat=="R"' will not work.

           Note: You can also specify 'COMM' as an EVENT_FIELD. This will use the
           task name (or comm) of the record to compare. For example, to filter out
           all of the "trace-cmd" tasks:

               -F '.*:COMM != "trace-cmd"'

       <b>-I</b>
           Do not print events where the HARDIRQ latency flag is set.
           This will filter out most events that are from interrupt
           context. Note, it may not filter out function traced
           functions that are in interrupt context but were called
           before the kernel "in interrupt" flag was set.

       <b>-S</b>
           Do not print events where the SOFTIRQ latency flag is set.
           This will filter out most events that are from soft interrupt
           context.

       <b>-v</b>
           This causes the following filters of <b>-F </b>to filter out the
           matching events.

               -v -F 'sched/sched_switch : prev_state == 0'

           Will not display any sched_switch events that have a prev_state of 0.
           Removing the *-v* will only print out those events.

       <b>-T</b>
           Test the filters of -F. After processing a filter string, the
           resulting filter will be displayed for each event. This is
           useful for using a filter for more than one event where a
           field may not exist in all events. Also it can be used to
           make sure there are no misspelled event field names, as they
           will simply be ignored.  <b>-T </b>is ignored if <b>-F </b>is not
           specified.

       <b>-V</b>
           Show verbose messages (see <b>--verbose </b>but only for the
           numbers)

       <b>-L</b>
           This will not load system wide plugins. It loads "local
           only". That is what it finds in the ~/.trace-cmd/plugins
           directory.

       <b>-N</b>
           This will not load any plugins.

       <b>-n </b><i>event-re</i>
           This will cause all events that match the option to ignore
           any registered handler (by the plugins) to print the event.
           The normal event will be printed instead. The <i>event-re</i> is a
           regular expression as defined by <a href="../man3/regcomp.3.html">regcomp(3)</a>.

       <b>--profile</b>
           With the <b>--profile </b>option, "trace-cmd report" will process
           all the events first, and then output a format showing where
           tasks have spent their time in the kernel, as well as where
           they are blocked the most, and where wake up latencies are.

               See trace-cmd-profile(1) for more details and examples.

       <b>-G</b>
           Set interrupt (soft and hard) events as global (associated to
           CPU instead of tasks). Only works for --profile.

       <b>-H </b><i>event-hooks</i>
           Add custom event matching to connect any two events together.

               See trace-cmd-profile(1) for format.

       <b>-R</b>
           This will show the events in "raw" format. That is, it will
           ignore the event’s print formatting and just print the
           contents of each field.

       <b>-r </b><i>event-re</i>
           This will cause all events that match the option to print its
           raw fields. The <i>event-re</i> is a regular expression as defined
           by <a href="../man3/regcomp.3.html">regcomp(3)</a>.

       <b>-l</b>
           This adds a "latency output" format. Information about
           interrupts being disabled, soft irq being disabled, the
           "need_resched" flag being set, preempt count, and big kernel
           lock are all being recorded with every event. But the default
           display does not show this information. This option will set
           display this information with 6 characters. When one of the
           fields is zero or N/A a '.\' is shown.

                 &lt;idle&gt;-0       0d.h1. 106467.859747: function:             ktime_get &lt;-- tick_check_idle

           The 0d.h1. denotes this information.

           It starts with a number. This represents the CPU number that the event occurred
           on.

           The second character is one of the following:

           'd' - Interrupts are disabled
           '.' - Interrupts are enabled
           'X' - Has flags that are not yet known by trace-cmd

           The third character is the "need rescheduling" flag.

           'N' - A schedule is set to take place
           '.' - No scheduling is set

           The fourth character represents the context the event was in when it triggered

           'h' - Hard interrupt context
           's' - Soft interrupt context
           'H' - Hard interrupt context that interrupted a soft interrupt
           '.' - Normal context

           The next is a number (should be less than 10), that represents the preemption
           depth (the number of times preempt_disable() is called without preempt_enable()).
           '.' means preemption is enabled.

           On some systems, "migrate disable" may exist, in which case a number will be
           shown for that, or '.' meaning migration is enabled.

           If lockdep in enabled on the system, then the number represents the depth of
           locks that are held when the event triggered. '.' means no locks are held.

       <b>-w</b>
           If both the <i>sched_switch</i> and <i>sched_wakeup</i> events are enabled,
           then this option will report the latency between the time the
           task was first woken, and the time it was scheduled in.

       <b>-q</b>
           Quiet non critical warnings.

       <b>-O</b>
           Pass options to the trace-cmd plugins that are loaded.

               -O plugin:var=value

               The 'plugin:' and '=value' are optional. Value may be left off for options
               that are boolean. If the 'plugin:' is left off, then any variable that matches
               in all plugins will be set.

               Example:  -O fgraph:tailprint

       <b>--cpu </b>&lt;cpu list&gt;
           List of CPUs, separated by "," or ":", used for filtering the
           events. A range of CPUs can be specified using "cpuX-cpuY"
           notation, where all CPUs in the range between cpuX and cpuY
           will be included in the list. The order of CPUs in the list
           must be from lower to greater.

               Example:  "--cpu 0,3" - show events from CPUs 0 and 3
                         "--cpu 2-4" - show events from CPUs 2, 3 and 4

       <b>--cpus</b>
           List the CPUs that have data in the trace file then exit.

       <b>--first-event</b>
           Show the timestamp of the first event of all CPUs that have
           data.

       <b>--last-event</b>
           Show the timestamp of the last event of all CPUs that have
           data.

       <b>--stat</b>
           If the trace.dat file recorded the final stats (outputed at
           the end of record) the <b>--stat </b>option can be used to retrieve
           them.

       <b>--uname</b>
           If the trace.dat file recorded uname during the run, this
           will retrieve that information.

       <b>--version</b>
           If the trace.dat file recorded the version of the executable
           used to create it, report that version.

       <b>--ts-offset </b>offset
           Add (or subtract if negative) an offset for all timestamps of
           the previous data file specified with <b>-i</b>. This is useful to
           merge sort multiple trace.dat files where the difference in
           the timestamp is known. For example if a trace is done on a
           virtual guest, and another trace is done on the host. If the
           host timestamp is 1000 units ahead of the guest, the
           following can be done:

               trace-cmd report -i host.dat --ts-offset -1000 -i guest.dat

               This will subtract 1000 timestamp units from all the host events as it merges
               with the guest.dat events. Note, the units is for the raw units recorded in
               the trace. If the units are nanoseconds, the addition (or subtraction) from
               the offset will be nanoseconds even if the displayed units are microseconds.

       <b>--ts2secs </b>HZ
           Convert the current clock source into a second (nanosecond
           resolution) output. When using clocks like x86-tsc, if the
           frequency is known, by passing in the clock frequency, this
           will convert the time to seconds.

               This option affects any trace.dat file given with *-i* proceeding it.
               If this option comes before any *-i* option, then that value becomes
               the default conversion for all other trace.dat files. If another
               --ts2secs option appears after a *-i* trace.dat file, than that option
               will override the default value.

               Example: On a 3.4 GHz machine

               trace-cmd record -p function -C x86-tsc

               trace-cmd report --ts2ns 3400000000

               The report will convert the cycles timestamps into a readable second
               display. The default display resolution is microseconds, unless *-t*
               is used.

               The value of --ts-offset must still be in the raw timestamp units, even
               with this option. The offset will be converted as well.

       <b>--ts-diff</b>
           Show the time differences between events. The difference will
           appear in parenthesis just after the timestamp.

       <b>--ts-check</b>
           Make sure no timestamp goes backwards, and if it does, print
           out a warning message of the fact.

       <b>--nodate</b>
           Ignore converting the timestamps to the date set by <b>trace-cmd</b>
           <b>record</b>(3) --date option.

       <b>--raw-ts</b>
           Display raw timestamps, without any corrections.

       <b>--align-ts</b>
           Display timestamps aligned to the first event.

       <b>--verbose</b>[=<i>level</i>]
           Set the log level. Supported log levels are "none", "crit",
           "err", "warn", "info", "debug", "all" or their identifiers
           "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6". Setting the log level to
           specific value enables all logs from that and all previous
           levels. The level will default to "info" if one is not
           specified.

               Example: enable all critical, error and warning logs

               trace-cmd report --verbose=warning

       The above needs a little explanation. The filter specifies the
       "sched" subsystem, which includes both sched_switch and
       sched_wakeup events. Any event that does not have the format
       field "prev_state" or "success", will evaluate those expressions
       as FALSE, and will not produce a match. Using "||" will have the
       "prev_state" test happen for the "sched_switch" event and the
       "success" test happen for the "sched_wakeup" event.

       "sched_switch" event reports each individual latency after
       writing the event information. At the end of the report, the
       average wakeup latency is reported.

       The above version will only show the wakeups and context switches
       of Real Time tasks. The <i>prio</i> used inside the kernel starts at 0
       for highest priority. That is <i>prio</i> 0 is equivalent to user space
       real time priority 99, and priority 98 is equivalent to user
       space real time priority 1. Prios less than 100 represent Real
       Time tasks.
