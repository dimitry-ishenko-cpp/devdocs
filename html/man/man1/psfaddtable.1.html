NAME </h2>
<pre>
       psfaddtable - add a Unicode character table to a console font
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>psfaddtable </b><i>fontfile tablefile outfile</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>psfaddtable </b>takes a console font in .psf format given by <i>fontfile</i>
       and merges it with the Unicode character table given by <i>tablefile</i>
       to produce a font file with an embedded character table, which is
       written to <i>outfile</i>.  An input file name of "-" denotes standard
       input, and an output file name of "-" denotes standard output.
       If the <i>fontfile</i> already contains an embedded character table, it
       is ignored.
</pre> <h2>
TABLE FILE FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       Each line in the <i>tablefile</i> should be either blank, contain a
       comment (preceded by <i>#</i>), or contain a sequence of numbers in
       either decimal (default), octal (preceded by <i>0</i>), or hexadecimal
       (preceded by <i>0x</i>) format, separated by spaces or tabs.  The first
       number on each line indicates the glyph slot in the font that is
       being referred to, this is between 0 and 0xff for a 256-character
       font and 0 and 0x1ff for a 512-character font.  Any subsequent
       numbers on the same line are Unicodes matched by this specific
       glyph slot.  Instead of a single Unicode one may have a sequence
       of Unicodes separates by commas, to denote that the glyph depicts
       the corresponding composed symbol.  It is permissible to have
       multiple lines for the same glyph.
