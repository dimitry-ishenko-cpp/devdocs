NAME </h2>
<pre>
       localectl - Control the system locale and keyboard layout
       settings
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>localectl </b>[OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>localectl </b>may be used to query and change the system locale and
       keyboard layout settings. It communicates with <a href="../man8/systemd-localed.8.html">systemd-localed(8)</a>
       to modify files such as /etc/locale.conf and /etc/vconsole.conf.

       The system locale controls the language settings of system
       services and of the UI before the user logs in, such as the
       display manager, as well as the default for users after login.

       The keyboard settings control the keyboard layout used on the
       text console and of the graphical UI before the user logs in,
       such as the display manager, as well as the default for users
       after login.

       Note that the changes performed using this tool might require the
       initrd to be rebuilt to take effect during early system boot. The
       initrd is not rebuilt automatically by localectl, this task has
       to be performed manually, usually by reinstalling the
       distribution's kernel package.

       Note that <a href="systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot(1)</a> may be used to initialize the
       system locale for mounted (but not booted) system images.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>status</b>
           Show current settings of the system locale and keyboard
           mapping. If no command is specified, this is the implied
           default.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>set-locale LOCALE</b>, <b>set-locale VARIABLE=LOCALE...</b>
           Set the system locale. This takes one locale such as
           "en_US.UTF-8", or takes one or more locale assignments such
           as "LANG=de_DE.utf8", "LC_MESSAGES=en_GB.utf8", and so on. If
           one locale without variable name is provided, then "LANG="
           locale variable will be set. See <a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale(7)</a> for details on the
           available settings and their meanings. Use <b>list-locales </b>for a
           list of available locales (see below).

           Added in version 195.

       <b>list-locales</b>
           List available locales useful for configuration with
           <b>set-locale</b>.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>set-keymap MAP [TOGGLEMAP]</b>
           Set the system keyboard mapping for the console and X11. This
           takes a mapping name (such as "de" or "us"), and possibly a
           second one to define a toggle keyboard mapping. Unless
           <b>--no-convert </b>is passed, the selected setting is also applied
           as the default system keyboard mapping of X11, after
           converting it to the closest matching X11 keyboard mapping.
           Use <b>list-keymaps </b>for a list of available keyboard mappings
           (see below).

           Added in version 195.

       <b>list-keymaps</b>
           List available keyboard mappings for the console, useful for
           configuration with <b>set-keymap</b>.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>set-x11-keymap LAYOUT [MODEL [VARIANT [OPTIONS]]]</b>
           Set the system default keyboard mapping for X11 and the
           virtual console. This takes a keyboard mapping name (such as
           "de" or "us"), and possibly a model, variant, and options,
           see <b>kbd</b>(4) for details. Unless <b>--no-convert </b>is passed, the
           selected setting is also applied as the system console
           keyboard mapping, after converting it to the closest matching
           console keyboard mapping.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>list-x11-keymap-models</b>, <b>list-x11-keymap-layouts</b>,
       <b>list-x11-keymap-variants [LAYOUT]</b>, <b>list-x11-keymap-options</b>
           List available X11 keymap models, layouts, variants and
           options, useful for configuration with <b>set-keymap</b>. The
           command <b>list-x11-keymap-variants </b>optionally takes a layout
           parameter to limit the output to the variants suitable for
           the specific layout.

           Added in version 201.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged
           operations.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>--no-convert</b>
           If <b>set-keymap </b>or <b>set-x11-keymap </b>is invoked and this option is
           passed, then the keymap will not be converted from the
           console to X11, or X11 to console, respectively.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
           username and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The
           hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is
           listening on, separated by ":", and then a container name,
           separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific
           container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to
           the remote machine manager instance. Container names may be
           enumerated with <b>machinectl -H </b><i>HOST</i>. Put IPv6 addresses in
           brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
           name to connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to
           connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special
           string ".host" is used in place of the container name, a
           connection to the local system is made (which is useful to
           connect to a specific user's user bus: "--user
           --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
           connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used
           either the left hand side or the right hand side may be
           omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and
           ".host" are implied.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</i>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a
           higher log level, i.e. less important ones, will be
           suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value
           may be either one of (in order of decreasing importance)
           <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an
           integer in the range 0...7. See <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a> for more
           information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with one
           of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg </b>or <b>journal </b>followed by a colon to
           set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.
           <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info </b>specifies to log at
           debug level except when logging to the console which should
           be at info level). Note that the global maximum log level
           takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be
           colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and other
           tools that display logs will color messages based on the log
           level on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</i>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed
           with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal or a file, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and
           other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on
           the entry metadata on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename
           and line number in the source code where the message
           originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to
           journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
           text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the
           current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to
           journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
           text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</i>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console </b>(log to the
           attached tty), <b>console-prefixed </b>(log to the attached tty but
           with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see
           <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>, <b>kmsg </b>(log to the kernel circular log buffer),
           <b>journal </b>(log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg </b>(log to the
           journal if available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto </b>(determine
           the appropriate log target automatically, the default), <b>null</b>
           (disable log output).

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</i>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults
           to "true". If disabled, systemd will not ratelimit messages
           written to kmsg.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager </b>is not given; overrides <i>$PAGER</i>.
           If neither <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> nor <i>$PAGER</i> are set, a set of
           well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including
           <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> and <a href="more.1.html">more(1)</a>, until one is found. If no pager
           implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting
           this environment variable to an empty string or the value
           "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> (as
           well as <i>$PAGER</i>) will be silently ignored.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i>
           Override the options passed to <b>less </b>(by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when
               Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less </b>to handle Ctrl+C itself
               to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this
               option.

               If the value of <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i> does not include "K", and
               the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C will be ignored
               by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap
               initialization and deinitialization strings to the
               terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to
               remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
               exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager
               functionality from working, in particular paged output
               cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESS</i> environment variable has
           no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

           See <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> for more discussion.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</i>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less </b>(by default "utf-8", if
           the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESSCHARSET</i> environment
           variable has no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the
           pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective
           UID is not the same as the owner of the login session, see
           <a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid(2)</a> and <a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid(3)</a>. In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1 </b>will be set when invoking the pager, and the
           pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or
           start new subprocesses. When <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set
           at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode
           will not be used. (Currently only <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for
           example under <a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo(8)</a> or <b>pkexec</b>(1), care must be taken to
           ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled.
           "Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as
           describe above. Setting <i>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</i> or not removing
           it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke
           arbitrary commands. Note that if the <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> or <i>$PAGER</i>
           variables are to be honoured, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> must be
           set too. It might be reasonable to completely disable the
           pager using <b>--no-pager </b>instead.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd </b>and related
           utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the
           output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can
           take one of the following special values: "16", "256" to
           restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic
           decision based on <i>$TERM</i> and what the console is connected to.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</i>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links
           should be generated in the output for terminal emulators
           supporting this. This can be specified to override the
           decision that <b>systemd </b>makes based on <i>$TERM</i> and other
           conditions.
