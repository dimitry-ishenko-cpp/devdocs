NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fold — filter for folding lines
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       fold <b>[</b>-bs<b>] [</b>-w <i>width</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fold</i> utility is a filter that shall fold lines from its input
       files, breaking the lines to have a maximum of <i>width</i> column
       positions (or bytes, if the <b>-b </b>option is specified). Lines shall
       be broken by the insertion of a &lt;newline&gt; such that each output
       line (referred to later in this section as a <i>segment</i>) is the
       maximum width possible that does not exceed the specified number
       of column positions (or bytes). A line shall not be broken in the
       middle of a character. The behavior is undefined if <i>width</i> is less
       than the number of columns any single character in the input
       would occupy.

       If the &lt;carriage-return&gt;, &lt;backspace&gt;, or &lt;tab&gt; characters are
       encountered in the input, and the <b>-b </b>option is not specified,
       they shall be treated specially:

       &lt;backspace&gt;
                 The current count of line width shall be decremented by
                 one, although the count never shall become negative.
                 The <i>fold</i> utility shall not insert a &lt;newline&gt;
                 immediately before or after any &lt;backspace&gt;, unless the
                 following character has a width greater than 1 and
                 would cause the line width to exceed <i>width</i>.

       &lt;carriage-return&gt;
                 The current count of line width shall be set to zero.
                 The <i>fold</i> utility shall not insert a &lt;newline&gt;
                 immediately before or after any &lt;carriage-return&gt;.

       &lt;tab&gt;     Each &lt;tab&gt; encountered shall advance the column
                 position pointer to the next tab stop. Tab stops shall
                 be at each column position <i>n</i> such that <i>n</i> modulo 8
                 equals 1.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fold</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-b        </b>Count <i>width</i> in bytes rather than column positions.

       <b>-s        </b>If a segment of a line contains a &lt;blank&gt; within the
                 first <i>width</i> column positions (or bytes), break the line
                 after the last such &lt;blank&gt; meeting the width
                 constraints. If there is no &lt;blank&gt; meeting the
                 requirements, the <b>-s </b>option shall have no effect for
                 that output segment of the input line.

       <b>-w </b><i>width</i>  Specify the maximum line length, in column positions
                 (or bytes if <b>-b </b>is specified). The results are
                 unspecified if <i>width</i> is not a positive decimal number.
                 The default value shall be 80.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a text file to be folded. If no <i>file</i>
                 operands are specified, the standard input shall be
                 used.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used if no <i>file</i> operands are
       specified, and shall be used if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-' </b>and the
       implementation treats the <b>'-' </b>as meaning standard input.
       Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT
       FILES section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>-b </b>option is specified, the input files shall be text
       files except that the lines are not limited to {LINE_MAX} bytes
       in length. If the <b>-b </b>option is not specified, the input files
       shall be text files.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>fold</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files), and for the
                 determination of the width in column positions each
                 character would occupy on a constant-width font output
                 device.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cut</i> and <i>fold</i> utilities can be used to create text files out
       of files with arbitrary line lengths. The <i>cut</i> utility should be
       used when the number of lines (or records) needs to remain
       constant. The <i>fold</i> utility should be used when the contents of
       long lines need to be kept contiguous.

       The <i>fold</i> utility is frequently used to send text files to
       printers that truncate, rather than fold, lines wider than the
       printer is able to print (usually 80 or 132 column positions).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       An example invocation that submits a file of possibly long lines
       to the printer (under the assumption that the user knows the line
       width of the printer to be assigned by <i>lp</i>):

           fold -w 132 bigfile | lp
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Although terminal input in canonical processing mode requires the
       erase character (frequently set to &lt;backspace&gt;) to erase the
       previous character (not byte or column position), terminal output
       is not buffered and is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
       parse correctly; the interpretation depends entirely on the
       physical device that actually displays/prints/stores the output.
       In all known internationalized implementations, the utilities
       producing output for mixed column-width output assume that a
       &lt;backspace&gt; character backs up one column position and outputs
       enough &lt;backspace&gt; characters to return to the start of the
       character when &lt;backspace&gt; is used to provide local line motions
       to support underlining and emboldening operations. Since <i>fold</i>
       without the <b>-b </b>option is dealing with these same constraints,
       &lt;backspace&gt; is always treated as backing up one column position
       rather than backing up one character.

       Historical versions of the <i>fold</i> utility assumed 1 byte was one
       character and occupied one column position when written out. This
       is no longer always true. Since the most common usage of <i>fold</i> is
       believed to be folding long lines for output to limited-length
       output devices, this capability was preserved as the default
       case. The <b>-b </b>option was added so that applications could <i>fold</i>
       files with arbitrary length lines into text files that could then
       be processed by the standard utilities. Note that although the
       width for the <b>-b </b>option is in bytes, a line is never split in the
       middle of a character.  (It is unspecified what happens if a
       width is specified that is too small to hold a single character
       found in the input followed by a &lt;newline&gt;.)

       The tab stops are hardcoded to be every eighth column to meet
       historical practice. No new method of specifying other tab stops
       was invented.
