PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       strip — remove unnecessary information from strippable files
       (<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       strip <i>file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A strippable file is defined as a relocatable, object, or
       executable file.  On XSI-conformant systems, a strippable file
       can also be an archive of object or relocatable files.

       The <i>strip</i> utility shall remove from strippable files named by the
       <i>file</i> operands any information the implementor deems unnecessary
       for execution of those files. The nature of that information is
       unspecified. The effect of <i>strip</i> on object and executable files
       shall be similar to the use of the <b>-s </b>option to <i>c99</i> or <i>fort77</i>.
       The effect of <i>strip</i> on an archive of object files shall be
       similar to the use of the <b>-s </b>option to <i>c99</i> or <i>fort77</i> for each
       object file in the archive.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname referring to a strippable file.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be in the form of strippable files
       successfully produced by any compiler defined by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 or produced by creating or updating an archive of
       such files using the <i>ar</i> utility.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>strip</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>strip</i> utility shall produce strippable files of unspecified
       format.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Historically, this utility has been used to remove the symbol
       table from a strippable file. It was included since it is known
       that the amount of symbolic information can amount to several
       megabytes; the ability to remove it in a portable manner was
       deemed important, especially for smaller systems.

       The behavior of <i>strip</i> on object and executable files is said to
       be the same as the <b>-s </b>option to a compiler. While the end result
       is essentially the same, it is not required to be identical.

       XSI-conformant systems support use of <i>strip</i> on archive files
       containing object files or relocatable files.
