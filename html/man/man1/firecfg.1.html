NAME </h2>
<pre>
       Firecfg - Desktop integration utility for Firejail software.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       firecfg [OPTIONS]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Firecfg is the desktop integration utility for Firejail sandbox.
       It allows the user to sandbox applications automatically by
       clicking on desktop manager icons and menus.

       The integration covers:

              - programs started in a terminal - typing "firefox" would
              be enough to start a sandboxed Firefox browser

              - programs started by clicking on desktop manager menus -
              all major desktop managers are supported

              - programs started by clicking on file icons in file
              manager - only Cinnamon, KDE, LXDE/LXQT, MATE and XFCE
              desktop managers are supported in this moment

       To set it up, run "sudo firecfg" after installing Firejail
       software.  The same command should also be run after installing
       new programs. If the program is supported by Firejail, the
       symbolic link in /usr/local/bin will be created. For a full list
       of programs supported by default run "cat
       /etc/firejail/firecfg.config".

       For user-driven manual integration, see <b>DESKTOP INTEGRATION</b>
       section in <b>man 1 firejail</b>.
</pre> <h2>
DEFAULT ACTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following actions are implemented by default by running sudo
       firecfg:

              - set or update the symbolic links for desktop
              integration;

              - add the current user to Firejail user access database
              (firecfg --add-users);

              - fix desktop files in $HOME/.local/share/applications/
              (firecfg --fix).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--add-users user [user]</b>
              Add the list of users to Firejail user access database.

              Example:
              $ sudo firecfg --add-users dustin lucas mike eleven

       <b>--bindir=directory</b>
              Create and search symbolic links in directory instead of
              the default location /usr/local/bin.  Directory should
              precede /usr/bin and /bin in the PATH environment
              variable.

       <b>--clean</b>
              Remove all firejail symbolic links.

       <b>--fix  </b>Fix .desktop files. Some .desktop files use full path to
              executable. Firecfg will check .desktop files in
              /usr/share/applications/, replace full path by name if it
              is in PATH, and write result to
              $HOME/.local/share/applications/.  This action is done by
              default when running "sudo firecfg". We have it as a
              separate option for regular users.

       <b>--fix-sound</b>
              Create a proper ~/.config/pulse/client.conf file without
              shm support. On some PulseAudio versions, shared memory
              support (shm) breaks the process ID namespace. PulseAudio
              software was designed a long time ago, and the
              introduction of PID namespace in Linux kernel breaks their
              design. This was reportedly fixed in PulseAudio version 9.
              If you have sound problems on your system, run "firecfg
              --fix-sound" command in a terminal, followed by
              logout/login in order to apply the changes.

       <b>--guide</b>
              Guided configuration for new users.

              Example:
              $ sudo firecfg --guide

       <b>--debug</b>
              Print debug messages.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print options end exit.

       <b>--list </b>List all firejail symbolic links

       <b>--version</b>
              Print program version and exit.

       Example:

       $ sudo firecfg
       /usr/local/bin/firefox created
       /usr/local/bin/vlc created
       [...]
       $ firecfg --list
       /usr/local/bin/firefox
       /usr/local/bin/vlc
       [...]
       $ sudo firecfg --clean
       /usr/local/bin/firefox removed
       /usr/local/bin/vlc removed
       [...]
