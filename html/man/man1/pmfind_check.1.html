</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmfind_check </b>- administration of Performance Co-Pilot discovery
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmfind_check </b>[<b>-CNV?</b>]  [<b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This shell script is used to integrate the Performance Co-Pilot
       (see <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>) collector service discovery mechanisms with
       <a href="pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> and <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> service administration, such that
       multiple collector hosts can be monitored from a single
       centralized host.  It is important to note that the <b>pmfind</b>
       service is tightly integrated with the <b>pmie </b>and <b>pmlogger</b>
       services, and these must also be enabled if the services are to
       be started for each collector system that <b>pmfind </b>discovers.

       <b>pmfind_check </b>is designed to be enabled via a service management
       daemon such as <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> on Linux.  It is run from a system
       timer (either by <b>systemd </b>or by <b>cron </b>on other systems).  Once per
       timer interval <b>pmfind </b>attempts discovery of PCP collector
       systems.  For each unique system found <b>pmfind_check </b>creates
       <b>pmie_check </b>and <b>pmlogger_check </b>control file entries, such that
       these latter process can manage one <b>pmie </b>and <b>pmlogger </b>service for
       each discovered collector system.

       When run through <b>systemd </b>these processes will be launched
       immediately because <b>systemd </b>monitors the service control files
       for changes.  With <b>systemd </b>one may also initiate an immediate
       service discovery with <b>pmfind </b>and <b>pmfind_check </b>by modifying the
       <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmfind</i> directory in any way.

       When run from <b>cron </b>the next (also timer-based) invocation of
       <b>pmie_check </b>or <b>pmlogger_check </b>will start and manage the associated
       <b>pmie </b>and <b>pmlogger </b>processes.

       The control file entries created by <b>pmfind_check </b>follow the
       convention of individual files for each collector host.  The
       files are named using the (unique) source identifier that <b>pmfind</b>
       calculates.  This identifier is a hash calculated based on (non-
       optional) context labels available from every collector host, and
       is the same source identifier reported and used by <a href="pminfo.1.html">pminfo(1)</a> and
       <a href="pmseries.1.html">pmseries(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--containers</b>
            This option causes <b>pmfind_check </b>to query each discovered
            collector system for running containers as well, which will
            then be individually monitored.

       <b>-l </b><i>file</i>, <b>--logfile</b>=<i>file</i>
            In order to ensure that mail is not unintentionally sent
            when these scripts are run from <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron(8)</a> diagnostics are
            always sent to log files.  By default, this file is
            <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmfind/pmfind_check.log </b>but this can be changed
            using the <b>-l </b>option.  If this log <i>file</i> already exists when
            the script starts, it will be renamed with a <i>.prev</i> suffix
            (overwriting any log file saved earlier) before diagnostics
            are generated to the new log file.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--showme</b>
            This option enables a ``show me'' mode, where the programs
            actions are echoed, but not executed, in the style of ``make
            -n''.  Using <b>-N </b>in conjunction with <b>-V </b>maximizes the
            diagnostic capabilities for debugging.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            The output from the <b>cron </b>execution of the scripts may be
            extended using the <b>-V </b>option to the scripts which will
            enable verbose tracing of their activity.  By default the
            scripts generate no output unless some error or warning
            condition is encountered.  Using <b>-N </b>in conjunction with <b>-V</b>
            maximizes the diagnostic capabilities for debugging.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The command line options passed to <b>pmie </b>and <b>pmlogger </b>can be
       customized via the <i>$PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmfind</i> configuration file.

       Refer to the <b>pmie_check </b>and <b>pmlogger_check </b>manual pages for
       details of the control file format generated by <b>pmfind_check</b>.

       By default, each collector system <b>pmie </b>logfile will be created in
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmie/</b><i>source</i> and <b>pmlogger </b>archives will be created
       below <b>$PCP_ARCHIVE_DIR/</b><i>source</i>.  This is consistent with the way
       <a href="pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> and <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> maintain their activity logs and archive
       files.

       Typical <a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab(5)</a> entries for periodic execution of <b>pmfind_check</b>
       are given in <b>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmfind/crontab </b>(unless installed by
       default in <i>/etc/cron.d</i> already) and shown below.

       # every minute, discover remote PCP services
       *       *       *       *       *       $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmfind_check
       When using <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> on Linux, no <b>crontab </b>entries are needed as
       the timer and path mechanisms provided by <b>systemd </b>are used
       instead.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$PCP_PMIECONTROL_PATH.d</i>
            PCP inference engine control files for each discovered
            metric source, typically one per host or container.
            <b>Warning</b>: this files herein must not be writable by any user
            other than root.

       <i>$PCP_PMLOGGERCONTROL_PATH.d</i>
            PCP logger control files for each discovered metric source,
            typically one per host or container.
            <b>Warning</b>: this files herein must not be writable by any user
            other than root.

       <i>$PCP_SYSCONFIG_DIR/pmfind</i>
            default <b>pmie </b>and <b>pmlogger </b>command line arguments, and other
            parameters passed to <b>pmfind</b>.

       <i>$PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pmfind/crontab</i>
            sample crontab for automated script execution by root -
            exists only if the platform does not support the <i>/etc/cron.d</i>
            mechanism.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
