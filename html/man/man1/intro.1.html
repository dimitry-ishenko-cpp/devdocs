NAME </h2>
<pre>
       intro - introduction to user commands
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Section 1 of the manual describes user commands and tools, for
       example, file manipulation tools, shells, compilers, web
       browsers, file and image viewers and editors, and so on.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Linux is a flavor of UNIX, and user commands under UNIX work
       similarly under Linux (and lots of other UNIX-like systems too,
       like FreeBSD).

       Under Linux, there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where
       you can point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done
       without first reading lots of documentation.  The traditional
       UNIX environment is a CLI (command line interface), where you
       type commands to tell the computer what to do.  This is faster
       and more powerful, but requires finding out what the commands are
       and how to use them.  Below is a bare minimum guide to get you
       started.

   <b>Login</b>
       In order to start working, you'll probably first have to open a
       session.  The program <a href="login.1.html">login(1)</a> will wait for you to type your
       username and password, and after that, it will start a <i>shell</i>
       (command interpreter) for you.  In case of a graphical login, you
       get a screen with menus or icons and a mouse click will start a
       shell in a window.  See also <b>xterm</b>(1).

   <b>The shell</b>
       One types commands into the <i>shell</i>, the command interpreter.  It
       is not built-in; it is just another program.  You can change your
       shell, and everybody has their own favorite one.  The standard
       one is called <i>sh</i>.  See also <b>ash</b>(1), <a href="bash.1.html">bash(1)</a>, <a href="chsh.1.html">chsh(1)</a>, <b>csh</b>(1),
       <a href="dash.1.html">dash(1)</a>, <b>ksh</b>(1), <b>zsh</b>(1).

       A session might look like this:

           knuth login: <b>aeb</b>
           Password: <b>********</b>
           $ <b>date</b>
           Tue Aug  6 23:50:44 CEST 2002
           $ <b>cal</b>

           drwxr-xr-x   2 aeb       1024 Aug  6 23:51 bin
           -rw-r--r--   1 aeb         37 Aug  6 23:52 tel
           -rw-r--r--   1 aeb         37 Aug  6 23:53 tel2
           $ <b>mv tel tel1</b>
           $ <b>ls -l</b>
           total 3
           drwxr-xr-x   2 aeb       1024 Aug  6 23:51 bin
           -rw-r--r--   1 aeb         37 Aug  6 23:52 tel1
           -rw-r--r--   1 aeb         37 Aug  6 23:53 tel2
           $ <b>diff tel1 tel2</b>
           $ <b>rm tel1</b>
           $ <b>grep maja tel2</b>
           maja    0501-1136285
           $

       Here typing Control-D ended the session.

       The <b>$ </b>here was the command prompt—it is the shell's way of
       indicating that it is ready for the next command.  The prompt can
       be customized in lots of ways, and one might include stuff like
       username, machine name, current directory, time, and so on.  An
       assignment PS1="What next, master? " would change the prompt as
       indicated.

       We see that there are commands <i>date</i> (that gives date and time),
       and <i>cal</i> (that gives a calendar).

       The command <i>ls</i> lists the contents of the current directory—it
       tells you what files you have.  With a <i>-l</i> option it gives a long
       listing, that includes the owner and size and date of the file,
       and the permissions people have for reading and/or changing the
       file.  For example, the file "tel" here is 37 bytes long, owned
       by aeb and the owner can read and write it, others can only read
       it.  Owner and permissions can be changed by the commands <i>chown</i>
       and <i>chmod</i>.

       The command <i>cat</i> will show the contents of a file.  (The name is
       from "concatenate and print": all files given as parameters are
       concatenated and sent to "standard output" (see <a href="../man3/stdout.3.html">stdout(3)</a>), here
       the terminal screen.)

       The command <i>cp</i> (from "copy") will copy a file.

       The command <i>mv</i> (from "move"), on the other hand, only renames it.

       The command <i>diff</i> lists the differences between two files.  Here
       there was no output because there were no differences.

       The command <i>rm</i> (from "remove") deletes the file, and be careful!
       it is gone.  No wastepaper basket or anything.  Deleted means
       lost.

       The command <i>grep</i> (from "g/re/p") finds occurrences of a string in
       one or more files.  Here it finds Maja's telephone number.

   <b>Pathnames and the current directory</b>
       Files live in a large tree, the file hierarchy.  Each has a
       <i>pathname</i> describing the path from the root of the tree (which is
       called <i>/</i>) to the file.  For example, such a full pathname might
       be <i>/home/aeb/tel</i>.  Always using full pathnames would be
       inconvenient, and the name of a file in the current directory may
       be abbreviated by giving only the last component.  That is why
       <i>/home/aeb/tel</i> can be abbreviated to <i>tel</i> when the current
       directory is <i>/home/aeb</i>.

       The command <i>pwd</i> prints the current directory.

       The command <i>cd</i> changes the current directory.

       Try alternatively <i>cd</i> and <i>pwd</i> commands and explore <i>cd</i> usage: "cd",
       "cd .", "cd ..", "cd /", and "cd ~".

   <b>Directories</b>
       The command <i>mkdir</i> makes a new directory.

       The command <i>rmdir</i> removes a directory if it is empty, and
       complains otherwise.

       The command <i>find</i> (with a rather baroque syntax) will find files
       with given name or other properties.  For example, "find . -name
       tel" would find the file <i>tel</i> starting in the present directory
       (which is called <i>.</i>).  And "find / -name tel" would do the same,
       but starting at the root of the tree.  Large searches on a multi-
       GB disk will be time-consuming, and it may be better to use
       <a href="locate.1.html">locate(1)</a>.

   <b>Disks and filesystems</b>
       The command <i>mount</i> will attach the filesystem found on some disk
       (or floppy, or CDROM or so) to the big filesystem hierarchy.  And
       <i>umount</i> detaches it again.  The command <i>df</i> will tell you how much
       of your disk is still free.

   <b>Processes</b>
       On a UNIX system many user and system processes run
       simultaneously.  The one you are talking to runs in the
       <i>foreground</i>, the others in the <i>background</i>.  The command <i>ps</i> will
       show you which processes are active and what numbers these
       processes have.  The command <i>kill</i> allows you to get rid of them.
       Without option this is a friendly request: please go away.  And
       "kill -9" followed by the number of the process is an immediate
       kill.  Foreground processes can often be killed by typing
       Control-C.

   <b>Getting information</b>
       There are thousands of commands, each with many options.
       Traditionally commands are documented on <i>man pages</i>, (like this
       one), so that the command "man kill" will document the use of the
       command "kill" (and "man man" document the command "man").  The
       program <i>man</i> sends the text through some <i>pager</i>, usually <i>less</i>.  Hit
       the space bar to get the next page, hit q to quit.

       In documentation it is customary to refer to man pages by giving
       the name and section number, as in <a href="man.1.html">man(1)</a>.  Man pages are terse,
       and allow you to find quickly some forgotten detail.  For
       newcomers an introductory text with more examples and
       explanations is useful.

       A lot of GNU/FSF software is provided with info files.  Type
       "info info" for an introduction on the use of the program <i>info</i>.

       Special topics are often treated in HOWTOs.  Look in
       <i>/usr/share/doc/howto/en</i> and use a browser if you find HTML files
       there.
