</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       newgrp - log in to a new group
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>newgrp </b>[-] [<i>group</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>newgrp </b>command is used to change the current group ID during
       a login session. If the optional <b>- </b>flag is given, the user's
       environment will be reinitialized as though the user had logged
       in, otherwise the current environment, including current working
       directory, remains unchanged.

       <b>newgrp </b>changes the current real group ID to the named group, or
       to the default group listed in /etc/passwd if no group name is
       given.  <b>newgrp </b>also tries to add the group to the user groupset.
       If not root, the user will be prompted for a password if she does
       not have a password (in /etc/shadow if this user has an entry in
       the shadowed password file, or in /etc/passwd otherwise) and the
       group does, or if the user is not listed as a member and the
       group has a password. The user will be denied access if the group
       password is empty and the user is not listed as a member.

       If there is an entry for this group in /etc/gshadow, then the
       list of members and the password of this group will be taken from
       this file, otherwise, the entry in /etc/group is considered.
</pre> <h2>
