OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -v, --verbose
           Provide more detailed reports:

           count: the number of loose objects

           size: disk space consumed by loose objects, in KiB (unless -H
           is specified)

           in-pack: the number of in-pack objects

           size-pack: disk space consumed by the packs, in KiB (unless
           -H is specified)

           prune-packable: the number of loose objects that are also
           present in the packs. These objects could be pruned using <b>git</b>
           <b>prune-packed</b>.

           garbage: the number of files in the object database that are
           neither valid loose objects nor valid packs

           size-garbage: disk space consumed by garbage files, in KiB
           (unless -H is specified)

           alternate: absolute path of alternate object databases; may
           appear multiple times, one line per path. Note that if the
           path contains non-printable characters, it may be surrounded
           by double-quotes and contain C-style backslashed escape
           sequences.
