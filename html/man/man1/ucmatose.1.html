NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ucmatose - RDMA CM connection and simple ping-pong test.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>ucmatose</i> [-s server_address] [-b bind_address]
                 [-f address_format] [-P port_space]
                 [-c connections] [-C message_count] [-S message_size] [-a ack_timeout]
       <i>ucmatose</i> -s server_address [-b bind_address]
                 [-f address_format] [-P port_space]

</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Establishes a set of reliable RDMA connections between two nodes
       using the librdmacm, optionally transfers data between the nodes,
       then disconnects.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -s server_address
              The network name or IP address of the server system
              listening for connections.  The used name or address must
              route over an RDMA device.  This option must be specified
              by the client.

       -b bind_address
              The local network address to bind to.  To bind to any
              address with IPv6 use -b ::0 .

       -f address_format
              Specifies the format of the server and bind address.  Be
              default, the format is determined by getaddrinfo() as
              either being a hostname, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6
              address.  This option may be used to indicate that a
              specific address format has been provided.  Supported
              address_format values are: name, ip, ipv6, and gid.

       -P port_space
              Specifies the port space for the connection.  Be default,
              the port space is the RDMA TCP port space. (Note that the
              RDMA port space may be separate from that used for IP.)
              Supported port_space values are: tcp and ib.

       -c connections
              The number of connections to establish between the client
              and server.  (default 1)

       -C message_count
              The number of messages to transfer over each connection.
              (default 10)

       -S message_size
              The size of each message transferred, in bytes.  (default
              100)

       -t tos Indicates the type of service used for the communication.
              Type of service is implementation dependent based on
              subnet configuration.

       -a ack_timeout
              Indicates the QP ACK timeout value that should be used.
              The value calculated according to the formula 4.096 *
              2^(ack_timeout) usec.

       -m     Tests event channel migration.  Migrates all communication
              identifiers to a different event channel for disconnect
              events.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Basic usage is to start ucmatose on a server system, then run
       ucmatose -s server_name on a client system.

       Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace, users must
       ensure that they have available system resources and permissions.
       See the libibverbs README file for additional details.
