NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_link - create symlinks in package build directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_link </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-A</b>] [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>]
       [<i>source destination</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_link </b>is a debhelper program that creates symlinks in package
       build directories.

       <b>dh_link </b>accepts a list of pairs of source and destination files.
       The source files are the already existing files that will be
       symlinked from (called <b>target </b>by <a href="ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>). The destination files
       are the symlinks that will be created (called <b>link name </b>by
       <a href="ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>). There <b>must </b>be an equal number of source and destination
       files specified.

       Be sure you <b>do </b>specify the absolute path to both the source and
       destination files (unlike you would do if you were using
       something like <a href="ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>).  Please note that the leading slash is
       optional.

       <b>dh_link </b>will generate symlinks that comply with Debian policy -
       absolute when policy says they should be absolute, and relative
       links with as short a path as possible. It will also create any
       subdirectories it needs to put the symlinks in.

       Any pre-existing destination files will be replaced with
       symlinks.

       <b>dh_link </b>also scans the package build tree for existing symlinks
       which do not conform to Debian policy, and corrects them (v4 or
       later).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.links
           Lists pairs of source and destination files to be symlinked.
           Each pair should be put on its own line, with the source and
           destination separated by whitespace.

           In each pair the source file (called <b>target </b>by <a href="ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>) comes
           first and is followed by the destination file (called <b>link</b>
           <b>name </b>by <a href="ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>). Thus the pairs of source and destination
           files in each line are given in the same order as they would
           be given to <a href="ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>.

           In contrast to <a href="ln.1.html">ln(1)</a>, source and destination paths must be
           absolute (the leading slash is optional).

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
           documented in <a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper(7)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Create any links specified by command line parameters in ALL
           packages acted on, not just the first.

       <b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude symlinks that contain <i>item</i> anywhere in their filename
           from being corrected to comply with Debian policy.

       <i>source destination</i> ...
           Create a file named <i>destination</i> as a link to a file named
           <i>source</i>. Do this in the package build directory of the first
           package acted on.  (Or in all packages if <b>-A </b>is specified.)
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        dh_link usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1

       Make <i>bar.1</i> be a symlink to <i>foo.1</i>

        dh_link var/lib/foo usr/lib/foo \
          usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1

       Make <i>/usr/lib/foo/</i> be a link to <i>/var/lib/foo/</i>, and <i>bar.1</i> be a
       symlink to the <i>foo.1</i>

        var/lib/foo usr/lib/foo
        usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1

       Same as above but as content for a debian/<i>package</i>.links file.
