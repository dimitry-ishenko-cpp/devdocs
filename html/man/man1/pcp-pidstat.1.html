DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pcp-pidstat </b>command is used for monitoring individual tasks
       running on the system.  Using various options it helps a user to
       see useful information related to the processes.  This
       information includes CPU percentage, memory and stack usage,
       scheduling and priority.  By default <b>pcp-pidstat </b>reports live
       data for the local host.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       When invoked via the <a href="pcp.1.html">pcp(1)</a> command, the <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>,
       <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>, <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>, <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>, <b>-Z</b>/<b>--timezone </b>and
       several other <i>pcp options</i> become indirectly available; refer to
       <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for a complete description of these options.

       The additional command line options available for <b>pcp-pidstat</b>

            StkSize
                  The amount of memory in kilobytes reserved for the

            referenced by the task.

            Command
                  The command name of the task.

       <b>-U </b>[<i>username</i>]<b>, --user-name</b><i>[=username]</i>
            Display the real user name of the tasks being monitored
            instead of the UID.  If <i>username</i> is specified, then only
            tasks belonging to the specified user are displayed.

       <b>-V, --version</b>
            Print version number then exit.

       <b>-G </b><i>processname</i><b>, --process-name=</b><i>processname</i>
            Display only processes whose command name includes the
            string <i>processname</i>.  This string can be a regular
            expression.

       <b>-p </b><i>pid1,pid2..</i><b>, --pid-list=</b><i>pid1,pid2..</i>
            Display only processes with the listed PIDs.

       <b>-t </b><i>interval</i><b>, --interval=</b><i>interval</i>
            Set the interval between two samples.  The default is one
            second.

       <b>-s </b><i>count</i><b>, --samples=</b><i>count</i>
            Set the number of samples to be displayed.  Since the first
            sample is used for the rate conversion of some of the
            metrics, the total number of samples reported are one less
            than <i>count</i>.  The default is continuous.

       <b>-a </b><i>archive</i><b>, --archive=</b><i>archive</i>
            Causes <b>pcp-pidstat </b>to use the specified archive than
            connecting to PMCD.  The argument to <b>-a </b>is a comma-separated
            list of names, each of which may be the base name of an
            archive or the name of a directory containing one or more
            archives.

       <b>-B   </b>Report process states.  The argument to -B is one of the
            following:

            <b>detail</b>
                   Show total time processes have spent in each of the 5
            different states

            <b>all</b>
                   Show total time processes spent in their current
            state

            [<b>R</b>,<b>S</b>,<b>T</b>,<b>D</b>,<b>Z</b>]
                   A comma separated list of process states.  For
            example, <b>-B R,S </b>will report processes currently in either <b>R</b>
            or <b>S </b>states and not report processes currently in any other
            states.

       <b>-f   </b>Use the format string for formatting the timestamp.  The
            format will be used with the <b>python</b>(1) datetime.strftime
            method which is similar to that described in <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime(3)</a>.
            An empty format string (i.e, "") will remove the timestamps
            from the output.  The default with stdout is %H:%M:%S.

       <b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i><b>, --timezone=</b><i>timezone</i>
            By default, <b>pcp-pidstat </b>reports the time of day according to
            the local timezone on the system where <b>pcp-pidstat </b>is run.
            The <b>-Z </b>option changes the timezone to <i>timezone</i> in the format
            of the environment variable <b>TZ </b>as described in <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.

       <b>-z </b>, <b>--hostzone</b>
            Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
            host that is the source of the performance metrics.  When
            replaying a PCP archive that was captured in a foreign
            timezone, the <b>-z </b>option would almost always be used (the
            default reporting timezone is the local timezone, which may
            not be the same as the timezone of the PCP archive).

       <b>-? </b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcp-pidstat </b>is inspired by the <a href="pidstat.1.html">pidstat(1)</a> command and aims to be
       command line and output compatible with it.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
       <a href="../man3/pmgetoptions.3.html">pmGetOptions(3)</a>.
