DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>who</i> utility shall list various pieces of information about
       accessible users. The domain of accessibility is implementation-
       defined.

       Based on the options given, <i>who</i> can also list the user's name,
       terminal line, login time, elapsed time since activity occurred
       on the line, and the process ID of the command interpreter for
       each current system user.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>who</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported. The metavariables, such
       as &lt;<i>line</i>&gt;, refer to fields described in the STDOUT section.

       <b>-a        </b>Process the implementation-defined database or named
                 file with the <b>-b</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-t</b>, <b>-T </b>and <b>-u </b>options
                 turned on.

       <b>-b        </b>Write the time and date of the last system reboot. The
                 system reboot time is the time at which the
                 implementation is able to commence running processes.

       <b>-d        </b>Write a list of all processes that have expired and not
                 been respawned by the <i>init</i> system process. The &lt;<i>exit</i>&gt;
                 field shall appear for dead processes and contain the
                 termination and exit values of the dead process. This
                 can be useful in determining why a process terminated.

       <b>-H        </b>Write column headings above the regular output.

       <b>-l        </b>(The letter ell.) List only those lines on which the
                 system is waiting for someone to login. The &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;
                 field shall be <b>LOGIN </b>in such cases. Other fields shall
                 be the same as for user entries except that the &lt;<i>state</i>&gt;
                 field does not exist.

       <b>-m        </b>Output only information about the current terminal.

       <b>-p        </b>List any other process that is currently active and has
                 been previously spawned by <i>init</i>.

       <b>-q        </b>(Quick.) List only the names and the number of users
                 currently logged on. When this option is used, all
                 other options shall be ignored.

       <b>-r        </b>Write the current <i>run-level</i> of the <i>init</i> process.

       <b>-s        </b>List only the &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>line</i>&gt;, and &lt;<i>time</i>&gt; fields.  This
                 is the default case.

       <b>-t        </b>Indicate the last change to the system clock.

       <b>-T        </b>Show the state of each terminal, as described in the
                 STDOUT section.

       <b>-u        </b>Write ``idle time'' for each displayed user in addition
                 to any other information. The idle time is the time
                 since any activity occurred on the user's terminal. The
                 method of determining this is unspecified.  This option
                 shall list only those users who are currently logged
                 in.  The &lt;<i>name</i>&gt; is the user's login name. The &lt;<i>line</i>&gt; is
                 the name of the line as found in the directory <b>/dev</b>.
                 The &lt;<i>time</i>&gt; is the time that the user logged in. The
                 &lt;<i>activity</i>&gt; is the number of hours and minutes since
                 activity last occurred on that particular line. A dot
                 indicates that the terminal has seen activity in the
                 last minute and is therefore ``current''. If more than
                 twenty-four hours have elapsed or the line has not been
                 used since boot time, the entry shall be marked &lt;<i>old</i>&gt;.
                 This field is useful when trying to determine whether a
                 person is working at the terminal or not. The &lt;<i>pid</i>&gt; is
                 the process ID of the user's login process.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <b>am i</b>, <b>am I</b>
                 In the POSIX locale, limit the output to describing the
                 invoking user, equivalent to the <b>-m </b>option. The <b>am </b>and
                 <b>i </b>or <b>I </b>must be separate arguments.

       <i>file</i>      Specify a pathname of a file to substitute for the
                 implementation-defined database of logged-on users that
                 <i>who</i> uses by default.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>who</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Determine the locale used for the format and contents
                 of the date and time strings.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone used when writing date and time
                 information. If <i>TZ</i> is unset or null, an unspecified
                 default timezone shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>who</i> utility shall write its default format to the standard
       output in an implementation-defined format, subject only to the
       requirement of containing the information described above.

       XSI-conformant systems shall write the default information to the
       standard output in the following general format:

           &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;<b>[</b>&lt;<i>state</i>&gt;<b>]</b>&lt;<i>line</i>&gt;&lt;<i>time</i>&gt;<b>[</b>&lt;<i>activity</i>&gt;<b>][</b>&lt;<i>pid</i>&gt;<b>][</b>&lt;<i>comment</i>&gt;<b>][</b>&lt;<i>exit</i>&gt;<b>]</b>

       For the <b>-b </b>option, &lt;<i>line</i>&gt; shall be <b>"system</b>boot"<b>.  </b>The &lt;<i>name</i>&gt; is
       unspecified.

       The following format shall be used for the <b>-T </b>option:

           "%s %c %s %s\n" &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>terminal state</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>terminal name</i>&gt;,
               &lt;<i>time of login</i>&gt;

       where &lt;<i>terminal state</i>&gt; is one of the following characters:

       +       The terminal allows write access to other users.

       -       The terminal denies write access to other users.

       ?       The terminal write-access state cannot be determined.

       &lt;space&gt; This entry is not associated with a terminal.

       In the POSIX locale, the &lt;<i>time of login</i>&gt; shall be equivalent in
       format to the output of:

           date +"%b %e %H:%M"

       If the <b>-u </b>option is used with <b>-T</b>, the idle time shall be added to
       the end of the previous format in an unspecified format.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The name <i>init</i> used for the system process is the most commonly
       used on historical systems, but it may vary.

       The ``domain of accessibility'' referred to is a broad concept
       that permits interpretation either on a very secure basis or even
       to allow a network-wide implementation like the historical <i>rwho</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Due to differences between historical implementations, the base
       options provided were a compromise to allow users to work with
       those functions. The standard developers also considered removing
       all the options, but felt that these options offered users
       valuable functionality. Additional options to match historical
       systems are available on XSI-conformant systems.

       It is recognized that the <i>who</i> command may be of limited
       usefulness, especially in a multi-level secure environment. The
       standard developers considered, however, that having some
       standard method of determining the ``accessibility'' of other
       users would aid user portability.

       No format was specified for the default <i>who</i> output for systems
       not supporting the XSI option. In such a user-oriented command,
       designed only for human use, this was not considered to be a
       deficiency.

       The format of the terminal name is unspecified, but the
       descriptions of <i>ps</i>, <i>talk</i>, and <i>write</i> require that they use the
       same format.

       It is acceptable for an implementation to produce no output for
       an invocation of <i>who</i> <b>mil</b>.
