</pre> <h2>
Description </h2>
<pre>
       <i>pdfroff</i> is a wrapper program for the GNU text processing system,
       <i>groff</i>.  It transparently handles the mechanics of multiple pass
       <i>groff</i> processing, when applied to suitably marked up <i>groff</i> source
       files, such that tables of contents and body text are formatted
       separately, and are subsequently combined in the correct order,
       for final publication as a single PDF document.  A further
       optional “style sheet” capability is provided; this allows for
       the definition of content which is required to precede the table
       of contents, in the published document.

       For each invocation of <i>pdfroff</i>, the ultimate <i>groff</i> output stream
       is post-processed by the Ghostscript <i>gs</i>(1) interpreter to produce
       a finished PDF document.

       <i>pdfroff</i> makes no assumptions about, and imposes no restrictions
       on, the use of any <i>groff</i> macro packages which the user may choose
       to employ, in order to achieve a desired document format;
       however, it <i>does</i> include specific built in support for the
       <i>pdfmark</i> macro package, should the user choose to employ it.
       Specifically, if the <i>pdfhref</i> macro, defined in the <i>pdfmark.tmac</i>
       package, is used to define public reference marks, or dynamic
       links to such reference marks, then <i>pdfroff</i> performs as many
       preformatting <i>groff</i> passes as required, up to a maximum limit of
       <i>four</i>, in order to compile a document reference dictionary, to
       resolve references, and to expand the dynamically defined content
       of links.
</pre> <h2>
Usage </h2>
<pre>
       The command line is parsed in accordance with normal GNU
       conventions, but with one exception—when specifying any short
       form option (i.e., a single character option introduced by a
       single hyphen), and if that option expects an argument, then it
       <i>must</i> be specified independently (i.e., it may <i>not</i> be appended to
       any group of other single character short form options).

       Long form option names (i.e., those introduced by a double
       hyphen) may be abbreviated to their minimum length unambiguous
       initial substring.

       Otherwise, <i>pdfroff</i> usage closely mirrors that of <i>groff</i> itself.
       Indeed, with the exception of the <b>-h</b>, <b>-v</b>, and <b>-T </b><i>dev</i> short form
       options, and all long form options, which are parsed internally
       by <i>pdfroff</i>, all options and file name arguments specified on the
       command line are passed on to <i>groff</i>, to control the formatting of
       the PDF document.  Consequently, <i>pdfroff</i> accepts all options and
       arguments, as specified in <i>groff</i>(1), which may also be considered
       as the definitive reference for all standard <i>pdfroff</i> options and
       argument usage.
</pre> <h2>
Options </h2>
<pre>
       <i>pdfroff</i> accepts all of the short form options (i.e., those
       introduced by a single hyphen), which are available with <i>groff</i>
       itself.  In most cases, these are simply passed transparently to
       <i>groff</i>; the following, however, are handled specially by <i>pdfroff</i>.

       <b>-h     </b>Same as <b>--help</b>; see below.

       <b>-i     </b>Process standard input, after all other specified input
              files.  This is passed transparently to <i>groff</i>, but, if
              grouped with other options, it <i>must</i> be the first in the
              group.  Hiding it within a group breaks standard input
              processing, in the multiple-pass <i>groff</i> processing context
              of <i>pdfroff</i>.

       <b>-T </b><i>dev</i> Only <b>-T ps </b>is supported by <i>pdfroff</i>.  Attempting to specify
              any other device causes <i>pdfroff</i> to abort.

       <b>-v     </b>Same as <b>--version</b>; see below.

       See <i>groff</i>(1) for a description of all other short form options,
       which are transparently passed through <i>pdfroff</i> to <i>groff</i>.

       All long form options (i.e., those introduced by a double hyphen)
       are interpreted locally by <i>pdfroff</i>; they are <i>not</i> passed on to
       <i>groff</i>, unless otherwise stated below.

       <b>--help </b>Causes <i>pdfroff</i> to display a summary of the its usage
              syntax, and supported options, and then exit.

       <b>--emit-ps</b>
              Suppresses the final output conversion step, causing
              <i>pdfroff</i> to emit PostScript output instead of PDF.  This
              may be useful to capture intermediate PostScript output
              when using a specialised postprocessor, such as <i>gpresent</i>
              for example, in place of the default Ghostscript PDF
              writer.

       <b>--keep-temporary-files</b>
              Suppresses the deletion of temporary files, which normally
              occurs after <i>pdfroff</i> has completed PDF document
              formatting; this may be useful when debugging formatting
              problems.

              See section “Files” below for a description of the
              temporary files used by <i>pdfroff</i>.

       <b>--no-pdf-output</b>
              May be used with the <b>--reference-dictionary=</b><i>name</i> option
              (described below) to eliminate the overhead of PDF
              formatting when running <i>pdfroff</i> to create a reference
              dictionary for use in a different document.

       <b>--no-reference-dictionary</b>
              May be used to eliminate the overhead of creating a
              reference dictionary, when it is known that the target PDF
              document contains no public references, created by the
              <b>pdfhref </b>macro.

       <b>--no-toc-relocation</b>
              May be used to eliminate the extra <i>groff</i> processing pass,
              which is required to generate a table of contents, and
              relocate it to the start of the PDF document, when
              processing any document which lacks an automatically
              generated table of contents.

       <b>--no-kill-null-pages</b>
              While preparing for simulation of the manual collation
              step, which is traditionally required to relocate a <i>table</i>
              <i>of contents</i> to the start of a document, <i>pdfroff</i>
              accumulates a number of empty page descriptions into the
              intermediate PostScript output stream.  During the final
              collation step, these empty pages are normally discarded
              from the finished document; this option forces <i>pdfroff</i> to
              leave them in place.

       <b>--pdf-output=</b><i>name</i>
              Specifies the name to be used for the resultant PDF
              document; if unspecified, the PDF output is written to
              standard output.  A future version of <i>pdfroff</i> may use this
              option, to encode the document name in a generated
              reference dictionary.

       <b>--reference-dictionary=</b><i>name</i>
              Specifies the name to be used for the generated reference
              dictionary file; if unspecified, the reference dictionary
              is created in a temporary file, which is deleted when
              <i>pdfroff</i> completes processing of the current document.
              This option <i>must</i> be specified, if it is desired to save
              the reference dictionary, for use in references placed in
              other PDF documents.

       <b>--report-progress</b>
              Causes <i>pdfroff</i> to display an informational message on
              standard error, at the start of each <i>groff</i> processing
              pass.

       <b>--stylesheet=</b><i>name</i>
              Specifies the name of an <i>input file</i>, to be used as a style
              sheet for formatting of content, which is to be placed
              <i>before</i> the table of contents, in the formatted PDF
              document.

       <b>--version</b>
              Causes <i>pdfroff</i> to display a version identification
              message.  The entire command line is then passed
              transparently to <i>groff</i>, in a <i>one</i> pass operation <i>only</i>, in
              order to display the associated <i>groff</i> version information,
              before exiting.
</pre> <h2>
Environment </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables may be set, and exported, to
       modify the behaviour of <i>pdfroff</i>.

       <i>PDFROFF_COLLATE</i>
              Specifies the program to be used for collation of the
              finished PDF document.

              This collation step may be required to move <i>tables of</i>
              <i>contents</i> to the start of the finished PDF document, when
              formatting with traditional macro packages, which print
              them at the end.  However, users should not normally need
              to specify <i>PDFROFF_COLLATE</i>, (and indeed, are not
              encouraged to do so).  If unspecified, <i>pdfroff</i> uses <i>sed</i>(1)
              by default, which normally suffices.

              If <i>PDFROFF_COLLATE is</i> specified, then it must act as a
              filter, accepting a list of file name arguments, and write
              its output to the standard output stream, whence it is
              piped to the <i>PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND</i>, to produce the
              finished PDF output.

              When specifying <i>PDFROFF_COLLATE</i>, it is normally necessary
              to also specify <i>PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES</i>.

              <i>PDFROFF_COLLATE</i> is ignored, if <i>pdfroff</i> is invoked with the
              <b>--no-kill-null-pages </b>option.

       <i>PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES</i>
              Specifies options to be passed to the <i>PDFROFF_COLLATE</i>
              program.

              It should not normally be necessary to specify
              <i>PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES</i>.  The internal default is a <i>sed</i>(1)
              script, which is intended to remove completely blank pages
              from the collated output stream, and which should be
              appropriate in most applications of <i>pdfroff</i>.  However, if
              any alternative to <i>sed</i>(1) is specified for
              <i>PDFROFF_COLLATE</i>, then it is likely that a corresponding
              alternative specification for <i>PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES</i> is
              required.

              As in the case of <i>PDFROFF_COLLATE</i>, <i>PDFROFF_KILL_NULL_PAGES</i>
              is ignored, if <i>pdfroff</i> is invoked with the
              <b>--no-kill-null-pages </b>option.

       <i>PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND</i>
              Specifies the command to be used for the final document
              conversion from PostScript intermediate output to PDF.  It
              must behave as a filter, writing its output to the
              standard output stream, and must accept an arbitrary
              number of <i>files ...</i> arguments, with the special case of
              “<b>-</b>” representing the standard input stream.

              If unspecified, <i>PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND</i> defaults to
                   gs -dBATCH -dQUIET -dNOPAUSE -dSAFER -sDEVICE=pdfwrite \
                        -sOutputFile=-

       <i>GROFF_TMPDIR</i>
              Identifies the directory in which <i>pdfroff</i> should create
              temporary files.  If <i>GROFF_TMPDIR</i> is <i>not</i> specified, then
              the variables <i>TMPDIR</i>, <i>TMP</i> and <i>TEMP</i> are considered in turn
              as possible temporary file repositories.  If none of these
              are set, then temporary files are created in the current
              directory.

       <i>GROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER</i>
              Specifies the program to be invoked when <i>pdfroff</i> converts
              <i>groff</i> PostScript output to PDF.  If
              <i>PDFROFF_POSTPROCESSOR_COMMAND</i> is specified, then the
              command name it specifies is <i>implicitly</i> assigned to
              <i>GROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER</i>, overriding any explicit
              setting specified in the environment.  If
              <i>GROFF_GHOSTSCRIPT_INTERPRETER</i> is not specified, then
              <i>pdfroff</i> searches the process <i>PATH</i>, looking for a program
              with any of the well known names for the Ghostscript
              interpreter; if no Ghostscript interpreter can be found,
              <i>pdfroff</i> aborts.

       <i>GROFF_AWK_INTERPRETER</i>
              Specifies the program to be invoked when <i>pdfroff</i> is
              extracting reference dictionary entries from a <i>groff</i>
              intermediate message stream.  If <i>GROFF_AWK_INTERPRETER</i> is
              not specified, then <i>pdfroff</i> searches the process <i>PATH</i>,
              looking for any of the preferred programs, <i>gawk</i>, <i>mawk</i>,
              <i>nawk</i>, and <i>awk</i>, in that order; if none of these are found,
              <i>pdfroff</i> issues a warning message, and continue processing;
              however, in this case, no reference dictionary is created.

       <i>OSTYPE</i> Typically defined automatically by the operating system,
              <i>OSTYPE</i> is used on Microsoft Win32/MS-DOS platforms <i>only</i>,
              to infer the default <i>PATH_SEPARATOR</i> character, which is
              used when parsing the process <i>PATH</i> to search for external
              helper programs.

       <i>PATH_SEPARATOR</i>
              If set, <i>PATH_SEPARATOR</i> overrides the default separator
              character, (‘:’ on POSIX/Unix systems, inferred from
              <i>OSTYPE</i> on Microsoft Win32/MS-DOS), which is used when
              parsing the process <i>PATH</i> to search for external helper
              programs.

       <i>SHOW_PROGRESS</i>
              If this is set to a non-empty value, then <i>pdfroff</i> always
              behaves as if the <b>--report-progress </b>option is specified on
              the command line.
</pre> <h2>
Files </h2>
<pre>
       Input and output files for <i>pdfroff</i> may be named according to any
       convention of the user's choice.  Typically, input files may be
       named according to the choice of the principal normatting macro
       package, e.g., file<i>.ms</i> might be an input file for formatting
       using the <i>ms</i> macros (<i>s.tmac</i>); normally, the final output file
       should be named file<i>.pdf</i>.

       Temporary files created by <i>pdfroff</i> are placed in the file system
       hierarchy, in or below the directory specified by environment
       variables (see section “Environment” above).  If <i>mktemp</i>(1) is
       available, it is invoked to create a private subdirectory of the
       nominated temporary files directory, (with subdirectory name
       derived from the template <i>pdfroff-XXXXXXXXXX</i>); if this
       subdirectory is successfully created, the temporary files will be
       placed within it, otherwise they will be placed directly in the
       directory nominated in the environment.

       All temporary files themselves are named according to the
       convention <i>pdf</i>$$<i>.</i>*, where <i>$$</i> is the standard shell variable
       representing the process identifier of the <i>pdfroff</i> process
       itself, and <i>*</i> represents any of the extensions used by <i>pdfroff</i> to
       identify the following temporary and intermediate files.

       <i>pdf</i>$$<i>.tmp</i>
              A scratch pad file, used to capture reference data emitted
              by <i>groff</i>, during the <i>reference dictionary</i> compilation
              phase.

       <i>pdf</i>$$<i>.ref</i>
              The <i>reference dictionary</i>, as compiled in the last but one
              pass of the <i>reference dictionary</i> compilation phase; (at
              the start of the first pass, this file is created empty;
              in successive passes, it contains the <i>reference dictionary</i>
              entries, as collected in the preceding pass).

              If the <b>--reference-dictionary</b>=<i>name</i> option is specified,
              this intermediate file becomes permanent, and is named
              <i>name</i>, rather than <i>pdf</i>$$<i>.ref</i>.

       <i>pdf</i>$$<i>.cmp</i>
              Used to collect <i>reference dictionary</i> entries during the
              active pass of the <i>reference dictionary</i> compilation phase.
              At the end of any pass, when the content of <i>pdf</i>$$<i>.cmp</i>
              compares as identical to <i>pdf</i>$$<i>.ref</i>, (or the corresponding
              file named by the <b>--reference-dictionary</b>=<i>name</i> option),
              then <i>reference dictionary</i> compilation is terminated, and
              the <i>document reference map</i> is appended to this
              intermediate file, for inclusion in the final formatting
              passes.

       <i>pdf</i>$$<i>.tc</i>
              An intermediate <i>PostScript</i> file, in which “Table of
              Contents” entries are collected, to facilitate relocation
              before the body text, on ultimate output to the
              <i>Ghostscript</i> postprocessor.

       <i>pdf</i>$$<i>.ps</i>
              An intermediate <i>PostScript</i> file, in which the body text is
              collected prior to ultimate output to the <i>Ghostscript</i>
              postprocessor, in the proper sequence, <i>after pdf</i>$$<i>.tc</i>.
