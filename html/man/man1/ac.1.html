DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ac  </b>prints  out  a report of connect time (in hours) based on the
       logins/logouts in the current <i>wtmp</i> file.  A total is also printed
       out.

       The accounting file <i>wtmp</i> is maintained by <b>init</b>(8)  and  <a href="login.1.html">login(1)</a>.
       Neither <b>ac </b>nor <b>login </b>creates the <i>wtmp</i> if it doesn't exist, no ac‐
       counting  is  done.   To begin accounting, create the file with a
       length of zero.

       NOTE:  The <i>wtmp</i> file can get really big, really fast.  You  might
       want to trim it every once and a while.

       GNU  <b>ac  </b>works  nearly  the  same  UNIX  <b>ac</b>, though it's a little
       smarter in several ways.  You should therefore expect differences
       in the output of GNU <b>ac </b>and the output of <b>ac</b>'s on other  systems.
       Use the command <b>info </b><i>accounting</i> to get additional information.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d, --daily-totals</b>
              Print totals for each day rather than just one big total
              at the end.  The output looks like this:
                      Jul  3  total     1.17
                      Jul  4  total     2.10
                      Jul  5  total     8.23
                      Jul  6  total     2.10
                      Jul  7  total     0.30
       <b>-p, --individual-totals</b>
              Print time totals for each user in addition to the usual
              everything-lumped-into-one value.  It looks like:
                      bob       8.06
                      goff      0.60
                      maley     7.37
                      root      0.12
                      total    16.15
       <i>people</i> Print out the sum total of the connect time used by all of
              the users included in <i>people.</i>  Note that <i>people</i> is a space
              separated list of valid user names; wildcards are not al‐
              lowed.
       <b>-f, --file </b><i>filename</i>
              Read from the file <i>filename</i> instead of the system's <i>wtmp</i>
              file.
       <b>--complain</b>
              When the <i>wtmp</i> file has a problem (a time-warp, missing
              record, or whatever), print out an appropriate error.
       <b>--reboots</b>
              Reboot records are NOT written at the time of a reboot,
              but when the system restarts; therefore, it is impossible
              to know exactly when the reboot occurred.  Users may have
              been logged into the system at the time of the reboot, and
              many <b>ac's </b>automatically count the time between the login
              and the reboot record against the user (even though all of
              that time shouldn't be, perhaps, if the system is down for
              a long time, for instance).  If you want to count this
              time, include the flag.  *For vanilla <b>ac </b>compatibility,
              include this flag.*
       <b>--supplants</b>
              Sometimes, a logout record is not written for a specific
              terminal, so the time that the last user accrued cannot be
              calculated.  If you want to include the time from the
              user's login to the next login on the terminal (though
              probably incorrect), include this you want to include the
              time from the user's login to the next login on the termi‐
              nal (though probably incorrect), include this flag.  *For
              vanilla <b>ac </b>compatibility, include this flag.*
       <b>--timewarps</b>
              Sometimes, entries in a <i>wtmp</i> file will suddenly jump back
              into the past without a clock change record occurring.  It
              is impossible to know how long a user was logged in when
              this occurs.  If you want to count the time between the
              login and the time warp against the user, include this
              flag.  *For vanilla <b>ac </b>compatibility, include this flag.*
       <b>--compatibility</b>
              This is shorthand for typing out the three above options.
       <b>-a, --all-days</b>
              If we're printing daily totals, print a record for every
              day instead of skipping intervening days where there is no
              login activity.  Without this flag, time accrued during
              those intervening days gets listed under the next day
              where there is login activity.
       <b>--tw-leniency </b><i>num</i>
              Set the time warp leniency to <i>num</i> seconds.  Records in
              <i>wtmp</i> files might be slightly out of order (most notably
              when two logins occur within a one-second period - the
              second one gets written first).  By default, this value is
              set to 60.  If the program notices this problem, time is
              not assigned to users unless the <b>--timewarps </b>flag is used.
       <b>--tw-suspicious </b><i>num</i>
              Set the time warp suspicious value to <i>num</i> seconds.  If two
              records in the <i>wtmp</i> file are farther than this number of
              seconds apart, there is a problem with the <i>wtmp</i> file (or
              your machine hasn't been used in a year).  If the program
              notices this problem, time is not assigned to users unless
              the <b>--timewarps </b>flag is used.
       <b>-y, --print-year</b>
              Print year when displaying dates.
       <b>-z, --print-zeros</b>
              If a total for any category (save the grand total) is ze‐
              ro, print it.  The default is to suppress printing.
       <b>--debug</b>
              Print verbose internal information.
       <b>-V, --version</b>
              Print the version number of <b>ac </b>to standard output and
              quit.
       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Prints the usage string and default locations of system
              files to standard output and exits.
