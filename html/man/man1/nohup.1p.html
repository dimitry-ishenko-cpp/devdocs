PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       nohup — invoke a utility immune to hangups
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       nohup <i>utility</i> <b>[</b><i>argument</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>nohup</i> utility shall invoke the utility named by the <i>utility</i>
       operand with arguments supplied as the <i>argument</i> operands. At the
       time the named <i>utility</i> is invoked, the SIGHUP signal shall be set
       to be ignored.

       If standard input is associated with a terminal, the <i>nohup</i>
       utility may redirect standard input from an unspecified file.

       If the standard output is a terminal, all output written by the
       named <i>utility</i> to its standard output shall be appended to the end
       of the file <b>nohup.out </b>in the current directory. If <b>nohup.out</b>
       cannot be created or opened for appending, the output shall be
       appended to the end of the file <b>nohup.out </b>in the directory
       specified by the <i>HOME</i> environment variable. If neither file can
       be created or opened for appending, <i>utility</i> shall not be invoked.
       If a file is created, the file's permission bits shall be set to
       S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR.

       If standard error is a terminal and standard output is open but
       is not a terminal, all output written by the named utility to its
       standard error shall be redirected to the same open file
       description as the standard output. If standard error is a
       terminal and standard output either is a terminal or is closed,
       the same output shall instead be appended to the end of the
       <b>nohup.out </b>file as described above.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>utility</i>   The name of a utility that is to be invoked. If the
                 <i>utility</i> operand names any of the special built-in
                 utilities in <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>Special Built-In Utilities</i>,
                 the results are undefined.

       <i>argument</i>  Any string to be supplied as an argument when invoking
                 the utility named by the <i>utility</i> operand.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>nohup</i>:

       <i>HOME</i>      Determine the pathname of the user's home directory: if
                 the output file <b>nohup.out </b>cannot be created in the
                 current directory, the <i>nohup</i> utility shall use the
                 directory named by <i>HOME</i> to create the file.

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>PATH</i>      Determine the search path that is used to locate the
                 utility to be invoked. See the Base Definitions volume
                 of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 8</i>, <i>Environment Variables</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>nohup</i> utility shall take the standard action for all signals
       except that SIGHUP shall be ignored.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If the standard output is not a terminal, the standard output of
       <i>nohup</i> shall be the standard output generated by the execution of
       the <i>utility</i> specified by the operands. Otherwise, nothing shall
       be written to the standard output.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       If the standard output is a terminal, a message shall be written
       to the standard error, indicating the name of the file to which
       the output is being appended. The name of the file shall be
       either <b>nohup.out </b>or <b>$HOME/nohup.out</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Output written by the named utility is appended to the file
       <b>nohup.out </b>(or <b>$HOME/nohup.out</b>), if the conditions hold as
       described in the DESCRIPTION.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

       126     The utility specified by <i>utility</i> was found but could not
               be invoked.

       127     An error occurred in the <i>nohup</i> utility or the utility
               specified by <i>utility</i> could not be found.

       Otherwise, the exit status of <i>nohup</i> shall be that of the utility
       specified by the <i>utility</i> operand.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>command</i>, <i>env</i>, <i>nice</i>, <i>nohup</i>, <i>time</i>, and <i>xargs</i> utilities have
       been specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs so that
       applications can distinguish ``failure to find a utility'' from
       ``invoked utility exited with an error indication''. The value
       127 was chosen because it is not commonly used for other
       meanings; most utilities use small values for ``normal error
       conditions'' and the values above 128 can be confused with
       termination due to receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen
       in a similar manner to indicate that the utility could be found,
       but not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages
       differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between
       exit codes 126 and 127 is based on KornShell practice that uses
       127 when all attempts to <i>exec</i> the utility fail with <b>[ENOENT]</b>, and
       uses 126 when any attempt to <i>exec</i> the utility fails for any other
       reason.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       It is frequently desirable to apply <i>nohup</i> to pipelines or lists
       of commands. This can be done by placing pipelines and command
       lists in a single file; this file can then be invoked as a
       utility, and the <i>nohup</i> applies to everything in the file.

       Alternatively, the following command can be used to apply <i>nohup</i>
       to a complex command:

           nohup sh -c '<i>complex-command-line</i>' &lt;/dev/null
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The 4.3 BSD version ignores SIGTERM and SIGHUP, and if
       <b>./nohup.out </b>cannot be used, it fails instead of trying to use
       <b>$HOME/nohup.out</b>.

       The <i>csh</i> utility has a built-in version of <i>nohup</i> that acts
       differently from the <i>nohup</i> defined in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017.

       The term <i>utility</i> is used, rather than <i>command</i>, to highlight the
       fact that shell compound commands, pipelines, special built-ins,
       and so on, cannot be used directly.  However, <i>utility</i> includes
       user application programs and shell scripts, not just the
       standard utilities.

       Historical versions of the <i>nohup</i> utility use default file
       creation semantics. Some more recent versions use the permissions
       specified here as an added security precaution.

       Some historical implementations ignore SIGQUIT in addition to
       SIGHUP; others ignore SIGTERM. An early proposal allowed, but did
       not require, SIGQUIT to be ignored. Several reviewers objected
       that <i>nohup</i> should only modify the handling of SIGHUP as required
       by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.

       Historical versions of <i>nohup</i> did not affect standard input, but
       that causes problems in the common scenario where the user logs
       into a system, types the command:

           nohup make &amp;

       at the prompt, and then logs out. If standard input is not
       affected by <i>nohup</i>, the login session may not terminate for quite
       some time, since standard input remains open until <i>make</i> exits. To
       avoid this problem, POSIX.1‐2008 allows implementations to
       redirect standard input if it is a terminal. Since the behavior
       is implementation-defined, portable applications that may run
       into the problem should redirect standard input themselves. For
       example, instead of:

           nohup make &amp;

       an application can invoke:

           nohup make &lt;/dev/null &amp;
