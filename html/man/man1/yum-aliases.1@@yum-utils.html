NAME </h2>
<pre>
       yum aliases plugin
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>yum </b>[options] alias
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This plugin changes other commands in <b>yum</b>, much like the alias
       command in bash. There are a couple of notable differences from
       shell style aliases though. The alias command has three forms:
        * alias
        * alias command
        * alias command result

       The first form lists all current aliases with their final result,
       the second form looks up a "command" and shows it's final result
       or an error message. The last form creates a new alias.
</pre> <h2>
Explanation of alias to final result conversion </h2>
<pre>
       When you type an aliased command, like "yum --disableexcludes UPT
       lsu" using the default aliases, the yum-aliases plugin first
       takes the first "command", by skipping over any options, and then
       looks up the result (in this case "UPT" is converted to
       "--enablerepo=updates-testing"). If there is a match, then it
       will replace the aliased "command" in the argument list and try
       again (again skipping over any options). By convention, in the
       default aliases list, alias "commands" that are in all CAPS only
       add options so you can join together a chain of them before any
       real command or aliased command.

       There are two things that can alter the above, if you have the
       "recursive" configuration option set to off then alias processing
       will stop after the first alias to command substitution. Also,
       like in shell aliases, if the result starts with \ then alias
       processing will stop.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To create a new alias command called "rm" which does the same
       thing as the command "remove" use:

              yum <b>alias </b>rm remove

       To always add the --skip-broken --disableexcludes=all --obsoletes
       options to the update command (but leaving the upgrade option
       alone), you could use:

              yum <b>alias </b>update \update  --skip-broken
              --disableexcludes=all --obsoletes

       To override the default "up" alias to use the above update
       command, and never ask for confirmation, you could use:

              yum <b>alias </b>up update -y
