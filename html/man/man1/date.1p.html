NAME </h2>
<pre>
       date — write the date and time
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       date <b>[</b>-u<b>] [</b>+<i>format</i><b>]</b>

       date <b>[</b>-u<b>] </b><i>mmddhhmm</i><b>[[</b><i>cc</i><b>]</b><i>yy</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>date</i> utility shall write the date and time to standard output
       or attempt to set the system date and time.  By default, the
       current date and time shall be written. If an operand beginning
       with <b>'+' </b>is specified, the output format of <i>date</i> shall be
       controlled by the conversion specifications and other text in the
       operand.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>date</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-u        </b>Perform operations as if the <i>TZ</i> environment variable
                 was set to the string <b>"UTC0"</b>, or its equivalent
                 historical value of <b>"GMT0"</b>.  Otherwise, <i>date</i> shall use
                 the timezone indicated by the <i>TZ</i> environment variable
                 or the system default if that variable is unset or
                 null.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       +<i>format</i>   When the format is specified, each conversion specifier
                 shall be replaced in the standard output by its
                 corresponding value. All other characters shall be
                 copied to the output without change. The output shall
                 always be terminated with a &lt;newline&gt;.

                         in the new year, then it shall be considered
                         week 1; otherwise, it shall be the last week of
                         the previous year, and the next week shall be

                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Determine the format and contents of date and time
                 strings written by <i>date</i>.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone in which the time and date are
                 written, unless the <b>-u </b>option is specified. If the <i>TZ</i>
                 variable is unset or null and <b>-u </b>is not specified, an

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Conversion specifiers are of unspecified format when not in the
       POSIX locale. Some of them can contain &lt;newline&gt; characters in
       some locales, so it may be difficult to use the format shown in
       standard output for parsing the output of <i>date</i> in those locales.

       The range of values for <b>%S </b>extends from 0 to 60 seconds to
       accommodate the occasional leap second.

       Although certain of the conversion specifiers in the POSIX locale
       (such as the name of the month) are shown with initial capital
       letters, this need not be the case in other locales. Programs
       using these fields may need to adjust the capitalization if the
       output is going to be used at the beginning of a sentence.

       The date string formatting capabilities are intended for use in
       Gregorian-style calendars, possibly with a different starting
       year (or years). The <b>%x </b>and <b>%c </b>conversion specifications,
       however, are intended for local representation; these may be
       based on a different, non-Gregorian calendar.

       The <b>%C </b>conversion specification was introduced to allow a
       fallback for the <b>%EC </b>(alternative year format base year); it can
       be viewed as the base of the current subdivision in the Gregorian
       calendar. The century number is calculated as the year divided by
       100 and truncated to an integer; it should not be confused with
       the use of ordinal numbers for centuries (for example, ``twenty-
       first century''.) Both the <b>%Ey </b>and <b>%y </b>can then be viewed as the
       offset from <b>%EC </b>and <b>%C</b>, respectively.

       The <b>E </b>and <b>O </b>modifiers modify the traditional conversion
       specifiers, so that they can always be used, even if the
       implementation (or the current locale) does not support the
       modifier.

       The <b>E </b>modifier supports alternative date formats, such as the
       Japanese Emperor's Era, as long as these are based on the
       Gregorian calendar system. Extending the <b>E </b>modifiers to other
       date elements may provide an implementation-defined extension
       capable of supporting other calendar systems, especially in
       combination with the <b>O </b>modifier.

       The <b>O </b>modifier supports time and date formats using the locale's
       alternative numerical symbols, such as Kanji or Hindi digits or
       ordinal number representation.

       Non-European locales, whether they use Latin digits in
       computational items or not, often have local forms of the digits
       for use in date formats. This is not totally unknown even in
       Europe; a variant of dates uses Roman numerals for the months:
       the third day of September 1991 would be written as 3.IX.1991. In
       Japan, Kanji digits are regularly used for dates; in Arabic-
       speaking countries, Hindi digits are used.  The <b>%d</b>, <b>%e</b>, <b>%H</b>, <b>%I</b>,
       <b>%m</b>, <b>%S</b>, <b>%U</b>, <b>%w</b>, <b>%W</b>, and <b>%y </b>conversion specifications always
       return the date and time field in Latin digits (that is, 0 to 9).
       The <b>%O </b>modifier was introduced to support the use for display
       purposes of non-Latin digits. In the <i>LC_TIME</i> category in
       <i>localedef</i>, the optional <b>alt_digits </b>keyword is intended for this
       purpose. As an example, assume the following (partial) <i>localedef</i>
       source:

           alt_digits  "";"I";"II";"III";"IV";"V";"VI";"VII";"VIII" \
                       "IX";"X";"XI";"XII"
           d_fmt       "%e.%Om.%Y"

       With the above date, the command:

           date "+%x"

       would yield 3.IX.1991. With the same <b>d_fmt</b>, but without the
       <b>alt_digits</b>, the command would yield 3.9.1991.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Some of the new options for formatting are from the ISO C
       standard. The <b>-u </b>option was introduced to allow portable access
       to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The string <b>"GMT0" </b>is
       allowed as an equivalent <i>TZ</i> value to be compatible with all of
       the systems using the BSD implementation, where this option
       originated.

       The <b>%e </b>format conversion specification (adopted from System V)
       was added because the ISO C standard conversion specifications
       did not provide any way to produce the historical default <i>date</i>
       output during the first nine days of any month.

       There are two varieties of day and week numbering supported (in
       addition to any others created with the locale-dependent <b>%E </b>and
       <b>%O </b>modifier characters):

        *  The historical variety in which Sunday is the first day of
           the week and the weekdays preceding the first Sunday of the
           year are considered week 0. These are represented by <b>%w </b>and
           <b>%U</b>.  A variant of this is <b>%W</b>, using Monday as the first day
           of the week, but still referring to week 0. This view of the
           calendar was retained because so many historical applications
           depend on it and the ISO C standard <i>strftime</i>() function, on
           which many <i>date</i> implementations are based, was defined in
           this way.

        *  The international standard, based on the ISO 8601:2004
           standard where Monday is the first weekday and the algorithm
           for the first week number is more complex: If the week
           (Monday to Sunday) containing January 1 has four or more days
           in the new year, then it is week 1; otherwise, it is week 53
           of the previous year, and the next week is week 1. These are
           represented by the new conversion specifications <b>%u </b>and <b>%V</b>,
           added as a result of international comments.
