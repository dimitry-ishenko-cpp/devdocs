PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       export — set the export attribute for variables
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       export name<b>[</b>=<i>word</i><b>]</b>...

       export -p
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The shell shall give the <i>export</i> attribute to the variables
       corresponding to the specified <i>name</i>s, which shall cause them to
       be in the environment of subsequently executed commands. If the
       name of a variable is followed by =<i>word</i>, then the value of that
       variable shall be set to <i>word</i>.

       The <i>export</i> special built-in shall support the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       When <b>-p </b>is specified, <i>export</i> shall write to the standard output
       the names and values of all exported variables, in the following
       format:

           "export %s=%s\n", &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>value</i>&gt;

       if <i>name</i> is set, and:

           "export %s\n", &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;

       if <i>name</i> is unset.

       The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of
       quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as
       commands that achieve the same exporting results, except:

        1. Read-only variables with values cannot be reset.

        2. Variables that were unset at the time they were output need
           not be reset to the unset state if a value is assigned to the
           variable between the time the state was saved and the time at
           which the saved output is reinput to the shell.

       When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.

INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       See the DESCRIPTION.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR S </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
        0    All <i>name</i> operands were successfully exported.

       &gt;0    At least one <i>name</i> could not be exported, or the <b>-p </b>option
             was specified and an error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Note that, unless <i>X</i> was previously marked readonly, the value of
       <b>"$?" </b>after:

           export X=$(false)

       will be 0 (because <i>export</i> successfully set <i>X</i> to the empty string)
       and that execution continues, even if <i>set</i> <b>-e </b>is in effect. In
       order to detect command substitution failures, a user must
       separate the assignment from the export, as in:

           X=$(false)
           export X
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Export <i>PWD</i> and <i>HOME</i> variables:

           export PWD HOME

       Set and export the <i>PATH</i> variable:

           export PATH=/local/bin:$PATH

       Save and restore all exported variables:

           export -p &gt; <i>temp-file</i>
           unset <i>a lot of variables</i>
           ... <i>processing</i>
           . <i>temp-file</i>
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Some historical shells use the no-argument case as the functional
       equivalent of what is required here with <b>-p</b>.  This feature was
       left unspecified because it is not historical practice in all
       shells, and some scripts may rely on the now-unspecified results
       on their implementations. Attempts to specify the <b>-p </b>output as
       the default case were unsuccessful in achieving consensus.  The
       <b>-p </b>option was added to allow portable access to the values that
       can be saved and then later restored using; for example, a <i>dot</i>
       script.
