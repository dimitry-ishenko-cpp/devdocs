<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pathchk — check pathnames
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       pathchk <b>[</b>-p<b>] [</b>-P<b>] </b><i>pathname</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pathchk</i> utility shall check that one or more pathnames are
       valid (that is, they could be used to access or create a file
       without causing syntax errors) and portable (that is, no filename
       truncation results). More extensive portability checks are
       provided by the <b>-p </b>and <b>-P </b>options.

       By default, the <i>pathchk</i> utility shall check each component of
       each <i>pathname</i> operand based on the underlying file system. A
       diagnostic shall be written for each <i>pathname</i> operand that:

        *  Is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (see <b>Pathname Variable Values</b>
           in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <a href="../man0/limits.h.0p.html">limits.h(0p)</a>)

        *  Contains any component longer than {NAME_MAX} bytes in its
           containing directory

        *  Contains any component in a directory that is not searchable

        *  Contains any byte sequence that is not valid in its
           containing directory

       The format of the diagnostic message is not specified, but shall
       indicate the error detected and the corresponding <i>pathname</i>
       operand.

       It shall not be considered an error if one or more components of
       a <i>pathname</i> operand do not exist as long as a file matching the
       pathname specified by the missing components could be created
       that does not violate any of the checks specified above.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pathchk</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-p        </b>Instead of performing checks based on the underlying
                 file system, write a diagnostic for each <i>pathname</i>
                 operand that:

                  *  Is longer than {_POSIX_PATH_MAX} bytes (see <b>Minimum</b>
                     <b>Values </b>in the Base Definitions volume of
                     POSIX.1‐2017, <a href="../man0/limits.h.0p.html">limits.h(0p)</a>)

                  *  Contains any component longer than
                     {_POSIX_NAME_MAX} bytes

                  *  Contains any character in any component that is not
                     in the portable filename character set

       <b>-P        </b>Write a diagnostic for each <i>pathname</i> operand that:

                  *  Contains a component whose first character is the
                     &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character

                  *  Is empty
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>pathname</i>  A pathname to be checked.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>pathchk</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All <i>pathname</i> operands passed all of the checks.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>test</i> utility can be used to determine whether a given
       pathname names an existing file; it does not, however, give any
       indication of whether or not any component of the pathname was
       truncated in a directory where the _POSIX_NO_TRUNC feature is not
       in effect. The <i>pathchk</i> utility does not check for file existence;
       it performs checks to determine whether a pathname does exist or
       could be created with no pathname component truncation.

       The <i>noclobber</i> option in the shell (see the <a href="set.1p.html">set(1p)</a> special built-
       in) can be used to atomically create a file. As with all file
       creation semantics in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, it guarantees atomic creation, but still depends on
       applications to agree on conventions and cooperate on the use of
       files after they have been created.

       To verify that a pathname meets the requirements of filename
       portability, applications should use both the <b>-p </b>and <b>-P </b>options
       together.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To verify that all pathnames in an imported data interchange
       archive are legitimate and unambiguous on the current system:

           # This example assumes that no pathnames in the archive
           # contain &lt;newline&gt; characters.
           pax -f archive | sed -e 's/[^[:alnum:]]/\\&amp;/g' | xargs pathchk --
           if [ $? -eq 0 ]
           then
               pax -r -f archive
           else
               echo Investigate problems before importing files.
               exit 1
           fi

       To verify that all files in the current directory hierarchy could
       be moved to any system conforming to the System Interfaces volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 that also supports the <i>pax</i> utility:

           find . -exec pathchk -p -P {} +
           if [ $? -eq 0 ]
           then
               pax -w -f ../archive .
           else
               echo Portable archive cannot be created.
               exit 1
           fi

       To verify that a user-supplied pathname names a readable file and
       that the application can create a file extending the given path
       without truncation and without overwriting any existing file:

           case $- in
               *C*)    reset="";;
               *)      reset="set +C"
                       set -C;;
           esac
           test -r "$path" &amp;&amp; pathchk "$path.out" &amp;&amp;
               rm "$path.out" &gt; "$path.out"
           if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
               printf "%s: %s not found or %s.out fails \
           creation checks.\n" $0 "$path$path"
               $reset    # Reset the noclobber option in case a trap
                         # on EXIT depends on it.
               exit 1
           fi
           $reset
           PROCESSING &lt; "$path" &gt; "$path.out"

       The following assumptions are made in this example:

        1. <b>PROCESSING </b>represents the code that is used by the
           application to use <b>$path </b>once it is verified that <b>$path.out</b>
           works as intended.

        2. The state of the <i>noclobber</i> option is unknown when this code
           is invoked and should be set on exit to the state it was in
           when this code was invoked. (The <b>reset </b>variable is used in
           this example to restore the initial state.)

        3. Note the usage of:

               rm "$path.out" &gt; "$path.out"

            a. The <i>pathchk</i> command has already verified, at this point,
               that <b>$path.out </b>is not truncated.

            b. With the <i>noclobber</i> option set, the shell verifies that
               <b>$path.out </b>does not already exist before invoking <i>rm</i>.

            c. If the shell succeeded in creating <b>$path.out</b>, <i>rm</i> removes
               it so that the application can create the file again in
               the <b>PROCESSING </b>step.

            d. If the <b>PROCESSING </b>step wants the file to exist already
               when it is invoked, the:

                   rm "$path.out" &gt; "$path.out"

               should be replaced with:

                   &gt; "$path.out"

               which verifies that the file did not already exist, but
               leaves <b>$path.out </b>in place for use by <b>PROCESSING</b>.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pathchk</i> utility was new for the ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard.
       It, along with the <i>set</i> <b>-C</b>(<i>noclobber</i>) option added to the shell,
       replaces the <i>mktemp</i>, <i>validfnam</i>, and <i>create</i> utilities that
       appeared in early proposals. All of these utilities were attempts
       to solve several common problems:

        *  Verify the validity (for several different definitions of
           ``valid'') of a pathname supplied by a user, generated by an
           application, or imported from an external source.

        *  Atomically create a file.

        *  Perform various string handling functions to generate a
           temporary filename.

       The <i>create</i> utility, included in an early proposal, provided
       checking and atomic creation in a single invocation of the
       utility; these are orthogonal issues and need not be grouped into
       a single utility. Note that the <i>noclobber</i> option also provides a
       way of creating a lock for process synchronization; since it
       provides an atomic <i>create</i>, there is no race between a test for
       existence and the following creation if it did not exist.

       Having a function like <i>tmpnam</i>() in the ISO C standard is
       important in many high-level languages. The shell programming
       language, however, has built-in string manipulation facilities,
       making it very easy to construct temporary filenames. The names
       needed obviously depend on the application, but are frequently of
       a form similar to:

           <b>$TMPDIR/</b><i>application_abbreviation</i><b>$$.</b><i>suffix</i>

       In cases where there is likely to be contention for a given
       suffix, a simple shell <b>for </b>or <b>while </b>loop can be used with the
       shell <i>noclobber</i> option to create a file without risk of
       collisions, as long as applications trying to use the same
       filename name space are cooperating on the use of files after
       they have been created.

       For historical purposes, <b>-p </b>does not check for the use of the
       &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character as the first character in a component of
       the pathname, or for an empty <i>pathname</i> operand.
