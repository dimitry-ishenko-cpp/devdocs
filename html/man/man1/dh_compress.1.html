</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_compress - compress files and fix symlinks in package build
       directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_compress </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [<b>-A</b>] [<i>file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_compress </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       compressing the files in package build directories, and makes
       sure that any symlinks that pointed to the files before they were
       compressed are updated to point to the new files.

       By default, <b>dh_compress </b>compresses files that Debian policy
       mandates should be compressed, namely all files in
       <i>usr/share/info</i>, <i>usr/share/man</i>, files in <i>usr/share/doc</i> that are
       larger than 4k in size, (except the <i>copyright</i> file, <i>.html</i> and
       other web files, image files, and files that appear to be already
       compressed based on their extensions), and all <i>changelog</i> files.
       Plus PCF fonts underneath <i>usr/share/fonts/X11/</i>
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       debian/<i>package</i>.compress
           These files are deprecated.

           If this file exists, the default files are not compressed.
           Instead, the file is ran as a shell script, and all filenames
           that the shell script outputs will be compressed. The shell
           script will be run from inside the package build directory.
           Note though that using <b>-X </b>is a much better idea in general;
           you should only use a <i>debian/package.compress</i> file if you
           really need to.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-X</b><i>item</i>, <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude files that contain <i>item</i> anywhere in their filename
           from being compressed. For example, <b>-X.tiff </b>will exclude TIFF
           files from compression.  You may use this option multiple
           times to build up a list of things to exclude.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all</b>
           Compress all files specified by command line parameters in
           ALL packages acted on.

       <i>file</i> ...
           Add these files to the list of files to compress.
