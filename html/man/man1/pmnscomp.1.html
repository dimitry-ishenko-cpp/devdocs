</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmnscomp </b>- compile an ASCII performance metrics namespace into
       binary format.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmnscomp </b>[<b>-d</b>] [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-n </b><i>namespace</i>] [<b>-v </b><i>version</i>] <i>outfile</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmnscomp </b>compiles a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) in
       ASCII format into a more efficient binary representation.
       <a href="../man3/pmloadnamespace.3.html">pmLoadNameSpace(3)</a> is able to load this binary representation
       significantly faster than the equivalent ASCII representation.

       If <i>outfile</i> already exists <b>pmnscomp </b>will exit without overwriting
       it.

       By convention, the name of the compiled namespace is that of the
       root file of the ASCII namespace, with <b>.bin </b>appended.  For
       example, the root of the default PMNS is a file named <b>root </b>and
       the compiled version of the entire namespace is <b>root.bin</b>.

       The options are;

       <b>-d   </b>By default the PMNS to be compiled is expected to contain at
            most one name for each unique Performance Metric Identifier
            (PMID).  The <b>-d </b>option relaxes this restriction and allows
            the compilation of a PMNS in which multiple names may be
            associated with a single PMID.  Duplicate names are useful
            when a particular metric may be logically associated with
            more than one group of related metrics, or when it is
            desired to create abbreviated aliases to name a set of
            frequently used metrics.

       <b>-f   </b>Force overwriting of an existing <i>outfile</i> if it already
            exists.

       <b>-n   </b>Normally <b>pmnscomp </b>operates on the default PMNS, however if
            the <b>-n </b>option is specified an alternative namespace is
            loaded from the file <i>namespace.</i>

       <b>-v   </b>By default, <b>pmnscomp </b>writes a version <b>2 </b>compiled namespace.
            If <i>version</i> is <b>1 </b>then <b>pmnscomp </b>will write a version <b>1</b>
            namespace which is similar to version <b>2</b>, without the extra
            integrity afforded by checksums.  Note that PCP version 2.0
            or later can handle both versions <b>1 </b>and <b>2 </b>of the binary PMNS
            format.

       The default input PMNS is found in the file
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root</i> unless the environment variable
       <b>PMNS_DEFAULT </b>is set, in which case the value is assumed to be the
       pathname to the file containing the default input PMNS.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEAT </h2>
<pre>
       Once the writing of the new <i>outfile</i> has begun, the signals
       SIGINT, SIGHUP and SIGTERM will be ignored to protect the
       integrity of the new file.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       Cannot open ``xyz'' - the filename for the root of the PMNS that
       was passed to <a href="../man3/pmloadnamespace.3.html">pmLoadNameSpace(3)</a> is bogus.

       Illegal PMID - either one of the three PMID components (see
       <a href="../man5/pmns.5.html">pmns(5)</a>) is not an integer, or the value for one of the
       components is negative, or too large.

       Expected ... - specific syntax errors when a particular type of
       lexical symbol was expected and not found; the messages are
       intended to be self-explanatory.

       Internal botch - implementation problem for the parser ...

       Duplicate name ``abc'' in subtree for ``pqr.xyz'' - for each non-
       leaf node, the names of all immediate descendents must be unique.

       No name space entry for ``root'' - the special non-leaf node with
       a pathname of ``root'' defines the root of the PMNS, and must
       appear somewhere in the PMNS specification.

       Multiple name space entries for ``root'' - more than one ``root''
       node does not make sense!

       Disconnected subtree (``abc.xyz.def'') in name space - the
       pathname for this non-leaf node does not correspond to any
       pathname in the PMNS, hence this non-leaf node is ``orphaned'' in
       the PMNS.

       Cannot find definition for non-terminal node ``xyz'' in name
       space - a non-terminal node is named as part of its parent's
       specification, but is never defined.

       Duplicate metric id (xxx) in name space for metrics ``abc'' and
       ``xyz'' - each PMID must be unique across the PMNS.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/*</i>
              default PMNS specification files
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root.bin</i>
              compiled version of the default PMNS, when the environment
              variable <b>PMNS_DEFAULT </b>is unset
       <i>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/stdpmid</i>
              some standard macros for PMID generation
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
