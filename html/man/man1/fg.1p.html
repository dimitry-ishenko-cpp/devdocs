PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       fg — run jobs in the foreground
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       fg <b>[</b><i>job_id</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       If job control is enabled (see the description of <i>set</i> <b>-m</b>), the <i>fg</i>
       utility shall move a background job from the current environment
       (see <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>) into the
       foreground.

       Using <i>fg</i> to place a job into the foreground shall remove its
       process ID from the list of those ``known in the current shell
       execution environment''; see <i>Section 2.9.3.1</i>, <i>Examples</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>job_id</i>    Specify the job to be run as a foreground job. If no
                 <i>job_id</i> operand is given, the <i>job_id</i> for the job that
                 was most recently suspended, placed in the background,
                 or run as a background job shall be used. The format of
                 <i>job_id</i> is described in the Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.204</i>, <i>Job Control Job ID</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>fg</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fg</i> utility shall write the command line of the job to
       standard output in the following format:

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>command</i>&gt;
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If job control is disabled, the <i>fg</i> utility shall exit with an
       error and no job shall be placed in the foreground.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>fg</i> utility does not work as expected when it is operating in
       its own utility execution environment because that environment
       has no applicable jobs to manipulate. See the APPLICATION USAGE
       section for <a href="bg.1p.html">bg(1p)</a>.  For this reason, <i>fg</i> is generally implemented
       as a shell regular built-in.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The extensions to the shell specified in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 have mostly been based on features provided by the
       KornShell. The job control features provided by <i>bg</i>, <i>fg</i>, and <i>jobs</i>
       are also based on the KornShell. The standard developers examined
       the characteristics of the C shell versions of these utilities
       and found that differences exist. Despite widespread use of the C
       shell, the KornShell versions were selected for this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 to maintain a degree of uniformity with the rest of
       the KornShell features selected (such as the very popular command
       line editing features).
