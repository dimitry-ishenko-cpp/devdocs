</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_installmanpages - old-style man page installer (deprecated)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installmanpages </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<i>file</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installmanpages </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       automatically installing man pages into <i>usr/share/man/</i> in package
       build directories.

       This is a DWIM-style program, with an interface unlike the rest
       of debhelper. It is deprecated, and you are encouraged to use
       <a href="dh_installman.1.html">dh_installman(1)</a> instead.

       <b>dh_installmanpages </b>scans the current directory and all
       subdirectories for filenames that look like man pages. (Note that
       only real files are looked at; symlinks are ignored.) It uses
       <a href="file.1.html">file(1)</a> to verify that the files are in the correct format. Then,
       based on the files' extensions, it installs them into the correct
       man directory.

       All filenames specified as parameters will be skipped by
       <b>dh_installmanpages</b>.  This is useful if by default it installs
       some man pages that you do not want to be installed.

       After the man page installation step, <b>dh_installmanpages </b>will
       check to see if any of the man pages are <i>.so</i> links. If so, it
       changes them to symlinks.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>file</i> ...
           Do not install these files as man pages, even if they look
           like valid man pages.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_installmanpages </b>will install the man pages it finds into <b>all</b>
       packages you tell it to act on, since it can't tell what package
       the man pages belong in. This is almost never what you really
       want (use <b>-p </b>to work around this, or use the much better
       <a href="dh_installman.1.html">dh_installman(1)</a> program instead).

       Files ending in <i>.man</i> will be ignored.

       Files specified as parameters that contain spaces in their
       filenames will not be processed properly.
