</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       newuidmap - set the uid mapping of a user namespace
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>newuidmap </b><i>pid uid loweruid count</i> [<i>uid loweruid count</i> [ <i>...</i> ]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>newuidmap </b>sets /proc/[pid]/uid_map based on its command line
       arguments and the uids allowed. Subuid delegation can either be
       managed via /etc/subuid or through the configured NSS subid
       module. These options are mutually exclusive.

       Note that the root user is not exempted from the requirement for
       a valid /etc/subuid entry.

       After the pid argument, <b>newuidmap </b>expects sets of 3 integers:

       uid
           Beginning of the range of UIDs inside the user namespace.

       loweruid
           Beginning of the range of UIDs outside the user namespace.

       count
           Length of the ranges (both inside and outside the user
           namespace).

       <b>newuidmap </b>verifies that the caller is the owner of the process
       indicated by <b>pid </b>and that for each of the above sets, each of the
       UIDs in the range [loweruid, loweruid+count) is allowed to the
       caller according to /etc/subuid before setting
       /proc/[pid]/uid_map.

       Note that newuidmap may be used only once for a given process.

       Instead of an integer process id, the first argument may be
       specified as <i>fd:N</i>, where the integer N is the file descriptor
       number for the calling process's opened file descriptor for the
       directory /proc/[pid]. In this case, <b>newuidmap </b>will use openat(2)
       to open the uid_map file under that directory, avoiding a TOCTTOU
       in case the process exits and the pid is immediately reused.
