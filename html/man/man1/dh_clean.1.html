</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_clean - clean up package build directories
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_clean </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-k</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-X</b><i>item</i>] [<i>path</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_clean </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for cleaning
       up.  It should be the last step of the <b>clean </b>target and other
       debhelper commands generally assume that <b>dh_clean </b>will clean up
       after them.

       It removes the package build directories, and removes some other
       files including <i>debian/files</i>, and any detritus left behind by
       other debhelper commands. It also removes common files and
       directories that should not appear in a Debian diff:
         #*# *~ DEADJOE *.orig *.rej *.SUMS __pycache__ TAGS .deps/* *.P
       *-stamp

       It does not run "make clean" to clean up after the build process.
       Use <a href="dh_auto_clean.1.html">dh_auto_clean(1)</a> to do things like that.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>debian/clean</i>
           Can list other paths to be removed.

           Note that directories listed in this file <b>must </b>end with a
           trailing slash.  Any content in these directories will be
           removed as well.

           Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
           documented in <a href="../man7/debhelper.7.html">debhelper(7)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep</b>
           This is deprecated, use <a href="dh_prep.1.html">dh_prep(1)</a> instead.

           The option is removed in compat 12.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dirs-only</b>
           Only clean the package build directories, do not clean up any
           other files at all.

       <b>-X</b><i>item</i> <b>--exclude=</b><i>item</i>
           Exclude files that contain <i>item</i> anywhere in their filename
           from being deleted, even if they would normally be deleted.
           You may use this option multiple times to build up a list of
           things to exclude.

       <i>path</i> ...
           Delete these <i>path</i>s too.

           Note that directories passed as arguments <b>must </b>end with a
           trailing slash.  Any content in these directories will be
           removed as well.
