NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-remote-fd - Reflect smart transport stream back to caller
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       "fd::&lt;infd&gt;[,&lt;outfd&gt;][/&lt;anything&gt;]" (as URL)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This helper uses specified file descriptors to connect to a
       remote Git server. This is not meant for end users but for
       programs and scripts calling git fetch, push, or archive.

       If only &lt;infd&gt; is given, it is assumed to be a bidirectional
       socket connected to a remote Git server (git-upload-pack,
       git-receive-pack, or git-upload-archive). If both &lt;infd&gt; and
       &lt;outfd&gt; are given, they are assumed to be pipes connected to a
       remote Git server (&lt;infd&gt; being the inbound pipe and &lt;outfd&gt;
       being the outbound pipe).

       It is assumed that any handshaking procedures have already been
       completed (such as sending service request for git://) before
       this helper is started.

       &lt;anything&gt; can be any string. It is ignored. It is meant for
       providing information to the user in the URL in case that URL is
       displayed in some context.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       GIT_TRANSLOOP_DEBUG
           If set, prints debugging information about various
           reads/writes.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git fetch fd::17 master</b>
           Fetch master, using file descriptor #17 to communicate with
           git-upload-pack.

       <b>git fetch fd::17/foo master</b>
           Same as above.

       <b>git push fd::7,8 master (as URL)</b>
           Push master, using file descriptor #7 to read data from
           git-receive-pack and file descriptor #8 to write data to the
           same service.

       <b>git push fd::7,8/bar master</b>
           Same as above.
