NAME </h2>
<pre>
       ib_acme - test and configuration utility for the IB ACM
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>ib_acme</i> [-f addr_format] [-s src_addr] -d dest_addr [-v] [-c] [-e] [-P] [-S svc_addr] [-C repetitions]
       <i>ib_acme</i> [-A [addr_file]] [-O [opt_file]] [-D dest_dir] [-V]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       ib_acme provides assistance configuring and testing the ibacm
       service.  The first usage of the service will test that the ibacm
       is running and operating correctly.  The second usage model will
       automatically create address and configuration files for the
       ibacm service.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -f addr_format
              Specifies the format of the src_addr and dest_addr
              parameters.  Valid address formats are: 'i' ip address,
              'n' host name, 'l' lid, 'g' gid, and 'u' unspecified.  If
              the -f option is omitted, an unspecified address format is
              assumed.  ib_acme will use getaddrinfo or other mechanisms
              to determine which format the address uses.

       -s src_addr
              Specifies the local source address of the path to resolve.
              The source address can be an IP address, system network
              name, or LID, as indicated by the addr_format option.

       -d dest_addr
              Specifies the destination address of the path to resolve.
              The destination address can be an IP address, system
              network name, or LID, as indicated by the addr_format
              option.

       -v     Indicates that the resolved path information should be
              verified with the active IB SA.  Use of the -v option
              provides a sanity check that resolved path information is
              usable given the current cluster configuration.

       -c     Instructs the ACM service to only returned information
              that currently resides in its local cache.

       -e [N] Displays one (N = 1, 2, ...) or all endpoints (N = 0 or
              not present).

       -P [opt]
              Queries performance data from the destination service.
              Valid options are: "col" for outputting combined data in
              column format,  "N" (N = 1, 2, ...) for outputting data
              for a specific endpoint N,  "all" for outputting data for
              all endpoints,  and "s" for outputting data for a specific
              endpoint with the address given by the -s option.

       -S svc_addr
              Hostname, IPv4-address or Unix-domain socket of ACM
              service, default: /run/ibacm.sock

       -C repetitions
              number of repetitions to perform resolution.  Used to
              measure performance of ACM cache lookups.  Defaults to 1.

       -A [addr_file]
              With this option, the ib_acme utility automatically
              generates the address configuration file ibacm_addr.cfg.
              The generated file is constructed using the system host
              name.

       -O [opt_file]
              With this option, the ib_acme utility automatically
              generates the option configuration file ibacm_opts.cfg.
              The generated file is currently generated using static
              information.

       -D dest_dir
              Specify the destination directory for the output files.

       -V     Enables verbose output.  When combined with -A or -O
              options, ib_acme will display additional details, such as
              generated address information saved to the ibacm_addr.cfg
              file.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The ib_acme utility performs two main functions.  With the -A and
       -O options, it automatically generates address or options
       configuration files.  The generated files are text based and may
       be edited.  These options are intended to provide a simple way to
       configure address and option information on all nodes on a
       cluster.

       The other function of the ib_acme utility is to test the ibacm
       service, including helping to verify that the service is usable
       given the current cluster configuration.  The ib_acme utility can
       resolve IP addresses, network names, or IB LIDs into a path
       record.  It can then compare that path record against one
       obtained by the SA.  When used to test the ibacm service, the
       ib_acme utility has the side effect of loading the ibacm caches.

       Multiple, numerical destinations can be specified by adding
       brackets [] to the end of a base destination name or address.
       Users may specify a list of numerical ranges inside the brackets
       using the following example as a guide: node[1-3,5,7-8].  This
       will result in testing node1, node2, node3, node5, node7, and
       node8.
