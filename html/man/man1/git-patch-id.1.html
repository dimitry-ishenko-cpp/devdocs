NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-patch-id - Compute unique ID for a patch
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git patch-id</i> [--stable | --unstable | --verbatim]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Read a patch from the standard input and compute the patch ID for
       it.

       A "patch ID" is nothing but a sum of SHA-1 of the file diffs
       associated with a patch, with line numbers ignored. As such, it’s
       "reasonably stable", but at the same time also reasonably unique,
       i.e., two patches that have the same "patch ID" are almost
       guaranteed to be the same thing.

       The main usecase for this command is to look for likely duplicate
       commits.

       When dealing with <i>git diff-tree</i> output, it takes advantage of the
       fact that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the
       commit, and outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first
       string is the patch ID, and the second string is the commit ID.
       This can be used to make a mapping from patch ID to commit ID.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --verbatim
           Calculate the patch-id of the input as it is given, do not
           strip any whitespace.

               This is the default if patchid.verbatim is true.

       --stable
           Use a "stable" sum of hashes as the patch ID. With this
           option:

           •   Reordering file diffs that make up a patch does not
               affect the ID. In particular, two patches produced by
               comparing the same two trees with two different settings
               for "-O&lt;orderfile&gt;" result in the same patch ID
               signature, thereby allowing the computed result to be
               used as a key to index some meta-information about the
               change between the two trees;

           •   Result is different from the value produced by git 1.9
               and older or produced when an "unstable" hash (see
               --unstable below) is configured - even when used on a
               diff output taken without any use of "-O&lt;orderfile&gt;",
               thereby making existing databases storing such "unstable"
               or historical patch-ids unusable.

           •   All whitespace within the patch is ignored and does not
               affect the id.

                   This is the default if patchid.stable is set to true.

       --unstable
           Use an "unstable" hash as the patch ID. With this option, the
           result produced is compatible with the patch-id value
           produced by git 1.9 and older and whitespace is ignored.
           Users with pre-existing databases storing patch-ids produced
           by git 1.9 and older (who do not deal with reordered patches)
           may want to use this option.

               This is the default.
