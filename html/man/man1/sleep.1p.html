PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sleep — suspend execution for an interval
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       sleep <i>time</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sleep</i> utility shall suspend execution for at least the
       integral number of seconds specified by the <i>time</i> operand.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>time</i>      A non-negative decimal integer specifying the number of
                 seconds for which to suspend execution.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>sleep</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       If the <i>sleep</i> utility receives a SIGALRM signal, one of the
       following actions shall be taken:

        1. Terminate normally with a zero exit status.

        2. Effectively ignore the signal.

        3. Provide the default behavior for signals described in the
           ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section of <i>Section 1.4</i>, <i>Utility</i>
           <i>Description Defaults</i>.  This could include terminating with a
           non-zero exit status.

       The <i>sleep</i> utility shall take the standard action for all other
       signals.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The execution was successfully suspended for at least <i>time</i>
             seconds, or a SIGALRM signal was received. See the
             ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sleep</i> utility can be used to execute a command after a
       certain amount of time, as in:

           (sleep 105; <i>command</i>) &amp;

       or to execute a command every so often, as in:

           while true
           do
               <i>command</i>
               sleep 37
           done
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The exit status is allowed to be zero when <i>sleep</i> is interrupted
       by the SIGALRM signal because most implementations of this
       utility rely on the arrival of that signal to notify them that
       the requested finishing time has been successfully attained. Such
       implementations thus do not distinguish this situation from the
       successful completion case. Other implementations are allowed to
       catch the signal and go back to sleep until the requested time
       expires or to provide the normal signal termination procedures.

       As with all other utilities that take integral operands and do
       not specify subranges of allowed values, <i>sleep</i> is required by
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to deal with <i>time</i> requests of up to
       2147483647 seconds. This may mean that some implementations have
       to make multiple calls to the delay mechanism of the underlying
       operating system if its argument range is less than this.
