NAME </h2>
<pre>
       xargs - build and execute command lines from standard input
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xargs </b>[<i>options</i>] [<i>command</i> [<i>initial-arguments</i>]]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>xargs</b>.  <b>xargs </b>reads
       items from the standard input, delimited by blanks (which can be
       protected with double or single quotes or a backslash) or new‐
       lines, and executes the <i>command</i> (default is <i>echo</i>) one or more
       times with any <i>initial-arguments</i> followed by items read from
       standard input.  Blank lines on the standard input are ignored.

       The command line for <i>command</i> is built up until it reaches a sys‐
       tem-defined limit (unless the <b>-n </b>and <b>-L </b>options are used).  The
       specified <i>command</i> will be invoked as many times as necessary to
       use up the list of input items.  In general, there will be many
       fewer invocations of <i>command</i> than there were items in the input.
       This will normally have significant performance benefits.  Some
       commands can usefully be executed in parallel too; see the <b>-P </b>op‐
       tion.

       Because Unix filenames can contain blanks and newlines, this de‐
       fault behaviour is often problematic; filenames containing blanks
       and/or newlines are incorrectly processed by <b>xargs</b>.  In these
       situations it is better to use the <b>-0 </b>option, which prevents such
       problems.  When using this option you will need to ensure that
       the program which produces the input for <b>xargs </b>also uses a null
       character as a separator.  If that program is GNU <b>find </b>for exam‐
       ple, the <b>-print0 </b>option does this for you.

       If any invocation of the command exits with a status of 255,
       <b>xargs </b>will stop immediately without reading any further input.
       An error message is issued on stderr when this happens.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-0, --null</b>
              Input items are terminated by a null character instead of
              by whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are not spe‐
              cial (every character is taken literally).  Disables the
              end-of-file string, which is treated like any other argu‐
              ment.  Useful when input items might contain white space,
              quote marks, or backslashes.  The GNU find (and from Issue
              8, POSIX) -print0 option produces input suitable for this
              mode.

       <b>-a </b><i>file</i><b>, --arg-file=</b><i>file</i>
              Read items from <i>file</i> instead of standard input.  If you
              use this option, stdin remains unchanged when commands are
              run.  Otherwise, stdin is redirected from <i>/dev/null</i>.

       <b>--delimiter=</b><i>delim</i><b>, -d </b><i>delim</i>
              Input items are terminated by the specified character.
              The specified delimiter may be a single character, a C-
              style character escape such as <b>\n</b>, or an octal or hexadec‐
              imal escape code.  Octal and hexadecimal escape codes are
              understood as for the <b>printf </b>command.  Multibyte charac‐
              ters are not supported.  When processing the input, quotes
              and backslash are not special; every character in the in‐
              put is taken literally.  The <b>-d </b>option disables any end-
              of-file string, which is treated like any other argument.
              You can use this option when the input consists of simply
              newline-separated items, although it is almost always bet‐
              ter to design your program to use <b>--null </b>where this is
              possible.

       <b>-E </b><i>eof-str</i>
              Set the end-of-file string to <i>eof-str</i>.  If the end-of-file
              string occurs as a line of input, the rest of the input is
              ignored.  If neither <b>-E </b>nor <b>-e </b>is used, no end-of-file
              string is used.

       <b>-e</b>[<i>eof-str</i>], <b>--eof</b>[<i>=eof-str</i>]
              This option is a synonym for the <b>-E </b>option.  Use <b>-E </b>in‐
              stead, because it is POSIX compliant while this option is
              not.  If <i>eof-str</i> is omitted, there is no end-of-file
              string.  If neither <b>-E </b>nor <b>-e </b>is used, no end-of-file
              string is used.

       <b>-I </b><i>replace-str</i>
              Replace occurrences of <i>replace-str</i> in the initial-argu‐
              ments with names read from standard input.  Also, unquoted
              blanks do not terminate input items; instead the separator
              is the newline character.  Implies <b>-x </b>and <b>-L </b>1.

       <b>-i</b>[<i>replace-str</i>], <b>--replace</b>[<i>=replace-str</i>]
              This option is a synonym for <b>-I</b><i>replace-str</i> if <i>replace-str</i>
              is specified.  If the <i>replace-str</i> argument is missing, the
              effect is the same as <b>-I</b>{}.  The <b>-i </b>option is deprecated;
              use <b>-I </b>instead.

       <b>-L </b><i>max-lines</i>
              Use at most <i>max-lines</i> nonblank input lines per command
              line.  Trailing blanks cause an input line to be logically
              continued on the next input line.  Implies <b>-x</b>.

       <b>-l</b>[<i>max-lines</i>], <b>--max-lines</b>[=<i>max-lines</i>]
              Synonym for the <b>-L </b>option.  Unlike <b>-L</b>, the <i>max-lines</i> argu‐
              ment is optional.  If <i>max-lines</i> is not specified, it de‐
              faults to one.  The <b>-l </b>option is deprecated since the
              POSIX standard specifies <b>-L </b>instead.

       <b>-n </b><i>max-args</i>, <b>--max-args</b>=<i>max-args</i>
              Use at most <i>max-args</i> arguments per command line.  Fewer
              than <i>max-args</i> arguments will be used if the size (see the
              <b>-s </b>option) is exceeded, unless the <b>-x </b>option is given, in
              which case <b>xargs </b>will exit.

       <b>-P </b><i>max-procs</i>, <b>--max-procs</b>=<i>max-procs</i>
              Run up to <i>max-procs</i> processes at a time; the default is 1.
              If <i>max-procs</i> is 0, <b>xargs </b>will run as many processes as
              possible at a time.  Use the <b>-n </b>option or the <b>-L </b>option
              with <b>-P</b>; otherwise chances are that only one exec will be
              done.  While <b>xargs </b>is running, you can send its process a
              SIGUSR1 signal to increase the number of commands to run
              simultaneously, or a SIGUSR2 to decrease the number.  You
              cannot increase it above an implementation-defined limit
              (which is shown with --show-limits).  You cannot decrease
              it below 1.  <b>xargs </b>never terminates its commands; when
              asked to decrease, it merely waits for more than one ex‐
              isting command to terminate before starting another.
              <b>xargs </b>always waits for all child processes to exit before
              exiting itself (but see BUGS).

              If you do not use the <b>-P </b>option, <b>xargs </b>will not handle the
              SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals, meaning that they will termi‐
              nate the program (unless they were blocked in the parent
              process before <b>xargs </b>was started).

              <b>Please note </b>that it is up to the called processes to prop‐
              erly manage parallel access to shared resources.  For ex‐
              ample, if more than one of them tries to print to stdout,
              the output will be produced in an indeterminate order (and
              very likely mixed up) unless the processes collaborate in
              some way to prevent this.  Using some kind of locking
              scheme is one way to prevent such problems.  In general,
              using a locking scheme will help ensure correct output but
              reduce performance.  If you don't want to tolerate the
              performance difference, simply arrange for each process to
              produce a separate output file (or otherwise use separate
              resources).

       <b>-o, --open-tty</b>
              Reopen stdin as <i>/dev/tty</i> in the child process before exe‐
              cuting the command.  This is useful if you want <b>xargs </b>to
              run an interactive application.

       <b>-p, --interactive</b>
              Prompt the user about whether to run each command line and
              read a line from the terminal.  Only run the command line
              if the response starts with `y' or `Y'.  Implies <b>-t</b>.

       <b>--process-slot-var</b>=<i>name</i>
              Set the environment variable <i>name</i> to a unique value in
              each running child process.  Values are reused once child
              processes exit.  This can be used in a rudimentary load
              distribution scheme, for example.

       <b>-r, --no-run-if-empty</b>
              If the standard input does not contain any nonblanks, do
              not run the command.  Normally, the command is run once
              even if there is no input.  This option is a GNU exten‐
              sion.

       <b>-s </b><i>max-chars</i>, <b>--max-chars</b><i>=max-chars</i>
              Use at most <i>max-chars</i> characters per command line, includ‐
              ing the command and initial-arguments and the terminating
              nulls at the ends of the argument strings.  The largest
              allowed value is system-dependent, and is calculated as
              the argument length limit for exec, less the size of your
              environment, less 2048 bytes of headroom.  If this value
              is more than 128 KiB, 128 KiB is used as the default val‐
              ue; otherwise, the default value is the maximum.  1 KiB is
              1024 bytes.  <b>xargs </b>automatically adapts to tighter con‐
              straints.

       <b>--show-limits</b>
              Display the limits on the command-line length which are
              imposed by the operating system, <b>xargs</b>' choice of buffer
              size and the <b>-s </b>option.  Pipe the input from <i>/dev/null</i>
              (and perhaps specify <b>--no-run-if-empty</b>) if you don't want
              <b>xargs </b>to do anything.

       <b>-t, --verbose</b>
              Print the command line on the standard error output before
              executing it.

       <b>-x, --exit</b>
              Exit if the size (see the <b>-s </b>option) is exceeded.

       <b>--     </b>Delimit the option list.  Later arguments, if any, are
              treated as operands even if they begin with <i>-</i>.  For exam‐
              ple, <b>xargs -- --help </b>runs the command <i>--help</i> (found in
              <i>PATH</i>) instead of printing the usage text, and <b>xargs --</b>
              <b>--mycommand </b>runs the command <i>--mycommand</i> instead of re‐
              jecting this as unrecognized option.

       <b>--help </b>Print a summary of the options to <b>xargs </b>and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number of <b>xargs </b>and exit.

       The options <b>--max-lines </b>(<b>-L</b>, <b>-l</b>), <b>--replace </b>(<b>-I</b>, <b>-i</b>) and <b>--max-</b>
       <b>args </b>(<b>-n</b>) are mutually exclusive.  If some of them are specified
       at the same time, then <b>xargs </b>will generally use the option speci‐
       fied last on the command line, i.e., it will reset the value of
       the offending option (given before) to its default value.  Addi‐
       tionally, <b>xargs </b>will issue a warning diagnostic on <i>stderr</i>.  The
       exception to this rule is that the special <i>max-args</i> value <i>1</i>
       ('<b>-n</b><i>1</i>') is ignored after the <b>--replace </b>option and its aliases <b>-I</b>
       and <b>-i</b>, because it would not actually conflict.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>find /tmp -name core -type f -print | xargs /bin/rm -f</b>

       Find files named <b>core </b>in or below the directory <b>/tmp </b>and delete
       them.  Note that this will work incorrectly if there are any
       filenames containing newlines or spaces.

       <b>find /tmp -name core -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -f</b>

       Find files named <b>core </b>in or below the directory <b>/tmp </b>and delete
       them, processing filenames in such a way that file or directory
       names containing spaces or newlines are correctly handled.

       <b>find /tmp -depth -name core -type f -delete</b>

       Find files named <b>core </b>in or below the directory <b>/tmp </b>and delete
       them, but more efficiently than in the previous example (because
       we avoid the need to use <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork(2)</a> and <b>exec</b>(2) to launch <b>rm </b>and we
       don't need the extra <b>xargs </b>process).

       <b>cut -d: -f1 &lt; /etc/passwd | sort | xargs echo</b>

       Generates a compact listing of all the users on the system.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>xargs </b>exits with the following status:

              0      if it succeeds

              123    if any invocation of the command exited with status
                     1–125

              124    if the command exited with status 255

              125    if the command is killed by a signal

              126    if the command cannot be run

              127    if the command is not found

              1      if some other error occurred.

       Exit codes greater than 128 are used by the shell to indicate
       that a program died due to a fatal signal.
</pre> <h2>
STANDARDS CONFORMANCE </h2>
<pre>
       The long-standing <b>-0 </b>option of <b>xargs </b>will be included in Issue 8
       of the POSIX standard.

       As of GNU xargs version 4.2.9, the default behaviour of <b>xargs </b>is
       not to have a logical end-of-file marker.  POSIX (IEEE Std
       1003.1, 2004 Edition) allows this.

       The -l and -i options appear in the 1997 version of the POSIX
       standard, but do not appear in the 2004 version of the standard.
       Therefore you should use -L and -I instead, respectively.

       The -o option is an extension to the POSIX standard for better
       compatibility with BSD.

       The POSIX standard allows implementations to have a limit on the
       size of arguments to the <b>exec </b>functions.  This limit could be as
       low as 4096 bytes including the size of the environment.  For
       scripts to be portable, they must not rely on a larger value.
       However, I know of no implementation whose actual limit is that
       small.  The <b>--show-limits </b>option can be used to discover the ac‐
       tual limits in force on the current system.

       In versions of <b>xargs </b>up to and including version 4.9.0, SIGUSR1
       and SIGUSR2 would not cause <b>xargs </b>to terminate even if the <b>-P </b>op‐
       tion was not used.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>xargs </b>program was invented by Herb Gellis at Bell Labs.  See
       the Texinfo manual for findutils, <i>Finding Files</i>, for more infor‐
       mation.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       It is not possible for <b>xargs </b>to be used securely, since there
       will always be a time gap between the production of the list of
       input files and their use in the commands that <b>xargs </b>issues.  If
       other users have access to the system, they can manipulate the
       filesystem during this time window to force the action of the
       commands <b>xargs </b>runs to apply to files that you didn't intend.
       For a more detailed discussion of this and related problems,
       please refer to the ``Security Considerations'' chapter in the
       findutils Texinfo documentation.  The <b>-execdir </b>option of <b>find </b>can
       often be used as a more secure alternative.

       When you use the <b>-I </b>option, each line read from the input is
       buffered internally.  This means that there is an upper limit on
       the length of input line that <b>xargs </b>will accept when used with
       the <b>-I </b>option.  To work around this limitation, you can use the
       <b>-s </b>option to increase the amount of buffer space that <b>xargs </b>uses,
       and you can also use an extra invocation of <b>xargs </b>to ensure that
       very long lines do not occur.  For example:

       <b>somecommand | xargs -s 50000 echo | xargs -I '{}' -s 100000 rm</b>
       <b>'{}'</b>

       Here, the first invocation of <b>xargs </b>has no input line length lim‐
       it because it doesn't use the <b>-i </b>option.  The second invocation
       of <b>xargs </b>does have such a limit, but we have ensured that it nev‐
       er encounters a line which is longer than it can handle.  This is
       not an ideal solution.  Instead, the <b>-i </b>option should not impose
       a line length limit, which is why this discussion appears in the
       BUGS section.  The problem doesn't occur with the output of
       <a href="find.1.html">find(1)</a> because it emits just one filename per line.

       In versions of <b>xargs </b>up to and including version 4.9.0, <b>xargs -P</b>
       would exit while some of its children were still running, if one
       of them exited with status 255.
