PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       exit — cause the shell to exit
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       exit <b>[</b><i>n</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>exit</i> utility shall cause the shell to exit from its current
       execution environment with the exit status specified by the
       unsigned decimal integer <i>n</i>.  If the current execution environment
       is a subshell environment, the shell shall exit from the subshell
       environment with the specified exit status and continue in the
       environment from which that subshell environment was invoked;
       otherwise, the shell utility shall terminate with the specified
       exit status. If <i>n</i> is specified, but its value is not between 0
       and 255 inclusively, the exit status is undefined.

       A <i>trap</i> on <b>EXIT </b>shall be executed before the shell terminates,
       except when the <i>exit</i> utility is invoked in that <i>trap</i> itself, in
       which case the shell shall exit immediately.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The exit status shall be <i>n</i>, if specified, except that the
       behavior is unspecified if <i>n</i> is not an unsigned decimal integer
       or is greater than 255. Otherwise, the value shall be the exit
       value of the last command executed, or zero if no command was
       executed. When <i>exit</i> is executed in a <i>trap</i> action, the last
       command is considered to be the command that executed immediately
       preceding the <i>trap</i> action.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Exit with a <i>true</i> value:

           exit 0

       Exit with a <i>false</i> value:

           exit 1

       Propagate error handling from within a subshell:

           (
               command1 || exit 1
               command2 || exit 1
               exec command3
           ) &gt; outputfile || exit 1
           echo "outputfile created successfully"
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       As explained in other sections, certain exit status values have
       been reserved for special uses and should be used by applications
       only for those purposes:

        126    A file to be executed was found, but it was not an
               executable utility.

        127    A utility to be executed was not found.

       &gt;128    A command was interrupted by a signal.

       The behavior of <i>exit</i> when given an invalid argument or unknown
       option is unspecified, because of differing practices in the
       various historical implementations. A value larger than 255 might
       be truncated by the shell, and be unavailable even to a parent
       process that uses <i>waitid</i>() to get the full exit value. It is
       recommended that implementations that detect any usage error
       should cause a non-zero exit status (or, if the shell is
       interactive and the error does not cause the shell to abort,
       store a non-zero value in <b>"$?"</b>), but even this was not done
       historically in all shells.
