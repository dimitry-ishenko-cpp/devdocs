</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The attributes of a batch job are altered by a request to the
       batch server that manages the batch job. The <i>qalter</i> utility is a
       user-accessible batch client that requests the alteration of the
       attributes of one or more batch jobs.

       The <i>qalter</i> utility shall alter the attributes of those batch
       jobs, and only those batch jobs, for which a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       is presented to the utility.

       The <i>qalter</i> utility shall alter the attributes of batch jobs in
       the order in which the batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the
       utility.

       If the <i>qalter</i> utility fails to process a batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       For each batch <i>job_identifier</i> for which the <i>qalter</i> utility
       succeeds, each attribute of the identified batch job shall be
       altered as indicated by all the options presented to the utility.

       For each identified batch job for which the <i>qalter</i> utility fails,
       the utility shall not alter any attribute of the batch job.

       For each batch job that the <i>qalter</i> utility processes, the utility
       shall not modify any attribute other than those required by the
       options and option-arguments presented to the utility.

       The <i>qalter</i> utility shall alter batch jobs by sending a <i>Modify Job</i>
       <i>Request</i> to the batch server that manages each batch job. At the
       time the <i>qalter</i> utility exits, it shall have modified the batch
       job corresponding to each successfully processed batch
       <i>job_identifier</i>.  An attempt to alter the attributes of a batch
       job in the RUNNING state is implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qalter</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-a </b><i>date_time</i>
                 Redefine the time at which the batch job becomes
                 eligible for execution.

                 The <i>date_time</i> argument shall be in the same form and
                 represent the same time as for the <i>touch</i> utility. The
                 time so represented shall be set into the
                 <i>Execution_Time</i> attribute of the batch job. If the time
                 specified is earlier than the current time, the <b>-a</b>
                 option shall have no effect.

       <b>-A </b><i>account_string</i>
                 Redefine the account to which the resource consumption
                 of the batch job should be charged.

                 The syntax of the <i>account_string</i> option-argument is
                 unspecified.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the <i>Account_Name</i> attribute
                 of the batch job to the value of the <i>account_string</i>
                 option-argument.

       <b>-c </b><i>interval</i>
                 Redefine whether the batch job should be checkpointed,
                 and if so, how often.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a value for the
                 interval option-argument that is one of the following:

                 n         No checkpointing is to be performed on the
                           batch job (NO_CHECKPOINT).

                 s         Checkpointing is to be performed only when
                           the batch server is shut down
                           (CHECKPOINT_AT_SHUTDOWN).

                 c         Automatic periodic checkpointing is to be
                           performed at the <i>Minimum_Cpu_Interval</i>
                           attribute of the batch queue, in units of CPU
                           minutes (CHECKPOINT_AT_MIN_CPU_INTERVAL).

                 c=<i>minutes</i> Automatic periodic checkpointing is to be
                           performed every <i>minutes</i> of CPU time, or every
                           <i>Minimum_Cpu_Interval</i> minutes, whichever is
                           greater. The <i>minutes</i> argument shall conform
                           to the syntax for unsigned integers and shall
                           be greater than zero.

                 An implementation may define other checkpoint
                 intervals. The conformance document for an
                 implementation shall describe any alternative
                 checkpoint intervals, how they are specified, their
                 internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of
                 the utility.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the <i>Checkpoint</i> attribute
                 of the batch job to the value of the <i>interval</i> option-
                 argument.

       <b>-e </b><i>path_name</i>
                 Redefine the path to be used for the standard error
                 stream of the batch job.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a <i>path_name</i> option-
                 argument that conforms to the syntax of the <i>path_name</i>
                 element defined in the System Interfaces volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, which can be preceded by a host name
                 element of the form <i>hostname</i>:.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes an
                 absolute pathname, the <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the
                 <i>Error_Path</i> attribute of the batch job to the value of
                 the <i>path_name</i> option-argument, including the host name
                 element, if present.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes a relative
                 pathname and no host name element is specified, the
                 <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the <i>Error_Path</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the value of the absolute pathname
                 derived by expanding the <i>path_name</i> option-argument
                 relative to the current directory of the process that
                 executes the <i>qalter</i> utility.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes a relative
                 pathname and a host name element is specified, the
                 <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the <i>Error_Path</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the value of the option-argument
                 without expansion.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument does not include a
                 host name element, the <i>qalter</i> utility shall prefix the
                 pathname in the <i>Error_Path</i> attribute with <i>hostname</i>:,
                 where <i>hostname</i> is the name of the host upon which the
                 <i>qalter</i> utility is being executed.

       <b>-h </b><i>hold_list</i>
                 Redefine the types of holds, if any, on the batch job.
                 The <i>qalter</i> <b>-h </b>option shall accept a value for the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a value for the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument that is a string of one or
                 more of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, or <b>'o'</b>, or the single
                 character <b>'n'</b>.  For each unique character in the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument, the <i>qalter</i> utility shall add
                 a value to the <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute of the batch job as
                 follows, each representing a different hold type:

                 u     USER

                 s     SYSTEM

                 o     OPERATOR

                 If any of these characters are duplicated in the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument, the duplicates shall be
                 ignored. An existing <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute can be
                 cleared by the hold type:

                 n     NO_HOLD

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall consider it an error if any
                 hold type other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with hold type
                 <b>'n'</b>.  Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat
                 any of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument. The <i>qalter</i> utility shall
                 permit the repetition of characters, but shall not
                 assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.
                 An implementation may define other hold types. The
                 conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe any additional hold types, how they are
                 specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                 the behavior of the utility.

       <b>-j </b><i>join_list</i>
                 Redefine which streams of the batch job are to be
                 merged. The <i>qalter</i> <b>-j </b>option shall accept a value for
                 the <i>join_list</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a <i>join_list</i> option-
                 argument that consists of one or more of the characters
                 <b>'e' </b>and <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 All of the other batch job output streams specified
                 shall be merged into the output stream represented by
                 the character listed first in the <i>join_list</i> option-
                 argument.

                 For each unique character in the <i>join_list</i> option-
                 argument, the <i>qalter</i> utility shall add a value to the
                 <i>Join_Path</i> attribute of the batch job as follows, each
                 representing a different batch job stream to join:

                 e     The standard error of the batch job
                       (JOIN_STD_ERROR).

                 o     The standard output of the batch job
                       (JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).

                 An existing <i>Join_Path</i> attribute can be cleared by the
                 join type:

                 n     NO_JOIN

                 If <b>'n' </b>is specified, then no files are joined. The
                 <i>qalter</i> utility shall consider it an error if any join
                 type other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with join type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                 of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the <i>join_list</i>
                 option-argument. The <i>qalter</i> utility shall permit the
                 repetition of characters, but shall not assign
                 additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other join types. The
                 conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe any additional batch job streams, how they are
                 specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                 the behavior of the utility.

       <b>-k </b><i>keep_list</i>
                 Redefine which output of the batch job to retain on the
                 execution host.

                 The <i>qalter</i> <b>-k </b>option shall accept a value for the
                 <i>keep_list</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a <i>keep_list</i> option-
                 argument that consists of one or more of the characters
                 <b>'e' </b>and <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 For each unique character in the <i>keep_list</i> option-
                 argument, the <i>qalter</i> utility shall add a value to the
                 <i>Keep_Files</i> attribute of the batch job as follows, each
                 representing a different batch job stream to keep:

                 e     The standard error of the batch job
                       (KEEP_STD_ERROR).

                 o     The standard output of the batch job
                       (KEEP_STD_OUTPUT).

                 If both <b>'e' </b>and <b>'o' </b>are specified, then both files are
                 retained. An existing <i>Keep_Files</i> attribute can be
                 cleared by the keep type:

                 n     NO_KEEP

                 If <b>'n' </b>is specified, then no files are retained. The
                 <i>qalter</i> utility shall consider it an error if any keep
                 type other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with keep type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                 of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the <i>keep_list</i>
                 option-argument. The <i>qalter</i> utility shall permit the
                 repetition of characters, but shall not assign
                 additional meaning to the repeated characters. An
                 implementation may define other keep types. The
                 conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe any additional keep types, how they are
                 specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                 the behavior of the utility.

       <b>-l </b><i>resource_list</i>
                 Redefine the resources that are allowed or required by
                 the batch job.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a <i>resource_list</i> option-
                 argument that conforms to the following syntax:

                     resource=value[,,resource=value,,...]

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall set one entry in the value of
                 the <i>Resource_List</i> attribute of the batch job for each
                 resource listed in the <i>resource_list</i> option-argument.

                 Because the list of supported resource names might vary
                 by batch server, the <i>qalter</i> utility shall rely on the
                 batch server to validate the resource names and
                 associated values. See <i>Section 3.3.3</i>, <i>Multiple Keyword-</i>
                 <i>Value Pairs</i> for a means of removing <i>keyword</i>=<i>value</i> (and
                 <i>value</i>@<i>keyword</i>) pairs and other general rules for list-
                 oriented batch job attributes.

       <b>-m </b><i>mail_options</i>
                 Redefine the points in the execution of the batch job
                 at which the batch server is to send mail about a
                 change in the state of the batch job.

                 The <i>qalter</i> <b>-m </b>option shall accept a value for the
                 <i>mail_options</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a value for the
                 <i>mail_options</i> option-argument that is a string of one or
                 more of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, and <b>'a'</b>, or the single
                 character <b>'n'</b>.  For each unique character in the
                 <i>mail_options</i> option-argument, the <i>qalter</i> utility shall
                 add a value to the <i>Mail_Users</i> attribute of the batch
                 job as follows, each representing a different time
                 during the life of a batch job at which to send mail:

                 e     MAIL_AT_EXIT

                 b     MAIL_AT_BEGINNING

                 a     MAIL_AT_ABORT

                 If any of these characters are duplicated in the
                 <i>mail_options</i> option-argument, the duplicates shall be
                 ignored.

                 An existing <i>Mail_Points</i> attribute can be cleared by the
                 mail type:

                 n     NO_MAIL

                 If <b>'n' </b>is specified, then mail is not sent. The <i>qalter</i>
                 utility shall consider it an error if any mail type
                 other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with mail type <b>'n'</b>.
                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                 of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, <b>'a'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the
                 <i>mail_options</i> option-argument. The <i>qalter</i> utility shall
                 permit the repetition of characters but shall not
                 assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other mail types. The
                 conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe any additional mail types, how they are
                 specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                 the behavior of the utility.

       <b>-M </b><i>mail_list</i>
                 Redefine the list of users to which the batch server
                 that executes the batch job is to send mail, if the
                 batch server sends mail about the batch job.

                 The syntax of the <i>mail_list</i> option-argument is
                 unspecified. If the implementation of the <i>qalter</i>
                 utility uses a name service to locate users, the
                 utility shall accept the syntax used by the name
                 service.

                 If the implementation of the <i>qalter</i> utility does not
                 use a name service to locate users, the implementation
                 shall accept the following syntax for user names:

                     mail_address[,,mail_address,,...]

                 The interpretation of <i>mail_address</i> is implementation-
                 defined.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the <i>Mail_Users</i> attribute
                 of the batch job to the value of the <i>mail_list</i> option-
                 argument.

       <b>-N </b><i>name</i>   Redefine the name of the batch job.

                 The <i>qalter</i> <b>-N </b>option shall accept a value for the <i>name</i>
                 option-argument that is a string of up to 15
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                 where the first character is alphabetic.

                 The syntax of the <i>name</i> option-argument is unspecified.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the <i>Job_Name</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the value of the <i>name</i> option-argument.

       <b>-o </b><i>path_name</i>
                 Redefine the path for the standard output of the batch
                 job.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a <i>path_name</i> option-
                 argument that conforms to the syntax of the <i>path_name</i>
                 element defined in the System Interfaces volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, which can be preceded by a host name
                 element of the form <i>hostname</i>:.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes an
                 absolute pathname, the <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the
                 <i>Output_Path</i> attribute of the batch job to the value of
                 the <i>path_name</i> option-argument.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes a relative
                 pathname and no host name element is specified, the
                 <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the <i>Output_Path</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the absolute pathname derived by
                 expanding the <i>path_name</i> option-argument relative to the
                 current directory of the process that executes the
                 <i>qalter</i> utility.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument constitutes a relative
                 pathname and a host name element is specified, the
                 <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the <i>Output_Path</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the value of the <i>path_name</i> option-
                 argument without any expansion of the pathname.

                 If the <i>path_name</i> option-argument does not include a
                 host name element, the <i>qalter</i> utility shall prefix the
                 pathname in the <i>Output_Path</i> attribute with <i>hostname</i>:,
                 where <i>hostname</i> is the name of the host upon which the
                 <i>qalter</i> utility is being executed.

       <b>-p </b><i>priority</i>
                 Redefine the priority of the batch job.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a value for the
                 priority option-argument that conforms to the syntax
                 for signed decimal integers, and which is not less than
                 -1024 and not greater than 1023.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall set the <i>Priority</i> attribute of
                 the batch job to the value of the <i>priority</i> option-
                 argument.

       <b>-r </b>y|n    Redefine whether the batch job is rerunnable.

                 If the value of the option-argument is <b>'y'</b>, the <i>qalter</i>
                 utility shall set the <i>Rerunable</i> attribute of the batch
                 job to TRUE.

                 If the value of the option-argument is <b>'n'</b>, the <i>qalter</i>
                 utility shall set the <i>Rerunable</i> attribute of the batch
                 job to FALSE.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall consider it an error if any
                 character other than <b>'y' </b>or <b>'n' </b>is specified in the
                 option-argument.

       <b>-S </b><i>path_name_list</i>
                 Redefine the shell that interprets the script at the
                 destination system.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a <i>path_name_list</i>
                 option-argument that conforms to the following syntax:

                     pathname[@host][,pathname[@host],...]

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept only one pathname that
                 is missing a corresponding host name. The <i>qalter</i>
                 utility shall allow only one pathname per named host.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall add a value to the
                 <i>Shell_Path_List</i> attribute of the batch job for each
                 entry in the <i>path_name_list</i> option-argument. See
                 <i>Section 3.3.3</i>, <i>Multiple Keyword-Value Pairs</i> for a means
                 of removing <i>keyword</i>=<i>value</i> (and <i>value</i>@<i>keyword</i>) pairs and

                 attributes.

       <b>-u </b><i>user_list</i>
                 Redefine the user name under which the batch job is to
                 run at the destination system.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept a <i>user_list</i> option-
                 argument that conforms to the following syntax:

                     username[@host][,,username[@host],,...]

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall accept only one user name that
                 is missing a corresponding host name. The <i>qalter</i>
                 utility shall accept only one user name per named host.

                 The <i>qalter</i> utility shall add a value to the <i>User_List</i>
                 attribute of the batch job for each entry in the
                 <i>user_list</i> option-argument. See <i>Section 3.3.3</i>, <i>Multiple</i>
                 <i>Keyword-Value Pairs</i> for a means of removing

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qalter</i> utility allows users to change the attributes of a
       batch job.

       As a means of altering a queued job, the <i>qalter</i> utility is
       superior to deleting and requeuing the batch job insofar as an
       altered job retains its place in the queue with some traditional
       selection algorithms. In addition, the <i>qalter</i> utility is both
       shorter and simpler than a sequence of <i>qdel</i> and <i>qsub</i> utilities.

       The result of an attempt on the part of a user to alter a batch
       job in a RUNNING state is implementation-defined because a batch
       job in the RUNNING state will already have opened its output
       files and otherwise performed any actions indicated by the
       options in effect at the time the batch job began execution.

       The options processed by the <i>qalter</i> utility are identical to
       those of the <i>qsub</i> utility, with a few exceptions: <b>-V</b>, <b>-v</b>, and <b>-q</b>.
       The <b>-V </b>and <b>-v </b>are inappropriate for the <i>qalter</i> utility, since
       they capture potentially transient environment information from
       the submitting process. The <b>-q </b>option would specify a new queue,
       which would largely negate the previously stated advantage of
       using <i>qalter</i>; furthermore, the <i>qmove</i> utility provides a superior
       means of moving jobs.

       Each of the following paragraphs provides the rationale for a
       <i>qalter</i> option.

       Additional rationale concerning these options can be found in the
       rationale for the <i>qsub</i> utility.

       The <b>-a </b>option allows users to alter the date and time at which a
       batch job becomes eligible to run.

       The <b>-A </b>option allows users to change the account that will be
       charged for the resources consumed by the batch job. Support for
       the <b>-A </b>option is mandatory for conforming implementations of
       <i>qalter</i>, even though support of accounting is optional for
       servers. Whether or not to support accounting is left to the
       implementor of the server, but mandatory support of the <b>-A </b>option
       assures users of a consistent interface and allows them to
       control accounting on servers that support accounting.

       The <b>-c </b>option allows users to alter the checkpointing interval of
       a batch job. A checkpointing system, which is not defined by
       POSIX.1‐2008, allows recovery of a batch job at the most recent
       checkpoint in the event of a crash. Checkpointing is typically
       used for jobs that consume expensive computing time or must meet
       a critical schedule. Users should be allowed to make the tradeoff
       between the overhead of checkpointing and the risk to the timely
       completion of the batch job; therefore, this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 provides the checkpointing interval option. Support
       for checkpointing is optional for servers.

       The <b>-e </b>option allows users to alter the name and location of the
       standard error stream written by a batch job. However, the path
       of the standard error stream is meaningless if the value of the
       <i>Join_Path</i> attribute of the batch job is TRUE.

       The <b>-h </b>option allows users to set the hold type in the <i>Hold_Types</i>
       attribute of a batch job. The <i>qhold</i> and <i>qrls</i> utilities add or
       remove hold types to the <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute, respectively. The
       <b>-h </b>option has been modified to allow for implementation-defined
       hold types.

       The <b>-j </b>option allows users to alter the decision to join (merge)
       the standard error stream of the batch job with the standard
       output stream of the batch job.

       The <b>-l </b>option allows users to change the resource limits imposed
       on a batch job.

       The <b>-m </b>option allows users to modify the list of points in the
       life of a batch job at which the designated users will receive
       mail notification.

       The <b>-M </b>option allows users to alter the list of users who will
       receive notification about events in the life of a batch job.

       The <b>-N </b>option allows users to change the name of a batch job.

       The <b>-o </b>option allows users to alter the name and path to which
       the standard output stream of the batch job will be written.

       The <b>-P </b>option allows users to modify the priority of a batch job.
       Support for priority is optional for batch servers.

       The <b>-r </b>option allows users to alter the rerunability status of a
       batch job.

       The <b>-S </b>option allows users to change the name and location of the
       shell image that will be invoked to interpret the script of the
       batch job. This option has been modified to allow a list of shell
       name and locations associated with different hosts.

       The <b>-u </b>option allows users to change the user identifier under
       which the batch job will execute.

       The <i>job_identifier</i> operand syntax is provided so that the user
       can differentiate between the originating and destination (or
       executing) batch server. These may or may not be the same. The
       .<i>server_name</i> portion identifies the originating batch server,
       while the @<i>server</i> portion identifies the destination batch
       server.

       Historically, the <i>qalter</i> utility has been a component of the
       Network Queuing System (NQS), the existing practice from which
       this utility has been derived.
