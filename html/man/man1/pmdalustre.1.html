NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdalustre </b>- lustre filesystem statistics performance metrics
       domain agent (PMDA)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdalustre </b>is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       reads and exports metric values from the statistics interfaces of
       a Lustre filesystem.

       <b>pmdalustre </b>searches for statistics interfaces from several
       locations, which vary depending on the version of <b>Lustre</b>
       installed locally.

       Recent <b>Lustre </b>versions (v2.12 and later) export statistics from
       the kernel <b>debugfs </b>pseudo filesystem, in the directories
       <b>/sys/kernel/debug/lustre/llite </b>and <b>/sys/kernel/debug/lnet</b>.  If
       these interfaces are not found during startup, <b>pmdalustre </b>will
       automatically check if the statistics interfaces are available
       from the <b>procfs </b>pseudo filesystem below the <b>/proc/fs/lustre/llite</b>
       and <b>/proc/sys/lnet </b>directories.  These are the default locations
       of the statistics for <b>Lustre </b>versions less than <b>v2.12</b>.

       If neither of the above filesystem interfaces are detected, or if
       the user wants to override the default locations, <b>pmdalustre </b>also
       supports an optional configuration file named
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/lustre.conf</b>.  Note that <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR </b>is
       set to <b>/var/lib/pcp/pmdas </b>on most Linux based  systems.  The
       configuration file supports <b>perl</b>(1) variable assignment syntax.
       An example configuration file suitable for <b>Lustre </b>v2.12 and later
       is:

                    <b>$LLITE_PATH="/sys/kernel/debug/lustre/llite/";</b>
                    <b>$LNET_PATH="/sys/kernel/debug/lustre/lnet/";</b>

       See comments in the shipped <b>lustre.conf </b>file for further details.
       By default, this file is installed with everything commented (and
       so it has no effect unless edited) because the built-in
       heuristics used by <b>pmdalustre </b>should suffice.

       Finally, overriding all of the above, the <b>LUSTRE_LLITE_PATH </b>and
       <b>LUSTRE_LNET_PATH </b>environment variables may be set (and exported)
       to specify the directory locations of the statistics interfaces
       to be used.  This mechanism using environment variables is
       intended to be used for development and testing purposes only.

       The <b>pmdalustre </b>process runs as the root user because <b>debugfs</b>
       directories are not normally readable by unprivileged users.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       Install <b>pmdalustre </b>by using the <b>Install </b>script as the root user:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre
            # ./Install

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdalustre </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/Install</b>
           installation script for the <b>pmdalustre </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/Remove</b>
           undo installation script for the <b>pmdalustre </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lustre.log</b>
           default log file for error messages from <b>pmdalustre</b>

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustre/lustre.conf</b>
           Configuration file for over-riding default statistics
           directories used by <b>pmdalustre</b>.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by <b>PCP</b>. On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
