NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-remote-add - Add a remote repository
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak remote-add </b>[OPTION...] NAME LOCATION
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Adds a remote repository to the flatpak repository configuration.
       NAME is the name for the new remote, and LOCATION is a url or
       pathname. The LOCATION is either a flatpak repository, or a
       .flatpakrepo file which describes a repository. In the former
       case you may also have to specify extra options, such as the gpg
       key for the repo.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user </b>or <b>--installation </b>options, this
       command changes the default system-wide installation.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>--from</b>
           Assume the URI is a .flatpakrepo file rather than the
           repository itself. This is enabled by default if the
           extension is .flatpakrepo, so generally you don't need this
           option.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Modify the per-user configuration.

       <b>--system</b>
           Modify the default system-wide configuration.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Modify a system-wide installation specified by NAME among
           those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
           <b>--installation=default </b>is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--no-gpg-verify</b>
           Disable GPG verification for the added remote.

       <b>--prio=PRIO</b>
           Set the priority for the remote. Default is 1, higher is more
           prioritized. This is mainly used for graphical installation
           tools. It is also used when searching for a remote to provide
           an app's runtime. The app's origin is checked before other
           remotes with the same priority.

       <b>--subset=SUBSET</b>
           Limit the refs available from the remote to those that are
           part of the named subset.

       <b>--no-enumerate</b>
           Mark the remote as not enumerated. This means the remote will
           not be used to list applications, for instance in graphical
           installation tools.

       <b>--no-use-for-deps</b>
           Mark the remote as not to be used for automatic runtime
           dependency resolution.

       <b>--if-not-exists</b>
           Do nothing if the provided remote already exists.

       <b>--disable</b>
           Disable the added remote.

       <b>--title=TITLE</b>
           A title for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI.

       <b>--comment=COMMENT</b>
           A single-line comment for the remote, e.g. for display in a
           UI.

       <b>--description=DESCRIPTION</b>
           A full-paragraph description for the remote, e.g. for display
           in a UI.

       <b>--homepage=URL</b>
           URL for a website for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI.

       <b>--icon=URL</b>
           URL for an icon for the remote, e.g. for display in a UI.

       <b>--default-branch=BRANCH</b>
           A default branch for the remote, mainly for use in a UI.

       <b>--filter=PATH</b>
           Add a local filter to the remote. A filter file is a list of
           lines, each file starting with "allow" or "deny", and then a
           glob for the ref to allow or disallow. The globs specify a
           partial ref (i.e. you can leave out trailing parts which will
           then match everything), but otherwise only "*" is special,
           matching anything in that part of the ref.

           By default all refs are allowed, but if a ref matches a deny
           rule it is disallowed unless it specifically matches an allow
           rule. This means you can use this to implement both
           allowlisting and blocklisting.

           Here is an example filter file:

               # This is an allowlist style filter as it denies all first
               deny *
               allow runtime/org.freedesktop.*
               allow org.some.app/arm
               allow org.signal.Signal/*/stable
               allow org.signal.Signal.*/*/stable

       <b>--gpg-import=FILE</b>
           Import gpg keys from the specified keyring file as trusted
           for the new remote. If the file is - the keyring is read from
           standard input.

       <b>--authenticator-name=NAME</b>
           Specify the authenticator to use for the remote.

       <b>--authenticator-option=KEY=VALUE</b>
           Specify an authenticator option for the remote.

       <b>--authenticator-install</b>
           Enable auto-installation of authenticator.

       <b>--no-authenticator-install</b>
           Disable auto-installation of authenticator.

       <b>--no-follow-redirect</b>
           Do not follow xa.redirect-url defined in the summary file.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
