PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pwd — return working directory name
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       pwd <b>[</b>-L|-P<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pwd</i> utility shall write to standard output an absolute
       pathname of the current working directory, which does not contain
       the filenames dot or dot-dot.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pwd</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-L        </b>If the <i>PWD</i> environment variable contains an absolute
                 pathname of the current directory and the pathname does
                 not contain any components that are dot or dot-dot, <i>pwd</i>
                 shall write this pathname to standard output, except
                 that if the <i>PWD</i> environment variable is longer than
                 {PATH_MAX} bytes including the terminating null, it is
                 unspecified whether <i>pwd</i> writes this pathname to
                 standard output or behaves as if the <b>-P </b>option had been
                 specified. Otherwise, the <b>-L </b>option shall behave as the
                 <b>-P </b>option.

       <b>-P        </b>The pathname written to standard output shall not
                 contain any components that refer to files of type
                 symbolic link. If there are multiple pathnames that the
                 <i>pwd</i> utility could write to standard output, one
                 beginning with a single &lt;slash&gt; character and one or
                 more beginning with two &lt;slash&gt; characters, then it
                 shall write the pathname beginning with a single
                 &lt;slash&gt; character. The pathname shall not contain any
                 unnecessary &lt;slash&gt; characters after the leading one or
                 two &lt;slash&gt; characters.

       If both <b>-L </b>and <b>-P </b>are specified, the last one shall apply. If
       neither <b>-L </b>nor <b>-P </b>is specified, the <i>pwd</i> utility shall behave as
       if <b>-L </b>had been specified.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>pwd</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>PWD</i>       An absolute pathname of the current working directory.
                 If an application sets or unsets the value of <i>PWD</i>, the
                 behavior of <i>pwd</i> is unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>pwd</i> utility output is an absolute pathname of the current
       working directory:

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>directory pathname</i>&gt;
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       If an error is detected, output shall not be written to standard
       output, a diagnostic message shall be written to standard error,
       and the exit status is not zero.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If the pathname obtained from <i>pwd</i> is longer than {PATH_MAX}
       bytes, it could produce an error if passed to <i>cd</i>.  Therefore, in
       order to return to that directory it may be necessary to break
       the pathname into sections shorter than {PATH_MAX} and call <i>cd</i> on
       each section in turn (the first section being an absolute
       pathname and subsequent sections being relative pathnames).
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Some implementations have historically provided <i>pwd</i> as a shell
       special built-in command.

       In most utilities, if an error occurs, partial output may be
       written to standard output. This does not happen in historical
       implementations of <i>pwd</i>.  Because <i>pwd</i> is frequently used in
       historical shell scripts without checking the exit status, it is
       important that the historical behavior is required here;
       therefore, the CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section specifically
       disallows any partial output being written to standard output.

       An earlier version of this standard stated that the <i>PWD</i>
       environment variable was affected when the <b>-P </b>option was in
       effect. This was incorrect; conforming implementations do not do
       this.
