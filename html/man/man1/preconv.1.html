Description </h2>
<pre>
       <i>preconv</i> reads each <i>file</i>, converts its encoded characters to a
       form <i>troff</i>(1) can interpret, and sends the result to the standard
       output stream.  Currently, this means that code points in the
       range 0–127 (in US-ASCII, ISO 8859, or Unicode) remain as-is and
       the remainder are converted to the <i>groff</i> special character form
       “<b>\[u</b><i>XXXX</i><b>]</b>”, where <i>XXXX</i> is a hexadecimal number of four to six
       digits corresponding to a Unicode code point.  By default,
       <i>preconv</i> also inserts a <i>roff</i> <b>.lf </b>request at the beginning of each
       <i>file</i>, identifying it for the benefit of later processing
       (including diagnostic messages); the <b>-r </b>option suppresses this
       behavior.

       In typical usage scenarios, <i>preconv</i> need not be run directly;
       instead it should be invoked with the <b>-k </b>or <b>-K </b>options of <i>groff</i>.
       If no <i>file</i> operands are present, or if <i>file</i> is “<b>-</b>”, <i>preconv</i> reads
       the standard input stream.

       <i>preconv</i> selects an input encoding with the following algorithm,
       stopping at the first success.

       1.  If the input encoding has been explicitly specified with
           option <b>-e</b>, use it.

       2.  If the input starts with a Unicode Byte Order Mark, select
           UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 accordingly.

       3.  If the input stream is seekable, check the first two input
           lines for a GNU Emacs file-local variable identifying the
           character encoding, here referred to as the “coding tag”.  If
           found, use it.

       4.  If the input stream is seekable, and if the <i>uchardet</i> library
           is available on the system, use it to try to infer the
           encoding of the file.

       5.  If the <b>-D </b>option specifies an encoding, use it.

       6.  Use the encoding specified by the current locale (<i>LC_CTYPE</i>),
           unless the locale is “C”, “POSIX”, or empty, in which case
           assume Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1).

       The coding tag and <i>uchardet</i> methods in the above procedure rely
       upon a seekable input stream; when <i>preconv</i> reads from a pipe, the
       stream is not seekable, and these detection methods are skipped.
       If character encoding detection of your input files is
       unreliable, arrange for one of the other methods to succeed by
       using <i>preconv</i>'s <b>-D </b>or <b>-e </b>options, or by configuring your locale
       appropriately.  <i>groff</i> also supports a <i>GROFF_ENCODING</i> environment
       variable, which can be overridden by its <b>-K </b>option.  Valid values
       for (or parameters to) all of these are enumerated in the lists
       of recognized coding tags in the next subsection, and are further
       influenced by <i>iconv</i> library support.

   <b>Coding tags</b>
       Text editors that support more than a single character encoding
       need tags within the input files to mark the file's encoding.
       While it is possible to guess the right input encoding with the
       help of heuristics that produce good results for a preponderance
       of natural language texts, they are not absolutely reliable.
       Heuristics can fail on inputs that are too short or don't
       represent a natural language.

       Consequently, <i>preconv</i> supports the coding tag convention used by
       GNU Emacs (with some restrictions).  This notation appears in
       specially marked regions of an input file designated for “file-
       local variables”.

       <i>preconv</i> interprets the following syntax if it occurs in a <i>roff</i>
       comment in the first or second line of the input file.  Both “\"”
       and “\#” comment forms are recognized, but the control (or no-
       break control) character must be the default and must begin the
       line.  Similarly, the escape character must be the default.
              <b>-*- </b>[...<b>;</b>] <b>coding: </b><i>encoding</i>[<b>; </b>...] <b>-*-</b>

       The only variable <i>preconv</i> interprets is “coding”, which can take
       the values listed below.

       The following list comprises all MIME “charset” parameter values
       recognized, case-insensitively, by <i>preconv</i>.
              big5, cp1047, euc-jp, euc-kr, gb2312, iso-8859-1,
              iso-8859-2, iso-8859-5, iso-8859-7, iso-8859-9,
              iso-8859-13, iso-8859-15, koi8-r, us-ascii, utf-8, utf-16,
              utf-16be, utf-16le

       In addition, the following list of other coding tags is
       recognized, each of which is mapped to an appropriate value from
       the list above.
              ascii, chinese-big5, chinese-euc, chinese-iso-8bit,
              cn-big5, cn-gb, cn-gb-2312, cp878, csascii, csisolatin1,
              cyrillic-iso-8bit, cyrillic-koi8, euc-china, euc-cn,
              euc-japan, euc-japan-1990, euc-korea, greek-iso-8bit,
              iso-10646/utf8, iso-10646/utf-8, iso-latin-1, iso-latin-2,
              iso-latin-5, iso-latin-7, iso-latin-9, japanese-euc,
              japanese-iso-8bit, jis8, koi8, korean-euc,
              korean-iso-8bit, latin-0, latin1, latin-1, latin-2,
              latin-5, latin-7, latin-9, mule-utf-8, mule-utf-16,
              mule-utf-16be, mule-utf-16-be,
              mule-utf-16be-with-signature, mule-utf-16le,
              mule-utf-16-le, mule-utf-16le-with-signature, utf8,
              utf-16-be, utf-16-be-with-signature,
              utf-16be-with-signature, utf-16-le,
              utf-16-le-with-signature, utf-16le-with-signature

       Any “-dos”, “-unix”, or “-mac” suffix on a coding tag (which
       indicates the end-of-line convention used in the file) is ignored
       during comparison with the above tags.

   [1miconv[24m support
       While <i>preconv</i> recognizes all of the coding tags listed above, it
       is capable on its own of interpreting only three encodings:
       Latin-1, code page 1047, and UTF-8.  If <i>iconv</i> support is
       configured at compile time and available at run time, all others
       are passed to <i>iconv</i> library functions, which may recognize many
       additional encoding strings.  The command “<b>preconv -v</b>” discloses
       whether <i>iconv</i> support is configured.

       The use of <i>iconv</i> means that characters in the input that encode
       invalid code points for that encoding may be dropped from the
       output stream or mapped to the Unicode replacement character
       (U+FFFD).  Compare the following examples using the input “café”
       (note the “e” with an acute accent), which due to its short
       length challenges inference of the encoding used.
              printf 'caf\351\n' | LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 preconv
              printf 'caf\351\n' | preconv -e us-ascii
              printf 'caf\351\n' | preconv -e latin-1
       The fate of the accented “e” differs in each case.  In the first,
       <i>uchardet</i> fails to detect an encoding (though the library on your
       system may behave differently) and <i>preconv</i> falls back to the
       locale settings, where octal 351 starts an incomplete UTF-8
       sequence and results in the Unicode replacement character.  In
       the second, it is not a representable character in the declared
       input encoding of US-ASCII and is discarded by <i>iconv</i>.  In the
       last, it is correctly detected and mapped.

   <b>Limitations</b>
       <i>preconv</i> cannot perform any transformation on input that it cannot
       see.  Examples include files that are interpolated by
       preprocessors that run subsequently, including <i>soelim</i>(1); files
       included by <i>troff</i> itself through “<b>so</b>” and similar requests; and
       string definitions passed to <i>troff</i> through its <b>-d </b>command-line
       option.

       <i>preconv</i> assumes that its input uses the default escape character,
       a backslash <b>\</b>, and writes special character escape sequences
       accordingly.
