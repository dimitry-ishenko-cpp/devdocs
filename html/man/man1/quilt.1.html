DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Quilt</i> is a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping track
       of the changes each patch makes.  Patches can be applied,
       unapplied, refreshed, and so forth.  The key philosophical
       concept is that your primary working material is patches.

       With <i>quilt</i>, all work occurs within a single directory tree.
       Commands can be invoked from anywhere within the source tree.
       Like <i>CVS</i>, <i>Subversion</i>, or <i>Git</i>, <i>quilt</i> takes commands of the form
       “quilt <i>command</i>”.  A command can be truncated (abbreviated) as
       long as the specified part of the command is unambiguous.  If
       <i>command</i> is ambiguously short, <i>quilt</i> lists all commands matching
       that prefix and exits.  All commands print a brief contextual
       help message and exit if given the “-h” option.

       <i>Quilt</i> manages a stack of patches.  Patches are applied
       incrementally on top of the base tree plus all preceding patches.
       They can be pushed onto the stack (“quilt push”), and popped off
       the stack (“quilt pop”).  Commands are available for querying the
       contents of the stack (“quilt applied”, “quilt previous”, “quilt
       top”) and the patches that are not applied at a particular moment
       (“quilt next”, “quilt unapplied”).  By default, most commands
       apply to the topmost patch on the stack.

       Patch files are located in the <i>patches</i> subdirectory of the source
       tree (see <b>Example of working tree</b>, under <b>FILES</b>, below).  The
       <i>QUILT_PATCHES</i> environment variable overrides this default
       location.  When not found in the current directory, that
       subdirectory is searched recursively in the parent directories
       (this is similar to the way <i>Git</i> searches for its configuration
       files).  The <i>patches</i> directory may contain subdirectories.  It
       may also be a symbolic link instead of a directory.

       <i>Quilt</i> creates and maintains a file called <i>series</i>, which defines
       the order in which patches are applied.  The <i>QUILT_SERIES</i>
       environment variable overrides this default name.  You can query
       the contents of the series file at any time with “quilt series”.
       In this file, each patch file name is on a separate line.  Patch
       files are identified by path names that are relative to the
       <i>patches</i> directory; patches may be in subdirectories below this
       directory.  Lines in the series file that start with a hash
       character (#) are ignored.  Patch options, such as the strip
       level or whether the patch is reversed, can be added after each
       patch file name.  Options are introduced by a space, separated by
       spaces, and follow the syntax of the patch(1) options (e.g.,
       “-p2”).  Quilt records patch options automatically when a command
       supporting them is used.  Without options, strip level 1 is
       assumed.  You can also add a comment after each patch file name
       and options, introduced by a space followed by a hash character.
       When <i>quilt</i> adds, removes, or renames patches, it automatically
       updates the series file.  Users of <i>quilt</i> can modify series files
       while some patches are applied, as long as the applied patches
       remain in their original order.  Unless there are means by which
       a series file can be generated automatically, you should provide
       it along with any set of <i>quilt</i>-managed patches you distribute.
       Different series files can be used to assemble patches in
       different ways, corresponding (for example) to different
       development branches.

       Before a patch is applied, copies of all files the patch modifies
       are saved to the <i>.pc/</i>patch-name directory, where <i>patch-name</i> is
       the name of the patch (for example, <i>fix-buffer-overflow.patch</i>).
       The patch is added to the list of currently applied patches
       (<i>.pc/applied-patches</i>).  Later, when a patch is regenerated
       (“quilt refresh”), the backup copies in <i>.pc/</i>patch-name are
       compared with the current versions of the files in the source
       tree using GNU <a href="diff.1.html">diff(1)</a>.

       A similar process occurs when starting a new patch (“quilt new”);
       the new patch file name is added to the series file.  A file to
       be changed by the patch is backed up and opened for editing
       (“quilt edit”).  After editing, inspect the impact of your
       changes (“quilt diff”); the changes stay local to your working
       tree until you call “quilt refresh” to write them to the patch
       file.

       Documentation related to a patch can be put at the beginning of
       its patch file (“quilt header”).  <i>Quilt</i> is careful to preserve
       all text that precedes the actual patch when doing a refresh.
       (This is limited to patches in unified format; see the GNU
       <i>Diffutils</i> manual.)

       The series file is looked up in the <i>.pc</i> directory, in the root of
       the source tree, and in the patches directory.  The first series
       file that is found is used.  This may also be a symbolic link, or
       a file with multiple hard links.  Usually, only one series file
       is used for a set of patches, making the patches subdirectory a
       convenient location.

       The <i>.pc</i> directory cannot be relocated, but it can be a symbolic
       link.  Its subdirectories must not be renamed or restructured.
       While patches are applied to the source tree, this directory is
       essential for many operations, including popping patches off the
       stack and refreshing them.  Files in the <i>.pc</i> directory are
       automatically removed when they are no longer needed, so there is
       no need to clean up manually.

   <b>Quilt commands reference</b>
       <b>add </b>[-P patch] {file} ...

           Add one or more files to the topmost or named patch.  Files
           must be added to the patch before being modified.  Files that
           are modified by patches already applied on top of the
           specified patch cannot be added.

           -P patch

               Patch to add files to.

       <b>annotate </b>[-P patch] {file}

           Print an annotated listing of the specified file showing
           which patches modify which lines. Only applied patches are
           included.

           -P patch

               Stop checking for changes at the specified rather than
               the topmost patch.

       <b>applied </b>[patch]

           Print a list of applied patches, or all patches up to and
           including the specified patch in the file series.

       <b>delete </b>[-r] [--backup] [patch|-n]

           Remove the specified or topmost patch from the series file.
           If the patch is applied, quilt will attempt to remove it
           first. (Only the topmost patch can be removed right now.)

           -n  Delete the next patch after topmost, rather than the
               specified or topmost patch.

           -r  Remove the deleted patch file from the patches directory
               as well.

           --backup

               Rename the patch file to patch~ rather than deleting it.
               Ignored if not used with `-r'.

       <b>diff </b>[-p n|-p ab] [-u|-U num|-c|-C num] [--combine patch|-z] [-R]
       [-P patch] [--snapshot] [--diff=utility] [--no-timestamps] [--no-
       index] [--sort] [--color[=always|auto|never]] [file ...]

           Produces a diff of the specified file(s) in the topmost or
           specified patch.  If no files are specified, all files that
           are modified are included.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).

           -p ab
               Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as
               the original and new filenames instead of the default
               dir.orig/file and dir/file names.

           -u, -U num, -c, -C num

               Create a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context.
               Create a context diff (-c, -C) with num lines of context.
               The number of context lines defaults to 3.

           --no-timestamps

               Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.

           --no-index

               Do not output Index: lines.

           -z  Write to standard output the changes that have been made
               relative to the topmost or specified patch.

           -R  Create a reverse diff.

           -P patch

               Create a diff for the specified patch.  (Defaults to the
               topmost patch.)

           --combine patch

               Create a combined diff for all patches between this patch
               and the patch specified with -P. A patch name of `-' is
               equivalent to specifying the first applied patch.

           --snapshot

               Diff against snapshot (see `quilt snapshot -h').

           --diff=utility

               Use the specified utility for generating the diff. The
               utility is invoked with the original and new file name as
               arguments.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output
               is a tty).

           --sort
               Sort files by their name instead of preserving the
               original order.

       <b>edit </b>file ...

           Edit the specified file(s) in $EDITOR after adding it (them)
           to the topmost patch.

       <b>files </b>[-v] [-a] [-l] [--combine patch] [patch]

           Print the list of files that the topmost or specified patch
           changes.

           -a  List all files in all applied patches.

           -l  Add patch name to output.

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

           --combine patch

               Create a listing for all patches between this patch and
               the topmost or specified patch. A patch name of `-' is
               equivalent to specifying the first applied patch.

       <b>fold </b>[-R] [-q] [-f] [-p strip-level]

           Integrate the patch read from standard input into the topmost
           patch: After making sure that all files modified are part of
           the topmost patch, the patch is applied with the specified
           strip level (which defaults to 1).

           -R  Apply patch in reverse.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -f  Force apply, even if the patch has rejects. Unless in
               quiet mode, apply the patch interactively: the patch
               utility may ask questions.

           -p strip-level

               The number of pathname components to strip from file
               names when applying patchfile.

       <b>fork </b>[new_name]

           Fork the topmost patch.  Forking a patch means creating a
           verbatim copy of it under a new name, and use that new name
           instead of the original one in the current series.  This is
           useful when a patch has to be modified, but the original
           version of it should be preserved, e.g.  because it is used
           in another series, or for the history.  A typical sequence of
           commands would be: fork, edit, refresh.

           If new_name is missing, the name of the forked patch will be
           the current patch name, followed by `-2'.  If the patch name
           already ends in a dash-and-number, the number is further
           incremented (e.g., patch.diff, patch-2.diff, patch-3.diff).

       <b>graph </b>[--all] [--reduce] [--lines[=num]] [--edge-labels=files]
       [-T ps] [patch]

           Generate a dot(1) directed graph showing the dependencies
           between applied patches. A patch depends on another patch if
           both touch the same file or, with the --lines option, if
           their modifications overlap. Unless otherwise specified, the
           graph includes all patches that the topmost patch depends on.
           When a patch name is specified, instead of the topmost patch,
           create a graph for the specified patch. The graph will
           include all other patches that this patch depends on, as well
           as all patches that depend on this patch.

           --all
               Generate a graph including all applied patches and their
               dependencies. (Unapplied patches are not included.)

           --reduce

               Eliminate transitive edges from the graph.

           --lines[=num]

               Compute dependencies by looking at the lines the patches
               modify.  Unless a different num is specified, two lines
               of context are included.

           --edge-labels=files

               Label graph edges with the file names that the adjacent
               patches modify.

           -T ps
               Directly produce a PostScript output file.

       <b>grep </b>[-h|options] {pattern}

           Grep through the source files, recursively, skipping patches
           and quilt meta-information. If no filename argument is given,
           the whole source tree is searched. Please see the grep(1)
           manual page for options.

           -h  Print this help. The grep -h option can be passed after a
               double-dash (--). Search expressions that start with a
               dash can be passed after a second double-dash (-- --).

       <b>header </b>[-a|-r|-e] [--backup] [--strip-diffstat] [--strip-
       trailing-whitespace] [patch]

           Print or change the header of the topmost or specified patch.

           -a, -r, -e

               Append to (-a) or replace (-r) the exiting patch header,
               or edit (-e) the header in $EDITOR. If none of these
               options is given, print the patch header.

           --strip-diffstat

               Strip diffstat output from the header.

           --strip-trailing-whitespace

               Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines of the
               header.

           --backup

               Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as
               patch~.

       <b>import </b>[-p num] [-R] [-P patch] [-f] [-d {o|a|n}] patchfile ...

           Import external patches.  The patches will be inserted
           following the current top patch, and must be pushed after
           import to apply them.

           -p num

               Number of directory levels to strip when applying
               (default=1)

           -R

               Apply patch in reverse.

           -P patch

               Patch filename to use inside quilt. This option can only
               be used when importing a single patch.

           -f  Overwrite/update existing patches.

           -d {o|a|n}

               When overwriting in existing patch, keep the old (o), all
               (a), or new (n) patch header. If both patches include
               headers, this option must be specified. This option is
               only effective when -f is used.

       <b>mail </b>{--mbox file|--send} [-m text] [-M file] [--prefix prefix]
       [--sender ...] [--from ...] [--to ...] [--cc ...] [--bcc ...]
       [--subject ...] [--reply-to message] [--charset ...] [--signature
       file] [first_patch [last_patch]]

           Create mail messages from a specified range of patches, or
           all patches in the series file, and either store them in a
           mailbox file, or send them immediately. The editor is opened
           with a template for the introduction.  Please see
           /usr/local/share/doc/quilt/README.MAIL for details.  When
           specifying a range of patches, a first patch name of `-'
           denotes the first, and a last patch name of `-' denotes the
           last patch in the series.

           -m text

               Text to use as the text in the introduction. When this
               option is used, the editor will not be invoked, and the
               patches will be processed immediately.

           -M file

               Like the -m option, but read the introduction from file.

           --prefix prefix

               Use an alternate prefix in the bracketed part of the
               subjects generated. Defaults to `patch'.

           --mbox file

               Store all messages in the specified file in mbox format.
               The mbox can later be sent using formail, for example.

           --send

               Send the messages directly.

           --sender

               The envelope sender address to use. The address must be
               of the form `user@domain.name'. No display name is
               allowed.

           --from, --subject

               The values for the From and Subject headers to use. If no
               --from option is given, the value of the --sender option
               is used.

           --to, --cc, --bcc

               Append a recipient to the To, Cc, or Bcc header.

           --charset

               Specify a particular message encoding on systems which
               don't use UTF-8 or ISO-8859-15. This character encoding
               must match the one used in the patches.

           --signature file

               Append the specified signature to messages (defaults to
               ~/.signature if found; use `-' for no signature).

           --reply-to message

               Add the appropriate headers to reply to the specified
               message.

       <b>new </b>[-p n|-p ab] {patchname}

           Create a new patch with the specified file name, and insert
           it after the topmost patch. The name can be prefixed with a
           sub-directory name, allowing for grouping related patches
           together.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 are supported).

           -p ab
               Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as
               the original and new filenames instead of the default
               dir.orig/file and dir/file names.

               Quilt can be used in sub-directories of a source tree. It
               determines the root of a source tree by searching for a
               directory above the current working directory. Create a
               directory in the intended root directory if quilt chooses
               a top-level directory that is too high up in the
               directory tree.

       <b>next </b>[patch]

           Print the name of the next patch after the specified or
           topmost patch in the series file.

       <b>patches </b>[-v] [--color[=always|auto|never]] {file} [files...]

           Print the list of patches that modify any of the specified
           files. (Uses a heuristic to determine which files are
           modified by unapplied patches.  Note that this heuristic is
           much slower than scanning applied patches.)

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output
               is a tty).

       <b>pop </b>[-afRqv] [--refresh] [num|patch]

           Remove patch(es) from the stack of applied patches.  Without
           options, the topmost patch is removed.  When a number is
           specified, remove the specified number of patches.  When a
           patch name is specified, remove patches until the specified
           patch end up on top of the stack.  Patch names may include
           the patches/ prefix, which means that filename completion can
           be used.

           -a  Remove all applied patches.

           -f  Force remove. The state before the patch(es) were applied
               will be restored from backup files.

           -R  Always verify if the patch removes cleanly; don't rely on
               timestamp checks.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -v  Verbose operation.

           --refresh

               Automatically refresh every patch before it gets
               unapplied.

       <b>previous </b>[patch]

           Print the name of the previous patch before the specified or
           topmost patch in the series file.

       <b>push </b>[-afqvm] [--fuzz=N] [--merge[=merge|diff3]] [--leave-
       rejects] [--color[=always|auto|never]] [--refresh] [num|patch]

           Apply patch(es) from the series file.  Without options, the
           next patch in the series file is applied.  When a number is
           specified, apply the specified number of patches.  When a
           patch name is specified, apply all patches up to and
           including the specified patch.  Patch names may include the
           patches/ prefix, which means that filename completion can be
           used.

           -a  Apply all patches in the series file.

           -q  Quiet operation.

           -f  Force apply, even if the patch has rejects.

           -v  Verbose operation.

           --fuzz=N

               Set the maximum fuzz factor (default: 2).

           -m, --merge[=merge|diff3]

               Merge the patch file into the original files (see
               patch(1)).

           --leave-rejects

               Leave around the reject files patch produced, even if the
               patch is not actually applied.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output
               is a tty).

           --refresh

               Automatically refresh every patch after it was
               successfully applied.

       <b>refresh </b>[-p n|-p ab] [-u|-U num|-c|-C num] [-z[new_name]] [-f]
       [--no-timestamps] [--no-index] [--diffstat] [--sort] [--backup]
       [--strip-trailing-whitespace] [patch]

           Refreshes the specified patch, or the topmost patch by
           default.  Documentation that comes before the actual patch in
           the patch file is retained.

           It is possible to refresh patches that are not on top.  If
           any patches on top of the patch to refresh modify the same
           files, the script aborts by default.  Patches can still be
           refreshed with -f.  In that case this script will print a
           warning for each shadowed file, changes by more recent
           patches will be ignored, and only changes in files that have
           not been modified by any more recent patches will end up in
           the specified patch.

           -p n
               Create a -p n style patch (-p0 or -p1 supported).

           -p ab
               Create a -p1 style patch, but use a/file and b/file as
               the original and new filenames instead of the default
               dir.orig/file and dir/file names.

           -u, -U num, -c, -C num

               Create a unified diff (-u, -U) with num lines of context.
               Create a context diff (-c, -C) with num lines of context.
               The number of context lines defaults to 3.

           -z[new_name]

               Create a new patch containing the changes instead of
               refreshing the topmost patch. If no new name is
               specified, `-2' is added to the original patch name, etc.
               (See the fork command.)

           --no-timestamps

               Do not include file timestamps in patch headers.

           --no-index

               Do not output Index: lines.

           --diffstat

               Add a diffstat section to the patch header, or replace
               the existing diffstat section.

           -f  Enforce refreshing of a patch that is not on top.

           --backup

               Create a backup copy of the old version of a patch as
               patch~.

           --sort
               Sort files by their name instead of preserving the
               original order.

           --strip-trailing-whitespace

               Strip trailing whitespace at the end of lines.

       <b>remove </b>[-P patch] {file} ...

           Remove one or more files from the topmost or named patch.
           Files that are modified by patches on top of the specified
           patch cannot be removed.

           -P patch

               Remove named files from the named patch.

       <b>rename </b>[-P patch] new_name

           Rename the topmost or named patch.

           -P patch

               Patch to rename.

       <b>revert </b>[-P patch] {file} ...

           Revert uncommitted changes to the topmost or named patch for
           the specified file(s): after the revert, 'quilt diff -z' will
           show no differences for those files. Changes to files that
           are modified by patches on top of the specified patch cannot
           be reverted.

           -P patch

               Revert changes in the named patch.

       <b>series </b>[--color[=always|auto|never]] [-v]

           Print the names of all patches in the series file.

           --color[=always|auto|never]

               Use syntax coloring (auto activates it only if the output
               is a tty).

           -v  Verbose, more user friendly output.

       <b>setup </b>[-d path-prefix] [-v] [--sourcedir dir] [--fuzz=N]
       [--slow|--fast] {specfile|seriesfile}

           Initializes a source tree from an rpm spec file or a quilt
           series file.

           -d  Optional path prefix for the resulting source tree.

           --sourcedir

               Directory that contains the package sources. Defaults to
               `.'.

           -v  Verbose debug output.

           --fuzz=N

               Set the maximum fuzz factor (needs rpm 4.6 or later).

           --slow
               Use the original, slow method to process the spec file.
               In this mode, rpmbuild generates a working tree in a
               temporary directory while all its actions are recorded,
               and then everything is replayed from scratch in the
               target directory.

           --fast
               Use the new, faster method to process the spec file. In
               this mode, rpmbuild is told to generate a working tree
               directly in the target directory. This is the default
               (since quilt version 0.67).

               The setup command is only guaranteed to work properly on
               spec files where applying all the patches is the last
               thing done in the %prep section. This is a design
               limitation due to the fact that quilt can only operate on
               patches. If other commands in the %prep section modify
               the patched files, they must come first, otherwise you
               won't be able to push the patch series.

               For example, a %prep section where you first unpack a
               tarball, then apply patches, and lastly perform a tree-
               wide string substitution, is not OK. For "quilt setup" to
               work, it would have to be changed to unpacking the
               tarball, then performing the tree-wide string
               substitution, and lastly applying the patches.

       <b>snapshot </b>[-d]

           Take a snapshot of the current working state.  After taking
           the snapshot, the tree can be modified in the usual ways,
           including pushing and popping patches.  A diff against the
           tree at the moment of the snapshot can be generated with
           `quilt diff --snapshot'.

           -d  Only remove current snapshot.

       <b>top</b>

           Print the name of the topmost patch on the current stack of
           applied patches.

       <b>unapplied </b>[patch]

           Print a list of patches that are not applied, or all patches
           that follow the specified patch in the series file.

       <b>upgrade</b>

           Upgrade the meta-data in a working tree from an old version
           of quilt to the current version. This command is only needed
           when the quilt meta-data format has changed, and the working
           tree still contains old-format meta-data. In that case, quilt
           will request to run `quilt upgrade'.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       These options are common to all <i>quilt</i> commands.

       <b>-h     </b>Print a usage message (for the given <i>command</i>, if one is
              specified, otherwise for <i>quilt</i> itself) and exit.

       <b>--quiltrc </b><i>file</i>
              Use <i>file</i> as the configuration file instead of <i>~/.quiltrc</i>
              (or <i>/etc/quilt.quiltrc</i> if <i>~/.quiltrc</i> does not exist).  The
              special value “-” causes <i>quilt</i> not to read any
              configuration file.

       <b>--trace</b>
              Run the command in the shell's trace mode (-x) for
              debugging of internal operations.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number and exit.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The exit status is 0 if the requested operation completed
       successfully, or 1 in case of error.

       An exit status of 2 indicates that <i>quilt</i> did not do anything to
       complete the command.  This happens in particular when asking
       <i>quilt</i> to push when the whole stack is already pushed, or to pop
       when the whole stack is already popped.  This behavior is
       intended to ease scripting with <i>quilt</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Quilt</i> recognizes the following variables:

       <i>EDITOR</i>
           Specify the program to run to edit files; for instance, with
           “quilt edit” or “quilt header -e”.

       <i>LESS</i>
           Specify the arguments used to invoke the <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> pager.
           Defaults to “-FRSX”.

       The <i>patches</i> directory is precious as it contains all your patches
       as well as the order in which they should be applied.

       The <i>.pc</i> directory contains metadata about the current state of
       your patch series.  Changing its content is not advised.  This
       directory can usually be regenerated from the initial files and
       the content of the <i>patches</i> directory (provided that all patches
       were regenerated before the removal).

   <b>Configuration file</b>
       Upon startup, <i>quilt</i> evaluates the file specified with the
       “--quiltrc” option; if that option is not given, the file
       <i>.quiltrc</i> in the user's home directory is used, and if that does
       not exist, <i>/etc/quilt.quiltrc</i> is read.  This file is a <a href="bash.1.html">bash(1)</a>
       script.  <i>EDITOR</i> and <i>LESS</i> can be overridden here if desired; see
       <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>, above.

       Define a variable of the form <i>QUILT_</i>COMMAND<i>_ARGS</i> to specify
       default options to be passed to any <i>quilt</i> command (in uppercase).
       For example,
              QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color=auto"
       causes the output of “quilt diff” to be syntax-colored when
       writing to a terminal.

       <i>QUILT_DIFF_OPTS</i>
           Additional options that <i>quilt</i> shall pass to GNU <i>diff</i> when
           generating patches.  A useful setting for C source code is
           “-p”, which causes GNU <i>diff</i> to show in the resulting patch
           which function a change is in.

       <i>QUILT_PATCH_OPTS</i>
           Additional options that <i>quilt</i> shall pass to GNU <i>patch</i> when
           applying patches.  For example, recent versions of GNU <i>patch</i>
           support the “--reject-format=unified” option for generating
           reject files in “unified diff” style (older <i>patch</i> versions
           used “--unified-reject-files” for that).

           You may also want to add the “-E” option if you have issues
           with <i>quilt</i> not deleting empty files when you think it should.
           The documentation of GNU <i>patch</i> says that “normally this
           option is unnecessary”, but when <i>patch</i> is in POSIX mode or if
           the patch format doesn't distinguish empty files from deleted
           files, <i>patch</i> deletes empty files only if the “-E” option is
           given.  Beware that when passing “-E” to <i>patch</i>, <i>quilt</i> will no
           longer be able to deal with empty files, which is why using
           “-E” is no longer the default.

       <i>QUILT_DIFFSTAT_OPTS</i>
           indicates additional options that <i>quilt</i> shall pass to
           <b>diffstat</b>(1) when generating patch statistics.  For example,
           “-f0” can be used for an alternative output format.  Recent
           versions of <i>diffstat</i> also support alternative rounding
           methods (“-r1”, “-r2”).

       <i>QUILT_PC</i>
           The location of backup files and any other data relating to
           the current state of the working directory from <i>quilt</i>'s
           perspective.  Defaults to “.pc”.

       <i>QUILT_PATCHES</i>
           The location of patch files, defaulting to <i>patches</i>.

       <i>QUILT_SERIES</i>
           The name of the series file, defaulting to <i>series</i>.  Unless an
           absolute path is used, the search algorithm described above
           applies.

       <i>QUILT_PATCHES_PREFIX</i>
           Boolean flag; if set to anything, <i>quilt</i> will prefix any patch
           name it prints with its directory (<i>QUILT_PATCHES</i>).

       <i>QUILT_NO_DIFF_INDEX</i>
           Boolean flag; if set to anything, no “Index:” line is
           prepended to patches generated by <i>quilt</i>.  This is shorthand
           for adding “--no-index” to both <i>QUILT_DIFF_ARGS</i> and
           <i>QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS</i>.

       <i>QUILT_NO_DIFF_TIMESTAMPS</i>
           Boolean flag; if set to anything, no timestamps are included
           in headers when generating patches.  This is shorthand for
           adding “--no-timestamps” to both <i>QUILT_DIFF_ARGS</i> and
           <i>QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS</i>.

       <i>QUILT_PAGER</i>
           The pager <i>quilt</i> shall use for commands which produce
           paginated output.  If unset, the value of <i>GIT_PAGER</i> or,
           failing that, <i>PAGER</i> is used.  If none of these variables is
           set, “less -R” is used.  An empty value indicates that no
           pager should be used.

       <i>QUILT_COLORS</i>
           A sequence of definitions that directs <i>quilt</i> which ANSI
           escape sequences to associate with an output context,
           overriding the defaults.  The most common use is to set
           colors (thus the name of this variable), but other attributes
           exist, such as bold or reverse.

           To override one or more settings, set <i>QUILT_COLORS</i> to a
           colon-separated list of elements, each of the form “<i>format-</i>
           <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>digit-sequence</i>[<b>;</b>...]”.

           Each <i>digit-sequence</i> should be a SGR (Select Graphic
           Rendition) value supported by your terminal.  The
           standardized SGR values were specified by ANSI and
           incorporated into ISO-6429 and ECMA-48 (§8.3.117).  The
           colors have standard names but their values were not defined
           within a color space; their precise appearance will vary and
           may be customizable in your terminal (emulator).

           Recognized <i>format-name</i>s, along with the <i>quilt</i> commands that
           use them, their use contexts, and default values, follow.
           ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
           │ <i>format-name</i>   command   context                 default      │

           └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

           All <i>format-name</i>s used by the series command are also used by
           the patches command.

           The special <i>format-name</i> “clear” is used to turn off special
           graphic renditions and return to the terminal defaults.
           Changing its definition should not be necessary for any
           terminal that claims to support ANSI escape sequences.  If
           your terminal is corrupted despite your best efforts, try the
           command “tput sgr0” to restore the default graphic rendition.

           As an example, one can put the following in <i>~/.quiltrc</i> (or
           <i>/etc/quilt.quiltrc</i>):
                   QUILT_DIFF_ARGS="--color"
                   # Render diff file headers in bold blue over yellow.
                   # Render diff hunk headers in "negative image" yellow.
                   # Render failed patches with a red background.
                   QUILT_COLORS="diff_hdr=1;34;43:diff_hunk=7;33:patch_fail=41"

AUTHORS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Quilt</i> started as a series of scripts written by Andrew Morton
       (<i>patch-scripts</i>).  Based on Andrew's ideas, Andreas Grünbacher
       completely rewrote the scripts, with the help of several other
