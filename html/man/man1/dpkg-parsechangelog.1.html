NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dpkg-parsechangelog - parse Debian changelog files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-parsechangelog </b>[<i>option</i>...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dpkg-parsechangelog </b>reads and parses the changelog of an unpacked
       Debian source tree and outputs the information in it to standard
       output in a machine-readable form.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-l</b>, <b>--file </b><i>changelog-file</i>
           Specifies the changelog file to read information from.  A ‘-’
           can be used to specify reading from standard input.  The
           default is <b>debian/changelog</b>.

       <b>-F </b><i>changelog-format</i>
           Specifies the format of the changelog.  By default the format
           is read from a special line near the bottom of the changelog
           or failing that defaults to the <b>debian </b>standard format.  See
           also "CHANGELOG FORMATS".

       <b>-L </b><i>libdir</i>
           Obsolete option without effect (since dpkg 1.18.8).  Setting
           the perl environment variables <b>PERL5LIB </b>or <b>PERLLIB </b>has a
           similar effect when looking for the parser perl modules.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--show-field </b><i>field</i>
           Specifies the name of the field to show (since dpkg 1.17.0).
           The field name is not printed, only its value.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show the usage message and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the version and exit.

   <b>Parser Options</b>
       The following options can be used to influence the output of the
       changelog parser, for example the range of entries or the format
       of the output.

       <b>--format </b><i>output-format</i>
           Set the output format.  Currently supported values are <b>dpkg</b>
           and <b>rfc822</b>.  <b>dpkg </b>is the classic output format (from before
           this option existed) and the default.  It consists of one
           stanza in Debian control format (see <a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control(5)</a>).  If
           more than one entry is requested, then most fields are taken
           from the first entry (usually the most recent entry), except
           otherwise stated:

           <b>Source: </b><i>pkg-name</i>
               The source package name.

           <b>Version: </b><i>version</i>
               The source version number.  <b>Note</b>: For binary-only
               releases there might be no corresponding source release.

           <b>Distribution: </b><i>target-distribution</i>
               A space-separated list of one or more distribution names
               where this version should be installed when it is
               uploaded.

           <b>Urgency: </b><i>urgency</i>
               The highest urgency of all included entries is used,
               followed by the concatenated (space-separated) comments
               from all the versions requested.

           <b>Maintainer: </b><i>author</i>
               The name and email address of the person who prepared
               these changes, they are <b>not </b>necessarily those of the
               uploader or the usual package maintainer.

           <b>Date: </b><i>date</i>
               The date of the entry as a string, as it appears in the
               changelog.  With a <a href="../man3/strptime.3.html">strptime(3)</a> format "<b>%a, %d %b %Y %T</b>
               <b>%z</b>", but where the day of the week might not actually
               correspond to the real day obtained from the rest of the
               date string.  If you need a more accurate representation
               of the date, use the <b>Timestamp </b>field, but take into
               account it might not be possible to map it back to the
               exact value in this field.

           <b>Timestamp: </b><i>timestamp</i>
               The date of the entry as a timestamp in seconds since the
               epoch (since dpkg 1.18.8).

           <b>Closes: </b><i>bug-number</i>
               The Closes fields of all included entries are merged.

           <b>Changes: </b><i>changelog-entries</i>
               The text of all changelog entries is concatenated.  To
               make this field a valid Debian control format multiline
               field empty lines are replaced with a single full stop
               and all lines is intended by one space character.  The
               exact content depends on the changelog format.

           The <b>Version</b>, <b>Distribution</b>, <b>Urgency</b>, <b>Maintainer </b>and <b>Changes</b>
           fields are mandatory.

           There might be additional user-defined fields present.

           The <b>rfc822 </b>format uses the same fields but outputs a separate
           stanza for each changelog entry so that all metadata for each
           entry is preserved.

       <b>--reverse</b>
           Include all changes in reverse order (since dpkg 1.19.1).

           <b>Note</b>: For the <b>dpkg </b>format the first entry will be the most
           ancient entry.

       <b>--all</b>
           Include all changes.  <b>Note</b>: Other options have no effect when
           this is in use.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--since </b><i>version</i>
       <b>-v </b><i>version</i>
           Include all changes later than <i>version</i>.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--until </b><i>version</i>
           Include all changes earlier than <i>version</i>.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--from </b><i>version</i>
           Include all changes equal or later than <i>version</i>.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--to </b><i>version</i>
           Include all changes up to or equal than <i>version</i>.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--count </b><i>number</i>
       <b>-n </b><i>number</i>
           Include <i>number</i> entries from the top (or the tail if <i>number</i> is
           lower than 0).

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--offset </b><i>number</i>
           Change the starting point for <b>--count</b>, counted from the top
           (or the tail if <i>number</i> is lower than 0).
</pre> <h2>
CHANGELOG FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       It is possible to use a different format to the standard one, by
       providing a parser for that alternative format.

       In order to have <b>dpkg-parsechangelog </b>run the new parser, a line
       must be included within the last 40 lines of the changelog file,
       matching the Perl regular expression:
       “<b>\schangelog-format:\s+([0-9a-z]+)\W</b>”.  The part in parentheses
       should be the name of the format.  For example:

           @@@ changelog-format: <i>otherformat</i> @@@

       Changelog format names are non-empty strings of lowercase
       alphanumerics (“a-z0-9”).

       If such a line exists then <b>dpkg-parsechangelog </b>will look for the
       parser as a <b>Dpkg::Changelog::</b><i>Otherformat</i> perl module; it is an
       error for it not being present.  The parser name in the perl
       module will be automatically capitalized.  The default changelog
       format is <b>debian</b>, and a parser for it is provided by default.

       The parser should be derived from the Dpkg::Changelog class and
       implement the required documented interface.

       If the changelog format which is being parsed always or almost
       always leaves a blank line between individual change notes, these
       blank lines should be stripped out, so as to make the resulting
       output compact.

       If the changelog format does not contain date or package name
       information this information should be omitted from the output.
       The parser should not attempt to synthesize it or find it from
       other sources.

       If the changelog does not have the expected format the parser
       should error out, rather than trying to muddle through and
       possibly generating incorrect output.

       A changelog parser may not interact with the user at all.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       All <b>Parser Options </b>except for <b>-v </b>are only supported since dpkg
       1.14.16.

       Short option parsing with non-bundled values available only since
       dpkg 1.18.0.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.

       <b>DPKG_NLS</b>
           If set, it will be used to decide whether to activate Native
           Language Support, also known as internationalization (or
           i18n) support (since dpkg 1.19.0).  The accepted values are:
           <b>0 </b>and <b>1 </b>(default).
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>debian/changelog</b>
           The changelog file, used to obtain version-dependent
           information about the source package, such as the urgency and
           distribution of an upload, the changes made since a
           particular release, and the source version number itself.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>Maintainer </b>field has a confusing name matching the field in
       the <i>debian/control</i> file but not its exact semantics, where its
       meaning would be better represented by the <b>Changed-By </b>field name
       used in the <i>.changes</i> file.
