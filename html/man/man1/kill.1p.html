NAME </h2>
<pre>
       kill — terminate or signal processes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       kill -s <i>signal_name pid</i>...

       kill -l <b>[</b><i>exit_status</i><b>]</b>

       kill <b>[</b>-<i>signal_name</i><b>] </b><i>pid</i>...

       kill <b>[</b>-<i>signal_number</i><b>] </b><i>pid</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>kill</i> utility shall send a signal to the process or processes
       specified by each <i>pid</i> operand.

       For each <i>pid</i> operand, the <i>kill</i> utility shall perform actions
       equivalent to the <i>kill</i>() function defined in the System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 called with the following
       arguments:

        *  The value of the <i>pid</i> operand shall be used as the <i>pid</i>
           argument.

        *  The <i>sig</i> argument is the value specified by the <b>-s </b>option,
           <b>-</b><i>signal_number</i> option, or the <b>-</b><i>signal_name</i> option, or by
           SIGTERM, if none of these options is specified.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>kill</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       that in the last two SYNOPSIS forms, the <b>-</b><i>signal_number</i> and
       <b>-</b><i>signal_name</i> options are usually more than a single character.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-l        </b>(The letter ell.) Write all values of <i>signal_name</i>
                 supported by the implementation, if no operand is
                 given. If an <i>exit_status</i> operand is given and it is a
                 value of the <b>'?'  </b>shell special parameter (see <i>Section</i>
                 <i>2.5.2</i>, <i>Special Parameters</i> and <i>wait</i>) corresponding to a
                 process that was terminated by a signal, the
                 <i>signal_name</i> corresponding to the signal that terminated
                 the process shall be written. If an <i>exit_status</i> operand
                 is given and it is the unsigned decimal integer value
                 of a signal number, the <i>signal_name</i> (the symbolic
                 constant name without the <b>SIG </b>prefix defined in the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017) corresponding
                 to that signal shall be written. Otherwise, the results
                 are unspecified.

       <b>-s </b><i>signal_name</i>
                 Specify the signal to send, using one of the symbolic
                 names defined in the <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i> header. Values of
                 <i>signal_name</i> shall be recognized in a case-independent
                 fashion, without the <b>SIG </b>prefix. In addition, the
                 symbolic name 0 shall be recognized, representing the
                 signal value zero. The corresponding signal shall be
                 sent instead of SIGTERM.

       <b>-</b><i>signal_name</i>
                 Equivalent to <b>-s </b><i>signal_name</i>.

       <b>-</b><i>signal_number</i>
                 Specify a non-negative decimal integer, <i>signal_number</i>,
                 representing the signal to be used instead of SIGTERM,
                 as the <i>sig</i> argument in the effective call to <i>kill</i>().
                 The correspondence between integer values and the <i>sig</i>
                 value used is shown in the following list.

                 The effects of specifying any <i>signal_number</i> other than
                 those listed below are undefined.

                 0     0

                 1     SIGHUP

                 2     SIGINT

                 3     SIGQUIT

                 6     SIGABRT

                 9     SIGKILL

                 14    SIGALRM

                 15    SIGTERM

                 If the first argument is a negative integer, it shall
                 be interpreted as a <b>-</b><i>signal_number</i> option, not as a
                 negative <i>pid</i> operand specifying a process group.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>pid</i>       One of the following:

                  1. A decimal integer specifying a process or process
                     group to be signaled.  The process or processes
                     selected by positive, negative, and zero values of
                     the <i>pid</i> operand shall be as described for the
                     <i>kill</i>() function. If process number 0 is specified,
                     all processes in the current process group shall be
                     signaled. For the effects of negative <i>pid</i> numbers,
                     see the <i>kill</i>() function defined in the System
                     Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. If the first <i>pid</i>
                     operand is negative, it should be preceded by <b>"--"</b>
                     to keep it from being interpreted as an option.

                  2. A job control job ID (see the Base Definitions
                     volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 3.204</i>, <i>Job Control</i>
                     <i>Job ID</i>) that identifies a background process group
                     to be signaled. The job control job ID notation is
                     applicable only for invocations of <i>kill</i> in the
                     current shell execution environment; see <i>Section</i>
                     <i>2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>.

       <i>exit_status</i>
                 A decimal integer specifying a signal number or the
                 exit status of a process terminated by a signal.

</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>kill</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       When the <b>-l </b>option is not specified, the standard output shall
       not be used.

       When the <b>-l </b>option is specified, the symbolic name of each signal
       shall be written in the following format:

           "%s%c", &lt;<i>signal_name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>separator</i>&gt;

       where the &lt;<i>signal_name</i>&gt; is in uppercase, without the <b>SIG </b>prefix,
       and the &lt;<i>separator</i>&gt; shall be either a &lt;newline&gt; or a &lt;space&gt;.
       For the last signal written, &lt;<i>separator</i>&gt; shall be a &lt;newline&gt;.

       When both the <b>-l </b>option and <i>exit_status</i> operand are specified,
       the symbolic name of the corresponding signal shall be written in
       the following format:

           "%s\n", &lt;<i>signal_name</i>&gt;
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    At least one matching process was found for each <i>pid</i>
             operand, and the specified signal was successfully
             processed for at least one matching process.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Process numbers can be found by using <i>ps</i>.

       The job control job ID notation is not required to work as
       expected when <i>kill</i> is operating in its own utility execution
       environment. In either of the following examples:

           nohup kill %1 &amp;
           system("kill %1");

       the <i>kill</i> operates in a different environment and does not share
       the shell's understanding of job numbers.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Any of the commands:

           kill -9 100 -165
           kill -s kill 100 -165
           kill -s KILL 100 -165

       sends the SIGKILL signal to the process whose process ID is 100
       and to all processes whose process group ID is 165, assuming the
       sending process has permission to send that signal to the
       specified processes, and that they exist.

       The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 and this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 do not require specific signal numbers for any
       <i>signal_names</i>.  Even the <b>-</b><i>signal_number</i> option provides symbolic
       (although numeric) names for signals. If a process is terminated
       by a signal, its exit status indicates the signal that killed it,
       but the exact values are not specified. The <i>kill</i> <b>-l </b>option,
       however, can be used to map decimal signal numbers and exit
       status values into the name of a signal. The following example
       reports the status of a terminated job:

           job
           stat=$?
           if [ $stat -eq 0 ]
           then
               echo job completed successfully.
           elif [ $stat -gt 128 ]
           then
               echo job terminated by signal SIG$(kill -l $stat).
           else
               echo job terminated with error code $stat.
           fi

       To send the default signal to a process group (say 123), an
       application should use a command similar to one of the following:

           kill -TERM -123
           kill -- -123
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-l </b>option originated from the C shell, and is also
       implemented in the KornShell. The C shell output can consist of
       multiple output lines because the signal names do not always fit
       on a single line on some terminal screens. The KornShell output
       also included the implementation-defined signal numbers and was
       considered by the standard developers to be too difficult for
       scripts to parse conveniently. The specified output format is
       intended not only to accommodate the historical C shell output,
       but also to permit an entirely vertical or entirely horizontal
       listing on systems for which this is appropriate.

       An early proposal invented the name SIGNULL as a <i>signal_name</i> for
       signal 0 (used by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to
       test for the existence of a process without sending it a signal).
       Since the <i>signal_name</i> 0 can be used in this case unambiguously,
       SIGNULL has been removed.

       An early proposal also required symbolic <i>signal_name</i>s to be
       recognized with or without the <b>SIG </b>prefix. Historical versions of
       <i>kill</i> have not written the <b>SIG </b>prefix for the <b>-l </b>option and have
       not recognized the <b>SIG </b>prefix on <i>signal_name</i>s.  Since neither
       applications portability nor ease-of-use would be improved by
       requiring this extension, it is no longer required.

       To avoid an ambiguity of an initial negative number argument
       specifying either a signal number or a process group,
       POSIX.1‐2008 mandates that it is always considered the former by
       implementations that support the XSI option. It also requires
       that conforming applications always use the <b>"--" </b>options
       terminator argument when specifying a process group, unless an
       option is also specified.

       The <b>-s </b>option was added in response to international interest in
       providing some form of <i>kill</i> that meets the Utility Syntax
       Guidelines.

       The job control job ID notation is not required to work as
       expected when <i>kill</i> is operating in its own utility execution
       environment. In either of the following examples:

           nohup kill %1 &amp;
           system("kill %1");

       the <i>kill</i> operates in a different environment and does not
       understand how the shell has managed its job numbers.
