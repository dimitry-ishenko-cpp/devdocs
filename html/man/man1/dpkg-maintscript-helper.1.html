DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This program is designed to be run within maintainer scripts to
       achieve some tasks that <b>dpkg </b>can't (yet) handle natively either
       because of design decisions or due to current limitations.

       Many of those tasks require coordinated actions from several
       maintainer scripts (<b>preinst</b>, <b>postinst</b>, <b>prerm</b>, <b>postrm</b>).  To avoid
       mistakes the same call simply needs to be put in all scripts and
       the program will automatically adapt its behavior based on the
       environment variable <b>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME </b>and on the maintainer
       scripts arguments that you have to forward after a double hyphen.

       This program was introduced in dpkg 1.15.7.
</pre> <h2>
COMMON PARAMETERS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>prior-version</i>
           Defines the latest version of the package whose upgrade
           should trigger the operation.  It is important to calculate
           <i>prior-version</i> correctly so that the operations are correctly
           performed even if the user rebuilt the package with a local
           version.  If <i>prior-version</i> is empty or omitted, then the
           operation is tried on every upgrade (note: it's safer to give
           the version and have the operation tried only once).

           If the conffile has not been shipped for several versions,
           and you are now modifying the maintainer scripts to clean up
           the obsolete file, <i>prior-version</i> should be based on the
           version of the package that you are now preparing, not the
           first version of the package that lacked the conffile.  This
           applies to all other actions in the same way.

           For example, for a conffile removed in version <b>2.0-1 </b>of a
           package, <i>prior-version</i> should be set to <b>2.0-1~</b>.  This will
           cause the conffile to be removed even if the user rebuilt the
           previous version <b>1.0-1 </b>as <b>1.0-1local1</b>.  Or a package
           switching a path from a symlink (shipped in version <b>1.0-1</b>) to
           a directory (shipped in version <b>2.0-1</b>), but only performing
           the actual switch in the maintainer scripts in version <b>3.0-1</b>,
           should set <i>prior-version</i> to <b>3.0-1~</b>.

       <i>package</i>
           The package name owning the pathname(s).  When the package is
           “Multi-Arch: same” this parameter must include the
           architecture qualifier, otherwise it should <b>not </b>usually
           include the architecture qualifier (as it would disallow
           cross-grades, or switching from being architecture specific
           to architecture <b>all </b>or vice versa).  If the parameter is
           empty or omitted, the <b>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE </b>and
           <b>DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_ARCH </b>environment variables (as set by <b>dpkg</b>
           when running the maintainer scripts) will be used to generate
           an arch-qualified package name.

       <b>--  </b>All the parameters of the maintainer scripts have to be
           forwarded to the program after <b>--</b>.
</pre> <h2>
CONFFILE RELATED TASKS </h2>
<pre>
       When upgrading a package, <b>dpkg </b>will not automatically remove a
       conffile (a configuration file for which <b>dpkg </b>should preserve
       user changes) if it is not present in the newer version.  There
       are two principal reasons for this; the first is that the
       conffile could've been dropped by accident and the next version
       could restore it, users wouldn't want their changes thrown away.
       The second is to allow packages to transition files from a dpkg-
       maintained conffile to a file maintained by the package's
       maintainer scripts, usually with a tool like debconf or ucf.

       This means that if a package is intended to rename or remove a
       conffile, it must explicitly do so and <b>dpkg-maintscript-helper</b>
       can be used to implement graceful deletion and moving of
       conffiles within maintainer scripts.

   <b>Removing a conffile</b>
       <b>Note</b>: This can be replaced in most cases by the
       "remove-on-upgrade" flag in <i>DEBIAN/conffiles</i> (since dpkg 1.20.6),
       see <a href="../man5/deb-conffiles.5.html">deb-conffiles(5)</a>.

       If a conffile is completely removed, it should be removed from
       disk, unless the user has modified it.  If there are local
       modifications, they should be preserved.  If the package upgrade
       aborts, the newly obsolete conffile should not disappear.

       All of this is implemented by putting the following shell snippet
       in the <b>preinst</b>, <b>postinst </b>and <b>postrm </b>maintainer scripts:

            dpkg-maintscript-helper rm_conffile \
               <i>conffile prior-version package</i> -- "$@"

       <i>conffile</i> is the filename of the conffile to remove.

       Current implementation: in the <b>preinst</b>, it checks if the conffile
       was modified and renames it either to <i>conffile</i><b>.dpkg-remove </b>(if
       not modified) or to <i>conffile</i><b>.dpkg-backup </b>(if modified).  In the
       <b>postinst</b>, the latter file is renamed to <i>conffile</i><b>.dpkg-bak </b>and
       kept for reference as it contains user modifications but the
       former will be removed.  If the package upgrade aborts, the
       <b>postrm </b>reinstalls the original conffile.  During purge, the
       <b>postrm </b>will also delete the <b>.dpkg-bak </b>file kept up to now.

   <b>Renaming a conffile</b>
       If a conffile is moved from one location to another, you need to
       make sure you move across any changes the user has made.  This
       may seem a simple change to the <b>preinst </b>script at first, however
       that will result in the user being prompted by <b>dpkg </b>to approve
       the conffile edits even though they are not responsible of them.

       Graceful renaming can be implemented by putting the following
       shell snippet in the <b>preinst</b>, <b>postinst </b>and <b>postrm </b>maintainer
       scripts:

            dpkg-maintscript-helper mv_conffile \
               <i>old-conffile new-conffile prior-version package</i> -- "$@"

       <i>old-conffile</i> and <i>new-conffile</i> are the old and new name of the
       conffile to rename.

       Current implementation: the <b>preinst </b>checks if the conffile has
       been modified, if yes it's left on place otherwise it's renamed
       to <i>old-conffile</i><b>.dpkg-remove</b>.  On configuration, the <b>postinst</b>
       removes <i>old-conffile</i><b>.dpkg-remove </b>and renames <i>old-conffile</i> to <i>new-</i>
       <i>conffile</i> if <i>old-conffile</i> is still available.  On
       abort-upgrade/abort-install, the <b>postrm </b>renames <i>old-</i>
       <i>conffile</i><b>.dpkg-remove </b>back to <i>old-conffile</i> if required.
</pre> <h2>
SYMLINK AND DIRECTORY SWITCHES </h2>
<pre>
       When upgrading a package, <b>dpkg </b>will not automatically switch a
       symlink to a directory or vice-versa.  Downgrades are not
       supported and the path will be left as is.

       <b>Note</b>: The symlinks and directories created during these switches
       need to be shipped in the new packages, or <b>dpkg </b>will not be able
       to remove them on purge.

   <b>Switching a symlink to directory</b>
       If a symlink is switched to a real directory, you need to make
       sure before unpacking that the symlink is removed.  This may seem
       a simple change to the <b>preinst </b>script at first, however that will
       result in some problems in case of admin local customization of
       the symlink or when downgrading the package.

       Graceful renaming can be implemented by putting the following
       shell snippet in the <b>preinst</b>, <b>postinst </b>and <b>postrm </b>maintainer
       scripts:

            dpkg-maintscript-helper symlink_to_dir \
               <i>pathname old-target prior-version package</i> -- "$@"

       <i>pathname</i> is the absolute name of the old symlink (the path will
       be a directory at the end of the installation) and <i>old-target</i> is
       the target name of the former symlink at <i>pathname</i>.  It can either
       be absolute or relative to the directory containing <i>pathname</i>.

       Current implementation: the <b>preinst </b>checks if the symlink exists
       and points to <i>old-target</i>, if not then it's left in place,
       otherwise it's renamed to <i>pathname</i><b>.dpkg-backup</b>.  On
       configuration, the <b>postinst </b>removes <i>pathname</i><b>.dpkg-backup </b>if
       <i>pathname</i><b>.dpkg-backup </b>is still a symlink.  On
       abort-upgrade/abort-install, the <b>postrm </b>renames
       <i>pathname</i><b>.dpkg-backup </b>back to <i>pathname</i> if required.

   <b>Switching a directory to symlink</b>
       If a real directory is switched to a symlink, you need to make
       sure before unpacking that the directory is removed.  This may
       seem a simple change to the <b>preinst </b>script at first, however that
       will result in some problems in case the directory contains
       conffiles, pathnames owned by other packages, locally created
       pathnames, or when downgrading the package.

       Graceful switching can be implemented by putting the following
       shell snippet in the <b>preinst</b>, <b>postinst </b>and <b>postrm </b>maintainer
       scripts:

            dpkg-maintscript-helper dir_to_symlink \
               <i>pathname new-target prior-version package</i> -- "$@"

       <i>pathname</i> is the absolute name of the old directory (the path will
       be a symlink at the end of the installation) and <i>new-target</i> is
       the target of the new symlink at <i>pathname</i>.  It can either be
       absolute or relative to the directory containing <i>pathname</i>.

       Current implementation: the <b>preinst </b>checks if the directory
       exists, does not contain conffiles, pathnames owned by other
       packages, or locally created pathnames, if not then it's left in
       place, otherwise it's renamed to <i>pathname</i><b>.dpkg-backup</b>, and an
       empty staging directory named <i>pathname</i> is created, marked with a
       file so that dpkg can track it.  On configuration, the <b>postinst</b>
       finishes the switch if <i>pathname</i><b>.dpkg-backup </b>is still a directory
       and <i>pathname</i> is the staging directory; it removes the staging
       directory mark file, moves the newly created files inside the
       staging directory to the symlink target <i>new-target</i>/, replaces the
       now empty staging directory <i>pathname</i> with a symlink to <i>new-</i>
       <i>target</i>, and removes <i>pathname</i><b>.dpkg-backup</b>.  On
       abort-upgrade/abort-install, the <b>postrm </b>renames
       <i>pathname</i><b>.dpkg-backup </b>back to <i>pathname</i> if required.
</pre> <h2>
INTEGRATION IN PACKAGES </h2>
<pre>
       When using a packaging helper, please check if it has native
       <b>dpkg-maintscript-helper </b>integration, which might make your life
       easier.  See for example <a href="dh_installdeb.1.html">dh_installdeb(1)</a>.

       Given that <b>dpkg-maintscript-helper </b>is used in the <b>preinst</b>, using
       it unconditionally requires a pre-dependency to ensure that the
       required version of <b>dpkg </b>has been unpacked before.  The required
       version depends on the command used, for <b>rm_conffile </b>and
       <b>mv_conffile </b>it is 1.15.7.2, for <b>symlink_to_dir </b>and <b>dir_to_symlink</b>
       it is 1.17.14:

        Pre-Depends: dpkg (&gt;= 1.17.14)

       But in many cases the operation done by the program is not
       critical for the package, and instead of using a pre-dependency
       we can call the program only if we know that the required command
       is supported by the currently installed <b>dpkg</b>:

            if dpkg-maintscript-helper supports <i>command</i>; then
               dpkg-maintscript-helper <i>command</i> ...
            fi

       The command <b>supports </b>will return 0 on success, 1 otherwise.  The
       <b>supports </b>command will check if the environment variables as set
       by dpkg and required by the script are present, and will consider
       it a failure in case the environment is not sufficient.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>DPKG_ROOT</b>
           If set, it will be used as the filesystem root directory.

       <b>DPKG_ADMINDIR</b>
           If set, it will be used as the <b>dpkg </b>data directory.

       <b>DPKG_COLORS</b>
           Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.19.1).  The currently
           accepted values are: <b>auto </b>(default), <b>always </b>and <b>never</b>.
