DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdalogger </b>is a configurable log file monitoring Performance
       Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA).  It can be seen as analogous to the
       <b>-f </b>option to <a href="tail.1.html">tail(1)</a> and converts each new log line into a
       performance event.  It was the first PMDA to make extensive use
       of event metrics, which can be consumed by client tools like
       <a href="pmevent.1.html">pmevent(1)</a>.

       The <b>logger </b>PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting
       timestamped event records for text logged to a file (or set of
       files or output from a process), as well as the more orthodox
       sample-style metrics such as event counts and throughput size
       values.

       The PMDA is configured via a <i>configfile</i> which contains one line
       for each source of events (file or process).  This file is setup
       by the Install script described in the later section on
       ``INSTALLATION'' of the PMDA.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdalogger </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>logger.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdalogger </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-m   </b>Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event
            records to <i>maxsize</i> bytes.  As log events arrive at the PMDA,
            they must be buffered until individual client tools request
            the next batch since their previous batch of events.  The
            default maximum is 2 megabytes.

       <b>-s   </b>Sets the polling interval for detecting newly arrived log
            lines.  Mirrors the same option from the <a href="tail.1.html">tail(1)</a> command.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
       logger performance metrics, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger
            # ./Install

       This is an interactive installation process which prompts for
       each log file path to be monitored (or command to be run), a
       metric instance name to identify it, and whether access should be
       restricted (refer to the <b>-x </b>option to <a href="pmevent.1.html">pmevent(1)</a> for further
       details).

       If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/logger
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdalogger </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
