NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lxc-autostart - start/stop/kill auto-started containers
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lxc-autostart </b>[-k] [-L] [-r] [-s] [-a] [-A] [-g <i>groups</i>] [-t
                     <i>timeout</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lxc-autostart  </b>processes  containers  with lxc.start.auto set. It
       lets the user start, shutdown, kill, restart  containers  in  the
       right  order,  waiting  the  right  time.  Supports  filtering by
       lxc.group or just run against all defined containers. It can also
       be used by external tools in list mode where no  action  will  be
       performed  and  the list of affected containers (and if relevant,
       delays) will be shown.

       The [-r], [-s] and [-k] options specify the  action  to  perform.
       If  none is specified, then the containers will be started.  [-a]
       and [-g] are used to specify which containers will  be  affected.
       By  default  only  containers without a lxc.group set will be af‐
       fected.  [-t TIMEOUT] specifies the maximum  amount  of  time  to
       wait for the container to complete the shutdown or reboot.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-r,--reboot</b>
              Request a reboot of the container.

       <b>-s,--shutdown</b>
              Request a clean shutdown. If a [-t timeout] greater than 0
              is given and the container has not shut down within this
              period, it will be killed as with the [-k kill] option.

       <b>-k,--kill</b>
              Rather than requesting a clean shutdown of the container,
              explicitly kill all tasks in the container.

       <b>-L,--list</b>
              Rather than performing the action, just print the contain‐
              er name and wait delays until starting the next container.

       <b>-t,--timeout </b><i>TIMEOUT</i>
              Wait TIMEOUT seconds before hard-stopping the container.

       <b>-g,--groups </b><i>GROUP</i>
              Comma separated list of groups to select (defaults to
              those without a lxc.group - the NULL group).  This option
              may be specified multiple times and the arguments concate‐
              nated. The NULL or empty group may be specified as a lead‐
              ing comma, trailing comma, embedded double comma, or empty
              argument where the NULL group should be processed.  Groups
              are processed in the order specified on the command line.
              Multiple invocations of the -g option may be freely inter‐
              mixed with the comma separated lists and will be combined
              in specified order.

       <b>-a,--all</b>
              Ignore lxc.group and select all auto-started containers.

       <b>-A,--ignore-auto</b>
              Ignore the lxc.start.auto flag. Combined with -a, will se‐
              lect all containers on the system.
</pre> <h2>
AUTOSTART AND SYSTEM BOOT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>lxc-autostart </b>command is used as part of the LXC system ser‐
       vice, when enabled to run on host system at bootup and at shut‐
       down. It's used to select which containers to start in what order
       and how much to delay between each startup when the host system
       boots.

       Each container can be part of any number of groups or no group at
       all.  Two groups are special. One is the NULL group, i.e. the
       container does not belong to any group. The other group is the
       "onboot" group.

       When the system boots with the LXC service enabled, it will first
       attempt to boot any containers with lxc.start.auto == 1 that is a
       member of the "onboot" group. The startup will be in order of
       lxc.start.order.  If an lxc.start.delay has been specified, that
       delay will be honored before attempting to start the next con‐
       tainer to give the current container time to begin initialization
       and reduce overloading the host system. After starting the mem‐
       bers of the "onboot" group, the LXC system will proceed to boot
       containers with lxc.start.auto == 1 which are not members of any
       group (the NULL group) and proceed as with the onboot group.
</pre> <h2>
STARTUP GROUP EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-g "onboot,"</b>
              Start the "onboot" group first then the NULL group.

              This is the equivalent of: <b>-g onboot -g ""</b>.

       <b>-g "dns,web,,onboot"</b>
              Starts the "dns" group first, the "web" group second, then
              the NULL group followed by the "onboot" group.

              This is the equivalent of: <b>-g dns,web -g ,onboot </b>or <b>-g dns</b>
              <b>-g web -g "" -g onboot</b>.
