<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       uudecode — decode a binary file
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       uudecode <b>[</b>-o <i>outfile</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>uudecode</i> utility shall read a file, or standard input if no
       file is specified, that includes data created by the <i>uuencode</i>
       utility. The <i>uudecode</i> utility shall scan the input file,
       searching for data compatible with one of the formats specified
       in <i>uuencode</i>, and attempt to create or overwrite the file
       described by the data (or overridden by the <b>-o </b>option). The
       pathname shall be contained in the data or specified by the <b>-o</b>
       option. The file access permission bits and contents for the file
       to be produced shall be contained in that data. The mode bits of
       the created file (other than standard output) shall be set from
       the file access permission bits contained in the data; that is,
       other attributes of the mode, including the file mode creation
       mask (see <i>umask</i>), shall not affect the file being produced. If
       either of the <i>op</i> characters <b>'+' </b>and <b>'-' </b>(see <i>chmod</i>) are specified
       in symbolic mode, the initial mode on which those operations are
       based is unspecified.

       If the pathname of the file resolves to an existing file and the
       user does not have write permission on that file, <i>uudecode</i> shall
       terminate with an error. If the pathname of the file resolves to
       an existing file and the user has write permission on that file,
       the existing file shall be overwritten and, if possible, the mode
       bits of the file (other than standard output) shall be set as
       described above; if the mode bits cannot be set, <i>uudecode</i> shall
       not treat this as an error.

       If the input data was produced by <i>uuencode</i> on a system with a
       different number of bits per byte than on the target system, the
       results of <i>uudecode</i> are unspecified.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>uudecode</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-o </b><i>outfile</i>
                 A pathname of a file that shall be used instead of any
                 pathname contained in the input data. Specifying an
                 <i>outfile</i> option-argument of <b>/dev/stdout </b>shall indicate
                 standard output.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      The pathname of a file containing the output of
                 <i>uuencode</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       See the INPUT FILES section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be files containing the output of <i>uuencode</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>uudecode</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       If the file data header encoded by <i>uuencode</i> is <b>- </b>or <b>/dev/stdout</b>,
       or the <b>-o /dev/stdout </b>option overrides the file data, the
       standard output shall be in the same format as the file
       originally encoded by <i>uuencode</i>.  Otherwise, the standard output
       shall not be used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The output file shall be in the same format as the file
       originally encoded by <i>uuencode</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The user who is invoking <i>uudecode</i> must have write permission on
       any file being created.

       The output of <i>uuencode</i> is essentially an encoded bit stream that
       is not cognizant of byte boundaries. It is possible that a 9-bit
       byte target machine can process input from an 8-bit source, if it
       is aware of the requirement, but the reverse is unlikely to be
       satisfying. Of course, the only data that is meaningful for such
       a transfer between architectures is generally character data.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Input files are not necessarily text files, as stated by an early
       proposal. Although the <i>uuencode</i> output is a text file, that
       output could have been wrapped within another file or mail
       message that is not a text file.

       The <b>-o </b>option is not historical practice, but was added at the
       request of WG15 so that the user could override the target
       pathname without having to edit the input data itself.

       In early drafts, the [<b>-o </b><i>outfile</i>] option-argument allowed the use
       of <b>- </b>to mean standard output. The symbol <b>- </b>has only been used
       previously in POSIX.1‐2008 as a standard input indicator.  The
       standard developers did not wish to overload the meaning of <b>- </b>in
       this manner. The <b>/dev/stdout </b>concept exists on most modern
       systems. The <b>/dev/stdout </b>syntax does not refer to a new special
       file. It is just a magic cookie to specify standard output.
