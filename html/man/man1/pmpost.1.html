NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmpost </b>- append messages to the Performance Co-Pilot notice board
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmpost </b><i>message</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmpost </b>will append the text <i>message</i> to the end of the Performance
       Co-Pilot (PCP) notice board file (<b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES</b>) in an
       atomic manner that guards against corruption of the notice board
       file by concurrent invocations of <b>pmpost</b>.

       The PCP notice board is intended to be a persistent store and
       clearing house for important messages relating to the operation
       of the PCP and the notification of performance alerts from
       <a href="pmie.1.html">pmie(1)</a> when other notification options are either unavailable or
       unsuitable.

       Before being written, messages are prefixed by the current time,
       and when the current day is different to the last time the notice
       board file was written, <b>pmpost </b>will prepend the message with the
       full date.

       If the notice board file does not exist, <b>pmpost </b>will create it.
       <b>pmpost </b>would usually run from long-running PCP daemons executing
       under the (typically unprivileged) <b>$PCP_USER </b>and <b>$PCP_GROUP</b>
       accounts.  The file should be owned and writable by the <b>$PCP_USER</b>
       user, and readable by others.
