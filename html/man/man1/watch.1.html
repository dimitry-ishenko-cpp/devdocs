</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       watch - execute a program periodically, showing output fullscreen
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>watch </b>[<i>option</i> ...] <i>command</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>watch </b>runs <i>command</i> repeatedly, displaying its output and errors
       (the first screenful). This allows you to watch the program
       output change over time. By default, <i>command</i> is run every 2
       seconds and <b>watch </b>will run until interrupted.  A header informs
       of the start and running time of <i>command</i> as well as its exit
       code.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>--beep</b>
              Beep if <i>command</i> has a non-zero exit.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--color</b>
              Interpret ANSI color and style sequences.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--no-color</b>
              Do not interpret ANSI color and style sequences.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--differences</b>[=<i>permanent</i>]
              Highlight the differences between successive updates. If
              the optional <i>permanent</i> argument is specified then <b>watch</b>
              will show all changes since the first iteration.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--errexit</b>
              Freeze updates on <i>command</i> error, and exit after a key
              press. The exit code of <b>watch </b>will be the code <i>command</i>
              exits with. If signal <b>n </b>is the cause of <i>command</i>
              termination, the exit code will be 128 + <b>n</b>.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--chgexit</b>
              Exit when the output of <i>command</i> changes.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--interval </b><i>seconds</i>
              Specify update interval. Values smaller than 0.1 and
              larger than 2678400 (31 days) are converted into these
              respective bounds. Both '.' and ',' work for any locale.
              The <b>WATCH_INTERVAL </b>environment variable can be used to
              persistently set a non-default interval (following the
              same rules and formatting).

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--precise</b>
              Execute <i>command</i> <b>--interval </b>seconds after its previous run
              started, instead of <b>--interval </b>seconds after its previous
              run finished. If it's taking longer than <b>--interval</b>
              seconds for <i>command</i> to complete, it is waited for in
              either case.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--equexit </b>&lt;cycles&gt;
              Exit when output of <i>command</i> does not change for the given
              number of cycles.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-rerun</b>
              Do not run the program on terminal resize, the output of
              the program will re-appear at the next regular run time.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--shotsdir</b>
              Directory to save screenshots into.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--no-title</b>
              Turn off the header normally shown at the top of the
              screen.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--no-wrap</b>
              Turn off line wrapping. Long lines will be truncated
              instead of wrapped to the next line.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exec</b>
              Pass <i>command</i> to an <a href="../man3/exec.3.html">exec(3)</a> call instead of <b>sh -c</b>. The
              program will start a bit quicker. Shell features
              (environment setup, variable and pathname expansion, etc.)
              will be unavailable.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display help text and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.
</pre> <h2>
KEY CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       <b>spacebar</b>
              Issue <i>command</i> immediately. If it's running at the moment,
              it is not interrupted and its next round will start
              without delay.

       <b>q      </b>Quit <b>watch</b>. It currently does not interrupt a running
              <i>command</i> (as opposed to terminating signals, such as the
              SIGKILL following Ctrl+C).

       <b>s      </b>Take a screenshot. It will be saved in the working
              directory, unless specified otherwise by <b>--shotsdir</b>. If
              <i>command</i> is running at the moment, the screenshot will be
              taken as soon as it finishes.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0      </b>Success. Does not represent <i>command</i> exit code.

       <b>1      </b>Errors unrelated to <i>command</i> operation.

       <b>2      </b>Errors related to <i>command</i> execution and management (not
              its exit code).

       <b>any non-zero (--errexit)</b>
              With <b>--errexit </b>the last exit code of <i>command</i> is returned.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The behavior of <b>watch </b>is affected by the following environment
       variables.

       <b>WATCH_INTERVAL</b>
              Update interval, follows the same rules as the <b>--interval</b>
              command line option.

       <b>COLUMNS</b>
              Terminal screen character width. Set to override
              autodetection.

       <b>LINES  </b>Terminal screen character height. Set to override
              autodetection.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX option processing is used (i.e., option processing stops at
       the first non-option argument). This means that flags after
       <i>command</i> don't get interpreted by <b>watch </b>itself.

       Non-printing characters are stripped from program output. Use <b>cat</b>
       <b>-v </b>as part of the command pipeline if you want to see them.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To watch the contents of a directory change, you could use

              watch -d ls -l

       If you have CPUs with a dynamic frequency and want to observe it
       change, try the following. The command is passed to the shell,
       which allows you to make the pipeline. The quotes are a feature
       of the shell too.

              watch -n1 'grep "^cpu MHz" /proc/cpuinfo | sort -nrk4'

       To monitor the up status of your servers, saving a copy of the
       output of each run to a file, you may use this. The <b>-p </b>makes the
       command execute every 10 seconds regardless of how long it took
       to complete the previous run.

              watch -n10 -p -d '{ date; for i in 10.0.0.31 10.0.0.32
              10.0.0.33; do R=OK; ping -c2 -W2 "$i" &amp;&gt;/dev/null ||
              R=FAIL; echo "$i: $R"; done } | tee -a ~/log'

       You can watch for your administrator to install the latest kernel
       with

              watch uname -r
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       When the terminal dimensions change, its contents changes are not
       registered on the next <i>command</i> run. <b>--chgexit </b>will not trigger
       that turn and the counter of <b>--equexit </b>will not restart even if
       <i>command</i> output changes meanwhile. <b>--differences </b>highlighting is
       reset.
</pre> <h2>
