NAME </h2>
<pre>
       make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>make </b>[<i>OPTION</i>]... [<i>TARGET</i>]...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>make</i> utility will determine automatically which pieces of a
       large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to
       recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation of
       <b>make</b>, which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath,
       and is currently maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples show C
       programs, since they are very common, but you can use <b>make </b>with
       any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell
       command.  In fact, <b>make </b>is not limited to programs.  You can use
       it to describe any task where some files must be updated
       automatically from others whenever the others change.

       To prepare to use <b>make</b>, you must write a file called the <i>makefile</i>
       that describes the relationships among files in your program, and
       provides commands for updating each file.  In a program,
       typically the executable file is updated from object files, which
       are in turn made by compiling source files.

       Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source
       files, this simple shell command:

              <b>make</b>

       suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The <b>make</b>
       program uses the makefile description and the last-modification
       times of the files to decide which of the files need to be
       updated.  For each of those files, it issues the commands
       recorded in the makefile.

       <b>make </b>executes commands in the <i>makefile</i> to update one or more
       <i>targets</i>, where <i>target</i> is typically a program.  If no <b>-f </b>option is
       present, <b>make </b>will look for the makefiles <i>GNUmakefile</i>, <i>makefile</i>,
       and <i>Makefile</i>, in that order.

       Normally you should call your makefile either <i>makefile</i> or
       <i>Makefile</i>.  (We recommend <i>Makefile</i> because it appears prominently
       near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other
       important files such as <i>README</i>.)  The first name checked,
       <i>GNUmakefile</i>, is not recommended for most makefiles.  You should
       use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU
       <b>make</b>, and will not be understood by other versions of <b>make</b>.  If
       <i>makefile</i> is '-', the standard input is read.

       <b>make </b>updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that
       have been modified since the target was last modified, or if the
       target does not exist.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>-m</b>
            These options are ignored for compatibility with other
            versions of <b>make</b>.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--always-make</b>
            Unconditionally make all targets.

       <b>-C </b><i>dir</i>, <b>--directory</b>=<i>dir</i>
            Change to directory <i>dir</i> before reading the makefiles or
            doing anything else.  If multiple <b>-C </b>options are specified,
            each is interpreted relative to the previous one: <b>-C </b>/ <b>-C</b>
            etc is equivalent to <b>-C </b>/etc.  This is typically used with
            recursive invocations of <b>make</b>.

       <b>-d   </b>Print debugging information in addition to normal
            processing.  The debugging information says which files are
            being considered for remaking, which file-times are being
            compared and with what results, which files actually need to
            be remade, which implicit rules are considered and which are
            applied---everything interesting about how <b>make </b>decides what
            to do.

       <b>--debug</b><i>[=FLAGS]</i>
            Print debugging information in addition to normal
            processing.  If the <i>FLAGS</i> are omitted, then the behavior is
            the same as if <b>-d </b>was specified.  <i>FLAGS</i> may be any or all of
            the following names, comma- or space-separated.  Only the
            first character is significant: the rest may be omitted: <i>all</i>
            for all debugging output (same as using <b>-d</b>), <i>basic</i> for basic
            debugging, <i>verbose</i> for more verbose basic debugging,
            <i>implicit</i> for showing implicit rule search operations, <i>jobs</i>
            for details on invocation of commands, <i>makefile</i> for
            debugging while remaking makefiles, <i>print</i> shows all recipes
            that are run even if they are silent, and <i>why</i> shows the
            reason <b>make </b>decided to rebuild each target.  Use <i>none</i> to
            disable all previous debugging flags.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--environment-overrides</b>
            Give variables taken from the environment precedence over
            variables from makefiles.

       <b>-E </b><i>string</i>, <b>--eval </b><i>string</i>
            Interpret <i>string</i> using the <b>eval </b>function, before parsing any
            makefiles.

       <b>-f </b><i>file</i>, <b>--file</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--makefile</b>=<i>FILE</i>
            Use <i>file</i> as a makefile.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-errors</b>
            Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files.

       <b>-I </b><i>dir</i>, <b>--include-dir</b>=<i>dir</i>
            Specifies a directory <i>dir</i> to search for included makefiles.
            If several <b>-I </b>options are used to specify several
            directories, the directories are searched in the order
            specified.  Unlike the arguments to other flags of <b>make</b>,
            directories given with <b>-I </b>flags may come directly after the
            flag: <b>-I</b><i>dir</i> is allowed, as well as <b>-I </b><i>dir</i>.  This syntax is
            allowed for compatibility with the C preprocessor's <b>-I </b>flag.

       <b>-j </b>[<i>jobs</i>], <b>--jobs</b>[=<i>jobs</i>]
            Specifies the number of <i>jobs</i> (commands) to run
            simultaneously.  If there is more than one <b>-j </b>option, the
            last one is effective.  If the <b>-j </b>option is given without an
            argument, <b>make </b>will not limit the number of jobs that can
            run simultaneously.

       <b>--jobserver-style=</b><i>style</i>
            The style of jobserver to use.  The <i>style</i> may be one of
            <b>fifo</b>, <b>pipe</b>, or <b>sem </b>(Windows only).

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-going</b>
            Continue as much as possible after an error.  While the
            target that failed, and those that depend on it, cannot be
            remade, the other dependencies of these targets can be
            processed all the same.

       <b>-l </b>[<i>load</i>], <b>--load-average</b>[=<i>load</i>]
            Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if
            there are others jobs running and the load average is at
            least <i>load</i> (a floating-point number).  With no argument,
            removes a previous load limit.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--check-symlink-times</b>
            Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--just-print</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>, <b>--recon</b>
            Print the commands that would be executed, but do not
            execute them (except in certain circumstances).

       <b>-o </b><i>file</i>, <b>--old-file</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--assume-old</b>=<i>file</i>
            Do not remake the file <i>file</i> even if it is older than its
            dependencies, and do not remake anything on account of
            changes in <i>file</i>.  Essentially the file is treated as very
            old and its rules are ignored.

       <b>-O</b>[<i>type</i>], <b>--output-sync</b>[=<i>type</i>]
            When running multiple jobs in parallel with <b>-j</b>, ensure the
            output of each job is collected together rather than
            interspersed with output from other jobs.  If <i>type</i> is not
            specified or is <b>target </b>the output from the entire recipe for
            each target is grouped together.  If <i>type</i> is <b>line </b>the output
            from each command line within a recipe is grouped together.
            If <i>type</i> is <b>recurse </b>output from an entire recursive make is
            grouped together.  If <i>type</i> is <b>none </b>output synchronization is
            disabled.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print-data-base</b>
            Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results
            from reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as
            otherwise specified.  This also prints the version
            information given by the <b>-v </b>switch (see below).  To print
            the data base without trying to remake any files, use <i>make</i>
            <i>-p -f/dev/null</i>.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--question</b>
            ``Question mode''.  Do not run any commands, or print
            anything; just return an exit status that is zero if the
            specified targets are already up to date, nonzero otherwise.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--no-builtin-rules</b>
            Eliminate use of the built-in implicit rules.  Also clear
            out the default list of suffixes for suffix rules.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--no-builtin-variables</b>
            Don't define any built-in variables.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
            Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are
            executed.

       <b>--no-silent</b>
            Cancel the effect of the <b>-s </b>option.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--no-keep-going</b>, <b>--stop</b>
            Cancel the effect of the <b>-k </b>option.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--touch</b>
            Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing
            them) instead of running their commands.  This is used to
            pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool future
            invocations of <b>make</b>.

       <b>--trace</b>
            Information about the disposition of each target is printed
            (why the target is being rebuilt and what commands are run
            to rebuild it).

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
            Print the version of the <b>make </b>program plus a copyright, a
            list of authors and a notice that there is no warranty.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--print-directory</b>
            Print a message containing the working directory before and
            after other processing.  This may be useful for tracking
            down errors from complicated nests of recursive <b>make</b>
            commands.

       <b>--no-print-directory</b>
            Turn off <b>-w</b>, even if it was turned on implicitly.

       <b>--shuffle</b><i>[=MODE]</i>
            Enable shuffling of goal and prerequisite ordering.  <i>MODE</i> is
            one of <i>none</i> to disable shuffle mode, <i>random</i> to shuffle
            prerequisites in random order, <i>reverse</i> to consider
            prerequisites in reverse order, or an integer <i>&lt;seed&gt;</i> which
            enables <i>random</i> mode with a specific <i>seed</i> value.  If <i>MODE</i> is
            omitted the default is <i>random</i>.

       <b>-W </b><i>file</i>, <b>--what-if</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--new-file</b>=<i>file</i>, <b>--assume-new</b>=<i>file</i>
            Pretend that the target <i>file</i> has just been modified.  When
            used with the <b>-n </b>flag, this shows you what would happen if
            you were to modify that file.  Without <b>-n</b>, it is almost the
            same as running a <i>touch</i> command on the given file before
            running <b>make</b>, except that the modification time is changed
            only in the imagination of <b>make</b>.

       <b>--warn-undefined-variables</b>
            Warn when an undefined variable is referenced.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       GNU <b>make </b>exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were
       successfully parsed and no targets that were built failed.  A
       status of one will be returned if the <b>-q </b>flag was used and <b>make</b>
       determines that a target needs to be rebuilt.  A status of two
       will be returned if any errors were encountered.
</pre> <h2>
SEE ALSO </h2>
<pre>
       The full documentation for <b>make </b>is maintained as a Texinfo
       manual.  If the <b>info </b>and <b>make </b>programs are properly installed at
       your site, the command

              <b>info make</b>

       should give you access to the complete manual.
