DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Create, clone, switch, rename, or delete StGit-enabled branches.

       With no arguments, the current branch is printed to stdout.

       With a single argument, switch to the named branch.

       StGit supports specifying a branch using the <b>@{-&lt;n&gt;} </b>syntax
       supported by git, including <b>- </b>as a synonym for <b>@{-1}</b>. Thus <b>stg</b>
       <b>branch - </b>may be used to switch to the last checked-out HEAD. Note
       that <b>@{-&lt;n&gt;} </b>refers to the &lt;n&gt;th last HEAD, which is not
       necessarily a local branch. Using an <b>@{-&lt;n&gt;} </b>value that refers to
       anything but a local branch will result in an error.

COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       --list
           List each branch in the current repository along with its
           description, if any. The current branch is prefixed with <i>&gt;</i>.
           Branches initialized with StGit stacks are prefixed with <i>s</i>.
           Protected branches are prefixed with <i>p</i>.

       --create
           Create and switch to a new branch. The new branch is
           initialized as a StGit patch stack. The new branch will be
           based on the current HEAD, by default, unless an optional
           committish provided for the base.

           StGit attempts to detect the branch from which the new branch
           forked, as well as the remote repository of that parent
           branch such that <a href="stg-pull.1.html">stg-pull(1)</a> will pull from the correct
           remote branch. A warning will be printed if the parent branch
           cannot be determined.

       --clone
           Clone the current branch as &lt;new-branch&gt;, if specified, or
           using the current branch name with a timestamp.

           The description of the new branch will indicate it is a clone
           of the current branch. The parent information of the new
           branch is copied from the current branch.

       --rename
           Rename an existing branch

       --protect
           Prevent StGit from modifying a branch

       --unprotect
           Allow StGit to modify a previously protected branch

       --delete
           Delete a branch.

           The branch will not be deleted if there are any patches
           remaining unless the <i>--force</i> option is provided.

           If the current branch is selected for deletion, its parent
           branch must be configured and the worktree must be clean. The
           parent branch will be checked-out after the current branch is
           deleted.

           A protected branch may not be deleted; it must be unprotected
           first.

       --cleanup
           Remove StGit patch stack from branch. The operation will be
           refused if any patches remain, unless the <i>--force</i> option is
           provided.

           A protected branch will not be cleaned up; it must be
           unprotected first.

           A cleaned up branch may be reinitialized using <a href="stg-init.1.html">stg-init(1)</a>.

       --describe
           Set the branch description
