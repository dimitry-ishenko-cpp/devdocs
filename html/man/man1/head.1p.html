PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       head — copy the first part of files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       head <b>[</b>-n <i>number</i><b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>head</i> utility shall copy its input files to the standard
       output, ending the output for each file at a designated point.

       Copying shall end at the point in each input file indicated by
       the <b>-n </b><i>number</i> option. The option-argument <i>number</i> shall be counted
       in units of lines.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>head</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-n </b><i>number</i> The first <i>number</i> lines of each input file shall be
                 copied to standard output. The application shall ensure
                 that the <i>number</i> option-argument is a positive decimal
                 integer.

       When a file contains less than <i>number</i> lines, it shall be copied
       to standard output in its entirety. This shall not be an error.

       If no options are specified, <i>head</i> shall act as if <b>-n 10 </b>had been
       specified.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of an input file. If no <i>file</i> operands are
                 specified, the standard input shall be used.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used if no <i>file</i> operands are
       specified, and shall be used if a <i>file</i> operand is <b>'-' </b>and the
       implementation treats the <b>'-' </b>as meaning standard input.
       Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT
       FILES section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       Input files shall be text files, but the line length is not
       restricted to {LINE_MAX} bytes.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>head</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The standard output shall contain designated portions of the
       input files.

       If multiple <i>file</i> operands are specified, <i>head</i> shall precede the
       output for each with the header:

           "\n==&gt; %s &lt;==\n", &lt;<i>pathname</i>&gt;

       except that the first header written shall not include the
       initial &lt;newline&gt;.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       When using <i>head</i> to process pathnames, it is recommended that
       LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or
       C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences
       that do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case
       the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale
       each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this
       problem is avoided.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       To write the first ten lines of all files (except those with a
       leading period) in the directory:

           head -- *
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Although it is possible to simulate <i>head</i> with <i>sed</i> 10q for a
       single file, the standard developers decided that the popularity
       of <i>head</i> on historical BSD systems warranted its inclusion
       alongside <i>tail</i>.

       POSIX.1‐2008 version of <i>head</i> follows the Utility Syntax
       Guidelines. The <b>-n </b>option was added to this new interface so that
       <i>head</i> and <i>tail</i> would be more logically related. Earlier versions
       of this standard allowed a <b>-number </b>option. This form is no longer
       specified by POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some
       implementations.

       There is no <b>-c </b>option (as there is in <i>tail</i>) because it is not
       historical practice and because other utilities in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 provide similar functionality.
