</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>@CLEAR@ </b>- clear the terminal screen
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>@CLEAR@ </b>[<b>-T</b><i>type</i>] [<b>-V</b>] [<b>-x</b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>@CLEAR@ </b>clears your terminal's screen if this is possible,
       including the terminal's scrollback buffer (if the extended “E3”
       capability is defined).  <b>@CLEAR@ </b>looks in the environment for the
       terminal type given by the environment variable <b>TERM</b>, and then in
       the <b>terminfo </b>database to determine how to clear the screen.

       <b>@CLEAR@ </b>writes to the standard output.  You can redirect the
       standard output to a file (which prevents <b>@CLEAR@ </b>from actually
       clearing the screen), and later <b>cat </b>the file to the screen,
       clearing it at that point.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-T </b><i>type</i>
            indicates the <i>type</i> of terminal.  Normally this option is
            unnecessary, because the default is taken from the
            environment variable <b>TERM</b>.  If <b>-T </b>is specified, then the
            shell variables <b>LINES </b>and <b>COLUMNS </b>will also be ignored.

       <b>-V   </b>reports the version of ncurses which was used in this
            program, and exits.  The options are as follows:

       <b>-x   </b>do not attempt to clear the terminal's scrollback buffer
            using the extended “E3” capability.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       A <b>clear </b>command appeared in 2.79BSD dated February 24, 1979.
       Later that was provided in Unix 8th edition (1985).

       AT&amp;T adapted a different BSD program (<b>tset</b>) to make a new command
       (<b>tput</b>), and used this to replace the <b>clear </b>command with a shell
       script which calls <b>tput clear</b>, e.g.,

           /usr/bin/tput ${1:+-T$1} clear 2&gt; /dev/null
           exit

       In 1989, when Keith Bostic revised the BSD <b>tput </b>command to make
       it similar to the AT&amp;T <b>tput</b>, he added a shell script for the
       <b>clear </b>command:

           exec tput clear

       The remainder of the script in each case is a copyright notice.

       The ncurses <b>clear </b>command began in 1995 by adapting the original
       BSD <b>clear </b>command (with terminfo, of course).

       The <b>E3 </b>extension came later:

       •   In June 1999, <b>xterm </b>provided an extension to the standard
           control sequence for clearing the screen.  Rather than
           clearing just the visible part of the screen using

               printf '\033[2J'

           one could clear the <i>scrollback</i> using

               printf '\033[<b>3</b>J'

           This is documented in <i>XTerm Control Sequences</i> as a feature
           originating with <b>xterm</b>.

       •   A few other terminal developers adopted the feature, e.g.,
           PuTTY in 2006.

       •   In April 2011, a Red Hat developer submitted a patch to the
           Linux kernel, modifying its console driver to do the same
           thing.  The Linux change, part of the 3.0 release, did not
           mention <b>xterm</b>, although it was cited in the Red Hat bug
           report (#683733) which led to the change.

       •   Again, a few other terminal developers adopted the feature.
           But the next relevant step was a change to the <b>clear </b>program
           in 2013 to incorporate this extension.

       •   In 2013, the <b>E3 </b>extension was overlooked in <b>@TPUT@ </b>with the
           “clear” parameter.  That was addressed in 2016 by
           reorganizing <b>@TPUT@ </b>to share its logic with <b>@CLEAR@ </b>and
           <b>@TSET@</b>.
</pre> <h2>
PORTABILITY </h2>
<pre>
       Neither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open  Group  Base  Specifications
       Issue  7 (POSIX.1-2008) nor X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents
       @TSET@ or @RESET@.

       The latter documents <b>tput</b>, which could be used to replace this
       utility either via a shell script or by an alias (such as a
       symbolic link) to run <b>@TPUT@ </b>as <b>@CLEAR@</b>.
