PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       test — evaluate expression
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       test <b>[</b><i>expression</i><b>]</b>

       [ <b>[</b><i>expression</i><b>] </b>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>test</i> utility shall evaluate the <i>expression</i> and indicate the
       result of the evaluation by its exit status. An exit status of
       zero indicates that the expression evaluated as true and an exit
       status of 1 indicates that the expression evaluated as false.

       In the second form of the utility, where the utility name used is
       <i>[</i> rather than <i>test</i>, the application shall ensure that the closing
       square bracket is a separate argument. The <i>test</i> and <i>[</i> utilities
       may be implemented as a single linked utility which examines the
       basename of the zeroth command line argument to determine whether
       to behave as the <i>test</i> or <i>[</i> variant. Applications using the <i>exec</i>()
       family of functions to execute these utilities shall ensure that
       the argument passed in <i>arg0</i> or <i>argv</i>[0] is <b>'[' </b>when executing the
       <i>[</i> utility and has a basename of <b>"test" </b>when executing the <i>test</i>
       utility.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>test</i> utility shall not recognize the <b>"--" </b>argument in the
       manner specified by Guideline 10 in the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       No options shall be supported.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The application shall ensure that all operators and elements of
       primaries are presented as separate arguments to the <i>test</i>
       utility.

       The following primaries can be used to construct <i>expression</i>:

       <b>-b </b><i>pathname</i>
                 True if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing directory
                 entry for a block special file.  False if <i>pathname</i>
                 cannot be resolved, or if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an
                 existing directory entry for a file that is not a block
                 special file.

                 entry for a regular file. False if <i>pathname</i> cannot be
                 resolved, or if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing

                 resolved, or if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing
                 directory entry for a file that is not a symbolic link.
                 If the final component of <i>pathname</i> is a symbolic link,
                 that symbolic link is not followed.

                 True if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing directory
                 entry for a symbolic link. False if <i>pathname</i> cannot be
                 resolved, or if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing
                 directory entry for a file that is not a symbolic link.
                 If the final component of <i>pathname</i> is a symbolic link,
                 that symbolic link is not followed.

                 True if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing directory
                 entry for a FIFO. False if <i>pathname</i> cannot be resolved,
                 or if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing directory entry
                 for a file that is not a FIFO.

       <b>-r </b><i>pathname</i>
                 True if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing directory

                 file will be granted, as defined in <i>Section 1.1.1.4</i>,
                 <i>File Read</i>, <i>Write</i>, <i>and Creation</i>.  False if <i>pathname</i>
                 cannot be resolved, or if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an

       <b>-S </b><i>pathname</i>
                 True if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing directory

       <b>-s </b><i>pathname</i>
                 True if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing directory
                 entry for a file that has a size greater than zero.
                 False if <i>pathname</i> cannot be resolved, or if <i>pathname</i>
                 resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that
                 does not have a size greater than zero.

       <b>-t </b><i>file_descriptor</i>
                 True if file descriptor number <i>file_descriptor</i> is open
                 and is associated with a terminal. False if
                 <i>file_descriptor</i> is not a valid file descriptor number,
                 or if file descriptor number <i>file_descriptor</i> is not
                 open, or if it is open but is not associated with a

       <b>-u </b><i>pathname</i>
                 True if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing directory

                 False if <i>pathname</i> cannot be resolved, or if <i>pathname</i>
                 resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that
                 does not have its set-user-ID flag set.

       <b>-w </b><i>pathname</i>

                 <i>File Read</i>, <i>Write</i>, <i>and Creation</i>.  False if <i>pathname</i>
                 cannot be resolved, or if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an

                 permission to write to the file will not be granted.

       <b>-x </b><i>pathname</i>
                 True if <i>pathname</i> resolves to an existing directory
                 entry for a file for which permission to execute the
                 file (or search it, if it is a directory) will be

                 execute (or search) the file will not be granted.

       <b>-z </b><i>string</i> True if the length of string <i>string</i> is zero; otherwise,
                 false.

       <i>string</i>    True if the string <i>string</i> is not the null string;
                 otherwise, false.

       <i>s1</i> <b>= </b><i>s2</i>   True if the strings <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i> are identical; otherwise,
                 false.

       <i>s1</i> <b>!= </b><i>s2</i>  True if the strings <i>s1</i> and <i>s2</i> are not identical;
                 otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>-eq </b><i>n2</i> True if the integers <i>n1</i> and <i>n2</i> are algebraically equal;
                 otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>-ne </b><i>n2</i> True if the integers <i>n1</i> and <i>n2</i> are not algebraically
                 equal; otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>-gt </b><i>n2</i> True if the integer <i>n1</i> is algebraically greater than
                 the integer <i>n2</i>; otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>-ge </b><i>n2</i> True if the integer <i>n1</i> is algebraically greater than or
                 equal to the integer <i>n2</i>; otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>-lt </b><i>n2</i> True if the integer <i>n1</i> is algebraically less than the
                 integer <i>n2</i>; otherwise, false.

       <i>n1</i> <b>-le </b><i>n2</i> True if the integer <i>n1</i> is algebraically less than or
                 equal to the integer <i>n2</i>; otherwise, false.

       <i>expression1</i> <b>-a </b><i>expression2</i>
                 True if both <i>expression1</i> and <i>expression2</i> are true;
                 otherwise, false. The <b>-a </b>binary primary is left
                 associative. It has a higher precedence than <b>-o</b>.

       <i>expression1</i> <b>-o </b><i>expression2</i>
                 True if either <i>expression1</i> or <i>expression2</i> is true;
                 otherwise, false. The <b>-o </b>binary primary is left
                 associative.

       With the exception of the <b>-h </b><i>pathname</i> and <b>-L </b><i>pathname</i> primaries,
       if a <i>pathname</i> argument is a symbolic link, <i>test</i> shall evaluate
       the expression by resolving the symbolic link and using the file
       referenced by the link.

       These primaries can be combined with the following operators:

       <b>! </b><i>expression</i>
                 True if <i>expression</i> is false. False if <i>expression</i> is
                 true.

       <b>( </b><i>expression</i> <b>)</b>
                 True if <i>expression</i> is true. False if <i>expression</i> is
                 false. The parentheses can be used to alter the normal
                 precedence and associativity.

       The primaries with two elements of the form:

           -<i>primary_operator primary_operand</i>

       are known as <i>unary primaries</i>.  The primaries with three elements
       in either of the two forms:

           <i>primary_operand</i> -<i>primary_operator primary_operand</i>

           primary_operand primary_operator primary_operand

       are known as <i>binary primaries</i>.  Additional implementation-defined
       operators and <i>primary_operator</i>s may be provided by
       implementations. They shall be of the form -<i>operator</i> where the
       first character of <i>operator</i> is not a digit.

       The algorithm for determining the precedence of the operators and
       the return value that shall be generated is based on the number
       of arguments presented to <i>test</i>.  (However, when using the <b>"[...]"</b>
       form, the &lt;right-square-bracket&gt; final argument shall not be
       counted in this algorithm.)

       In the following list, $1, $2, $3, and $4 represent the arguments
       presented to <i>test</i>:

       0 arguments:
                   Exit false (1).

       1 argument: Exit true (0) if $1 is not null; otherwise, exit
                   false.

       2 arguments:
                    *  If $1 is <b>'!'</b>, exit true if $2 is null, false if
                       $2 is not null.

                    *  If $1 is a unary primary, exit true if the unary
                       test is true, false if the unary test is false.

                    *  Otherwise, produce unspecified results.

       3 arguments:
                    *  If $2 is a binary primary, perform the binary
                       test of $1 and $3.

                    *  If $1 is <b>'!'</b>, negate the two-argument test of $2
                       and $3.

                    *  If $1 is <b>'(' </b>and $3 is <b>')'</b>, perform the unary
                       test of $2.  On systems that do not support the
                       XSI option, the results are unspecified if $1 is
                       <b>'(' </b>and $3 is <b>')'</b>.

                    *  Otherwise, produce unspecified results.

       4 arguments:
                    *  If $1 is <b>'!'</b>, negate the three-argument test of
                       $2, $3, and $4.

                    *  If $1 is <b>'(' </b>and $4 is <b>')'</b>, perform the two-
                       argument test of $2 and $3.  On systems that do
                       not support the XSI option, the results are
                       unspecified if $1 is <b>'(' </b>and $4 is <b>')'</b>.

                    *  Otherwise, the results are unspecified.

       &gt;4 arguments:
                   The results are unspecified.

                   On XSI-conformant systems, combinations of primaries
                   and operators shall be evaluated using the precedence
                   and associativity rules described previously. In
                   addition, the string comparison binary primaries <b>'='</b>
                   and <b>"!=" </b>shall have a higher precedence than any
                   unary primary.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The XSI extensions specifying the <b>-a </b>and <b>-o </b>binary primaries and
       the <b>'(' </b>and <b>')' </b>operators have been marked obsolescent. (Many
       expressions using them are ambiguously defined by the grammar
       depending on the specific expressions being evaluated.) Scripts
       using these expressions should be converted to the forms given
       below. Even though many implementations will continue to support
       these obsolescent forms, scripts should be extremely careful when
       dealing with user-supplied input that could be confused with
       these and other primaries and operators. Unless the application
       developer knows all the cases that produce input to the script,
       invocations like:

           test "$1" -a "$2"

       should be written as:

           test "$1" &amp;&amp; test "$2"

       to avoid problems if a user supplied values such as $1 set to <b>'!'</b>
       and $2 set to the null string. That is, in cases where maximal
       portability is of concern, replace:

           test expr1 -a expr2

       with:

           test expr1 &amp;&amp; test expr2

       and replace:

           test expr1 -o expr2

       with:

           test expr1 || test expr2

       but note that, in <i>test</i>, <b>-a </b>has higher precedence than <b>-o </b>while
       <b>"&amp;&amp;" </b>and <b>"||" </b>have equal precedence in the shell.

       Parentheses or braces can be used in the shell command language
       to effect grouping.

       Parentheses must be escaped when using <i>sh</i>; for example:

           test \( expr1 -a expr2 \) -o expr3

       This command is not always portable even on XSI-conformant
       systems depending on the expressions specified by <i>expr</i>1, <i>expr</i>2,
       and <i>expr</i>3.  The following form can be used instead:

           ( test expr1 &amp;&amp; test expr2 ) || test expr3

       The two commands:

           test "$1"
           test ! "$1"

       could not be used reliably on some historical systems. Unexpected
       results would occur if such a <i>string</i> expression were used and $1
       expanded to <b>'!'</b>, <b>'('</b>, or a known unary primary. Better constructs
       are:

           test -n "$1"
           test -z "$1"

       respectively.

       Historical systems have also been unreliable given the common
       construct:

           test "$response" = "expected string"

       One of the following is a more reliable form:

           test "X$response" = "Xexpected string"
           test "expected string" = "$response"

       Note that the second form assumes that <i>expected string</i> could not
       be confused with any unary primary. If <i>expected string</i> starts
       with <b>'-'</b>, <b>'('</b>, <b>'!'</b>, or even <b>'='</b>, the first form should be used
       instead. Using the preceding rules without the XSI marked
       extensions, any of the three comparison forms is reliable, given
       any input. (However, note that the strings are quoted in all
       cases.)

       Because the string comparison binary primaries, <b>'=' </b>and <b>"!="</b>,
       have a higher precedence than any unary primary in the greater
       than 4 argument case, unexpected results can occur if arguments
       are not properly prepared. For example, in:

           test -d $1 -o -d $2

       If $1 evaluates to a possible directory name of <b>'='</b>, the first
       three arguments are considered a string comparison, which shall
       cause a syntax error when the second <b>-d </b>is encountered. One of
       the following forms prevents this; the second is preferred:

           test \( -d "$1" \) -o \( -d "$2" \)
           test -d "$1" || test -d "$2"

       Also in the greater than 4 argument case:

           test "$1" = "bat" -a "$2" = "ball"

       syntax errors occur if $1 evaluates to <b>'(' </b>or <b>'!'</b>.  One of the
       following forms prevents this; the third is preferred:

           test "X$1" = "Xbat" -a "X$2" = "Xball"
           test "$1" = "bat" &amp;&amp; test "$2" = "ball"
           test "X$1" = "Xbat" &amp;&amp; test "X$2" = "Xball"

       Note that none of the following examples are permitted by the
       syntax described:

           [-f file]
           [-f file ]
           [ -f file]
           [ -f file
           test -f file ]

       In the first two cases, if a utility named <i>[‐f</i> exists, that
       utility would be invoked, and not <i>test</i>.  In the remaining cases,
       the brackets are mismatched, and the behavior is unspecified.
       However:

           test ! ]

       does have a defined meaning, and must exit with status 1.
       Similarly:

           test ]

       must exit with status 0.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. Exit if there are not two or three arguments (two
           variations):

               if [ $# -ne 2 ] &amp;&amp; [ $# -ne 3 ]; then exit 1; fi
               if [ $# -lt 2 ] || [ $# -gt 3 ]; then exit 1; fi

        2. Perform a <i>mkdir</i> if a directory does not exist:

               test ! -d tempdir &amp;&amp; mkdir tempdir

        3. Wait for a file to become non-readable:

               while test -r thefile
               do
                   sleep 30
               done
               echo '"thefile" is no longer readable'

        4. Perform a command if the argument is one of three strings
           (two variations):

               if [ "$1" = "pear" ] || [ "$1" = "grape" ] || [ "$1" = "apple" ]
               then
                   <i>command</i>
               fi

               case "$1" in
                   pear|grape|apple) <i>command</i> ;;
               esac
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The KornShell-derived conditional command (double bracket <b>[[]]</b>)
       was removed from the shell command language description in an
       early proposal. Objections were raised that the real problem is
       misuse of the <i>test</i> command (<b>[</b>), and putting it into the shell is
       the wrong way to fix the problem.  Instead, proper documentation
       and a new shell reserved word (<b>!</b>)  are sufficient.

       Tests that require multiple <i>test</i> operations can be done at the
       shell level using individual invocations of the <i>test</i> command and
       shell logicals, rather than using the error-prone <b>-o </b>flag of
       <i>test</i>.

       XSI-conformant systems support more than four arguments.

       XSI-conformant systems support the combining of primaries with
       the following constructs:

       <i>expression1</i> <b>-a </b><i>expression2</i>
             True if both <i>expression1</i> and <i>expression2</i> are true.

       <i>expression1</i> <b>-o </b><i>expression2</i>
             True if at least one of <i>expression1</i> and <i>expression2</i> are
             true.

       <b>( </b><i>expression</i> <b>)</b>
             True if <i>expression</i> is true.

       In evaluating these more complex combined expressions, the
       following precedence rules are used:

        *  The unary primaries have higher precedence than the algebraic
           binary primaries.

        *  The unary primaries have lower precedence than the string
           binary primaries.

        *  The unary and binary primaries have higher precedence than
           the unary <i>string</i> primary.

        *  The <b>!  </b>operator has higher precedence than the <b>-a </b>operator,
           and the <b>-a </b>operator has higher precedence than the <b>-o</b>
           operator.

        *  The <b>-a </b>and <b>-o </b>operators are left associative.

        *  The parentheses can be used to alter the normal precedence
           and associativity.

       The BSD and System V versions of <b>-f </b>are not the same. The BSD
       definition was:

       <b>-f </b><i>file</i>   True if <i>file</i> exists and is not a directory.

       The SVID version (true if the file exists and is a regular file)
       was chosen for this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because its use is
       consistent with the <b>-b</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-p </b>operands (<i>file</i> exists and
       is a specific file type).

       The <b>-e </b>primary, possessing similar functionality to that provided
       by the C shell, was added because it provides the only way for a
       shell script to find out if a file exists without trying to open
       the file. Since implementations are allowed to add additional
       file types, a portable script cannot use:

           test -b foo -o -c foo -o -d foo -o -f foo -o -p foo

       to find out if <b>foo </b>is an existing file. On historical BSD
       systems, the existence of a file could be determined by:

           test -f foo -o -d foo

       but there was no easy way to determine that an existing file was
       a regular file. An early proposal used the KornShell <b>-a </b>primary
       (with the same meaning), but this was changed to <b>-e </b>because there
       were concerns about the high probability of humans confusing the
       <b>-a </b>primary with the <b>-a </b>binary operator.

       The following options were not included in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, although they are provided by some implementations.
       These operands should not be used by new implementations for
       other purposes:

       <b>-k </b><i>file</i>   True if <i>file</i> exists and its sticky bit is set.

       <b>-C </b><i>file</i>   True if <i>file</i> is a contiguous file.

       <b>-V </b><i>file</i>   True if <i>file</i> is a version file.

       The following option was not included because it was undocumented
       in most implementations, has been removed from some
       implementations (including System V), and the functionality is
       provided by the shell (see <i>Section 2.6.2</i>, <i>Parameter Expansion</i>.

       <b>-l </b><i>string</i> The length of the string <i>string</i>.

       The <b>-b</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-u</b>, and <b>-x </b>operands are derived from the
       SVID; historical BSD does not provide them. The <b>-k </b>operand is
       derived from System V; historical BSD does not provide it.

       On historical BSD systems, <i>test</i> <b>-w </b><i>directory</i> always returned
       false because <i>test</i> tried to open the directory for writing, which
       always fails.

       Some additional primaries newly invented or from the KornShell
       appeared in an early proposal as part of the conditional command
       (<b>[[]]</b>): <i>s1</i> <b>&gt; </b><i>s2</i>, <i>s1</i> <b>&lt; </b><i>s2</i>, <i>str</i> <b>= </b><i>pattern</i>, <i>str</i> <b>!= </b><i>pattern</i>, <i>f1</i> <b>-nt</b>
       <i>f2</i>, <i>f1</i> <b>-ot </b><i>f2</i>, and <i>f1</i> <b>-ef </b><i>f2</i>.  They were not carried forward into
       the <i>test</i> utility when the conditional command was removed from
       the shell because they have not been included in the <i>test</i> utility
       built into historical implementations of the <i>sh</i> utility.

       The <b>-t </b><i>file_descriptor</i> primary is shown with a mandatory argument
       because the grammar is ambiguous if it can be omitted. Historical
       implementations have allowed it to be omitted, providing a
       default of 1.

       It is noted that <b>'[' </b>is not part of the portable filename
       character set; however, since it is required to be encoded by a
       single byte, and is part of the portable character set, the name
       of this utility forms a character string across all supported
       locales.
