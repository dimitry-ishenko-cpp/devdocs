</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogmv </b>- move (rename) Performance Co-Pilot archive files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlogmv </b>[<b>-cfNV?</b>]  <i>oldname newname</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive consists of multiple files
       as created by <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>.  <b>pmlogmv </b>allows all the files of a
       single PCP archive to be moved or renamed as a group in a single
       operation.

       The <i>oldname</i> argument identifies the target archive, and may be
       either the basename that is common to all files in that archive
       or one of the archive's files.  The new archive's basename is
       <i>newname</i>.

       Because PCP archives are important records of system activity,
       special care is taken to ensure the integrity of an archive's
       files.  For recoverable problems encountered during the execution
       of <b>pmlogmv</b>, all the files associated with <i>oldname</i> will be
       preserved, and no new files with the <i>newname</i> prefix will be
       created.  ``Recoverable problems'' include signals that can be
       caught (such as SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM), permissions
       issues, new files already existing, file system full events, etc.

       The implementation of <b>pmlogmv </b>tries to use hard links in the file
       system and so follows the semantic restrictions of <b>ln</b>(2) which
       for most systems means the directories containing both the
       <i>oldname</i> and the <i>newname</i> PCP archive files need to be within the
       <b>same </b>file system.  When this is not possible, <b>pmlogmv </b>falls back
       to using <a href="cp.1.html">cp(1)</a> to copy <i>oldname</i> to <i>newname</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--checksum</b>
            Paranoid checking mode when <a href="cp.1.html">cp(1)</a> is needed and each file's
            checksum is computed for the original file and the copied
            file, and the checksums must match before the copy is
            considered acceptable.  The checksum command is chosen by
            trying the following in turn until one is found to be
            executable: <a href="md5sum.1.html">md5sum(1)</a>, <a href="sha256sum.1.html">sha256sum(1)</a>, <a href="sha1sum.1.html">sha1sum(1)</a> and <a href="sum.1.html">sum(1)</a>.
            If no executable checksum command is found, a warning is
            issued and the checksum check is skipped.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
            Normally <b>pmlogmv </b>takes a conservative view in respect of
            <i>newname</i> and will not proceed if <i>newname</i> contains any
            characters that are likely to cause a problem for <b>sh</b>(1).
            This includes ``glob'' characters like ``?'', ``*'' and
            ``['', shell syntax meta characters like ``('', ``|'', ``;''
            and ``&amp;'', shell I/O redirection characters like ``&lt;'' and
            ``&gt;'', the dollar sign, a space, etc.

            The <b>-f </b>flag forces <b>pmlogmv </b>to proceed, even if <i>newname</i>
            contains any of these ``unsafe'' characters.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--showme</b>
            Perform a dry-run, checking and reporting what changes would
            be made without making any changes.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
            Enable verbose mode.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.

DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       All error and warning messages are intended to be easily
       understood and errors produce a non-zero exit status.
