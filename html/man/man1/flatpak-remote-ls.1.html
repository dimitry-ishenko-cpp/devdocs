</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-remote-ls - Show available runtimes and applications
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak remote-ls </b>[OPTION...] [REMOTE]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Shows runtimes and applications that are available in the remote
       repository with the name REMOTE, or all remotes if one isn't
       specified. You can find all configured remote repositories with
       <b>flatpak remotes</b>.

       REMOTE can be a file:// URI pointing to a local repository
       instead of a remote name.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--system</b>, <b>--user</b>, or <b>--installation</b>
       options, this command uses either the default system-wide
       installation or the per-user one, depending on which has the
       specified REMOTE.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Use the per-user configuration.

       <b>--system</b>
           Use the default system-wide configuration.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Use a system-wide installation specified by NAME among those
           defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
           <b>--installation=default </b>is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--cached</b>
           Prefer to use locally cached information if possible, even
           though it may be out of date. This is faster, but risks
           returning stale information.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--show-details</b>
           Show arches, branches and commit ids, in addition to the
           names. Equivalent to <b>--columns=all</b>.

       <b>--runtime</b>
           Show only runtimes, omit applications.

       <b>--app</b>
           Show only applications, omit runtimes.

       <b>--all</b>, <b>-a</b>
           Show everything. By default locale and debug extensions as
           well as secondary arches when the primary arch is available
           are hidden.

       <b>--updates</b>
           Show only those which have updates available.

       <b>--arch=ARCH</b>
           Show only those matching the specified architecture. By
           default, only supported architectures are shown. Use <b>--arch=*</b>
           to show all architectures. See <b>flatpak --supported-arches </b>for
           architectures supported by the host.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.

       <b>--app-runtime=RUNTIME</b>
           List applications that use the given runtime

       <b>--columns=FIELD,...</b>
           Specify what information to show about each ref. You can list
           multiple fields, or use this option multiple times.

           Append :s[tart], :m[iddle], :e[nd] or :f[ull] to column names
           to change ellipsization.
