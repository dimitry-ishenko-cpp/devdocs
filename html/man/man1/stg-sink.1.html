NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-sink - Move patches deeper in the stack
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg sink</i> [OPTIONS] [patch]...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Move the specified patches down the stack.

       If no patch is specified on the command line, the current
       (topmost) patch is sunk. By default, patches are sunk to the
       bottom of the stack, but the <i>--above</i> or <i>--below</i> (alias <i>--to</i>)
       options may be used to place them above or below any applied
       patch.

       Internally, sinking involves popping all patches to the bottom
       (or to the target patch if <i>--above</i> or <i>--below</i> is used), then
       pushing the patches to sink, and then, unless <i>--nopush</i> is
       specified, pushing back any other formerly applied patches.

       Sinking may be useful, for example, to group stable patches at
       the bottom of the stack where they less likely to be impacted by
       the push of another patch, and from where they can be more easily
       committed or pushed to another repository.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -n, --nopush
           Do not push any formerly applied patches after sinking. Only
           the patches to sink are pushed.

       -t &lt;target&gt;, --below=&lt;target&gt;, --to=&lt;target&gt;
           Sink patches below &lt;target&gt; patch.

           Specified patches are placed below &lt;target&gt; instead of at the
           bottom of the stack.

       -T &lt;target&gt;, --above=&lt;target&gt;
           Sink patches above &lt;target&gt; patch.

           Specified patches are placed above &lt;target&gt; instead of at the
           bottom of the stack.

       -k, --keep
           Keep the local changes

       --committer-date-is-author-date
           Instead of using the current time as the committer date, use
           the author date of the commit as the committer date.
