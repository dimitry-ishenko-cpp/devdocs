</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmsignal </b>- send a signal to one or more processes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsignal </b>[<b>-alnp</b>] [<b>-s </b><i>signal</i>] [<i>PID</i> ...|<i>name</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmsignal </b>provides a cross-platform event signalling mechanism for
       use with tools from the Performance Co-Pilot toolkit.  It can be
       used to send a named <i>signal</i> (only HUP, USR1, TERM, and KILL are
       accepted) to one or more processes.

       The processes are specified directly using PIDs or as program
       names (with either the <b>-a </b>or <b>-p </b>options).  In the <b>all </b>case, the
       set of all running processes is searched for a <a href="basename.1.html">basename(1)</a> match
       on <i>name</i>.  In the <b>program </b>case, process identifiers are extracted
       from files in the $PCP_RUN_DIR directory where file names are
       matched on <i>name</i>.pid.

       The <b>-n </b>option reports the list of process identifiers that would
       have been signalled, but no signals are actually sent.

       If a <i>signal</i> is not specified, then the TERM signal will be sent.
       The list of supported signals is reported when using the <b>-l</b>
       option.

       On Linux and UNIX platforms, <i>pmsignal</i> is a simple wrapper around
       the <a href="kill.1.html">kill(1)</a> command.  On Windows, the is no direct equivalent to
       this mechanism, and so an alternate mechanism has been
       implemented - this is only honoured by PCP tools, however, not
       all Windows utilities.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The available command line options are:

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
            Send signal to all named processes.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
            List supported signals.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
            List processes that would be affected.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--program</b>
            Extract programs from PCP runtime PID files.

       <b>-s </b><i>signal</i>, <b>--signal</b>=<i>signal</i>
            Specify the signal to send, one of: HUP, USR1, TERM, KILL.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
            Display usage message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
