</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       read — read from standard input into shell variables
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       read <b>[</b>-r<b>] </b><i>var</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>read</i> utility shall read a single logical line from standard
       input into one or more shell variables.

       By default, unless the <b>-r </b>option is specified, &lt;backslash&gt; shall
       act as an escape character. An unescaped &lt;backslash&gt; shall
       preserve the literal value of the following character, with the
       exception of a &lt;newline&gt;.  If a &lt;newline&gt; follows the
       &lt;backslash&gt;, the <i>read</i> utility shall interpret this as line
       continuation. The &lt;backslash&gt; and &lt;newline&gt; shall be removed
       before splitting the input into fields. All other unescaped
       &lt;backslash&gt; characters shall be removed after splitting the input
       into fields.

       If standard input is a terminal device and the invoking shell is
       interactive, <i>read</i> shall prompt for a continuation line when it
       reads an input line ending with a &lt;backslash&gt; &lt;newline&gt;, unless
       the <b>-r </b>option is specified.

       The terminating &lt;newline&gt; (if any) shall be removed from the
       input and the results shall be split into fields as in the shell
       for the results of parameter expansion (see <i>Section 2.6.5</i>, <i>Field</i>
       <i>Splitting</i>); the first field shall be assigned to the first
       variable <i>var</i>, the second field to the second variable <i>var</i>, and so
       on. If there are fewer fields than there are <i>var</i> operands, the
       remaining <i>var</i>s shall be set to empty strings. If there are fewer
       <i>var</i>s than fields, the last <i>var</i> shall be set to a value comprising
       the following elements:

        *  The field that corresponds to the last <i>var</i> in the normal
           assignment sequence described above

        *  The delimiter(s) that follow the field corresponding to the
           last <i>var</i>

        *  The remaining fields and their delimiters, with trailing <i>IFS</i>
           white space ignored

       The setting of variables specified by the <i>var</i> operands shall
       affect the current shell execution environment; see <i>Section 2.12</i>,
       <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>.  If it is called in a subshell or
       separate utility execution environment, such as one of the
       following:

           (read foo)
           nohup read ...
           find . -exec read ... \;

       it shall not affect the shell variables in the caller's
       environment.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>read</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option is supported:

       <b>-r        </b>Do not treat a &lt;backslash&gt; character in any special
                 way. Consider each &lt;backslash&gt; to be part of the input
                 line.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>var</i>       The name of an existing or nonexisting shell variable.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be a text file.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>read</i>:

       <i>IFS</i>       Determine the internal field separators used to delimit
                 fields; see <i>Section 2.5.3</i>, <i>Shell Variables</i>.

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>PS2</i>       Provide the prompt string that an interactive shell
                 shall write to standard error when a line ending with a
                 &lt;backslash&gt; &lt;newline&gt; is read and the <b>-r </b>option was not
                 specified.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and
       prompts for continued input.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    End-of-file was detected or an error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>-r </b>option is included to enable <i>read</i> to subsume the purpose
       of the <i>line</i> utility, which is not included in POSIX.1‐2008.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following command:

           while read -r xx yy
           do
               printf "%s %s\n$yy$xx"
           done &lt; <i>input_file</i>

       prints a file with the first field of each line moved to the end
       of the line.
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>read</i> utility historically has been a shell built-in. It was
       separated off into its own utility to take advantage of the
       richer description of functionality introduced by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017.

       Since <i>read</i> affects the current shell execution environment, it is
       generally provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called
       in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as
       one of the following:

           (read foo)
           nohup read ...
           find . -exec read ... \;

       it does not affect the shell variables in the environment of the
       caller.

       Although the standard input is required to be a text file, and
       therefore will always end with a &lt;newline&gt; (unless it is an empty
       file), the processing of continuation lines when the <b>-r </b>option is
       not used can result in the input not ending with a &lt;newline&gt;.
       This occurs if the last line of the input file ends with a
       &lt;backslash&gt; &lt;newline&gt;.  It is for this reason that ``if any'' is
       used in ``The terminating &lt;newline&gt; (if any) shall be removed
       from the input'' in the description.  It is not a relaxation of
       the requirement for standard input to be a text file.
