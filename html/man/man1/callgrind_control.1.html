</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       callgrind_control - observe and control programs being run by
       Callgrind
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>callgrind_control </b>[<i>options</i>] [<i>pid|program-name</i>...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>callgrind_control </b>controls programs being run by the Valgrind
       tool Callgrind. When a <b>pid/program name </b>argument is not
       specified, all applications currently being run by Callgrind on
       this system will be used for actions given by the specified
       option(s). The default action is to give some brief information
       about the applications being run by Callgrind.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-h --help</b>
           Show a short description, usage, and summary of options.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show version of callgrind_control.

       <b>-l --long</b>
           Show also the working directory, in addition to the brief
           information given by default.

       <b>-s --stat</b>
           Show statistics information about active Callgrind runs.

       <b>-b --back</b>
           Show stack/back traces of each thread in active Callgrind
           runs. For each active function in the stack trace, also the
           number of invocations since program start (or last dump) is
           shown. This option can be combined with -e to show inclusive
           cost of active functions.

       <b>-e [A,B,...]  </b>(default: all)
           Show the current per-thread, exclusive cost values of event
           counters. If no explicit event names are given, figures for
           all event types which are collected in the given Callgrind
           run are shown. Otherwise, only figures for event types A, B,
           ... are shown. If this option is combined with -b, inclusive
           cost for the functions of each active stack frame is
           provided, too.

       <b>--dump[=&lt;desc&gt;]  </b>(default: no description)
           Request the dumping of profile information. Optionally, a
           description can be specified which is written into the dump
           as part of the information giving the reason which triggered
           the dump action. This can be used to distinguish multiple
           dumps.

       <b>-z --zero</b>
           Zero all event counters.

       <b>-k --kill</b>
           Force a Callgrind run to be terminated.

       <b>--instr=&lt;on|off&gt;</b>
           Switch instrumentation mode on or off. If a Callgrind run has
           instrumentation disabled, no simulation is done and no events
           are counted. This is useful to skip uninteresting program
           parts, as there is much less slowdown (same as with the
           Valgrind tool "none"). See also the Callgrind option
           <b>--instr-atstart</b>.

       <b>--vgdb-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
           Specify the vgdb prefix to use by callgrind_control.
           callgrind_control internally uses vgdb to find and control
           the active Callgrind runs. If the <b>--vgdb-prefix </b>option was
           used for launching valgrind, then the same option must be
           given to callgrind_control.
