NAME </h2>
<pre>
       resolvectl, resolvconf - Resolve domain names, IPV4 and IPv6
       addresses, DNS resource records, and services; introspect and
       reconfigure the DNS resolver
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>resolvectl </b>[OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>resolvectl </b>may be used to resolve domain names, IPv4 and IPv6
       addresses, DNS resource records and services with the
       <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a> resolver service. By default, the
       specified list of parameters will be resolved as hostnames,
       retrieving their IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If the parameters
       specified are formatted as IPv4 or IPv6 addresses the reverse
       operation is done, and a hostname is retrieved for the specified
       addresses.

       The program's output contains information about the protocol used
       for the look-up and on which network interface the data was
       discovered. It also contains information on whether the
       information could be authenticated. All data for which local
       DNSSEC validation succeeds is considered authenticated. Moreover
       all data originating from local, trusted sources is also reported
       authenticated, including resolution of the local host name, the
       "localhost" hostname or all data from /etc/hosts.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>query </b><i>HOSTNAME|ADDRESS</i>...
           Resolve domain names, as well as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
           When used in conjunction with <b>--type= </b>or <b>--class= </b>(see
           below), resolves low-level DNS resource records.

           If a single-label domain name is specified it is searched for
           according to the configured search domains — unless
           <b>--search=no </b>or <b>--type=</b>/<b>--class= </b>are specified, both of which
           turn this logic off.

           If an international domain name is specified, it is
           automatically translated according to IDNA rules when
           resolved via classic DNS — but not for look-ups via
           MulticastDNS or LLMNR. If <b>--type=</b>/<b>--class= </b>is used IDNA
           translation is turned off and domain names are processed as
           specified.

           If combined with <b>--json= </b>(only supported in combination with
           <b>--type=</b>) will output the resource record data in a JSON
           object.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>service </b>[[<i>NAME</i>] <i>TYPE</i>] <i>DOMAIN</i>
           Resolve <b>RFC 6763 DNS-SD</b>[1] and <b>RFC 2782 SRV</b>[2] services,
           depending on the specified list of parameters. If three
           parameters are passed the first is assumed to be the DNS-SD
           service name, the second the <b>SRV </b>service type, and the third
           the domain to search in. In this case a full DNS-SD style <b>SRV</b>
           and <b>TXT </b>lookup is executed. If only two parameters are
           specified, the first is assumed to be the <b>SRV </b>service type,
           and the second the domain to look in. In this case no <b>TXT</b>
           resource record is requested. Finally, if only one parameter
           is specified, it is assumed to be a domain name, that is
           already prefixed with an <b>SRV </b>type, and an <b>SRV </b>lookup is done
           (no <b>TXT</b>).

           Added in version 239.

       <b>openpgp </b><i>EMAIL@DOMAIN</i>...
           Query PGP keys stored as <b>OPENPGPKEY </b>resource records, see <b>RFC</b>
           <b>7929</b>[3]. Specified e-mail addresses are converted to the
           corresponding DNS domain name, and any <b>OPENPGPKEY </b>keys are
           printed.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>tlsa </b>[<i>FAMILY</i>] <i>DOMAIN</i>[:<i>PORT</i>]...
           Query TLS public keys stored as <b>TLSA </b>resource records, see
           <b>RFC 6698</b>[4]. A query will be performed for each of the
           specified names prefixed with the port and family
           ("_<i>port</i>._<i>family</i>.<i>domain</i>"). The port number may be specified
           after a colon (":"), otherwise <b>443 </b>will be used by default.
           The family may be specified as the first argument, otherwise
           <b>tcp </b>will be used.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>status </b>[<i>LINK</i>...]
           Shows the global and per-link DNS settings currently in
           effect. If no command is specified, this is the implied
           default.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>statistics</b>
           Shows general resolver statistics, including information
           whether DNSSEC is enabled and available, as well as
           resolution and validation statistics.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>reset-statistics</b>
           Resets the statistics counters shown in <b>statistics </b>to zero.
           This operation requires root privileges.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>flush-caches</b>
           Flushes all DNS resource record caches the service maintains
           locally. This is mostly equivalent to sending the <b>SIGUSR2 </b>to
           the <b>systemd-resolved </b>service.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>reset-server-features</b>
           Flushes all feature level information the resolver learnt
           about specific servers, and ensures that the server feature
           probing logic is started from the beginning with the next
           look-up request. This is mostly equivalent to sending the
           <b>SIGRTMIN+1 </b>to the <b>systemd-resolved </b>service.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>dns </b>[<i>LINK</i> [<i>SERVER</i>...]], <b>domain </b>[<i>LINK</i> [<i>DOMAIN</i>...]], <b>default-route</b>
       [<i>LINK</i> [<i>BOOL</i>...]], <b>llmnr </b>[<i>LINK</i> [<i>MODE</i>]], <b>mdns </b>[<i>LINK</i> [<i>MODE</i>]], <b>dnssec</b>
       [<i>LINK</i> [<i>MODE</i>]], <b>dnsovertls </b>[<i>LINK</i> [<i>MODE</i>]], <b>nta </b>[<i>LINK</i> [<i>DOMAIN</i>...]]
           Get/set per-interface DNS configuration. These commands may
           be used to configure various DNS settings for network
           interfaces. These commands may be used to inform
           <b>systemd-resolved </b>or <b>systemd-networkd </b>about per-interface DNS
           configuration determined through external means. The <b>dns</b>
           command expects IPv4 or IPv6 address specifications of DNS
           servers to use. Each address can optionally take a port
           number separated with ":", a network interface name or index
           separated with "%", and a Server Name Indication (SNI)
           separated with "#". When IPv6 address is specified with a
           port number, then the address must be in the square brackets.
           That is, the acceptable full formats are
           "111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv4 and
           "[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv6. The
           <b>domain </b>command expects valid DNS domains, possibly prefixed
           with "~", and configures a per-interface search or route-only
           domain. The <b>default-route </b>command expects a boolean
           parameter, and configures whether the link may be used as
           default route for DNS lookups, i.e. if it is suitable for
           lookups on domains no other link explicitly is configured
           for. The <b>llmnr</b>, <b>mdns</b>, <b>dnssec </b>and <b>dnsovertls </b>commands may be
           used to configure the per-interface LLMNR, MulticastDNS,
           DNSSEC and DNSOverTLS settings. Finally, <b>nta </b>command may be
           used to configure additional per-interface DNSSEC NTA
           domains.

           Commands <b>dns</b>, <b>domain </b>and <b>nta </b>can take a single empty string
           argument to clear their respective value lists.

           For details about these settings, their possible values and
           their effect, see the corresponding settings in
           <a href="../man5/systemd.network.5.html">systemd.network(5)</a>.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>revert </b><i>LINK</i>
           Revert the per-interface DNS configuration. If the DNS
           configuration is reverted all per-interface DNS setting are
           reset to their defaults, undoing all effects of <b>dns</b>, <b>domain</b>,
           <b>default-route</b>, <b>llmnr</b>, <b>mdns</b>, <b>dnssec</b>, <b>dnsovertls</b>, <b>nta</b>. Note
           that when a network interface disappears all configuration is
           lost automatically, an explicit reverting is not necessary in
           that case.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>monitor</b>
           Show a continuous stream of local client resolution queries
           and their responses. Whenever a local query is completed the
           query's DNS resource lookup key and resource records are
           shown. Note that this displays queries issued locally only,
           and does not immediately relate to DNS requests submitted to
           configured DNS servers or the LLMNR or MulticastDNS zones, as
           lookups may be answered from the local cache, or might result
           in multiple DNS transactions (for example to validate DNSSEC
           information). If CNAME/CNAME redirection chains are followed,
           a separate query will be displayed for each element of the
           chain. Use <b>--json= </b>to enable JSON output.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>show-cache</b>
           Show current cache content, per scope. Use <b>--json= </b>to enable
           JSON output.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>show-server-state</b>
           Show detailed server state information, per DNS Server. Use
           <b>--json= </b>to enable JSON output.

           Added in version 255.

       <b>log-level </b>[<i>LEVEL</i>]
           If no argument is given, print the current log level of the
           manager. If an optional argument <i>LEVEL</i> is provided, then the
           command changes the current log level of the manager to <i>LEVEL</i>
           (accepts the same values as <b>--log-level= </b>described in
           <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>).

           Added in version 244.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-4</b>, <b>-6</b>
           By default, when resolving a hostname, both IPv4 and IPv6
           addresses are acquired. By specifying <b>-4 </b>only IPv4 addresses
           are requested, by specifying <b>-6 </b>only IPv6 addresses are
           requested.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-i </b><i>INTERFACE</i>, <b>--interface=</b><i>INTERFACE</i>
           Specifies the network interface to execute the query on. This
           may either be specified as numeric interface index or as
           network interface string (e.g.  "en0"). Note that this option
           has no effect if system-wide DNS configuration (as configured
           in /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/systemd/resolved.conf) in place
           of per-link configuration is used.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-p </b><i>PROTOCOL</i>, <b>--protocol=</b><i>PROTOCOL</i>
           Specifies the network protocol for the query. May be one of
           "dns" (i.e. classic unicast DNS), "llmnr" (<b>Link-Local</b>
           <b>Multicast Name Resolution</b>[5]), "llmnr-ipv4", "llmnr-ipv6"
           (LLMNR via the indicated underlying IP protocols), "mdns"
           (<b>Multicast DNS</b>[6]), "mdns-ipv4", "mdns-ipv6" (MDNS via the
           indicated underlying IP protocols). By default the lookup is
           done via all protocols suitable for the lookup. If used,
           limits the set of protocols that may be used. Use this option
           multiple times to enable resolving via multiple protocols at
           the same time. The setting "llmnr" is identical to specifying
           this switch once with "llmnr-ipv4" and once via "llmnr-ipv6".
           Note that this option does not force the service to resolve
           the operation with the specified protocol, as that might
           require a suitable network interface and configuration. The
           special value "help" may be used to list known values.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-t </b><i>TYPE</i>, <b>--type=</b><i>TYPE</i>, <b>-c </b><i>CLASS</i>, <b>--class=</b><i>CLASS</i>
           When used in conjunction with the <b>query </b>command, specifies
           the DNS resource record type (e.g.  <b>A</b>, <b>AAAA</b>, <b>MX</b>, ...) and
           class (e.g.  <b>IN</b>, <b>ANY</b>, ...) to look up. If these options are
           used a DNS resource record set matching the specified class
           and type is requested. The class defaults to <b>IN </b>if only a
           type is specified. The special value "help" may be used to
           list known values.

           Without these options <b>resolvectl query </b>provides high-level
           domain name to address and address to domain name resolution.
           With these options it provides low-level DNS resource record
           resolution. The search domain logic is automatically turned
           off when these options are used, i.e. specified domain names
           need to be fully qualified domain names. Moreover, IDNA
           internal domain name translation is turned off as well, i.e.
           international domain names should be specified in "xn--..."
           notation, unless look-up in MulticastDNS/LLMNR is desired, in
           which case UTF-8 characters should be used.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--service-address=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), when doing
           a service lookup with <b>--service </b>the hostnames contained in
           the <b>SRV </b>resource records are resolved as well.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--service-txt=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), when doing
           a DNS-SD service lookup with <b>--service </b>the <b>TXT </b>service
           metadata record is resolved as well.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--cname=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), DNS <b>CNAME</b>
           or <b>DNAME </b>redirections are followed. Otherwise, if a CNAME or
           DNAME record is encountered while resolving, an error is
           returned.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--validate=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If
           true (the default), DNSSEC validation is applied as usual —
           under the condition that it is enabled for the network and
           for systemd-resolved.service as a whole. If false, DNSSEC
           validation is disabled for the specific query, regardless of
           whether it is enabled for the network or in the service. Note
           that setting this option to true does not force DNSSEC
           validation on systems/networks where DNSSEC is turned off.
           This option is only suitable to turn off such validation
           where otherwise enabled, not enable validation where
           otherwise disabled.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--synthesize=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If
           true (the default), select domains are resolved on the local
           system, among them "localhost", "_gateway", "_outbound",
           "_localdnsstub" and "_localdnsproxy" or entries from
           /etc/hosts. If false these domains are not resolved locally,
           and either fail (in case of "localhost", "_gateway" or
           "_outbound" and suchlike) or go to the network via regular
           DNS/mDNS/LLMNR lookups (in case of /etc/hosts entries).

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--cache=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If
           true (the default), lookups use the local DNS resource record
           cache. If false, lookups are routed to the network instead,
           regardless if already available in the local cache.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--zone=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If
           true (the default), lookups are answered from locally
           registered LLMNR or mDNS resource records, if defined. If
           false, locally registered LLMNR/mDNS records are not
           considered for the lookup request.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--trust-anchor=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If
           true (the default), lookups for DS and DNSKEY are answered
           from the local DNSSEC trust anchors if possible. If false,
           the local trust store is not considered for the lookup
           request.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--network=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If
           true (the default), lookups are answered via DNS, LLMNR or
           mDNS network requests if they cannot be synthesized locally,
           or be answered from the local cache, zone or trust anchors
           (see above). If false, the request is not answered from the
           network and will thus fail if none of the indicated sources
           can answer them.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--search=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), any
           specified single-label hostnames will be searched in the
           domains configured in the search domain list, if it is
           non-empty. Otherwise, the search domain logic is disabled.
           Note that this option has no effect if <b>--type= </b>is used (see
           above), in which case the search domain logic is
           unconditionally turned off.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--raw</b>[=payload|packet]
           Dump the answer as binary data. If there is no argument or if
           the argument is "payload", the payload of the packet is
           exported. If the argument is "packet", the whole packet is
           dumped in wire format, prefixed by length specified as a
           little-endian 64-bit number. This format allows multiple
           packets to be dumped and unambiguously parsed.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--legend=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter. If true (the default), column
           headers and meta information about the query response are
           shown. Otherwise, this output is suppressed.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--stale-data=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If
           true (the default), lookups are answered with stale data
           (expired resource records) if possible. If false, the stale
           data is not considered for the lookup request.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--relax-single-label=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Takes a boolean parameter; used in conjunction with <b>query</b>. If
           true, rules regarding routing of single-label names are
           relaxed. Defaults to false. By default, lookups of single
           label names are assumed to refer to local hosts to be
           resolved via local resolution such as LLMNR or via search
           domain qualification and are not routed to upstream servers
           as is. If this option is enabled these rules are disabled and
           the queries are routed upstream anyway. Also see the
           <i>ResolveUnicastSingleLabel=</i> option in <a href="../man5/resolved.conf.5.html">resolved.conf(5)</a> which
           provides a system-wide option that controls this behaviour.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--json=</b><i>MODE</i>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for
           the shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace
           or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same,
           with indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON
           output, the default).

       <b>-j</b>
           Equivalent to <b>--json=pretty </b>if running on a terminal, and
           <b>--json=short </b>otherwise.

COMPATIBILITY WITH RESOLVCONF(8) </h2>
<pre>
       <b>resolvectl </b>is a multi-call binary. When invoked as "resolvconf"
       (generally achieved by means of a symbolic link of this name to
       the <b>resolvectl </b>binary) it is run in a limited <b>resolvconf</b>(8)
       compatibility mode. It accepts mostly the same arguments and
       pushes all data into <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>, similar to how
       <b>dns </b>and <b>domain </b>commands operate. Note that
       <b>systemd-resolved.service </b>is the only supported backend, which is
       different from other implementations of this command.

       /etc/resolv.conf will only be updated with servers added with
       this command when /etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to
       /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf, and not a static file. See the
       discussion of /etc/resolv.conf handling in
       <a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service(8)</a>.

       Not all operations supported by other implementations are
       supported natively. Specifically:

       <b>-a</b>
           Registers per-interface DNS configuration data with
           <b>systemd-resolved</b>. Expects a network interface name as only
           command line argument. Reads <a href="../man5/resolv.conf.5.html">resolv.conf(5)</a>-compatible DNS
           configuration data from its standard input. Relevant fields
           are "nameserver" and "domain"/"search". This command is
           mostly identical to invoking <b>resolvectl </b>with a combination of
           <b>dns </b>and <b>domain </b>commands.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-d</b>
           Unregisters per-interface DNS configuration data with
           <b>systemd-resolved</b>. This command is mostly identical to
           invoking <b>resolvectl revert</b>.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-f</b>
           When specified <b>-a </b>and <b>-d </b>will not complain about missing
           network interfaces and will silently execute no operation in
           that case.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-x</b>
           This switch for "exclusive" operation is supported only
           partially. It is mapped to an additional configured search
           domain of "~."  — i.e. ensures that DNS traffic is preferably
           routed to the DNS servers on this interface, unless there are
           other, more specific domains configured on other interfaces.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>-p</b>
           These switches are not supported and are silently ignored.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>-I</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-v</b>, <b>-V</b>, <b>--enable-updates</b>,
       <b>--disable-updates</b>, <b>--are-updates-enabled</b>
           These switches are not supported and the command will fail if
           used.

           Added in version 239.

       See <b>resolvconf</b>(8) for details on those command line options.
