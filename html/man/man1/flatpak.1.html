       flatpak - Build, install and run applications and runtimes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak </b>[OPTION...] {COMMAND}
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Flatpak is a tool for managing applications and the runtimes they
       use. In the Flatpak model, applications can be built and
       distributed independently from the host system they are used on,
       and they are isolated from the host system ('sandboxed') to some
       degree, at runtime.

       Flatpak can operate in system-wide or per-user mode. The
       system-wide data (runtimes, applications and configuration) is
       located in $prefix/var/lib/flatpak/, and the per-user data is in
       $HOME/.local/share/flatpak/. Below these locations, there is a
       local repository in the repo/ subdirectory and installed runtimes
       and applications are in the corresponding runtime/ and app/
       subdirectories.

       System-wide remotes can be statically preconfigured by dropping
       <a href="../man5/flatpakrepo.5.html">flatpakrepo(5)</a> files into /etc/flatpak/remotes.d/.

       In addition to the system-wide installation in
       $prefix/var/lib/flatpak/, which is always considered the default
       one unless overridden, more system-wide installations can be
       defined via configuration files in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/,
       which must define at least the id of the installation and the
       absolute path to it. Other optional parameters like DisplayName,
       Priority or StorageType are also supported.

       Flatpak uses OSTree to distribute and deploy data. The
       repositories it uses are OSTree repositories and can be
       manipulated with the <b>ostree </b>utility. Installed runtimes and
       applications are OSTree checkouts.

       Basic commands for building flatpaks such as build-init, build
       and build-finish are included in the flatpak utility. For
       higher-level build support, see the separate <b>flatpak-builder</b>(1)
       tool.

       Flatpak supports installing from sideload repos. These are
       partial copies of a repository (generated by <b>flatpak create-usb</b>)
       that are used as an installation source when offline (and online
       as a performance improvement). Such repositories are configured
       by creating symlinks to the sideload sources in the
       sideload-repos subdirectory of the installation directory (i.e.
       typically /var/lib/flatpak/sideload-repos or
       ~/.local/share/flatpak/sideload-repos). Additionally symlinks can
       be created in /run/flatpak/sideload-repos which is a better
       location for non-persistent sources (as it is cleared on reboot).
       These symlinks can point to either the directory given to <b>flatpak</b>
       <b>create-usb </b>which by default writes to the subpath .ostree/repo,
       or directly to an ostree repo.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following global options are understood. Individual commands
       have their own options.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Show debug information during command processing. Use -vv for
           more detail.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Show OSTree debug information during command processing.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print version information and exit.

       <b>--default-arch</b>
           Print the default arch and exit.

       <b>--supported-arches</b>
           Print the supported arches in priority order and exit.

       <b>--gl-drivers</b>
           Print the list of active gl drivers and exit.

       <b>--installations</b>
           Print paths of system installations and exit.

       <b>--print-system-only</b>
           When the <b>flatpak --print-updated-env </b>command is run, only
           print the environment for system flatpak installations, not
           including the user’s home installation.

       <b>--print-updated-env</b>
           Print the set of environment variables needed to use
           flatpaks, amending the current set of environment variables.
           This is intended to be used in a systemd environment
           generator, and should not need to be run manually.

</pre> <h2>
FILE FORMATS </h2>
<pre>
       File formats that are used by Flatpak commands:

       <a href="../man5/flatpakref.5.html">flatpakref(5)</a>
           Reference to a remote for an application or runtime

       <a href="../man5/flatpakrepo.5.html">flatpakrepo(5)</a>
           Reference to a remote

       <a href="../man5/flatpak-remote.5.html">flatpak-remote(5)</a>
           Configuration for a remote

       <a href="../man5/flatpak-installation.5.html">flatpak-installation(5)</a>
           Configuration for an installation location

       <a href="../man5/flatpak-metadata.5.html">flatpak-metadata(5)</a>
           Information about an application or runtime
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Besides standard environment variables such as <b>XDG_DATA_DIRS </b>and
       <b>XDG_DATA_HOME</b>, flatpak is consulting some of its own.

       <b>FLATPAK_USER_DIR</b>
           The location of the per-user installation. If this is not
           set, $XDG_DATA_HOME/flatpak is used.

       <b>FLATPAK_SYSTEM_DIR</b>
           The location of the default system-wide installation. If this
           is not set, /var/lib/flatpak is used (unless overridden at
           build time by --localstatedir or --with-system-install-dir).

       <b>FLATPAK_SYSTEM_CACHE_DIR</b>
           The location where temporary child repositories will be
           created during pulls into the system-wide installation. If
           this is not set, a directory in /var/tmp/ is used. This is
           useful because it is more likely to be on the same filesystem
           as the system repository (thus increasing the chances for
           e.g. reflink copying), and we can avoid filling the user's
           home directory with temporary data.

       <b>FLATPAK_CONFIG_DIR</b>
           The location of flatpak site configuration. If this is not
           set, /etc/flatpak is used (unless overridden at build time by
           --sysconfdir).

       <b>FLATPAK_RUN_DIR</b>
           The location of flatpak runtime global files. If this is not
           set, /run/flatpak is used.
