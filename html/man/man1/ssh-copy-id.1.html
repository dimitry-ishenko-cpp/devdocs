DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ssh-copy-id </b>is a script that uses <i>ssh</i>(1) to log into a remote
       machine (presumably using a login password, so password
       authentication should be enabled, unless you've done some clever
       use of multiple identities).  It assembles a list of one or more
       fingerprints (as described below) and tries to log in with each
       key, to see if any of them are already installed (of course, if
       you are not using <i>ssh-agent</i>(1) this may result in you being
       repeatedly prompted for pass-phrases).  It then assembles a list
       of those that failed to log in and, using <i>ssh</i>(1), enables logins
       with those keys on the remote server.  By default it adds the
       keys by appending them to the remote user's
       <i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> (creating the file, and directory, if
       necessary).  It is also capable of detecting if the remote system
       is a NetScreen, and using its ‘set ssh pka-dsa key ...’ command
       instead.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-i </b><i>identity_file</i>
               Use only the key(s) contained in <i>identity_file</i> (rather
               than looking for identities via <i>ssh-add</i>(1) or in the
               <b>default_ID_file</b>).  If the filename does not end in <i>.pub</i>
               this is added.  If the filename is omitted, the
               <b>default_ID_file </b>is used.

               Note that this can be used to ensure that the keys copied
               have the comment one prefers and/or extra options
               applied, by ensuring that the key file has these set as
               preferred before the copy is attempted.

       <b>-f      </b>Forced mode: doesn't check if the keys are present on the
               remote server.  This means that it does not need the
               private key.  Of course, this can result in more than one
               copy of the key being installed on the remote system.

       <b>-n      </b>do a dry-run.  Instead of installing keys on the remote
               system simply prints the key(s) that would have been
               installed.

       <b>-s      </b>SFTP mode: usually the public keys are installed by
               executing commands on the remote side.  With this option
               the user's <i>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</i> file will be
               downloaded, modified locally and uploaded with sftp.
               This option is useful if the server has restrictions on
               commands which can be used on the remote side.

       <b>-t </b><i>target_path</i>
               the path on the target system where the keys should be
               added (defaults to ".ssh/authorized_keys")

       <b>-p </b><i>port</i>, <b>-o </b><i>ssh_option</i>
               These two options are simply passed through untouched,
               along with their argument, to allow one to set the port
               or other <i>ssh</i>(1) options, respectively.

               Rather than specifying these as command line options, it
               is often better to use (per-host) settings in <i>ssh</i>(1)'s
               configuration file: <i>ssh_config</i>(5).

       <b>-x      </b>This option is for debugging the <b>ssh-copy-id </b>script
               itself.  It sets the shell's -x flag, so that you can see
               the commands being run.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>-</b>?  Print Usage summary

       Default behaviour without <b>-i</b>, is to check if ‘ssh-add -L’
       provides any output, and if so those keys are used.  Note that
       this results in the comment on the key being the filename that
       was given to <i>ssh-add</i>(1) when the key was loaded into your
       <i>ssh-agent</i>(1) rather than the comment contained in that file,
       which is a bit of a shame.  Otherwise, if <i>ssh-add</i>(1) provides no
       keys contents of the <b>default_ID_file </b>will be used.

       The <b>default_ID_file </b>is the most recent file that matches:
       <i>~/.ssh/id*.pub</i>, (excluding those that match <i>~/.ssh/*-cert.pub</i>) so
       if you create a key that is not the one you want <b>ssh-copy-id </b>to
       use, just use <i>touch</i>(1) on your preferred key's <i>.pub</i> file to
       reinstate it as the most recent.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       If you have already installed keys from one system on a lot of
       remote hosts, and you then create a new key, on a new client
       machine, say, it can be difficult to keep track of which systems
       on which you've installed the new key.  One way of dealing with
       this is to load both the new key and old key(s) into your
       <i>ssh-agent</i>(1).  Load the new key first, without the <b>-c </b>option,
       then load one or more old keys into the agent, possibly by ssh-
       ing to the client machine that has that old key, using the <b>-A</b>
       option to allow agent forwarding:

             user@newclient$ ssh-add
             user@newclient$ ssh -A old.client
             user@oldl$ ssh-add -c
             ... prompt for pass-phrase ...
             user@old$ logoff
             user@newclient$ ssh someserver

       now, if the new key is installed on the server, you'll be allowed
       in unprompted, whereas if you only have the old key(s) enabled,
       you'll be asked for confirmation, which is your cue to log back
       out and run

             user@newclient$ ssh-copy-id -i someserver

       The reason you might want to specify the <b>-i </b>option in this case
       is to ensure that the comment on the installed key is the one
       from the <i>.pub</i> file, rather than just the filename that was loaded
       into your agent.  It also ensures that only the id you intended
       is installed, rather than all the keys that you have in your
       <i>ssh-agent</i>(1).  Of course, you can specify another id, or use the
       contents of the <i>ssh-agent</i>(1) as you prefer.

       Having mentioned <i>ssh-add</i>(1)'s <b>-c </b>option, you might consider using
       this whenever using agent forwarding to avoid your key being
       hijacked, but it is much better to instead use <i>ssh</i>(1)'s
       <i>ProxyCommand</i> and <b>-W </b>option, to bounce through remote servers
       while always doing direct end-to-end authentication.  This way
       the middle hop(s) don't get access to your <i>ssh-agent</i>(1).  A web
       search for ‘ssh proxycommand nc’ should prove enlightening (NB
       the modern approach is to use the <b>-W </b>option, rather than <i>nc</i>(1)).
