DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>Sed</i> is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic
       text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a
       pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits
       scripted edits (such as <i>ed</i>), <i>sed</i> works by making only one pass
       over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is
       <i>sed</i>'s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly
       distinguishes it from other types of editors.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--quiet</b>, <b>--silent</b>

              suppress automatic printing of pattern space

       <b>--debug</b>

              annotate program execution

       <b>-e </b>script, <b>--expression</b>=<i>script</i>

              add the script to the commands to be executed

       <b>-f </b>script-file, <b>--file</b>=<i>script-file</i>

              add the contents of script-file to the commands to be
              executed

       <b>--follow-symlinks</b>

              follow symlinks when processing in place

       <b>-i[SUFFIX]</b>, <b>--in-place</b>[=<i>SUFFIX</i>]

              edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)

       <b>-l </b>N, <b>--line-length</b>=<i>N</i>

              specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command

       <b>--posix</b>

              disable all GNU extensions.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>--regexp-extended</b>

              use extended regular expressions in the script (for
              portability use POSIX <b>-E</b>).

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--separate</b>

              consider files as separate rather than as a single,
              continuous long stream.

       <b>--sandbox</b>

              operate in sandbox mode (disable e/r/w commands).

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unbuffered</b>

              load minimal amounts of data from the input files and
              flush the output buffers more often

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--null-data</b>

              separate lines by NUL characters

       <b>--help</b>
              display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       If no <b>-e</b>, <b>--expression</b>, <b>-f</b>, or <b>--file </b>option is given, then the
       first non-option argument is taken as the sed script to
       interpret.  All remaining arguments are names of input files; if
       no input files are specified, then the standard input is read.

COMMAND SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       This is just a brief synopsis of <i>sed</i> commands to serve as a
       reminder to those who already know <i>sed</i>; other documentation (such
       as the texinfo document) must be consulted for fuller
       descriptions.

   <b>Zero-address ``commands''</b>
       : <i>label</i>
              Label for <b>b </b>and <b>t </b>commands.

       #<i>comment</i>
              The comment extends until the next newline (or the end of
              a <b>-e </b>script fragment).

       }      The closing bracket of a { } block.

   <b>Zero- or One- address commands</b>
       =      Print the current line number.

       a \

       <i>text</i>   Append <i>text</i>, which has each embedded newline preceded by a
              backslash.

       i \

       <i>text</i>   Insert <i>text</i>, which has each embedded newline preceded by a
              backslash.

       q [<i>exit-code</i>]
              Immediately quit the <i>sed</i> script without processing any
              more input, except that if auto-print is not disabled the
              current pattern space will be printed.  The exit code
              argument is a GNU extension.

       Q [<i>exit-code</i>]
              Immediately quit the <i>sed</i> script without processing any
              more input.  This is a GNU extension.

       r <i>filename</i>
              Append text read from <i>filename</i>.

       R <i>filename</i>
              Append a line read from <i>filename</i>.  Each invocation of the
              command reads a line from the file.  This is a GNU
              extension.

   <b>Commands which accept address ranges</b>
       {      Begin a block of commands (end with a }).

       b <i>label</i>
              Branch to <i>label</i>; if <i>label</i> is omitted, branch to end of
              script.

       c \

       <i>text</i>   Replace the selected lines with <i>text</i>, which has each
              embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       d      Delete pattern space.  Start next cycle.

       D      If pattern space contains no newline, start a normal new
              cycle as if the d command was issued.  Otherwise, delete
              text in the pattern space up to the first newline, and
              restart cycle with the resultant pattern space, without
              reading a new line of input.

       h H    Copy/append pattern space to hold space.

       g G    Copy/append hold space to pattern space.

       l      List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous''
              form.

       l <i>width</i>
              List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous''
              form, breaking it at <i>width</i> characters.  This is a GNU
              extension.

       n N    Read/append the next line of input into the pattern space.

       p      Print the current pattern space.

       P      Print up to the first embedded newline of the current
              pattern space.

       s/<i>regexp</i>/<i>replacement</i>/
              Attempt to match <i>regexp</i> against the pattern space.  If
              successful, replace that portion matched with <i>replacement</i>.
              The <i>replacement</i> may contain the special character <b>&amp; </b>to
              refer to that portion of the pattern space which matched,
              and the special escapes \1 through \9 to refer to the
              corresponding matching sub-expressions in the <i>regexp</i>.

       t <i>label</i>
              If a s/// has done a successful substitution since the
              last input line was read and since the last t or T
              command, then branch to <i>label</i>; if <i>label</i> is omitted, branch
              to end of script.

       T <i>label</i>
              If no s/// has done a successful substitution since the
              last input line was read and since the last t or T
              command, then branch to <i>label</i>; if <i>label</i> is omitted, branch
              to end of script.  This is a GNU extension.

       w <i>filename</i>
              Write the current pattern space to <i>filename</i>.

       W <i>filename</i>
              Write the first line of the current pattern space to
              <i>filename</i>.  This is a GNU extension.

       x      Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.

       y/<i>source</i>/<i>dest</i>/
              Transliterate the characters in the pattern space which
              appear in <i>source</i> to the corresponding character in <i>dest</i>.

<b>Addresses</b>
       <i>Sed</i> commands can be given with no addresses, in which case the
       command will be executed for all input lines; with one address,
       in which case the command will only be executed for input lines
       which match that address; or with two addresses, in which case
       the command will be executed for all input lines which match the
       inclusive range of lines starting from the first address and
       continuing to the second address.  Three things to note about
       address ranges: the syntax is <i>addr1</i>,<i>addr2</i> (i.e., the addresses
       are separated by a comma); the line which <i>addr1</i> matched will
       always be accepted, even if <i>addr2</i> selects an earlier line; and if
       <i>addr2</i> is a <i>regexp</i>, it will not be tested against the line that
       <i>addr1</i> matched.

       After the address (or address-range), and before the command, a <b>!</b>
       may be inserted, which specifies that the command shall only be
       executed if the address (or address-range) does <b>not </b>match.

       The following address types are supported:

       <i>number</i> Match only the specified line <i>number</i> (which increments
              cumulatively across files, unless the <b>-s </b>option is
              specified on the command line).

       <i>first</i>~<i>step</i>
              Match every <i>step</i>'th line starting with line <i>first</i>.  For
              example, ``sed -n 1~2p'' will print all the odd-numbered
              lines in the input stream, and the address 2~5 will match
              every fifth line, starting with the second.  <i>first</i> can be
              zero; in this case, <i>sed</i> operates as if it were equal to
              <i>step</i>.  (This is an extension.)

       $      Match the last line.

       /<i>regexp</i>/
              Match lines matching the regular expression <i>regexp</i>.
              Matching is performed on the current pattern space, which
              can be modified with commands such as ``s///''.

       \<b>c</b><i>regexp</i><b>c</b>
              Match lines matching the regular expression <i>regexp</i>.  The <b>c</b>
              may be any character.

       GNU <i>sed</i> also supports some special 2-address forms:

       0,<i>addr2</i>
              Start out in "matched first address" state, until <i>addr2</i> is
              found.  This is similar to 1,<i>addr2</i>, except that if <i>addr2</i>
              matches the very first line of input the 0,<i>addr2</i> form will
              be at the end of its range, whereas the 1,<i>addr2</i> form will
              still be at the beginning of its range.  This works only
              when <i>addr2</i> is a regular expression.

       <i>addr1</i>,+<i>N</i>
              Will match <i>addr1</i> and the <i>N</i> lines following <i>addr1</i>.

       <i>addr1</i>,~<i>N</i>
              Will match <i>addr1</i> and the lines following <i>addr1</i> until the
              next line whose input line number is a multiple of <i>N</i>.
</pre> <h2>
REGULAR EXPRESSIONS </h2>
<pre>
       POSIX.2 BREs <i>should</i> be supported, but they aren't completely
       because of performance problems.  The <b>\n </b>sequence in a regular
       expression matches the newline character, and similarly for <b>\a</b>,
       <b>\t</b>, and other sequences.  The <i>-E</i> option switches to using
       extended regular expressions instead; it has been supported for
       years by GNU sed, and is now included in POSIX.
