</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lastcomm -  print out information about previously executed
       commands.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lastcomm</b>
              [ <i>command-name ...</i>  ]
              [ <i>user-name ...</i>  ]
              [ <i>terminal-name ...</i>  ]
              [ OPTION ... ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lastcomm  </b>prints  out  information about previously executed com‐
       mands.  If no arguments are specified, <b>lastcomm </b>will  print  info
       about  all  of the commands in <i>acct</i> (the record file).  If called
       with one or more of <i>command-name,</i>  <i>user-name,</i>  or  <i>terminal-name,</i>
       only records containing those items will be displayed.  For exam‐
       ple, to find out which users used command `a.out' and which users
       were logged into `tty0', type:
                              lastcomm a.out tty0

       This  will print any entry for which `a.out' or `tty0' matches in
       any of the record's fields (command, name, or terminal).  If  you
       want  to find only items that match *all* of the arguments on the
       command line, you must use the '-strict-match' option.  For exam‐
       ple, to list all of the executions of command <i>a.out</i> by user  <i>root</i>
       on terminal <i>tty0,</i> type:
        lastcomm --strict-match --command a.out --user root --tty tty0

       The order of the arguments is not important.

       For each entry the following information is printed:
          + command name of the process
          + flags, as recorded by the system accounting routines:
               S -- command executed by super-user
               F  -- command executed after a fork but without a follow‐
       ing exec
               C -- command run in PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only)
               D -- command terminated with the  generation  of  a  core
       file
               X -- command was terminated with the signal SIGTERM
          + the name of the user who ran the process
          + time the process started
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>--strict-match</b>
              Print only entries that match *all* of the arguments on
              the command line.
       <b>--print-controls</b>
              Print control characters.
       <b>--user </b><i>name</i>
              List records for user with <i>name.</i>  This is useful if you're
              trying to match a username that happens to be the same as
              a command (e.g., <i>ed</i> ).
       <b>--command </b><i>name</i>
              List records for command <i>name.</i>
       <b>--tty </b><i>name</i>
              List records for tty <i>name.</i>
       <b>--forwards</b>
              Read file forwards instead of backwards. This avoids try‐
              ing to seek on the file and can be used to read from a
              pipe. This must be specified prior to any <b>-f </b>arguments.
       <b>-f </b><i>filename,</i> <b>--file </b><i>filename</i>
              Read from the file <i>filename</i> instead of <i>acct.</i>  A filename
              of "-" will result in reading from stdin. This must either
              be the first <b>-f </b>option, or <b>--forwards </b>must precede all <b>-f</b>
              options.
       <b>--ahz </b><i>hz</i>
              Use this flag to tell the program what <b>AHZ </b>should be (in
              hertz).  This option is useful if you are trying to view
              an <i>acct</i> file created on another machine which has the same
              byte order and file format as your current machine, but
              has a different value for <b>AHZ.</b>
       <b>-p, --show-paging</b>
              Print paging statistics.
       <b>--pid  </b>Show PID and PPID of the process if acct version 3 format
              is supported by kernel.
       <b>--pid  </b>Add pid of the process and pid of the process parent to
              the output (pid is the last but one and parent pid the
              last column).  These values are shown only when they are
              generated by acct function (depends on the version of ker‐
              nel)
       <b>--debug</b>
              Print verbose internal information.
       <b>-V, --version</b>
              Print the version number of <b>lastcomm.</b>
       <b>-h, --help</b>
              Prints the usage string and default locations of system
              files to standard output and exits.
