NAME </h2>
<pre>
       rrsync - a script to setup restricted rsync users via ssh logins
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       rrsync [-ro|-rw] [-munge] [-no-del] [-no-lock] [-no-overwrite]  DIR

       The single non-option argument specifies the restricted <i>DIR</i> to
       use. It can be relative to the user's home directory or an
       absolute path.

       The online version of this manpage (that includes cross-linking
       of topics) is available at 
       ⟨<a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rrsync.1">https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rrsync.1</a>⟩.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A user's ssh login can be restricted to only allow the running of
       an rsync transfer in one of two easy ways:

       o      forcing the running of the rrsync script

       o      forcing the running of an rsync daemon-over-ssh command.

       Both of these setups use a feature of ssh that allows a command
       to be forced to run instead of an interactive shell.  However, if
       the user's home shell is bash, please see BASH SECURITY ISSUE for
       a potential issue.

       To use the rrsync script, edit the user's <b>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</b>
       file and add a prefix like one of the following (followed by a
       space) in front of each ssh-key line that should be restricted:

           command="rrsync DIR"
           command="rrsync -ro DIR"
           command="rrsync -munge -no-del DIR"

       Then, ensure that the rrsync script has your desired option
       restrictions. You may want to copy the script to a local bin dir
       with a unique name if you want to have multiple configurations.
       One or more rrsync options can be specified prior to the <i>DIR</i> if
       you want to further restrict the transfer.

       To use an rsync daemon setup, edit the user's
       <b>~/.ssh/authorized_keys </b>file and add a prefix like one of the
       following (followed by a space) in front of each ssh-key line
       that should be restricted:

           command="rsync --server --daemon ."
           command="rsync --server --daemon --config=/PATH/TO/rsyncd.conf ."

       Then, ensure that the rsyncd.conf file is created with one or
       more module names with the appropriate path and option
       restrictions.  If rsync's <b>--config </b>option is omitted, it defaults
       to <b>~/rsyncd.conf</b>.  See the <a href="../man5/rsyncd.conf.5.html">rsyncd.conf(5)</a> manpage for details of
       how to configure an rsync daemon.

       When using rrsync, there can be just one restricted dir per
       authorized key.  A daemon setup, on the other hand, allows
       multiple module names inside the config file, each one with its
       own path setting.

       The remainder of this manpage is dedicated to using the rrsync
       script.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-ro    </b>Allow only reading from the DIR. Implies <b>-no-del </b>and <b>-no-</b>
              <b>lock</b>.

       <b>-wo    </b>Allow only writing to the DIR.

       <b>-munge </b>Enable rsync's <b>--munge-links </b>on the server side.

       <b>-no-del</b>
              Disable rsync's <b>--delete* </b>and <b>--remove* </b>options.

       <b>-no-lock</b>
              Avoid the single-run (per-user) lock check.  Useful with
              <b>-munge</b>.

       <b>-no-overwrite</b>
              Enforce <b>--ignore-existing </b>on the server. Prevents
              overwriting existing files when the server is the
              receiver.

       <b>-help</b>, <b>-h</b>
              Output this help message and exit.
</pre> <h2>
SECURITY RESTRICTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The rrsync script validates the path arguments it is sent to try
       to restrict them to staying within the specified DIR.

       The rrsync script rejects rsync's <b>--copy-links </b>option (by
       default) so that a copy cannot dereference a symlink within the
       DIR to get to a file outside the DIR.

       The rrsync script rejects rsync's <b>--protect-args </b>(<b>-s</b>) option
       because it would allow options to be sent to the server-side that
       the script cannot check.  If you want to support <b>--protect-args</b>,
       use a daemon-over-ssh setup.

       The rrsync script accepts just a subset of rsync's options that
       the real rsync uses when running the server command.  A few extra
       convenience options are also included to help it to interact with
       BackupPC and accept some convenient user overrides.

       The script (or a copy of it) can be manually edited if you want
       it to customize the option handling.
</pre> <h2>
BASH SECURITY ISSUE </h2>
<pre>
       If your users have bash set as their home shell, bash may try to
       be overly helpful and ensure that the user's login bashrc files
       are run prior to executing the forced command.  This can be a
       problem if the user can somehow update their home bashrc files,
       perhaps via the restricted copy, a shared home directory, or
       something similar.

       One simple way to avoid the issue is to switch the user to a
       simpler shell, such as dash.  When choosing the new home shell,
       make sure that you're not choosing bash in disguise, as it is
       unclear if it avoids the security issue.

       Another potential fix is to ensure that the user's home directory
       is not a shared mount and that they have no means of copying
       files outside of their restricted directories.  This may require
       you to force the enabling of symlink munging on the server side.

       A future version of openssh may have a change to the handling of
       forced commands that allows it to avoid using the user's home
       shell.
