PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       diff — compare two files
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       diff <b>[</b>-c|-e|-f|-u|-C <i>n</i>|-U <i>n</i><b>] [</b>-br<b>] </b><i>file1 file2</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>diff</i> utility shall compare the contents of <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i>
       and write to standard output a list of changes necessary to
       convert <i>file1</i> into <i>file2</i>.  This list should be minimal. No output
       shall be produced if the files are identical.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>diff</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-b        </b>Cause any amount of white space at the end of a line to
                 be treated as a single &lt;newline&gt; (that is, the white-
                 space characters preceding the &lt;newline&gt; are ignored)
                 and other strings of white-space characters, not
                 including &lt;newline&gt; characters, to compare equal.

       <b>-c        </b>Produce output in a form that provides three lines of
                 copied context.

       <b>-C </b><i>n</i>      Produce output in a form that provides <i>n</i> lines of
                 copied context (where <i>n</i> shall be interpreted as a
                 positive decimal integer).

       <b>-e        </b>Produce output in a form suitable as input for the <i>ed</i>
                 utility, which can then be used to convert <i>file1</i> into
                 <i>file2</i>.

       <b>-f        </b>Produce output in an alternative form, similar in
                 format to <b>-e</b>, but not intended to be suitable as input
                 for the <i>ed</i> utility, and in the opposite order.

       <b>-r        </b>Apply <i>diff</i> recursively to files and directories of the
                 same name when <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> are both directories.

                 The <i>diff</i> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is,
                 entering a previously visited directory that is an
                 ancestor of the last file encountered.  When it detects
                 an infinite loop, <i>diff</i> shall write a diagnostic message
                 to standard error and shall either recover its position
                 in the hierarchy or terminate.

       <b>-u        </b>Produce output in a form that provides three lines of
                 unified context.

       <b>-U </b><i>n</i>      Produce output in a form that provides <i>n</i> lines of
                 unified context (where <i>n</i> shall be interpreted as a non-
                 negative decimal integer).
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>file1</i>, <i>file2</i>
                 A pathname of a file to be compared. If either the
                 <i>file1</i> or <i>file2</i> operand is <b>'-'</b>, the standard input shall
                 be used in its place.

       If both <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> are directories, <i>diff</i> shall not compare
       block special files, character special files, or FIFO special
       files to any files and shall not compare regular files to
       directories.  Further details are as specified in <i>Diff Directory</i>
       <i>Comparison Format</i>.  The behavior of <i>diff</i> on other file types is
       implementation-defined when found in directories.

       If only one of <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> is a directory, <i>diff</i> shall be
       applied to the non-directory file and the file contained in the
       directory file with a filename that is the same as the last
       component of the non-directory file.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       The standard input shall be used only if one of the <i>file1</i> or
       <i>file2</i> operands references standard input. See the INPUT FILES
       section.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files may be of any type.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>diff</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error and informative messages written to
                 standard output.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Determine the locale for affecting the format of file
                 timestamps written with the <b>-C </b>and <b>-c </b>options.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone used for calculating file
                 timestamps written with a context format. If <i>TZ</i> is
                 unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be
                 used.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Diff Directory Comparison Format</b>
       If both <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> are directories, the following output
       formats shall be used.

       In the POSIX locale, each file that is present in only one
       directory shall be reported using the following format:

           "Only in %s: %s\n", &lt;<i>directory pathname</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename</i>&gt;

       In the POSIX locale, subdirectories that are common to the two
       directories may be reported with the following format:

           "Common subdirectories: %s and %s\n", &lt;<i>directory1 pathname</i>&gt;,
               &lt;<i>directory2 pathname</i>&gt;

       For each file common to the two directories, if the two files are
       not to be compared: if the two files have the same device ID and
       file serial number, or are both block special files that refer to
       the same device, or are both character special files that refer
       to the same device, in the POSIX locale the output format is
       unspecified.  Otherwise, in the POSIX locale an unspecified
       format shall be used that contains the pathnames of the two
       files.

       For each file common to the two directories, if the files are
       compared and are identical, no output shall be written. If the
       two files differ, the following format is written:

           "diff %s %s %s\n", &lt;<i>diff_options</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename2</i>&gt;

       where &lt;<i>diff_options</i>&gt; are the options as specified on the command
       line.

       All directory pathnames listed in this section shall be relative
       to the original command line arguments. All other names of files
       listed in this section shall be filenames (pathname components).

   <b>Diff Binary Output Format</b>
       In the POSIX locale, if one or both of the files being compared
       are not text files, it is implementation-defined whether <i>diff</i>
       uses the binary file output format or the other formats as
       specified below. The binary file output format shall contain the
       pathnames of two files being compared and the string <b>"differ"</b>.

       If both files being compared are text files, depending on the
       options specified, one of the following formats shall be used to
       write the differences.

   <b>Diff Default Output Format</b>
       The default (without <b>-e</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-C</b>, <b>-u</b>, or <b>-U </b>options) <i>diff</i>
       utility output shall contain lines of these forms:

           "%da%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;

           "%da%d,%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;

           "%dd%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;

           "%d,%dd%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;

           "%dc%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;

           "%d,%dc%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;

           "%dc%d,%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;

           "%d,%dc%d,%d\n", &lt;<i>num1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num2</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num3</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>num4</i>&gt;

       These lines resemble <i>ed</i> subcommands to convert <i>file1</i> into <i>file2</i>.
       The line numbers before the action letters shall pertain to
       <i>file1</i>; those after shall pertain to <i>file2</i>.  Thus, by exchanging <i>a</i>
       for <i>d</i> and reading the line in reverse order, one can also
       determine how to convert <i>file2</i> into <i>file1</i>.  As in <i>ed</i>, identical
       pairs (where <i>num1</i>= <i>num2</i>) are abbreviated as a single number.

       Following each of these lines, <i>diff</i> shall write to standard
       output all lines affected in the first file using the format:

           "&lt; %s", &lt;<i>line</i>&gt;

       and all lines affected in the second file using the format:

           "&gt; %s", &lt;<i>line</i>&gt;

       If there are lines affected in both <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i> (as with the
       <b>c </b>subcommand), the changes are separated with a line consisting
       of three &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; characters:

           "---\n"

   <b>Diff -e Output Format</b>
       With the <b>-e </b>option, a script shall be produced that shall, when
       provided as input to <i>ed</i>, along with an appended <b>w </b>(write)
       command, convert <i>file1</i> into <i>file2</i>.  Only the <b>a </b>(append), <b>c</b>
       (change), <b>d </b>(delete), <b>i </b>(insert), and <b>s </b>(substitute) commands of
       <i>ed</i> shall be used in this script. Text lines, except those
       consisting of the single character &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>), shall be
       output as they appear in the file.

   <b>Diff -f Output Format</b>
       With the <b>-f </b>option, an alternative format of script shall be
       produced. It is similar to that produced by <b>-e</b>, with the
       following differences:

        1. It is expressed in reverse sequence; the output of <b>-e </b>orders
           changes from the end of the file to the beginning; the <b>-f</b>
           from beginning to end.

        2. The command form &lt;<i>lines</i>&gt; &lt;<i>command-letter</i>&gt; used by <b>-e </b>is
           reversed. For example, 10<i>c</i> with <b>-e </b>would be <i>c</i>10 with <b>-f</b>.

        3. The form used for ranges of line numbers is
           &lt;space&gt;-separated, rather than &lt;comma&gt;-separated.

   <b>Diff -c or -C Output Format</b>
       With the <b>-c </b>or <b>-C </b>option, the output format shall consist of
       affected lines along with surrounding lines of context. The
       affected lines shall show which ones need to be deleted or
       changed in <i>file1</i>, and those added from <i>file2</i>.  With the <b>-c</b>
       option, three lines of context, if available, shall be written
       before and after the affected lines. With the <b>-C </b>option, the user
       can specify how many lines of context are written.  The exact
       format follows.

       The name and last modification time of each file shall be output
       in the following format:

           "*** %s %s\n", <i>file1</i>, &lt;<i>file1 timestamp</i>&gt;
           "--- %s %s\n", <i>file2</i>, &lt;<i>file2 timestamp</i>&gt;

       Each &lt;<i>file</i>&gt; field shall be the pathname of the corresponding file
       being compared. The pathname written for standard input is
       unspecified.

       In the POSIX locale, each &lt;<i>timestamp</i>&gt; field shall be equivalent
       to the output from the following command:

           date "+%a %b %e %T %Y"

       without the trailing &lt;newline&gt;, executed at the time of last
       modification of the corresponding file (or the current time, if
       the file is standard input).

       Then, the following output formats shall be applied for every set
       of changes.

       First, a line shall be written in the following format:

           "***************\n"

       Next, the range of lines in <i>file1</i> shall be written in the
       following format if the range contains two or more lines:

           "*** %d,%d ****\n", &lt;<i>beginning line number</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>ending line number</i>&gt;

       and the following format otherwise:

           "*** %d ****\n", &lt;<i>ending line number</i>&gt;

       The ending line number of an empty range shall be the number of
       the preceding line, or 0 if the range is at the start of the
       file.

       Next, the affected lines along with lines of context (unaffected
       lines) shall be written. Unaffected lines shall be written in the
       following format:

           "  %s", &lt;<i>unaffected_line</i>&gt;

       Deleted lines shall be written as:

           "- %s", &lt;<i>deleted_line</i>&gt;

       Changed lines shall be written as:

           "! %s", &lt;<i>changed_line</i>&gt;

       Next, the range of lines in <i>file2</i> shall be written in the
       following format if the range contains two or more lines:

           "--- %d,%d ----\n", &lt;<i>beginning line number</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>ending line number</i>&gt;

       and the following format otherwise:

           "--- %d ----\n", &lt;<i>ending line number</i>&gt;

       Then, lines of context and changed lines shall be written as
       described in the previous formats. Lines added from <i>file2</i> shall
       be written in the following format:

           "+ %s", &lt;<i>added_line</i>&gt;

   <b>Diff -u or -U Output Format</b>
       The <b>-u </b>or <b>-U </b>options behave like the <b>-c </b>or <b>-C </b>options, except
       that the context lines are not repeated; instead, the context,
       deleted, and added lines are shown together, interleaved.  The
       exact format follows.

       The name and last modification time of each file shall be output
       in the following format:

           "--- %s\t%s%s %s\n", file1, &lt;file1 timestamp&gt;, &lt;file1 frac&gt;, &lt;file1 zone&gt;
           "+++ %s\t%s%s %s\n", file2, &lt;file2 timestamp&gt;, &lt;file2 frac&gt;, &lt;file2 zone&gt;

       Each &lt;<i>file</i>&gt; field shall be the pathname of the corresponding file
       being compared, or the single character <b>'-' </b>if standard input is
       being compared. However, if the pathname contains a &lt;tab&gt; or a
       &lt;newline&gt;, or if it does not consist entirely of characters taken
       from the portable character set, the behavior is implementation-
       defined.

       Each &lt;<i>timestamp</i>&gt; field shall be equivalent to the output from the
       following command:

           date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

       without the trailing &lt;newline&gt;, executed at the time of last
       modification of the corresponding file (or the current time, if
       the file is standard input).

       Each &lt;<i>frac</i>&gt; field shall be either empty, or a decimal point
       followed by at least one decimal digit, indicating the
       fractional-seconds part (if any) of the file timestamp. The
       number of fractional digits shall be at least the number needed
       to represent the file's timestamp without loss of information.

       Each &lt;<i>zone</i>&gt; field shall be of the form <b>"shhmm"</b>, where <b>"shh" </b>is a
       signed two-digit decimal number in the range -24 through +25, and
       <b>"mm" </b>is an unsigned two-digit decimal number in the range 00
       through 59.  It represents the timezone of the timestamp as the
       number of hours (hh) and minutes (mm) east (+) or west (-) of UTC
       for the timestamp.  If the hours and minutes are both zero, the
       sign shall be <b>'+'</b>.  However, if the timezone is not an integral
       number of minutes away from UTC, the &lt;<i>zone</i>&gt; field is
       implementation-defined.

       Then, the following output formats shall be applied for every set
       of changes.

       First, the range of lines in each file shall be written in the
       following format:

           "@@ -%s +%s @@", &lt;file1 range&gt;, &lt;file2 range&gt;

       Each &lt;<i>range</i>&gt; field shall be of the form:

           "%1d", &lt;beginning line number&gt;

       or:

           "%1d,1", &lt;beginning line number&gt;

       if the range contains exactly one line, and:

           "%1d,%1d", &lt;beginning line number&gt;, &lt;number of lines&gt;

       otherwise. If a range is empty, its beginning line number shall
       be the number of the line just before the range, or 0 if the
       empty range starts the file.

       Next, the affected lines along with lines of context shall be
       written.  Each non-empty unaffected line shall be written in the
       following format:

           " %s", &lt;unaffected_line&gt;

       where the contents of the unaffected line shall be taken from
       <i>file1</i>.  It is implementation-defined whether an empty unaffected
       line is written as an empty line or a line containing a single
       &lt;space&gt; character. This line also represents the same line of
       <i>file2</i>, even though <i>file2</i>'s line may contain different contents
       due to the <b>-b</b>.  Deleted lines shall be written as:

           "-%s", &lt;deleted_line&gt;

       Added lines shall be written as:

           "+%s", &lt;added_line&gt;

       The order of lines written shall be the same as that of the
       corresponding file. A deleted line shall never be written
       immediately after an added line.

       If <b>-U </b><i>n</i> is specified, the output shall contain no more than 2<i>n</i>
       consecutive unaffected lines; and if the output contains an
       affected line and this line is adjacent to up to <i>n</i> consecutive
       unaffected lines in the corresponding file, the output shall
       contain these unaffected lines.  <b>-u </b>shall act like <b>-U</b>3.

</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       If lines at the end of a file are changed and other lines are
       added, <i>diff</i> output may show this as a delete and add, as a
       change, or as a change and add; <i>diff</i> is not expected to know
       which happened and users should not care about the difference in
       output as long as it clearly shows the differences between the
       files.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       If <b>dir1 </b>is a directory containing a directory named <b>x</b>, <b>dir2 </b>is a
       directory containing a directory named <b>x</b>, <b>dir1/x </b>and <b>dir2/x </b>both
       contain files named <b>date.out</b>, and <b>dir2/x </b>contains a file named <b>y</b>,
       the command:

           diff -r dir1 dir2

       could produce output similar to:

           Common subdirectories: dir1/x and dir2/x
           Only in dir2/x: y
           diff -r dir1/x/date.out dir2/x/date.out

       The <b>-h </b>option was omitted because it was insufficiently specified
       and does not add to applications portability.

       Historical implementations employ algorithms that do not always
       produce a minimum list of differences; the current language about
       making every effort is the best this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 can
       do, as there is no metric that could be employed to judge the
       quality of implementations against any and all file contents. The
       statement ``This list should be minimal'' clearly implies that
       implementations are not expected to provide the following output
       when comparing two 100-line files that differ in only one
       character on a single line:

           1,100c1,100
           all 100 lines from file1 preceded with "&lt; "
           ---
           all 100 lines from file2 preceded with "&gt; "

       The ``Only in'' messages required when the <b>-r </b>option is specified
       are not used by most historical implementations if the <b>-e </b>option
       is also specified. It is required here because it provides useful
       information that must be provided to update a target directory
       hierarchy to match a source hierarchy. The ``Common
       subdirectories'' messages are written by System V and 4.3 BSD
       when the <b>-r </b>option is specified. They are allowed here but are
       not required because they are reporting on something that is the
       same, not reporting a difference, and are not needed to update a
       target hierarchy.

       The <b>-c </b>option, which writes output in a format using lines of
       context, has been included. The format is useful for a variety of
       reasons, among them being much improved readability and the
       ability to understand difference changes when the target file has
       line numbers that differ from another similar, but slightly
       different, copy. The <i>patch</i> utility is most valuable when working
       with difference listings using a context format. The BSD version
       of <b>-c </b>takes an optional argument specifying the amount of
       context. Rather than overloading <b>-c </b>and breaking the Utility
       Syntax Guidelines for <i>diff</i>, the standard developers decided to
       add a separate option for specifying a context diff with a
       specified amount of context (<b>-C</b>).  Also, the format for context
       <i>diff</i>s was extended slightly in 4.3 BSD to allow multiple changes
       that are within context lines from each other to be merged
       together. The output format contains an additional four
       &lt;asterisk&gt; characters after the range of affected lines in the
       first filename. This was to provide a flag for old programs (like
       old versions of <i>patch</i>) that only understand the old context
       format. The version of context described here does not require
       that multiple changes within context lines be merged, but it does
       not prohibit it either. The extension is upwards-compatible, so
       any vendors that wish to retain the old version of <i>diff</i> can do so
       by adding the extra four &lt;asterisk&gt; characters (that is,
       utilities that currently use <i>diff</i> and understand the new merged
       format will also understand the old unmerged format, but not <i>vice</i>
       <i>versa</i>).

       The <b>-u </b>and <b>-U </b>options of GNU <i>diff</i> have been included. Their
       output format, designed by Wayne Davison, takes up less space
       than <b>-c </b>and <b>-C </b>format, and in many cases is easier to read. The
       format's timestamps do not vary by locale, so <i>LC_TIME</i> does not
       affect it. The format's line numbers are rendered with the <b>%1d</b>
       format, not <b>%d</b>, because the file format notation rules would
       allow extra &lt;blank&gt; characters to appear around the numbers.

       The substitute command was added as an additional format for the
       <b>-e </b>option. This was added to provide implementations with a way
       to fix the classic ``dot alone on a line'' bug present in many
       versions of <i>diff</i>.  Since many implementations have fixed this
       bug, the standard developers decided not to standardize broken
       behavior, but rather to provide the necessary tool for fixing the
       bug. One way to fix this bug is to output two periods whenever a
       lone period is needed, then terminate the append command with a
       period, and then use the substitute command to convert the two
       periods into one period.

       The BSD-derived <b>-r </b>option was added to provide a mechanism for
       using <i>diff</i> to compare two file system trees. This behavior is
       useful, is standard practice on all BSD-derived systems, and is
       not easily reproducible with the <i>find</i> utility.

       The requirement that <i>diff</i> not compare files in some
       circumstances, even though they have the same name, is based on
       the actual output of historical implementations.  The specified
       behavior precludes the problems arising from running into FIFOs
       and other files that would cause <i>diff</i> to hang waiting for input
       with no indication to the user that <i>diff</i> was hung. An earlier
       version of this standard specified the output format more
       precisely, but in practice this requirement was widely ignored
       and the benefit of standardization seemed small, so it is now
       unspecified. In most common usage, <i>diff</i> <b>-r </b>should indicate
       differences in the file hierarchies, not the difference of
       contents of devices pointed to by the hierarchies.

       Many early implementations of <i>diff</i> require seekable files. Since
       the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 supports named
       pipes, the standard developers decided that such a restriction
       was unreasonable.  Note also that the allowed filename <b>- </b>almost
       always refers to a pipe.

       No directory search order is specified for <i>diff</i>.  The historical
       ordering is, in fact, not optimal, in that it prints out all of
       the differences at the current level, including the statements
       about all common subdirectories before recursing into those
       subdirectories.

       The message:

           "diff %s %s %s\n", &lt;<i>diff_options</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename2</i>&gt;

       does not vary by locale because it is the representation of a
       command, not an English sentence.
