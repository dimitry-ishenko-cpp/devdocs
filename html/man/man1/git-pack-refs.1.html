NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-pack-refs - Pack heads and tags for efficient repository
       access
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git pack-refs</i> [--all] [--no-prune] [--auto] [--include &lt;pattern&gt;] [--exclude &lt;pattern&gt;]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known as
       <i>refs</i>) were stored one file per ref in a (sub)directory under
       <b>$GIT_DIR/refs </b>directory. While many branch tips tend to be
       updated often, most tags and some branch tips are never updated.
       When a repository has hundreds or thousands of tags, this
       one-file-per-ref format both wastes storage and hurts
       performance.

       This command is used to solve the storage and performance problem
       by storing the refs in a single file, <b>$GIT_DIR/packed-refs</b>. When
       a ref is missing from the traditional <b>$GIT_DIR/refs </b>directory
       hierarchy, it is looked up in this file and used if found.

       Subsequent updates to branches always create new files under
       <b>$GIT_DIR/refs </b>directory hierarchy.

       A recommended practice to deal with a repository with too many
       refs is to pack its refs with <b>--all </b>once, and occasionally run
       <b>git pack-refs</b>. Tags are by definition stationary and are not
       expected to change. Branch heads will be packed with the initial
       <b>pack-refs --all</b>, but only the currently active branch heads will
       become unpacked, and the next <b>pack-refs </b>(without <b>--all</b>) will
       leave them unpacked.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --all
           The command by default packs all tags and refs that are
           already packed, and leaves other refs alone. This is because
           branches are expected to be actively developed and packing
           their tips does not help performance. This option causes all
           refs to be packed as well, with the exception of hidden refs,
           broken refs, and symbolic refs. Useful for a repository with
           many branches of historical interests.

       --no-prune
           The command usually removes loose refs under <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b>
           hierarchy after packing them. This option tells it not to.

       --auto
           Pack refs as needed depending on the current state of the ref
           database. The behavior depends on the ref format used by the
           repository and may change in the future.

           •   "files": No special handling for <b>--auto </b>has been
               implemented.

           •   "reftable": Tables are compacted such that they form a
               geometric sequence. For two tables N and N+1, where N+1
               is newer, this maintains the property that N is at least
               twice as big as N+1. Only tables that violate this
               property are compacted.

       --include &lt;pattern&gt;
           Pack refs based on a <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob(7)</a> pattern. Repetitions of this
           option accumulate inclusion patterns. If a ref is both
           included in <b>--include </b>and <b>--exclude</b>, <b>--exclude </b>takes
           precedence. Using <b>--include </b>will preclude all tags from being
           included by default. Symbolic refs and broken refs will never
           be packed. When used with <b>--all</b>, it will be a noop. Use
           <b>--no-include </b>to clear and reset the list of patterns.

       --exclude &lt;pattern&gt;
           Do not pack refs matching the given <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob(7)</a> pattern.
           Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns. Use
           <b>--no-exclude </b>to clear and reset the list of patterns. If a
           ref is already packed, including it with <b>--exclude </b>will not
           unpack it.

       When used with <b>--all</b>, pack only loose refs which do not match any
       of the provided <b>--exclude </b>patterns.

       When used with <b>--include</b>, refs provided to <b>--include</b>, minus refs
       that are provided to <b>--exclude </b>will be packed.

BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Older documentation written before the packed-refs mechanism was
       introduced may still say things like ".git/refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt;
       file exists" when it means "branch &lt;branch&gt; exists".
