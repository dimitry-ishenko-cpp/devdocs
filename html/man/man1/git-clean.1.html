</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git clean</i> [-d] [-f] [-i] [-n] [-q] [-e &lt;pattern&gt;] [-x | -X] [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are
       not under version control, starting from the current directory.

       Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the <b>-x</b>
       option is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can,
       for example, be useful to remove all build products.

       If any optional <b>&lt;pathspec&gt;... </b>arguments are given, only those
       paths that match the pathspec are affected.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -d
           Normally, when no &lt;pathspec&gt; is specified, git clean will not
           recurse into untracked directories to avoid removing too
           much. Specify -d to have it recurse into such directories as
           well. If a &lt;pathspec&gt; is specified, -d is irrelevant; all
           untracked files matching the specified paths (with exceptions
           for nested git directories mentioned under <b>--force</b>) will be
           removed.

       -f, --force
           If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not
           set to false, <i>git clean</i> will refuse to delete files or
           directories unless given -f. Git will refuse to modify
           untracked nested git repositories (directories with a .git
           subdirectory) unless a second -f is given.

       -i, --interactive
           Show what would be done and clean files interactively. See
           “Interactive mode” for details. Configuration variable
           <b>clean.requireForce </b>is ignored, as this mode gives its own
           safety protection by going interactive.

       -n, --dry-run
           Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.
           Configuration variable <b>clean.requireForce </b>is ignored, as
           nothing will be deleted anyway.

       -q, --quiet
           Be quiet, only report errors, but not the files that are
           successfully removed.

       -e &lt;pattern&gt;, --exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;
           Use the given exclude pattern in addition to the standard
           ignore rules (see <a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore(5)</a>).

       -x
           Don’t use the standard ignore rules (see <a href="../man5/gitignore.5.html">gitignore(5)</a>), but
           still use the ignore rules given with <b>-e </b>options from the
           command line. This allows removing all untracked files,
           including build products. This can be used (possibly in
           conjunction with <i>git restore</i> or <i>git reset</i>) to create a
           pristine working directory to test a clean build.

       -X
           Remove only files ignored by Git. This may be useful to
           rebuild everything from scratch, but keep manually created
           files.
</pre> <h2>
INTERACTIVE MODE </h2>
<pre>
       When the command enters the interactive mode, it shows the files
       and directories to be cleaned, and goes into its interactive
       command loop.

       The command loop shows the list of subcommands available, and
       gives a prompt "What now&gt; ". In general, when the prompt ends
       with a single <i>&gt;</i>, you can pick only one of the choices given and
       type return, like this:

               *** Commands ***
                   1: clean                2: filter by pattern    3: select by numbers
                   4: ask each             5: quit                 6: help
               What now&gt; 1

       You also could say <b>c </b>or <b>clean </b>above as long as the choice is
       unique.

       The main command loop has 6 subcommands.

       clean
           Start cleaning files and directories, and then quit.

       filter by pattern
           This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues
           an "Input ignore patterns&gt;&gt;" prompt. You can input
           space-separated patterns to exclude files and directories
           from deletion. E.g. "*.c *.h" will exclude files ending with
           ".c" and ".h" from deletion. When you are satisfied with the
           filtered result, press ENTER (empty) back to the main menu.

       select by numbers
           This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues
           an "Select items to delete&gt;&gt;" prompt. When the prompt ends
           with double <i>&gt;&gt;</i> like this, you can make more than one
           selection, concatenated with whitespace or comma. Also you
           can say ranges. E.g. "2-5 7,9" to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the
           list. If the second number in a range is omitted, all
           remaining items are selected. E.g. "7-" to choose 7,8,9 from
           the list. You can say <i>*</i> to choose everything. Also when you
           are satisfied with the filtered result, press ENTER (empty)
           back to the main menu.

       ask each
           This will start to clean, and you must confirm one by one in
           order to delete items. Please note that this action is not as
           efficient as the above two actions.

       quit
           This lets you quit without doing any cleaning.

       help
           Show brief usage of interactive git-clean.
