NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-mask - Mask out updates and automatic installation
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak mask </b>[OPTION...] PATTERN...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are
       masked. A masked ref will never be updated or automatically
       installed (for example a masked extension marked auto-download
       will not be downloaded). You can still manually install such
       refs, but once they are installed the version will be pinned.

       The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character
       matching anything within that part of the ref. Here are some
       example patterns:

           org.some.App
           org.some.App//unstable
           app/org.domain.*
           org.some.App/arm

       To list the current set of masks, run this command without any
       patterns.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>--remove</b>
           Instead of adding the patterns, remove matching patterns.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Mask refs in a per-user installation.

       <b>--system</b>
           Mask refs in the default system-wide installation.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Mask refs in a system-wide installation specified by NAME
           among those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
           <b>--installation=default </b>is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.
</pre> <h2>
