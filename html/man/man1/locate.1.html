DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>locate</b>.  For each
       given pattern, <b>locate </b>searches one or more databases of file
       names and displays the file names that contain the pattern.
       Patterns can contain shell-style metacharacters: `*', `?', and
       `[]'.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.'  specially.
       Therefore, a pattern `foo*bar' can match a file name that
       contains `foo3/bar', and a pattern `*duck*' can match a file name
       that contains `lake/.ducky'.  Patterns that contain
       metacharacters should be quoted to protect them from expansion by
       the shell.

       If a pattern is a plain string — it contains no metacharacters —
       <b>locate </b>displays all file names in the database that contain that
       string anywhere.  If a pattern does contain metacharacters,
       <b>locate </b>only displays file names that match the pattern exactly.
       As a result, patterns that contain metacharacters should usually
       begin with a `*', and will most often end with one as well.  The
       exceptions are patterns that are intended to explicitly match the
       beginning or end of a file name.

       The file name databases contain lists of files that were on the
       system when the databases were last updated.  The system
       administrator can choose the file name of the default database,
       the frequency with which the databases are updated, and the
       directories for which they contain entries; see <a href="updatedb.1.html">updatedb(1)</a>.

       If <b>locate</b>'s output is going to a terminal, unusual characters in
       the output are escaped in the same way as for the -print action
       of the <b>find </b>command.  If the output is not going to a terminal,
       file names are printed exactly as-is.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>-0, --null</i>
              Use ASCII NUL as a separator, instead of newline.

       <i>-A, --all</i>
              Print only names which match all non-option arguments, not
              those matching one or more non-option arguments.

       <i>-b, --basename</i>
              Results are considered to match if the pattern specified
              matches the final component of the name of a file as
              listed in the database.  This final component is usually
              referred to as the `base name'.

       <i>-c, --count</i>
              Instead of printing the matched filenames, just print the
              total number of matches we found, unless --<i>print</i> (-p) is
              also present.

       <i>-d path, --database=path</i>
              Instead of searching the default file name database,
              search the file name databases in <i>path</i>, which is a colon-
              separated list of database file names.  You can also use
              the environment variable <b>LOCATE_PATH </b>to set the list of
              database files to search.  The option overrides the
              environment variable if both are used.  Empty elements in
              the path are taken to be synonyms for the file name of the
              default database.  A database can be supplied on stdin,
              using `-' as an element of <i>path</i>. If more than one element
              of <i>path</i> is `-', later instances are ignored (and a warning
              message is printed).

              The file name database format changed starting with GNU
              <b>find </b>and <b>locate </b>version 4.0 to allow machines with
              different byte orderings to share the databases.  This
              version of <b>locate </b>can automatically recognize and read
              databases produced for older versions of GNU <b>locate </b>or
              Unix versions of <b>locate </b>or <b>find</b>.  Support for the old
              locate database format will be discontinued in a future
              release.

       <i>-e, --existing</i>
              Only print out such names that currently exist (instead of
              such names that existed when the database was created).
              Note that this may slow down the program a lot, if there
              are many matches in the database.  If you are using this
              option within a program, please note that it is possible
              for the file to be deleted after <b>locate </b>has checked that
              it exists, but before you use it.

       <i>-E, --non-existing</i>
              Only print out such names that currently do not exist
              (instead of such names that existed when the database was
              created).  Note that this may slow down the program a lot,
              if there are many matches in the database.

       <i>--help</i> Print a summary of the options to <b>locate </b>and exit.

       <i>-i, --ignore-case</i>
              Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the file
              names.

       <i>-l N, --limit=N</i>
              Limit the number of matches to N.  If a limit is set via
              this option, the number of results printed for the -c
              option will never be larger than this number.

       <i>-L, --follow</i>
              If testing for the existence of files (with the -e or -E
              options), consider broken symbolic links to be non-
              existing.   This is the default.

       <i>--max-database-age D</i>
              Normally, <b>locate </b>will issue a warning message when it
              searches a database which is more than 8 days old.  This
              option changes that value to something other than 8.  The
              effect of specifying a negative value is undefined.

       <i>-m, --mmap</i>
              Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with BSD
              <b>locate</b>.

       <i>-P, -H, --nofollow</i>
              If testing for the existence of files (with the -e or -E
              options), treat broken symbolic links as if they were
              existing files.  The -H form of this option is provided
              purely for similarity with <b>find</b>; the use of -P is
              recommended over -H.

       <i>-p, --print</i>
              Print search results when they normally would not, because
              of the presence of --statistics (-S) or --count (-c).

       <i>-r, --regex</i>
              The pattern specified on the command line is understood to
              be a regular expression, as opposed to a glob pattern.
              The Regular expressions work in the same was as in <b>emacs</b>
              except for the fact that "." will match a newline.  GNU
              <b>find </b>uses the same regular expressions.  Filenames whose
              full paths match the specified regular expression are
              printed (or, in the case of the -c option, counted).  If
              you wish to anchor your regular expression at the ends of
              the full path name, then as is usual with regular
              expressions, you should use the characters ^ and $ to
              signify this.

       <i>--regextype R</i>
              Use regular expression dialect R.  Supported dialects
              include `findutils-default', `posix-awk', `posix-basic',
              `posix-egrep', `posix-extended', `posix-minimal-basic',
              `awk', `ed', `egrep', `emacs', `gnu-awk', `grep' and
              `sed'.  See the Texinfo documentation for a detailed
              explanation of these dialects.

       <i>-s, --stdio</i>
              Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with BSD
              <b>locate</b>.

       <i>-S, --statistics</i>
              Print various statistics about each locate database and
              then exit without performing a search, unless non-option
              arguments are given.  For compatibility with BSD, -S is
              accepted as a synonym for --statistics.  However, the
              output of <b>locate -S </b>is different for the GNU and BSD
              implementations of <b>locate</b>.

       <i>--version</i>
              Print the version number of <b>locate </b>and exit.

       <i>-w, --wholename</i>
              Match against the whole name of the file as listed in the
              database.  This is the default.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>LOCATE_PATH</b>
              Colon-separated list of databases to search.  If the value
              has a leading or trailing colon, or has two colons in a
              row, you may get results that vary between different
              versions of <b>locate</b>.
</pre> <h2>
HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>locate </b>program started life as the BSD fast find program,
       contributed to BSD by James A. Woods.  This was described by his
       paper <i>Finding Files Fast</i> which was published in Usenix <i>;login:</i>,
       Vol 8, No 1, February/March, 1983, pp. 8-10.   When the <b>find</b>
       program began to assume a default <b>-print </b>action if no action was
       specified, this changed the interpretation of <b>find pattern</b>.  The
       BSD developers therefore moved the fast find functionality into
       <b>locate</b>.  The GNU implementation of <b>locate </b>appears to be derived
       from the same code.

       Significant changes to <b>locate </b>in reverse order:
       4.3.7     Byte-order independent support for old database format
       4.3.3     locate <i>-i</i> supports multi-byte characters correctly
                 Introduced <i>--max_db_age</i>
       4.3.2     Support for the slocate database format
       4.2.22    Introduced the <i>--all</i> option
       4.2.15    Introduced the <i>--regex</i> option
       4.2.14    Introduced options <i>-L, -P, -H</i>
       4.2.12    Empty items in <b>LOCATE_PATH </b>now indicate the default database
       4.2.11    Introduced the <i>--statistics</i> option
       4.2.4     Introduced <i>--count</i> and <i>--limit</i>
       4.2.0     Glob characters cause matching against the whole file name
       4.0       Introduced the LOCATE02 database format
       3.7       Locate can search multiple databases
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>locate </b>database correctly handles filenames containing
       newlines, but only if the system's sort command has a working <i>-z</i>
       option.  If you suspect that <b>locate </b>may need to return filenames
       containing newlines, consider using its <i>--null</i> option.
