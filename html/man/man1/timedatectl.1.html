</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>timedatectl </b>[OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>timedatectl </b>may be used to query and change the system clock and
       its settings, and enable or disable time synchronization
       services.

       Use <a href="systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot(1)</a> to initialize the system time zone for
       mounted (but not booted) system images.

       <b>timedatectl </b>may be used to show the current status of time
       synchronization services, for example
       <a href="../man8/systemd-timesyncd.service.8.html">systemd-timesyncd.service(8)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>status</b>
           Show current settings of the system clock and RTC, including
           whether network time synchronization is active. If no command
           is specified, this is the implied default.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>show</b>
           Show the same information as <b>status</b>, but in machine readable
           form. This command is intended to be used whenever
           computer-parsable output is required. Use <b>status </b>if you are
           looking for formatted human-readable output.

           By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use <b>--all </b>to
           show those too. To select specific properties to show, use
           <b>--property=</b>.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>set-time [TIME]</b>
           Set the system clock to the specified time. This will also
           update the RTC time accordingly. The time may be specified in
           the format "2012-10-30 18:17:16".

           Added in version 195.

       <b>set-timezone [TIMEZONE]</b>
           Set the system time zone to the specified value. Available
           timezones can be listed with <b>list-timezones</b>. If the RTC is
           configured to be in the local time, this will also update the
           RTC time. This call will alter the /etc/localtime symlink.
           See <a href="../man5/localtime.5.html">localtime(5)</a> for more information.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>list-timezones</b>
           List available time zones, one per line. Entries from the
           list can be set as the system timezone with <b>set-timezone</b>.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>set-local-rtc [BOOL]</b>
           Takes a boolean argument. If "0", the system is configured to
           maintain the RTC in universal time. If "1", it will maintain
           the RTC in local time instead. Note that maintaining the RTC
           in the local timezone is not fully supported and will create
           various problems with time zone changes and daylight saving
           adjustments. If at all possible, keep the RTC in UTC mode.
           Note that invoking this will also synchronize the RTC from
           the system clock, unless <b>--adjust-system-clock </b>is passed (see
           above). This command will change the 3rd line of
           /etc/adjtime, as documented in <a href="../man8/hwclock.8.html">hwclock(8)</a>.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>set-ntp [BOOL]</b>
           Takes a boolean argument. Controls whether network time
           synchronization is active and enabled (if available). If the
           argument is true, this enables and starts the first existing
           network synchronization service. If the argument is false,
           then this disables and stops the known network
           synchronization services. The way that the list of services
           is built is described in <a href="../man8/systemd-timedated.service.8.html">systemd-timedated.service(8)</a>.

           Added in version 195.

   <b>systemd-timesyncd Commands</b>
       The following commands are specific to
       <a href="../man8/systemd-timesyncd.service.8.html">systemd-timesyncd.service(8)</a>.

       <b>timesync-status</b>
           Show current status of <a href="../man8/systemd-timesyncd.service.8.html">systemd-timesyncd.service(8)</a>. If
           <b>--monitor </b>is specified, then this will monitor the status
           updates.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>show-timesync</b>
           Show the same information as <b>timesync-status</b>, but in machine
           readable form. This command is intended to be used whenever
           computer-parsable output is required. Use <b>timesync-status </b>if
           you are looking for formatted human-readable output.

           By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use <b>--all </b>to
           show those too. To select specific properties to show, use
           <b>--property=</b>.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>ntp-servers </b><i>INTERFACE SERVER</i><b>...</b>
           Set the interface specific NTP servers. This command can be
           used only when the interface is managed by <b>systemd-networkd</b>.

           Added in version 243.

       <b>revert </b><i>INTERFACE</i>
           Revert the interface specific NTP servers. This command can
           be used only when the interface is managed by
           <b>systemd-networkd</b>.

           Added in version 243.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged
           operations.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>--adjust-system-clock</b>
           If <b>set-local-rtc </b>is invoked and this option is passed, the
           system clock is synchronized from the RTC again, taking the
           new setting into account. Otherwise, the RTC is synchronized
           from the system clock.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>--monitor</b>
           If <b>timesync-status </b>is invoked and this option is passed, then
           <b>timedatectl </b>monitors the status of
           <a href="../man8/systemd-timesyncd.service.8.html">systemd-timesyncd.service(8)</a> and updates the outputs. Use
           Ctrl+C to terminate the monitoring.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
           When showing properties of <a href="../man8/systemd-timesyncd.service.8.html">systemd-timesyncd.service(8)</a>, show
           all properties regardless of whether they are set or not.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--property=</b>
           When showing properties of <a href="../man8/systemd-timesyncd.service.8.html">systemd-timesyncd.service(8)</a>,
           limit display to certain properties as specified as argument.
           If not specified, all set properties are shown. The argument
           should be a property name, such as "ServerName". If specified
           more than once, all properties with the specified names are
           shown.

           Added in version 239.

       <b>--value</b>
           When printing properties with <b>show-timesync</b>, only print the
           value, and skip the property name and "=".

           Added in version 239.

       <b>-P</b>
           Equivalent to <b>--value --property=</b>, i.e. shows the value of
           the property without the property name or "=". Note that
           using <b>-P </b>once will also affect all properties listed with
           <b>-p</b>/<b>--property=</b>.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
           username and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The
           hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is
           listening on, separated by ":", and then a container name,
           separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific
           container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to
           the remote machine manager instance. Container names may be
           enumerated with <b>machinectl -H </b><i>HOST</i>. Put IPv6 addresses in
           brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
           name to connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to
           connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special
           string ".host" is used in place of the container name, a
           connection to the local system is made (which is useful to
           connect to a specific user's user bus: "--user
           --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
           connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used
           either the left hand side or the right hand side may be
           omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and
           ".host" are implied.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</i>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a
           higher log level, i.e. less important ones, will be
           suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value
           may be either one of (in order of decreasing importance)
           <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an
           integer in the range 0...7. See <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a> for more
           information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with one
           of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg </b>or <b>journal </b>followed by a colon to
           set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.
           <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info </b>specifies to log at
           debug level except when logging to the console which should
           be at info level). Note that the global maximum log level
           takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be
           colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and other
           tools that display logs will color messages based on the log
           level on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</i>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed
           with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal or a file, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and
           other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on
           the entry metadata on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename
           and line number in the source code where the message
           originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to
           journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
           text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the
           current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to
           journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
           text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</i>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console </b>(log to the
           attached tty), <b>console-prefixed </b>(log to the attached tty but
           with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see
           <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>, <b>kmsg </b>(log to the kernel circular log buffer),
           <b>journal </b>(log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg </b>(log to the
           journal if available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto </b>(determine
           the appropriate log target automatically, the default), <b>null</b>
           (disable log output).

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</i>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults
           to "true". If disabled, systemd will not ratelimit messages
           written to kmsg.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager </b>is not given; overrides <i>$PAGER</i>.
           If neither <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> nor <i>$PAGER</i> are set, a set of
           well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including
           <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> and <a href="more.1.html">more(1)</a>, until one is found. If no pager
           implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting
           this environment variable to an empty string or the value
           "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> (as
           well as <i>$PAGER</i>) will be silently ignored.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i>
           Override the options passed to <b>less </b>(by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when
               Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less </b>to handle Ctrl+C itself
               to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this
               option.

               If the value of <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i> does not include "K", and
               the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C will be ignored
               by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap
               initialization and deinitialization strings to the
               terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to
               remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
               exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager
               functionality from working, in particular paged output
               cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESS</i> environment variable has
           no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

           See <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> for more discussion.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</i>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less </b>(by default "utf-8", if
           the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESSCHARSET</i> environment
           variable has no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the
           pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective
           UID is not the same as the owner of the login session, see
           <a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid(2)</a> and <a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid(3)</a>. In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1 </b>will be set when invoking the pager, and the
           pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or
           start new subprocesses. When <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set
           at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode
           will not be used. (Currently only <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for
           example under <a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo(8)</a> or <b>pkexec</b>(1), care must be taken to
           ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled.
           "Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as
           describe above. Setting <i>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</i> or not removing
           it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke
           arbitrary commands. Note that if the <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> or <i>$PAGER</i>
           variables are to be honoured, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> must be
           set too. It might be reasonable to completely disable the
           pager using <b>--no-pager </b>instead.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd </b>and related
           utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the
           output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can
           take one of the following special values: "16", "256" to
           restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic
           decision based on <i>$TERM</i> and what the console is connected to.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</i>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links
           should be generated in the output for terminal emulators
           supporting this. This can be specified to override the
           decision that <b>systemd </b>makes based on <i>$TERM</i> and other
           conditions.
