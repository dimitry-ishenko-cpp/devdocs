NAME </h2>

       <b>pmpython </b>- run a python script using a preferred python variant
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmpython </b>[<i>python-args-and-script</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmpython </b>provides a way to run python scripts using a
       customisable python interpreter, rather than embedding the name
       of a particular version of python into each script.

       This can be useful as it allows version-independent python code
       to be run anywhere.  All python modules shipped with PCP support
       versions 2.6 and later (in the python2 series), and 3.3 and later
       (in the python3 release series).

       Due to python monitoring and collecting scripts being relatively
       simple in PCP (not requiring new modules, language features,
       etc), it has been possible to ensure they work for all of the
       above python versions.

       However, the name of the python interpreter is not always the
       same, thus, it is common for PCP python scripts to use a
       “shebang” line that launches the <b>python </b>interpreter indirectly as
       follows:

          #!/usr/bin/env pmpython

       <a href="env.1.html">env(1)</a> is used to find the correct path for the <b>pmpython</b>
       executable from the user's <b>$PATH</b>.

       By default the name of the python interpreter is found from the
       the value of <b>$PCP_PYTHON_PROG </b>from the environment (if set) else
       from <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i>.  The latter is the more typical case where
       this value is based on some heuristics about the platform at the
       time the PCP packages were build and favour the use of <i>python3</i> in
       all recent releases of PCP (for those platforms that support it).

       This allows an appropriate name to be used for the python
       interpreter instead of a hard-coded python version name, while
       still allowing the user to override the python interpreter as
       follows:

          $ PCP_PYTHON_PROG=python3 pmpython --version
          Python 3.4.2
          $ PCP_PYTHON_PROG=python2 pmpython --version
          Python 2.7.9

       This is convenient for shipping identical scripts on multiple
       platforms, and for testing different python versions with the one
       script (e.g. in the case where multiple versions of python are
       installed, PCP_PYTHON_PROG can be set in the local environment to
       override the global setting).

       <b>pmpython </b>is a replacement for an earlier tool with similar
       function, namely <a href="pcp-python.1.html">pcp-python(1)</a>.

PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
