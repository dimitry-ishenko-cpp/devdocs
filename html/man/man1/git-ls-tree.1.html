NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-ls-tree - List the contents of a tree object
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git ls-tree</i> [-d] [-r] [-t] [-l] [-z]
                   [--name-only] [--name-status] [--object-only] [--full-name] [--full-tree] [--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]] [--format=&lt;format&gt;]
                   &lt;tree-ish&gt; [&lt;path&gt;...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Lists the contents of a given tree object, like what "/bin/ls -a"
       does in the current working directory. Note that:

       •   the behaviour is slightly different from that of "/bin/ls" in
           that the <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> denotes just a list of patterns to match,
           e.g. so specifying directory name (without <b>-r</b>) will behave
           differently, and order of the arguments does not matter.

       •   the behaviour is similar to that of "/bin/ls" in that the
           <i>&lt;path&gt;</i> is taken as relative to the current working directory.
           E.g. when you are in a directory <i>sub</i> that has a directory
           <i>dir</i>, you can run <i>git ls-tree -r HEAD dir</i> to list the contents
           of the tree (that is <b>sub/dir </b>in <b>HEAD</b>). You don’t want to give
           a tree that is not at the root level (e.g.  <b>git ls-tree -r</b>
           <b>HEAD:sub dir</b>) in this case, as that would result in asking
           for <b>sub/sub/dir </b>in the <b>HEAD </b>commit. However, the current
           working directory can be ignored by passing --full-tree
           option.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;tree-ish&gt;
           Id of a tree-ish.

       -d
           Show only the named tree entry itself, not its children.

       -r
           Recurse into sub-trees.

       -t
           Show tree entries even when going to recurse them. Has no
           effect if <b>-r </b>was not passed.  <b>-d </b>implies <b>-t</b>.

       -l, --long
           Show object size of blob (file) entries.

       -z
           \0 line termination on output and do not quote filenames. See
           OUTPUT FORMAT below for more information.

       --name-only, --name-status
           List only filenames (instead of the "long" output), one per
           line. Cannot be combined with <b>--object-only</b>.

       --object-only
           List only names of the objects, one per line. Cannot be
           combined with <b>--name-only </b>or <b>--name-status</b>. This is
           equivalent to specifying <b>--format='%(objectname)'</b>, but for
           both this option and that exact format the command takes a
           hand-optimized codepath instead of going through the generic
           formatting mechanism.

       --abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]
           Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object lines,
           show the shortest prefix that is at least <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> hexdigits long
           that uniquely refers the object. Non default number of digits
           can be specified with --abbrev=&lt;n&gt;.

       --full-name
           Instead of showing the path names relative to the current
           working directory, show the full path names.

       --full-tree
           Do not limit the listing to the current working directory.
           Implies --full-name.

       --format=&lt;format&gt;
           A string that interpolates <b>%(fieldname) </b>from the result being
           shown. It also interpolates <b>%% </b>to <b>%</b>, and <b>%xNN </b>where <b>NN </b>are
           hex digits interpolates to character with hex code <b>NN</b>; for
           example <b>%x00 </b>interpolates to <b>\0 </b>(NUL), <b>%x09 </b>to <b>\t </b>(TAB) and
           <b>%x0a </b>to <b>\n </b>(LF). When specified, <b>--format </b>cannot be combined
           with other format-altering options, including <b>--long</b>,
           <b>--name-only </b>and <b>--object-only</b>.

       [&lt;path&gt;...]
           When paths are given, show them (note that this isn’t really
           raw pathnames, but rather a list of patterns to match).
           Otherwise implicitly uses the root level of the tree as the
           sole path argument.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The output format of <b>ls-tree </b>is determined by either the <b>--format</b>
       option, or other format-altering options such as <b>--name-only </b>etc.
       (see <b>--format </b>above).

       The use of certain <b>--format </b>directives is equivalent to using
       those options, but invoking the full formatting machinery can be
       slower than using an appropriate formatting option.

       In cases where the <b>--format </b>would exactly map to an existing
       option <b>ls-tree </b>will use the appropriate faster path. Thus the
       default format is equivalent to:

           %(objectmode) %(objecttype) %(objectname)%x09%(path)

       This output format is compatible with what <b>--index-info --stdin</b>
       of <i>git update-index</i> expects.

       When the <b>-l </b>option is used, format changes to

           %(objectmode) %(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize:padded)%x09%(path)

       Object size identified by &lt;objectname&gt; is given in bytes, and
       right-justified with minimum width of 7 characters. Object size
       is given only for blobs (file) entries; for other entries <b>-</b>
       character is used in place of size.

       Without the <b>-z </b>option, pathnames with "unusual" characters are
       quoted as explained for the configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b>
       (see <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>). Using <b>-z </b>the filename is output verbatim and
       the line is terminated by a NUL byte.

       Customized format:

       It is possible to print in a custom format by using the <b>--format</b>
       option, which is able to interpolate different fields using a
       <b>%(fieldname) </b>notation. For example, if you only care about the
       "objectname" and "path" fields, you can execute with a specific
       "--format" like

           git ls-tree --format='%(objectname) %(path)' &lt;tree-ish&gt;
</pre> <h2>
FIELD NAMES </h2>
<pre>
       Various values from structured fields can be used to interpolate
       into the resulting output. For each outputting line, the
       following names can be used:

       objectmode
           The mode of the object.

       objecttype
           The type of the object (<b>commit</b>, <b>blob </b>or <b>tree</b>).

       objectname
           The name of the object.

       objectsize[:padded]
           The size of a <b>blob </b>object ("-" if it’s a <b>commit </b>or <b>tree</b>). It
           also supports a padded format of size with
           "%(objectsize:padded)".

       path
           The pathname of the object.
