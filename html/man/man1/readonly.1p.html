PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       readonly — set the readonly attribute for variables
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       readonly name<b>[</b>=<i>word</i><b>]</b>...

       readonly -p
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The variables whose <i>name</i>s are specified shall be given the
       <i>readonly</i> attribute. The values of variables with the <i>readonly</i>
       attribute cannot be changed by subsequent assignment, nor can
       those variables be unset by the <i>unset</i> utility. If the name of a
       variable is followed by =<i>word</i>, then the value of that variable
       shall be set to <i>word</i>.

       The <i>readonly</i> special built-in shall support the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       When <b>-p </b>is specified, <i>readonly</i> writes to the standard output the
       names and values of all read-only variables, in the following
       format:

           "readonly %s=%s\n", &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>value</i>&gt;

       if <i>name</i> is set, and

           "readonly %s\n", &lt;<i>name</i>&gt;

       if <i>name</i> is unset.

       The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of
       quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as
       commands that achieve the same value and <i>readonly</i> attribute-
       setting results in a shell execution environment in which:

        1. Variables with values at the time they were output do not
           have the <i>readonly</i> attribute set.

        2. Variables that were unset at the time they were output do not
           have a value at the time at which the saved output is reinput
           to the shell.

       When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.

EXAMPLES </h2>

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       Some historical shells preserve the <i>readonly</i> attribute across
       separate invocations. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 allows this
       behavior, but does not require it.

       The <b>-p </b>option allows portable access to the values that can be
       saved and then later restored using, for example, a <i>dot</i> script.
       Also see the RATIONALE for <a href="export.1p.html">export(1p)</a> for a description of the
       no-argument and <b>-p </b>output cases and a related example.

       Read-only functions were considered, but they were omitted as not
       being historical practice or particularly useful. Furthermore,
       functions must not be read-only across invocations to preclude
       ``spoofing'' (spoofing is the term for the practice of creating a
       program that acts like a well-known utility with the intent of
       subverting the real intent of the user) of administrative or
       security-relevant (or security-conscious) shell scripts.
