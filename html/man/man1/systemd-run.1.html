</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemd-run </b>may be used to create and start a transient .service
       or .scope unit and run the specified <i>COMMAND</i> in it. It may also
       be used to create and start a transient .path, .socket, or .timer
       unit, that activates a .service unit when elapsing.

       If a command is run as transient service unit, it will be started
       and managed by the service manager like any other service, and
       thus shows up in the output of <b>systemctl list-units </b>like any
       other unit. It will run in a clean and detached execution
       environment, with the service manager as its parent process. In
       this mode, <b>systemd-run </b>will start the service asynchronously in
       the background and return after the command has begun execution
       (unless <b>--no-block</b>, <b>--wait</b>, <b>--pipe</b>, or <b>--pty </b>are specified, see
       below).

       If a command is run as transient scope unit, it will be executed
       by <b>systemd-run </b>itself as parent process and will thus inherit the
       execution environment of the caller. However, the processes of
       the command are managed by the service manager similarly to
       normal services, and will show up in the output of <b>systemctl</b>
       <b>list-units</b>. Execution in this case is synchronous, and will
       return only when the command finishes. This mode is enabled via
       the <b>--scope </b>switch (see below).

       If a command is run with path, socket, or timer options such as
       <b>--on-calendar= </b>(see below), a transient path, socket, or timer
       unit is created alongside the service unit for the specified
       command. Only the transient path, socket, or timer unit is
       started immediately, the transient service unit will be triggered
       by the path, socket, or timer unit. If the <b>--unit= </b>option is
       specified, the <i>COMMAND</i> may be omitted. In this case, <b>systemd-run</b>
       creates only a .path, .socket, or .timer unit that triggers the
       specified unit.

       By default, services created with <b>systemd-run </b>default to the
       <b>simple </b>type, see the description of <i>Type=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>
       for details. Note that when this type is used, the service
       manager (and thus the <b>systemd-run </b>command) considers service
       start-up successful as soon as the <b>fork() </b>for the main service
       process succeeded, i.e. before the <b>execve() </b>is invoked, and thus
       even if the specified command cannot be started. Consider using
       the <b>exec </b>service type (i.e.  <b>--property=Type=exec</b>) to ensure that
       <b>systemd-run </b>returns successfully only if the specified command
       line has been successfully started.

       After <b>systemd-run </b>passes the command to the service manager, the
       manager performs variable expansion. This means that dollar
       characters ("$") which should not be expanded need to be escaped
       as "$$". Expansion can also be disabled using
       <i>--expand-environment=no</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged
           operations.

           Added in version 226.

       <b>--scope</b>
           Create a transient .scope unit instead of the default
           transient .service unit (see above).

           Added in version 206.

       <b>--unit=</b>, <b>-u</b>
           Use this unit name instead of an automatically generated one.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>--property=</b>, <b>-p</b>
           Sets a property on the scope or service unit that is created.
           This option takes an assignment in the same format as
           <a href="systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a>'s <b>set-property </b>command.

           Added in version 211.

       <b>--description=</b>
           Provide a description for the service, scope, path, socket,
           or timer unit. If not specified, the command itself will be
           used as a description. See <i>Description=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>--slice=</b>
           Make the new .service or .scope unit part of the specified
           slice, instead of system.slice (when running in <b>--system</b>
           mode) or the root slice (when running in <b>--user </b>mode).

           Added in version 206.

       <b>--slice-inherit</b>
           Make the new .service or .scope unit part of the slice the
           <b>systemd-run </b>itself has been invoked in. This option may be
           combined with <b>--slice=</b>, in which case the slice specified via
           <b>--slice= </b>is placed within the slice the <b>systemd-run </b>command
           is invoked in.

           Example: consider <b>systemd-run </b>being invoked in the slice
           foo.slice, and the <b>--slice= </b>argument is bar. The unit will
           then be placed under foo-bar.slice.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>--expand-environment=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Expand environment variables in command arguments. If
           enabled, environment variables specified as "${<i>VARIABLE</i>}"
           will be expanded in the same way as in commands specified via
           <i>ExecStart=</i> in units. With <i>--scope</i>, this expansion is
           performed by <b>systemd-run </b>itself, and in other cases by the
           service manager that spawns the command. Note that this is
           similar to, but not the same as variable expansion in <a href="bash.1.html">bash(1)</a>
           and other shells.

           The default is to enable this option in all cases, except for
           <i>--scope</i> where it is disabled by default, for backward
           compatibility reasons. Note that this will be changed in a
           future release, where it will be switched to enabled by
           default as well.

           See <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a> for a description of variable
           expansion. Disabling variable expansion is useful if the
           specified command includes or may include a "$" sign.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--remain-after-exit</b>
           After the service process has terminated, keep the service
           around until it is explicitly stopped. This is useful to
           collect runtime information about the service after it
           finished running. Also see <i>RemainAfterExit=</i> in
           <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>.

           Added in version 207.

       <b>--send-sighup</b>
           When terminating the scope or service unit, send a SIGHUP
           immediately after SIGTERM. This is useful to indicate to
           shells and shell-like processes that the connection has been
           severed. Also see <i>SendSIGHUP=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.kill.5.html">systemd.kill(5)</a>.

           Added in version 207.

       <b>--service-type=</b>
           Sets the service type. Also see <i>Type=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>.
           This option has no effect in conjunction with <b>--scope</b>.
           Defaults to <b>simple</b>.

           Added in version 211.

       <b>--uid=</b>, <b>--gid=</b>
           Runs the service process under the specified UNIX user and
           group. Also see <i>User=</i> and <i>Group=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a>.

           Added in version 211.

       <b>--nice=</b>
           Runs the service process with the specified nice level. Also
           see <i>Nice=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a>.

           Added in version 211.

       <b>--working-directory=</b>
           Runs the service process with the specified working
           directory. Also see <i>WorkingDirectory=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a>.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>--same-dir</b>, <b>-d</b>
           Similar to <b>--working-directory=</b>, but uses the current working
           directory of the caller for the service to execute.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>-E </b><i>NAME</i><b>[=</b><i>VALUE</i><b>]</b>, <b>--setenv=</b><i>NAME</i><b>[=</b><i>VALUE</i><b>]</b>
           Runs the service process with the specified environment
           variable set. This parameter may be used more than once to
           set multiple variables. When "=" and <i>VALUE</i> are omitted, the
           value of the variable with the same name in the program
           environment will be used.

           Also see <i>Environment=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a>.

           Added in version 211.

       <b>--pty</b>, <b>-t</b>
           When invoking the command, the transient service connects its
           standard input, output and error to the terminal <b>systemd-run</b>
           is invoked on, via a pseudo TTY device. This allows running
           programs that expect interactive user input/output as
           services, such as interactive command shells.

           This option will result in <b>systemd-run </b>synchronously waiting
           for the transient service to terminate, similar to specifying
           <b>--wait</b>. If specified along with <b>--wait</b>, <b>systemd-run </b>won't
           exit when manually disconnecting from the pseudo TTY device.

           Note that <a href="machinectl.1.html">machinectl(1)</a>'s <b>shell </b>command is usually a better
           alternative for requesting a new, interactive login session
           on the local host or a local container.

           See below for details on how this switch combines with
           <b>--pipe</b>.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>--pipe</b>, <b>-P</b>
           If specified, standard input, output, and error of the
           transient service are inherited from the <b>systemd-run </b>command
           itself. This allows <b>systemd-run </b>to be used within shell
           pipelines.

           Note that this mode is not suitable for interactive command
           shells and similar, as the service process will not become a
           TTY controller when invoked on a terminal. Use <b>--pty </b>instead
           in that case.

           When both <b>--pipe </b>and <b>--pty </b>are used in combination the more
           appropriate option is automatically determined and used.
           Specifically, when invoked with standard input, output and
           error connected to a TTY <b>--pty </b>is used, and otherwise <b>--pipe</b>.

           This option will result in <b>systemd-run </b>synchronously waiting
           for the transient service to terminate, similar to specifying
           <b>--wait</b>.

           When this option is used the original file descriptors
           <b>systemd-run </b>receives are passed to the service processes
           as-is. If the service runs with different privileges than
           <b>systemd-run</b>, this means the service might not be able to
           reopen the passed file descriptors, due to normal file
           descriptor access restrictions. If the invoked process is a
           shell script that uses the <b>echo "hello" &gt;/dev/stderr</b>
           construct for writing messages to stderr, this might cause
           problems, as this only works if stderr can be reopened. To
           mitigate this use the construct <b>echo "hello" &gt;&amp;2 </b>instead,
           which is mostly equivalent and avoids this pitfall.

           Added in version 235.

       <b>--shell</b>, <b>-S</b>
           A shortcut for "--pty --same-dir --wait --collect
           --service-type=exec $SHELL", i.e. requests an interactive
           shell in the current working directory, running in service
           context, accessible with a single switch.

           Added in version 240.

       <b>--quiet</b>, <b>-q</b>
           Suppresses additional informational output while running.
           This is particularly useful in combination with <b>--pty </b>when it
           will suppress the initial message explaining how to terminate
           the TTY connection.

           Added in version 219.

       <b>--on-active=</b>, <b>--on-boot=</b>, <b>--on-startup=</b>, <b>--on-unit-active=</b>,
       <b>--on-unit-inactive=</b>
           Defines a monotonic timer relative to different starting
           points for starting the specified command. See <i>OnActiveSec=</i>,
           <i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>, <i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i> and
           <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.timer.5.html">systemd.timer(5)</a> for details. These
           options are shortcuts for <b>--timer-property= </b>with the relevant
           properties. These options may not be combined with <b>--scope </b>or
           <b>--pty</b>.

           Added in version 218.

       <b>--on-calendar=</b>
           Defines a calendar timer for starting the specified command.
           See <i>OnCalendar=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.timer.5.html">systemd.timer(5)</a>. This option is a
           shortcut for <b>--timer-property=OnCalendar=</b>. This option may
           not be combined with <b>--scope </b>or <b>--pty</b>.

           Added in version 218.

       <b>--on-clock-change</b>, <b>--on-timezone-change</b>
           Defines a trigger based on system clock jumps or timezone
           changes for starting the specified command. See
           <i>OnClockChange=</i> and <i>OnTimezoneChange=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.timer.5.html">systemd.timer(5)</a>.
           These options are shortcuts for
           <b>--timer-property=OnClockChange=yes </b>and
           <b>--timer-property=OnTimezoneChange=yes</b>. These options may not
           be combined with <b>--scope </b>or <b>--pty</b>.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>--path-property=</b>, <b>--socket-property=</b>, <b>--timer-property=</b>
           Sets a property on the path, socket, or timer unit that is
           created. This option is similar to <b>--property=</b>, but applies
           to the transient path, socket, or timer unit rather than the
           transient service unit created. This option takes an
           assignment in the same format as <a href="systemctl.1.html">systemctl(1)</a>'s <b>set-property</b>
           command. These options may not be combined with <b>--scope </b>or
           <b>--pty</b>.

           Added in version 218.

       <b>--no-block</b>
           Do not synchronously wait for the unit start operation to
           finish. If this option is not specified, the start request
           for the transient unit will be verified, enqueued and
           <b>systemd-run </b>will wait until the unit's start-up is completed.
           By passing this argument, it is only verified and enqueued.
           This option may not be combined with <b>--wait</b>.

           Added in version 220.

       <b>--wait</b>
           Synchronously wait for the transient service to terminate. If
           this option is specified, the start request for the transient
           unit is verified, enqueued, and waited for. Subsequently the
           invoked unit is monitored, and it is waited until it is
           deactivated again (most likely because the specified command
           completed). On exit, terse information about the unit's
           runtime is shown, including total runtime (as well as CPU
           usage, if <b>--property=CPUAccounting=1 </b>was set) and the exit
           code and status of the main process. This output may be
           suppressed with <b>--quiet</b>. This option may not be combined with
           <b>--no-block</b>, <b>--scope </b>or the various path, socket, or timer
           options.

           Added in version 232.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--collect</b>
           Unload the transient unit after it completed, even if it
           failed. Normally, without this option, all units that ran and
           failed are kept in memory until the user explicitly resets
           their failure state with <b>systemctl reset-failed </b>or an
           equivalent command. On the other hand, units that ran
           successfully are unloaded immediately. If this option is
           turned on the "garbage collection" of units is more
           aggressive, and unloads units regardless if they exited
           successfully or failed. This option is a shortcut for
           <b>--property=CollectMode=inactive-or-failed</b>, see the
           explanation for <i>CollectMode=</i> in <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for further
           information.

           Added in version 236.

       <b>--ignore-failure</b>
           By default, if the specified command fails the invoked unit
           will be marked failed (though possibly still unloaded, see
           <b>--collect=</b>, above), and this is reported in the logs. If this
           switch is specified this is suppressed and any non-success
           exit status/code of the command is treated as success.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--background=</b><i>COLOR</i>
           Change the terminal background color to the specified ANSI
           color as long as the session lasts. The color specified
           should be an ANSI X3.64 SGR background color, i.e. strings
           such as "40", "41", ..., "47", "48;2;...", "48;5;...". See
           <b>ANSI Escape Code (Wikipedia)</b>[1] for details.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--user</b>
           Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than
           the service manager of the system.

       <b>--system</b>
           Talk to the service manager of the system. This is the
           implied default.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
           username and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The
           hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is
           listening on, separated by ":", and then a container name,
           separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific
           container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to
           the remote machine manager instance. Container names may be
           enumerated with <b>machinectl -H </b><i>HOST</i>. Put IPv6 addresses in
           brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
           name to connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to
           connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special
           string ".host" is used in place of the container name, a
           connection to the local system is made (which is useful to
           connect to a specific user's user bus: "--user
           --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
           connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used
           either the left hand side or the right hand side may be
           omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and
           ".host" are implied.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--capsule=</b>
           Execute operation on a capsule. Specify a capsule name to
           connect to. See <a href="../man5/capsule@.service.5.html">capsule@.service(5)</a> for details about
           capsules.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       All command line arguments after the first non-option argument
       become part of the command line of the launched process.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       On success, 0 is returned. If <b>systemd-run </b>failed to start the
       service, a non-zero return value will be returned. If <b>systemd-run</b>
       waits for the service to terminate, the return value will be
       propagated from the service. 0 will be returned on success,
       including all the cases where systemd considers a service to have
       exited cleanly, see the discussion of <i>SuccessExitStatus=</i> in
       <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>.

       <b>Example 1. Logging environment variables provided by systemd to</b>
       <b>services</b>

           # systemd-run env
           Running as unit: run-19945.service
           # journalctl -u run-19945.service
           Sep 08 07:37:21 bupkis systemd[1]: Starting /usr/bin/env...

       <b>Example 2. Limiting resources available to a command</b>

           # systemd-run -p IOWeight=10 updatedb

       This command invokes the <b>updatedb</b>(8) tool, but lowers the block
       I/O weight for it to 10. See <a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)</a> for more
       information on the <i>IOWeight=</i> property.

       <b>Example 3. Running commands at a specified time</b>

       The following command will touch a file after 30 seconds.

           # date; systemd-run --on-active=30 --timer-property=AccuracySec=100ms /bin/touch /tmp/foo
           Mon Dec  8 20:44:24 KST 2014
           Running as unit: run-71.timer
           Will run service as unit: run-71.service
           # journalctl -b -u run-71.timer
           -- Journal begins at Fri 2014-12-05 19:09:21 KST, ends at Mon 2014-12-08 20:44:54 KST. --
           Dec 08 20:44:38 container systemd[1]: Starting /bin/touch /tmp/foo.
           Dec 08 20:44:38 container systemd[1]: Started /bin/touch /tmp/foo.
           # journalctl -b -u run-71.service
           -- Journal begins at Fri 2014-12-05 19:09:21 KST, ends at Mon 2014-12-08 20:44:54 KST. --
           Dec 08 20:44:48 container systemd[1]: Starting /bin/touch /tmp/foo...
           Dec 08 20:44:48 container systemd[1]: Started /bin/touch /tmp/foo.

       <b>Example 4. Allowing access to the tty</b>

       The following command invokes <a href="bash.1.html">bash(1)</a> as a service passing its
       standard input, output and error to the calling TTY.

           # systemd-run -t --send-sighup bash

       <b>Example 5. Start screen as a user service</b>

           $ systemd-run --scope --user screen
           Running scope as unit run-r14b0047ab6df45bfb45e7786cc839e76.scope.

           $ screen -ls
           There is a screen on:
                   492..laptop     (Detached)
           1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-fatima.

       This starts the <b>screen </b>process as a child of the <b>systemd --user</b>
       process that was started by user@.service, in a scope unit. A
       <a href="../man5/systemd.scope.5.html">systemd.scope(5)</a> unit is used instead of a <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>
       unit, because <b>screen </b>will exit when detaching from the terminal,
       and a service unit would be terminated. Running <b>screen </b>as a user
       unit has the advantage that it is not part of the session scope.
       If <i>KillUserProcesses=yes</i> is configured in <a href="../man5/logind.conf.5.html">logind.conf(5)</a>, the
       default, the session scope will be terminated when the user logs
       out of that session.

       The user@.service is started automatically when the user first
       logs in, and stays around as long as at least one login session
       is open. After the user logs out of the last session,
       user@.service and all services underneath it are terminated. This
       behavior is the default, when "lingering" is not enabled for that
       user. Enabling lingering means that user@.service is started
       automatically during boot, even if the user is not logged in, and
       that the service is not terminated when the user logs out.

       Enabling lingering allows the user to run processes without being
       logged in, for example to allow <b>screen </b>to persist after the user
       logs out, even if the session scope is terminated. In the default
       configuration, users can enable lingering for themselves:

           $ loginctl enable-linger

       <b>Example 6. Variable expansion by the manager</b>

           $ systemd-run -t echo "&lt;${INVOCATION_ID}&gt;" '&lt;${INVOCATION_ID}&gt;'
                 &lt;&gt; &lt;5d0149bfa2c34b79bccb13074001eb20&gt;

       The first argument is expanded by the shell (double quotes), but
       the second one is not expanded by the shell (single quotes).
       <a href="echo.1.html">echo(1)</a> is called with ["/usr/bin/echo", "&lt;&gt;",
       "&lt;${INVOCATION_ID}&gt;"] as the argument array, and then <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>
       generates <i>${INVOCATION_ID}</i> and substitutes it in the
       command-line. This substitution could not be done on the client
       side, because the target ID that will be set for the service
       isn't known before the call is made.

       <b>Example 7. Variable expansion and output redirection using a</b>
       <b>shell</b>

       Variable expansion by <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a> can be disabled with
       <i>--expand-environment=no</i>.

       Disabling variable expansion can be useful if the command to
       execute contains dollar characters and escaping them would be
       inconvenient. For example, when a shell is used:

           $ systemd-run --expand-environment=no -t bash \
                 -c 'echo $SHELL $$ &gt;/dev/stdout'
           /bin/bash 12345

       The last argument is passed verbatim to the <a href="bash.1.html">bash(1)</a> shell which
       is started by the service unit. The shell expands "$SHELL" to the
       path of the shell, and "$$" to its process number, and then those
       strings are passed to the <b>echo </b>built-in and printed to standard
       output (which in this case is connected to the calling terminal).

       <b>Example 8. Return value</b>

           $ systemd-run --user --wait true
           $ systemd-run --user --wait -p SuccessExitStatus=11 bash -c 'exit 11'
           $ systemd-run --user --wait -p SuccessExitStatus=SIGUSR1 --expand-environment=no \
                 bash -c 'kill -SIGUSR1 $$'

       Those three invocations will succeed, i.e. terminate with an exit
       code of 0.
