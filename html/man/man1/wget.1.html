NAME </h2>
<pre>
       Wget - The non-interactive network downloader.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       wget [<i>option</i>]... [<i>URL</i>]...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files
       from the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as
       well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.

       Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the
       background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to
       start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget
       finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require
       constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when
       transferring a lot of data.

       Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create
       local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the
       directory structure of the original site.  This is sometimes
       referred to as "recursive downloading."  While doing that, Wget
       respects the Robot Exclusion Standard (<i>/robots.txt</i>).  Wget can be
       instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to point at
       the local files, for offline viewing.

       Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable
       network connections; if a download fails due to a network
       problem, it will keep retrying until the whole file has been
       retrieved.  If the server supports regetting, it will instruct
       the server to continue the download from where it left off.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Option Syntax</b>
       Since Wget uses GNU getopt to process command-line arguments,
       every option has a long form along with the short one.  Long
       options are more convenient to remember, but take time to type.
       You may freely mix different option styles, or specify options
       after the command-line arguments.  Thus you may write:

               wget -r --tries=10 <a href="http://fly.srk.fer.hr/">http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</a> -o log

       The space between the option accepting an argument and the
       argument may be omitted.  Instead of <b>-o log </b>you can write <b>-olog</b>.

       You may put several options that do not require arguments
       together, like:

               wget -drc &lt;URL&gt;

       This is completely equivalent to:

               wget -d -r -c &lt;URL&gt;

       Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may
       terminate them with <b>--</b>.  So the following will try to download
       URL <b>-x</b>, reporting failure to <i>log</i>:

               wget -o log -- -x

       The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the
       convention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This
       can be useful to clear the <i>.wgetrc</i> settings.  For instance, if
       your <i>.wgetrc</i> sets "exclude_directories" to <i>/cgi-bin</i>, the
       following example will first reset it, and then set it to exclude
       <i>/~nobody</i> and <i>/~somebody</i>.  You can also clear the lists in
       <i>.wgetrc</i>.

               wget -X "" -X /~nobody,/~somebody

       Most options that do not accept arguments are <i>boolean</i> options, so
       named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no
       ("boolean") variable.  For example, <b>--follow-ftp </b>tells Wget to
       follow FTP links from HTML files and, on the other hand,
       <b>--no-glob </b>tells it not to perform file globbing on FTP URLs.  A
       boolean option is either <i>affirmative</i> or <i>negative</i> (beginning with
       <b>--no</b>).  All such options share several properties.

       Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior
       is the opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example,
       the documented existence of <b>--follow-ftp </b>assumes that the default
       is to <i>not</i> follow FTP links from HTML pages.

       Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the <b>--no- </b>to the
       option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the
       <b>--no- </b>prefix.  This might seem superfluous---if the default for
       an affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a
       way to explicitly turn it off?  But the startup file may in fact
       change the default.  For instance, using "follow_ftp = on" in
       <i>.wgetrc</i> makes Wget <i>follow</i> FTP links by default, and using
       <b>--no-follow-ftp </b>is the only way to restore the factory default
       from the command line.

   <b>Basic Startup Options</b>
       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Display the version of Wget.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>
           Print a help message describing all of Wget's command-line
           options.

       <b>-b</b>
       <b>--background</b>
           Go to background immediately after startup.  If no output
           file is specified via the <b>-o</b>, output is redirected to <i>wget-</i>
           <i>log</i>.

       <b>-e </b><i>command</i>
       <b>--execute </b><i>command</i>
           Execute <i>command</i> as if it were a part of <i>.wgetrc</i>.  A command
           thus invoked will be executed <i>after</i> the commands in <i>.wgetrc</i>,
           thus taking precedence over them.  If you need to specify
           more than one wgetrc command, use multiple instances of <b>-e</b>.

   <b>Logging and Input File Options</b>
       <b>-o </b><i>logfile</i>
       <b>--output-file=</b><i>logfile</i>
           Log all messages to <i>logfile</i>.  The messages are normally
           reported to standard error.

       <b>-a </b><i>logfile</i>
       <b>--append-output=</b><i>logfile</i>
           Append to <i>logfile</i>.  This is the same as <b>-o</b>, only it appends
           to <i>logfile</i> instead of overwriting the old log file.  If
           <i>logfile</i> does not exist, a new file is created.

       <b>-d</b>
       <b>--debug</b>
           Turn on debug output, meaning various information important
           to the developers of Wget if it does not work properly.  Your
           system administrator may have chosen to compile Wget without
           debug support, in which case <b>-d </b>will not work.  Please note
           that compiling with debug support is always safe---Wget
           compiled with the debug support will <i>not</i> print any debug info
           unless requested with <b>-d</b>.

       <b>-q</b>
       <b>--quiet</b>
           Turn off Wget's output.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
           Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The
           default output is verbose.

       <b>-nv</b>
       <b>--no-verbose</b>
           Turn off verbose without being completely quiet (use <b>-q </b>for
           that), which means that error messages and basic information
           still get printed.

       <b>--report-speed=</b><i>type</i>
           Output bandwidth as <i>type</i>.  The only accepted value is <b>bits</b>.

       <b>-i </b><i>file</i>
       <b>--input-file=</b><i>file</i>
           Read URLs from a local or external <i>file</i>.  If <b>- </b>is specified
           as <i>file</i>, URLs are read from the standard input.  (Use <b>./- </b>to
           read from a file literally named <b>-</b>.)

           If this function is used, no URLs need be present on the
           command line.  If there are URLs both on the command line and
           in an input file, those on the command lines will be the
           first ones to be retrieved.  If <b>--force-html </b>is not
           specified, then <i>file</i> should consist of a series of URLs, one
           per line.

           However, if you specify <b>--force-html</b>, the document will be
           regarded as <b>html</b>.  In that case you may have problems with
           relative links, which you can solve either by adding "&lt;base
           href="<i>url</i>.html"&gt;" to the documents or by specifying <b>--base=</b><i>url</i> on
           the command line.

           If the <i>file</i> is an external one, the document will be
           automatically treated as <b>html </b>if the Content-Type matches
           <b>text/html</b>.  Furthermore, the <i>file</i>'s location will be
           implicitly used as base href if none was specified.

       <b>--input-metalink=</b><i>file</i>
           Downloads files covered in local Metalink <i>file</i>. Metalink
           version 3 and 4 are supported.

       <b>--keep-badhash</b>
           Keeps downloaded Metalink's files with a bad hash. It appends
           .badhash to the name of Metalink's files which have a
           checksum mismatch, except without overwriting existing files.

       <b>--metalink-over-http</b>
           Issues HTTP HEAD request instead of GET and extracts Metalink
           metadata from response headers. Then it switches to Metalink
           download.  If no valid Metalink metadata is found, it falls
           back to ordinary HTTP download.  Enables <b>Content-Type:</b>
           <b>application/metalink4+xml </b>files download/processing.

       <b>--metalink-index=</b><i>number</i>
           Set the Metalink <b>application/metalink4+xml </b>metaurl ordinal
           NUMBER. From 1 to the total number of
           "application/metalink4+xml" available.  Specify 0 or <b>inf </b>to
           choose the first good one.  Metaurls, such as those from a
           <b>--metalink-over-http</b>, may have been sorted by priority key's
           value; keep this in mind to choose the right NUMBER.

       <b>--preferred-location</b>
           Set preferred location for Metalink resources. This has
           effect if multiple resources with same priority are
           available.

       <b>--xattr</b>
           Enable use of file system's extended attributes to save the
           original URL and the Referer HTTP header value if used.

           Be aware that the URL might contain private information like
           access tokens or credentials.

       <b>-F</b>
       <b>--force-html</b>
           When input is read from a file, force it to be treated as an
           HTML file.  This enables you to retrieve relative links from
           existing HTML files on your local disk, by adding "&lt;base
           href="<i>url</i>.html"&gt;" to HTML, or using the <b>--base </b>command-line
           option.

       <b>-B </b><i>URL</i>
       <b>--base=</b><i>URL</i>
           Resolves relative links using <i>URL</i> as the point of reference,
           when reading links from an HTML file specified via the
           <b>-i</b>/<b>--input-file </b>option (together with <b>--force-html</b>, or when
           the input file was fetched remotely from a server describing
           it as HTML). This is equivalent to the presence of a "BASE"
           tag in the HTML input file, with <i>URL</i> as the value for the
           "href" attribute.

           For instance, if you specify <b>http://foo/bar/a.html </b>for <i>URL</i>,
           and Wget reads <b>../baz/b.html </b>from the input file, it would be
           resolved to <b><a href="http://foo/baz/b.html">http://foo/baz/b.html</a> </b>.

       <b>--config=</b><i>FILE</i>
           Specify the location of a startup file you wish to use
           instead of the default one(s). Use --no-config to disable
           reading of config files.  If both --config and --no-config
           are given, --no-config is ignored.

       <b>--rejected-log=</b><i>logfile</i>
           Logs all URL rejections to <i>logfile</i> as comma separated values.
           The values include the reason of rejection, the URL and the
           parent URL it was found in.

   <b>Download Options</b>
       <b>--bind-address=</b><i>ADDRESS</i>
           When making client TCP/IP connections, bind to <i>ADDRESS</i> on the
           local machine.  <i>ADDRESS</i> may be specified as a hostname or IP
           address.  This option can be useful if your machine is bound
           to multiple IPs.

       <b>--bind-dns-address=</b><i>ADDRESS</i>
           [libcares only] This address overrides the route for DNS
           requests. If you ever need to circumvent the standard
           settings from /etc/resolv.conf, this option together with
           <b>--dns-servers </b>is your friend.  <i>ADDRESS</i> must be specified
           either as IPv4 or IPv6 address.  Wget needs to be built with
           libcares for this option to be available.

       <b>--dns-servers=</b><i>ADDRESSES</i>
           [libcares only] The given address(es) override the standard
           nameserver addresses,  e.g. as configured in
           /etc/resolv.conf.  <i>ADDRESSES</i> may be specified either as IPv4
           or IPv6 addresses, comma-separated.  Wget needs to be built
           with libcares for this option to be available.

       <b>-t </b><i>number</i>
       <b>--tries=</b><i>number</i>
           Set number of tries to <i>number</i>. Specify 0 or <b>inf </b>for infinite
           retrying.  The default is to retry 20 times, with the
           exception of fatal errors like "connection refused" or "not
           found" (404), which are not retried.

       <b>-O </b><i>file</i>
       <b>--output-document=</b><i>file</i>
           The documents will not be written to the appropriate files,
           but all will be concatenated together and written to <i>file</i>.
           If <b>- </b>is used as <i>file</i>, documents will be printed to standard
           output, disabling link conversion.  (Use <b>./- </b>to print to a
           file literally named <b>-</b>.)

           Use of <b>-O </b>is <i>not</i> intended to mean simply "use the name <i>file</i>
           instead of the one in the URL;" rather, it is analogous to
           shell redirection: <b>wget -O file <a href="http://foo">http://foo</a> </b>is intended to
           work like <b>wget -O - <a href="http://foo">http://foo</a> &gt; file</b>; <i>file</i> will be truncated
           immediately, and <i>all</i> downloaded content will be written
           there.

           For this reason, <b>-N </b>(for timestamp-checking) is not supported
           in combination with <b>-O</b>: since <i>file</i> is always newly created,
           it will always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be
           issued if this combination is used.

           Similarly, using <b>-r </b>or <b>-p </b>with <b>-O </b>may not work as you expect:
           Wget won't just download the first file to <i>file</i> and then
           download the rest to their normal names: <i>all</i> downloaded
           content will be placed in <i>file</i>. This was disabled in version
           1.11, but has been reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as
           there are some cases where this behavior can actually have
           some use.

           A combination with <b>-nc </b>is only accepted if the given output
           file does not exist.

           Note that a combination with <b>-k </b>is only permitted when
           downloading a single document, as in that case it will just
           convert all relative URIs to external ones; <b>-k </b>makes no sense
           for multiple URIs when they're all being downloaded to a
           single file; <b>-k </b>can be used only when the output is a regular
           file.

       <b>-nc</b>
       <b>--no-clobber</b>
           If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory,
           Wget's behavior depends on a few options, including <b>-nc</b>.  In
           certain cases, the local file will be <i>clobbered</i>, or
           overwritten, upon repeated download.  In other cases it will
           be preserved.

           When running Wget without <b>-N</b>, <b>-nc</b>, <b>-r</b>, or <b>-p</b>, downloading the
           same file in the same directory will result in the original
           copy of <i>file</i> being preserved and the second copy being named
           <i>file</i><b>.1</b>.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy
           will be named <i>file</i><b>.2</b>, and so on.  (This is also the behavior
           with <b>-nd</b>, even if <b>-r </b>or <b>-p </b>are in effect.)  When <b>-nc </b>is
           specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will refuse
           to download newer copies of <i>file</i>.  Therefore, ""no-clobber""
           is actually a misnomer in this mode---it's not clobbering
           that's prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already
           preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version
           saving that's prevented.

           When running Wget with <b>-r </b>or <b>-p</b>, but without <b>-N</b>, <b>-nd</b>, or <b>-nc</b>,
           re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply
           overwriting the old.  Adding <b>-nc </b>will prevent this behavior,
           instead causing the original version to be preserved and any
           newer copies on the server to be ignored.

           When running Wget with <b>-N</b>, with or without <b>-r </b>or <b>-p</b>, the
           decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a
           file depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of
           the file.  <b>-nc </b>may not be specified at the same time as <b>-N</b>.

           A combination with <b>-O</b>/<b>--output-document </b>is only accepted if
           the given output file does not exist.

           Note that when <b>-nc </b>is specified, files with the suffixes
           <b>.html </b>or <b>.htm </b>will be loaded from the local disk and parsed
           as if they had been retrieved from the Web.

       <b>--backups=</b><i>backups</i>
           Before (over)writing a file, back up an existing file by
           adding a <b>.1 </b>suffix (<b>_1 </b>on VMS) to the file name.  Such backup
           files are rotated to <b>.2</b>, <b>.3</b>, and so on, up to <i>backups</i> (and
           lost beyond that).

       <b>--no-netrc</b>
           Do not try to obtain credentials from <i>.netrc</i> file. By default
           <i>.netrc</i> file is searched for credentials in case none have
           been passed on command line and authentication is required.

       <b>-c</b>
       <b>--continue</b>
           Continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful
           when you want to finish up a download started by a previous
           instance of Wget, or by another program.  For instance:

                   wget -c ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z

           If there is a file named <i>ls-lR.Z</i> in the current directory,
           Wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote
           file, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from
           an offset equal to the length of the local file.

           Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just
           want the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a
           file should the connection be lost midway through.  This is
           the default behavior.  <b>-c </b>only affects resumption of
           downloads started <i>prior</i> to this invocation of Wget, and whose
           local files are still sitting around.

           Without <b>-c</b>, the previous example would just download the
           remote file to <i>ls-lR.Z.1</i>, leaving the truncated <i>ls-lR.Z</i> file
           alone.

           If you use <b>-c </b>on a non-empty file, and the server does not
           support continued downloading, Wget will restart the download
           from scratch and overwrite the existing file entirely.

           Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <b>-c </b>on a file which is of
           equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to
           download the file and print an explanatory message.  The same
           happens when the file is smaller on the server than locally
           (presumably because it was changed on the server since your
           last download attempt)---because "continuing" is not
           meaningful, no download occurs.

           On the other side of the coin, while using <b>-c</b>, any file
           that's bigger on the server than locally will be considered
           an incomplete download and only "(length(remote) -
           length(local))" bytes will be downloaded and tacked onto the
           end of the local file.  This behavior can be desirable in
           certain cases---for instance, you can use <b>wget -c </b>to download
           just the new portion that's been appended to a data
           collection or log file.

           However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's
           been <i>changed</i>, as opposed to just <i>appended</i> to, you'll end up
           with a garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the
           local file is really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You
           need to be especially careful of this when using <b>-c </b>in
           conjunction with <b>-r</b>, since every file will be considered as
           an "incomplete download" candidate.

           Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try
           to use <b>-c </b>is if you have a lame HTTP proxy that inserts a
           "transfer interrupted" string into the local file.  In the
           future a "rollback" option may be added to deal with this
           case.

           Note that <b>-c </b>only works with FTP servers and with HTTP
           servers that support the "Range" header.

       <b>--start-pos=</b><i>OFFSET</i>
           Start downloading at zero-based position <i>OFFSET</i>.  Offset may
           be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the `k' suffix, or
           megabytes with the `m' suffix, etc.

           <b>--start-pos </b>has higher precedence over <b>--continue</b>.  When
           <b>--start-pos </b>and <b>--continue </b>are both specified, wget will emit
           a warning then proceed as if <b>--continue </b>was absent.

           Server support for continued download is required, otherwise
           <b>--start-pos </b>cannot help.  See <b>-c </b>for details.

       <b>--progress=</b><i>type</i>
           Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.
           Legal indicators are "dot" and "bar".

           The "bar" indicator is used by default.  It draws an ASCII
           progress bar graphics (a.k.a "thermometer" display)
           indicating the status of retrieval.  If the output is not a
           TTY, the "dot" bar will be used by default.

           Use <b>--progress=dot </b>to switch to the "dot" display.  It traces
           the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot
           representing a fixed amount of downloaded data.

           The progress <i>type</i> can also take one or more parameters.  The
           parameters vary based on the <i>type</i> selected.  Parameters to
           <i>type</i> are passed by appending them to the type sperated by a
           colon (:) like this: <b>--progress=</b><i>type</i><b>:</b><i>parameter1</i><b>:</b><i>parameter2</i>.

           When using the dotted retrieval, you may set the <i>style</i> by
           specifying the type as <b>dot:</b><i>style</i>.  Different styles assign
           different meaning to one dot.  With the "default" style each
           dot represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50
           dots in a line.  The "binary" style has a more
           "computer"-like orientation---8K dots, 16-dots clusters and
           48 dots per line (which makes for 384K lines).  The "mega"
           style is suitable for downloading large files---each dot
           represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster,
           and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M).  If
           "mega" is not enough then you can use the "giga" style---each
           dot represents 1M retrieved, there are eight dots in a
           cluster, and 32 dots on each line (so each line contains
           32M).

           With <b>--progress=bar</b>, there are currently two possible
           parameters, <i>force</i> and <i>noscroll</i>.

           When the output is not a TTY, the progress bar always falls
           back to "dot", even if <b>--progress=bar </b>was passed to Wget
           during invocation. This behaviour can be overridden and the
           "bar" output forced by using the "force" parameter as
           <b>--progress=bar:force</b>.

           By default, the <b>bar </b>style progress bar scroll the name of the
           file from left to right for the file being downloaded if the
           filename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display.
           In certain cases, such as with <b>--progress=bar:force</b>, one may
           not want the scrolling filename in the progress bar.  By
           passing the "noscroll" parameter, Wget can be forced to
           display as much of the filename as possible without scrolling
           through it.

           Note that you can set the default style using the "progress"
           command in <i>.wgetrc</i>.  That setting may be overridden from the
           command line.  For example, to force the bar output without
           scrolling, use <b>--progress=bar:force:noscroll</b>.

       <b>--show-progress</b>
           Force wget to display the progress bar in any verbosity.

           By default, wget only displays the progress bar in verbose
           mode.  One may however, want wget to display the progress bar
           on screen in conjunction with any other verbosity modes like
           <b>--no-verbose </b>or <b>--quiet</b>.  This is often a desired a property
           when invoking wget to download several small/large files.  In
           such a case, wget could simply be invoked with this parameter
           to get a much cleaner output on the screen.

           This option will also force the progress bar to be printed to
           <i>stderr</i> when used alongside the <b>--output-file </b>option.

       <b>-N</b>
       <b>--timestamping</b>
           Turn on time-stamping.

       <b>--no-if-modified-since</b>
           Do not send If-Modified-Since header in <b>-N </b>mode. Send
           preliminary HEAD request instead. This has only effect in <b>-N</b>
           mode.

       <b>--no-use-server-timestamps</b>
           Don't set the local file's timestamp by the one on the
           server.

           By default, when a file is downloaded, its timestamps are set
           to match those from the remote file. This allows the use of
           <b>--timestamping </b>on subsequent invocations of wget. However, it
           is sometimes useful to base the local file's timestamp on
           when it was actually downloaded; for that purpose, the
           <b>--no-use-server-timestamps </b>option has been provided.

       <b>-S</b>
       <b>--server-response</b>
           Print the headers sent by HTTP servers and responses sent by
           FTP servers.

       <b>--spider</b>
           When invoked with this option, Wget will behave as a Web
           <i>spider</i>, which means that it will not download the pages, just
           check that they are there.  For example, you can use Wget to
           check your bookmarks:

                   wget --spider --force-html -i bookmarks.html

           This feature needs much more work for Wget to get close to
           the functionality of real web spiders.

       <b>-T seconds</b>
       <b>--timeout=</b><i>seconds</i>
           Set the network timeout to <i>seconds</i> seconds.  This is
           equivalent to specifying <b>--dns-timeout</b>, <b>--connect-timeout</b>,
           and <b>--read-timeout</b>, all at the same time.

           When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout
           and abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents
           anomalies like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only
           timeout enabled by default is a 900-second read timeout.
           Setting a timeout to 0 disables it altogether.  Unless you
           know what you are doing, it is best not to change the default
           timeout settings.

           All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as
           subsecond values.  For example, <b>0.1 </b>seconds is a legal
           (though unwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are
           useful for checking server response times or for testing
           network latency.

       <b>--dns-timeout=</b><i>seconds</i>
           Set the DNS lookup timeout to <i>seconds</i> seconds.  DNS lookups
           that don't complete within the specified time will fail.  By
           default, there is no timeout on DNS lookups, other than that
           implemented by system libraries.

       <b>--connect-timeout=</b><i>seconds</i>
           Set the connect timeout to <i>seconds</i> seconds.  TCP connections
           that take longer to establish will be aborted.  By default,
           there is no connect timeout, other than that implemented by
           system libraries.

       <b>--read-timeout=</b><i>seconds</i>
           Set the read (and write) timeout to <i>seconds</i> seconds.  The
           "time" of this timeout refers to <i>idle time</i>: if, at any point
           in the download, no data is received for more than the
           specified number of seconds, reading fails and the download
           is restarted.  This option does not directly affect the
           duration of the entire download.

           Of course, the remote server may choose to terminate the
           connection sooner than this option requires.  The default
           read timeout is 900 seconds.

       <b>--limit-rate=</b><i>amount</i>
           Limit the download speed to <i>amount</i> bytes per second.  Amount
           may be expressed in bytes, kilobytes with the <b>k </b>suffix, or
           megabytes with the <b>m </b>suffix.  For example, <b>--limit-rate=20k</b>
           will limit the retrieval rate to 20KB/s.  This is useful
           when, for whatever reason, you don't want Wget to consume the
           entire available bandwidth.

           This option allows the use of decimal numbers, usually in
           conjunction with power suffixes; for example,
           <b>--limit-rate=2.5k </b>is a legal value.

           Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the
           appropriate amount of time after a network read that took
           less time than specified by the rate.  Eventually this
           strategy causes the TCP transfer to slow down to
           approximately the specified rate.  However, it may take some
           time for this balance to be achieved, so don't be surprised
           if limiting the rate doesn't work well with very small files.

       <b>-w </b><i>seconds</i>
       <b>--wait=</b><i>seconds</i>
           Wait the specified number of seconds between the retrievals.
           Use of this option is recommended, as it lightens the server
           load by making the requests less frequent.  Instead of in
           seconds, the time can be specified in minutes using the "m"
           suffix, in hours using "h" suffix, or in days using "d"
           suffix.

           Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the
           network or the destination host is down, so that Wget can
           wait long enough to reasonably expect the network error to be
           fixed before the retry.  The waiting interval specified by
           this function is influenced by "--random-wait", which see.

       <b>--waitretry=</b><i>seconds</i>
           If you don't want Wget to wait between <i>every</i> retrieval, but
           only between retries of failed downloads, you can use this
           option.  Wget will use <i>linear backoff</i>, waiting 1 second after
           the first failure on a given file, then waiting 2 seconds
           after the second failure on that file, up to the maximum
           number of <i>seconds</i> you specify.

           By default, Wget will assume a value of 10 seconds.

       <b>--random-wait</b>
           Some web sites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval
           programs such as Wget by looking for statistically
           significant similarities in the time between requests. This
           option causes the time between requests to vary between 0.5
           and 1.5 * <i>wait</i> seconds, where <i>wait</i> was specified using the
           <b>--wait </b>option, in order to mask Wget's presence from such
           analysis.

           A 2001 article in a publication devoted to development on a
           popular consumer platform provided code to perform this
           analysis on the fly.  Its author suggested blocking at the
           class C address level to ensure automated retrieval programs
           were blocked despite changing DHCP-supplied addresses.

           The <b>--random-wait </b>option was inspired by this ill-advised
           recommendation to block many unrelated users from a web site
           due to the actions of one.

       <b>--no-proxy</b>
           Don't use proxies, even if the appropriate *_proxy
           environment variable is defined.

       <b>-Q </b><i>quota</i>
       <b>--quota=</b><i>quota</i>
           Specify download quota for automatic retrievals.  The value
           can be specified in bytes (default), kilobytes (with <b>k</b>
           suffix), or megabytes (with <b>m </b>suffix).

           Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.
           So if you specify <b>wget -Q10k <a href="#">https://example.com/ls-lR.gz</a></b>,
           all of the <i>ls-lR.gz</i> will be downloaded.  The same goes even
           when several URLs are specified on the command-line.  The
           quota is checked only at the end of each downloaded file, so
           it will never result in a partially downloaded file. Thus you
           may safely type <b>wget -Q2m -i sites</b>---download will be aborted
           after the file that exhausts the quota is completely
           downloaded.

           Setting quota to 0 or to <b>inf </b>unlimits the download quota.

       <b>--no-dns-cache</b>
           Turn off caching of DNS lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers
           the IP addresses it looked up from DNS so it doesn't have to
           repeatedly contact the DNS server for the same (typically
           small) set of hosts it retrieves from.  This cache exists in
           memory only; a new Wget run will contact DNS again.

           However, it has been reported that in some situations it is
           not desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a
           short-running application like Wget.  With this option Wget
           issues a new DNS lookup (more precisely, a new call to
           "gethostbyname" or "getaddrinfo") each time it makes a new
           connection.  Please note that this option will <i>not</i> affect
           caching that might be performed by the resolving library or
           by an external caching layer, such as NSCD.

           If you don't understand exactly what this option does, you
           probably won't need it.

       <b>--restrict-file-names=</b><i>modes</i>
           Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped
           during generation of local filenames.  Characters that are
           <i>restricted</i> by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with
           <b>%HH</b>, where <b>HH </b>is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to
           the restricted character. This option may also be used to
           force all alphabetical cases to be either lower- or
           uppercase.

           By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or
           safe as part of file names on your operating system, as well
           as control characters that are typically unprintable.  This
           option is useful for changing these defaults, perhaps because
           you are downloading to a non-native partition, or because you
           want to disable escaping of the control characters, or you
           want to further restrict characters to only those in the
           ASCII range of values.

           The <i>modes</i> are a comma-separated set of text values. The
           acceptable values are <b>unix</b>, <b>windows</b>, <b>nocontrol</b>, <b>ascii</b>,
           <b>lowercase</b>, and <b>uppercase</b>. The values <b>unix </b>and <b>windows </b>are
           mutually exclusive (one will override the other), as are
           <b>lowercase </b>and <b>uppercase</b>. Those last are special cases, as
           they do not change the set of characters that would be
           escaped, but rather force local file paths to be converted
           either to lower- or uppercase.

           When "unix" is specified, Wget escapes the character <b>/ </b>and
           the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.
           This is the default on Unix-like operating systems.

           When "windows" is given, Wget escapes the characters <b>\</b>, <b>|</b>, <b>/</b>,
           <b>:</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>"</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, and the control characters in the ranges
           0--31 and 128--159.  In addition to this, Wget in Windows
           mode uses <b>+ </b>instead of <b>: </b>to separate host and port in local
           file names, and uses <b>@ </b>instead of <b>? </b>to separate the query
           portion of the file name from the rest.  Therefore, a URL
           that would be saved as
           <b>www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah </b>in Unix mode would
           be saved as <b>www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah </b>in
           Windows mode.  This mode is the default on Windows.

           If you specify <b>nocontrol</b>, then the escaping of the control
           characters is also switched off. This option may make sense
           when you are downloading URLs whose names contain UTF-8
           characters, on a system which can save and display filenames
           in UTF-8 (some possible byte values used in UTF-8 byte
           sequences fall in the range of values designated by Wget as
           "controls").

           The <b>ascii </b>mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values
           are outside the range of ASCII characters (that is, greater
           than 127) shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving
           filenames whose encoding does not match the one used locally.

       <b>-4</b>
       <b>--inet4-only</b>
       <b>-6</b>
       <b>--inet6-only</b>
           Force connecting to IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  With
           <b>--inet4-only </b>or <b>-4</b>, Wget will only connect to IPv4 hosts,
           ignoring AAAA records in DNS, and refusing to connect to IPv6
           addresses specified in URLs.  Conversely, with <b>--inet6-only</b>
           or <b>-6</b>, Wget will only connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A
           records and IPv4 addresses.

           Neither options should be needed normally.  By default, an
           IPv6-aware Wget will use the address family specified by the
           host's DNS record.  If the DNS responds with both IPv4 and
           IPv6 addresses, Wget will try them in sequence until it finds
           one it can connect to.  (Also see "--prefer-family" option
           described below.)

           These options can be used to deliberately force the use of
           IPv4 or IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually
           to aid debugging or to deal with broken network
           configuration.  Only one of <b>--inet6-only </b>and <b>--inet4-only </b>may
           be specified at the same time.  Neither option is available
           in Wget compiled without IPv6 support.

       <b>--prefer-family=none/IPv4/IPv6</b>
           When given a choice of several addresses, connect to the
           addresses with specified address family first.  The address
           order returned by DNS is used without change by default.

           This avoids spurious errors and connect attempts when
           accessing hosts that resolve to both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses
           from IPv4 networks.  For example, <b>www.kame.net </b>resolves to
           <b>2001:200:0:8002:203:47ff:fea5:3085 </b>and to <b>203.178.141.194</b>.
           When the preferred family is "IPv4", the IPv4 address is used
           first; when the preferred family is "IPv6", the IPv6 address
           is used first; if the specified value is "none", the address
           order returned by DNS is used without change.

           Unlike <b>-4 </b>and <b>-6</b>, this option doesn't inhibit access to any
           address family, it only changes the <i>order</i> in which the
           addresses are accessed.  Also note that the reordering
           performed by this option is <i>stable</i>---it doesn't affect order
           of addresses of the same family.  That is, the relative order
           of all IPv4 addresses and of all IPv6 addresses remains
           intact in all cases.

       <b>--retry-connrefused</b>
           Consider "connection refused" a transient error and try
           again.  Normally Wget gives up on a URL when it is unable to
           connect to the site because failure to connect is taken as a
           sign that the server is not running at all and that retries
           would not help.  This option is for mirroring unreliable
           sites whose servers tend to disappear for short periods of
           time.

       <b>--user=</b><i>user</i>
       <b>--password=</b><i>password</i>
           Specify the username <i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> for both FTP
           and HTTP file retrieval.  These parameters can be overridden
           using the <b>--ftp-user </b>and <b>--ftp-password </b>options for FTP
           connections and the <b>--http-user </b>and <b>--http-password </b>options
           for HTTP connections.

       <b>--ask-password</b>
           Prompt for a password for each connection established. Cannot
           be specified when <b>--password </b>is being used, because they are
           mutually exclusive.

       <b>--use-askpass=</b><i>command</i>
           Prompt for a user and password using the specified command.
           If no command is specified then the command in the
           environment variable WGET_ASKPASS is used.  If WGET_ASKPASS
           is not set then the command in the environment variable
           SSH_ASKPASS is used.

           You can set the default command for use-askpass in the
           <i>.wgetrc</i>.  That setting may be overridden from the command
           line.

       <b>--no-iri</b>
           Turn off internationalized URI (IRI) support. Use <b>--iri </b>to
           turn it on. IRI support is activated by default.

           You can set the default state of IRI support using the "iri"
           command in <i>.wgetrc</i>. That setting may be overridden from the
           command line.

       <b>--local-encoding=</b><i>encoding</i>
           Force Wget to use <i>encoding</i> as the default system encoding.
           That affects how Wget converts URLs specified as arguments
           from locale to UTF-8 for IRI support.

           Wget use the function nl_langinfo() and then the "CHARSET"
           environment variable to get the locale. If it fails, ASCII is
           used.

           You can set the default local encoding using the
           "local_encoding" command in <i>.wgetrc</i>. That setting may be
           overridden from the command line.

       <b>--remote-encoding=</b><i>encoding</i>
           Force Wget to use <i>encoding</i> as the default remote server
           encoding.  That affects how Wget converts URIs found in files
           from remote encoding to UTF-8 during a recursive fetch. This
           options is only useful for IRI support, for the
           interpretation of non-ASCII characters.

           For HTTP, remote encoding can be found in HTTP "Content-Type"
           header and in HTML "Content-Type http-equiv" meta tag.

           You can set the default encoding using the "remoteencoding"
           command in <i>.wgetrc</i>. That setting may be overridden from the
           command line.

       <b>--unlink</b>
           Force Wget to unlink file instead of clobbering existing
           file. This option is useful for downloading to the directory
           with hardlinks.

   <b>Directory Options</b>
       <b>-nd</b>
       <b>--no-directories</b>
           Do not create a hierarchy of directories when retrieving
           recursively.  With this option turned on, all files will get
           saved to the current directory, without clobbering (if a name
           shows up more than once, the filenames will get extensions
           <b>.n</b>).

       <b>-x</b>
       <b>--force-directories</b>
           The opposite of <b>-nd</b>---create a hierarchy of directories, even
           if one would not have been created otherwise.  E.g. <b>wget -x</b>
           <b>http://fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt </b>will save the downloaded
           file to <i>fly.srk.fer.hr/robots.txt</i>.

       <b>-nH</b>
       <b>--no-host-directories</b>
           Disable generation of host-prefixed directories.  By default,
           invoking Wget with <b>-r <a href="http://fly.srk.fer.hr/">http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</a> </b>will create a
           structure of directories beginning with <i>fly.srk.fer.hr/</i>.
           This option disables such behavior.

       <b>--protocol-directories</b>
           Use the protocol name as a directory component of local file
           names.  For example, with this option, <b>wget -r <a href="#">http://</a></b><i>host</i>
           will save to <b>http/</b><i>host</i><b>/... </b>rather than just to <i>host</i><b>/...</b>.

       <b>--cut-dirs=</b><i>number</i>
           Ignore <i>number</i> directory components.  This is useful for
           getting a fine-grained control over the directory where
           recursive retrieval will be saved.

           Take, for example, the directory at
           <b>ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</b>.  If you retrieve it with
           <b>-r</b>, it will be saved locally under
           <i>ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/</i>.  While the <b>-nH </b>option can remove
           the <i>ftp.xemacs.org/</i> part, you are still stuck with
           <i>pub/xemacs</i>.  This is where <b>--cut-dirs </b>comes in handy; it
           makes Wget not "see" <i>number</i> remote directory components.
           Here are several examples of how <b>--cut-dirs </b>option works.

                   No options        -&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/
                   -nH               -&gt; pub/xemacs/
                   -nH --cut-dirs=1  -&gt; xemacs/
                   -nH --cut-dirs=2  -&gt; .

                   --cut-dirs=1      -&gt; ftp.xemacs.org/xemacs/
                   ...

           If you just want to get rid of the directory structure, this
           option is similar to a combination of <b>-nd </b>and <b>-P</b>.  However,
           unlike <b>-nd</b>, <b>--cut-dirs </b>does not lose with
           subdirectories---for instance, with <b>-nH --cut-dirs=1</b>, a <i>beta/</i>
           subdirectory will be placed to <i>xemacs/beta</i>, as one would
           expect.

       <b>-P </b><i>prefix</i>
       <b>--directory-prefix=</b><i>prefix</i>
           Set directory prefix to <i>prefix</i>.  The <i>directory prefix</i> is the
           directory where all other files and subdirectories will be
           saved to, i.e. the top of the retrieval tree.  The default is
           <b>. </b>(the current directory).

   <b>HTTP Options</b>
       <b>--default-page=</b><i>name</i>
           Use <i>name</i> as the default file name when it isn't known (i.e.,
           for URLs that end in a slash), instead of <i>index.html</i>.

       <b>-E</b>
       <b>--adjust-extension</b>
           If a file of type <b>application/xhtml+xml </b>or <b>text/html </b>is
           downloaded and the URL does not end with the regexp
           <b>\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?</b>, this option will cause the suffix <b>.html</b>
           to be appended to the local filename.  This is useful, for
           instance, when you're mirroring a remote site that uses <b>.asp</b>
           pages, but you want the mirrored pages to be viewable on your
           stock Apache server.  Another good use for this is when
           you're downloading CGI-generated materials.  A URL like
           <b>http://site.com/article.cgi?25 </b>will be saved as
           <i>article.cgi?25.html</i>.

           Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded
           every time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that
           the local <i>X.html</i> file corresponds to remote URL <i>X</i> (since it
           doesn't yet know that the URL produces output of type
           <b>text/html </b>or <b>application/xhtml+xml</b>.

           As of version 1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded
           files of type <b>text/css </b>end in the suffix <b>.css</b>, and the option
           was renamed from <b>--html-extension</b>, to better reflect its new
           behavior. The old option name is still acceptable, but should
           now be considered deprecated.

           As of version 1.19.2, Wget will also ensure that any
           downloaded files with a "Content-Encoding" of <b>br</b>, <b>compress</b>,
           <b>deflate </b>or <b>gzip </b>end in the suffix <b>.br</b>, <b>.Z</b>, <b>.zlib </b>and <b>.gz</b>
           respectively.

           At some point in the future, this option may well be expanded
           to include suffixes for other types of content, including
           content types that are not parsed by Wget.

       <b>--http-user=</b><i>user</i>
       <b>--http-password=</b><i>password</i>
           Specify the username <i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> on an HTTP
           server.  According to the type of the challenge, Wget will
           encode them using either the "basic" (insecure), the
           "digest", or the Windows "NTLM" authentication scheme.

           Another way to specify username and password is in the URL
           itself.  Either method reveals your password to anyone who
           bothers to run "ps".  To prevent the passwords from being
           seen, use the <b>--use-askpass </b>or store them in <i>.wgetrc</i> or
           <i>.netrc</i>, and make sure to protect those files from other users
           with "chmod".  If the passwords are really important, do not
           leave them lying in those files either---edit the files and
           delete them after Wget has started the download.

       <b>--no-http-keep-alive</b>
           Turn off the "keep-alive" feature for HTTP downloads.
           Normally, Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so
           that, when you download more than one document from the same
           server, they get transferred over the same TCP connection.
           This saves time and at the same time reduces the load on the
           server.

           This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent
           (keep-alive) connections don't work for you, for example due
           to a server bug or due to the inability of server-side
           scripts to cope with the connections.

       <b>--no-cache</b>
           Disable server-side cache.  In this case, Wget will send the
           remote server appropriate directives (<b>Cache-Control: no-cache</b>
           and <b>Pragma: no-cache</b>) to get the file from the remote
           service, rather than returning the cached version. This is
           especially useful for retrieving and flushing out-of-date
           documents on proxy servers.

           Caching is allowed by default.

       <b>--no-cookies</b>
           Disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for
           maintaining server-side state.  The server sends the client a
           cookie using the "Set-Cookie" header, and the client responds
           with the same cookie upon further requests.  Since cookies
           allow the server owners to keep track of visitors and for
           sites to exchange this information, some consider them a
           breach of privacy.  The default is to use cookies; however,
           <i>storing</i> cookies is not on by default.

       <b>--load-cookies </b><i>file</i>
           Load cookies from <i>file</i> before the first HTTP retrieval.  <i>file</i>
           is a textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's
           <i>cookies.txt</i> file.

           You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that
           require that you be logged in to access some or all of their
           content.  The login process typically works by the web server
           issuing an HTTP cookie upon receiving and verifying your
           credentials.  The cookie is then resent by the browser when
           accessing that part of the site, and so proves your identity.

           Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies
           your browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is
           achieved by <b>--load-cookies</b>---simply point Wget to the
           location of the <i>cookies.txt</i> file, and it will send the same
           cookies your browser would send in the same situation.
           Different browsers keep textual cookie files in different
           locations:

           "Netscape 4.x."
               The cookies are in <i>~/.netscape/cookies.txt</i>.

           "Mozilla and Netscape 6.x."
               Mozilla's cookie file is also named <i>cookies.txt</i>, located
               somewhere under <i>~/.mozilla</i>, in the directory of your
               profile.  The full path usually ends up looking somewhat
               like <i>~/.mozilla/default/some-weird-string/cookies.txt</i>.

           "Internet Explorer."
               You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the
               File menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has
               been tested with Internet Explorer 5; it is not
               guaranteed to work with earlier versions.

           "Other browsers."
               If you are using a different browser to create your
               cookies, <b>--load-cookies </b>will only work if you can locate
               or produce a cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget
               expects.

           If you cannot use <b>--load-cookies</b>, there might still be an
           alternative.  If your browser supports a "cookie manager",
           you can use it to view the cookies used when accessing the
           site you're mirroring.  Write down the name and value of the
           cookie, and manually instruct Wget to send those cookies,
           bypassing the "official" cookie support:

                   wget --no-cookies --header "Cookie: &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;"

       <b>--save-cookies </b><i>file</i>
           Save cookies to <i>file</i> before exiting.  This will not save
           cookies that have expired or that have no expiry time (so-
           called "session cookies"), but also see
           <b>--keep-session-cookies</b>.

       <b>--keep-session-cookies</b>
           When specified, causes <b>--save-cookies </b>to also save session
           cookies.  Session cookies are normally not saved because they
           are meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit
           the browser.  Saving them is useful on sites that require you
           to log in or to visit the home page before you can access
           some pages.  With this option, multiple Wget runs are
           considered a single browser session as far as the site is
           concerned.

           Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session
           cookies, Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.
           Wget's <b>--load-cookies </b>recognizes those as session cookies,
           but it might confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies
           so loaded will be treated as other session cookies, which
           means that if you want <b>--save-cookies </b>to preserve them again,
           you must use <b>--keep-session-cookies </b>again.

       <b>--ignore-length</b>
           Unfortunately, some HTTP servers (CGI programs, to be more
           precise) send out bogus "Content-Length" headers, which makes
           Wget go wild, as it thinks not all the document was
           retrieved.  You can spot this syndrome if Wget retries
           getting the same document again and again, each time claiming
           that the (otherwise normal) connection has closed on the very
           same byte.

           With this option, Wget will ignore the "Content-Length"
           header---as if it never existed.

       <b>--header=</b><i>header-line</i>
           Send <i>header-line</i> along with the rest of the headers in each
           HTTP request.  The supplied header is sent as-is, which means
           it must contain name and value separated by colon, and must
           not contain newlines.

           You may define more than one additional header by specifying
           <b>--header </b>more than once.

                   wget --header='Accept-Charset: iso-8859-2' \
                        --header='Accept-Language: hr'        \
                          <a href="http://fly.srk.fer.hr/">http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</a>

           Specification of an empty string as the header value will
           clear all previous user-defined headers.

           As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers
           otherwise generated automatically.  This example instructs
           Wget to connect to localhost, but to specify <b>foo.bar </b>in the
           "Host" header:

                   wget --header="Host: foo.bar" <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>

           In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of <b>--header </b>caused
           sending of duplicate headers.

       <b>--compression=</b><i>type</i>
           Choose the type of compression to be used.  Legal values are
           <b>auto</b>, <b>gzip </b>and <b>none</b>.

           If <b>auto </b>or <b>gzip </b>are specified, Wget asks the server to
           compress the file using the gzip compression format. If the
           server compresses the file and responds with the
           "Content-Encoding" header field set appropriately, the file
           will be decompressed automatically.

           If <b>none </b>is specified, wget will not ask the server to
           compress the file and will not decompress any server
           responses. This is the default.

           Compression support is currently experimental. In case it is
           turned on, please report any bugs to "bug-wget@gnu.org".

       <b>--max-redirect=</b><i>number</i>
           Specifies the maximum number of redirections to follow for a
           resource.  The default is 20, which is usually far more than
           necessary. However, on those occasions where you want to
           allow more (or fewer), this is the option to use.

       <b>--proxy-user=</b><i>user</i>
       <b>--proxy-password=</b><i>password</i>
           Specify the username <i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> for
           authentication on a proxy server.  Wget will encode them
           using the "basic" authentication scheme.

           Security considerations similar to those with <b>--http-password</b>
           pertain here as well.

       <b>--referer=</b><i>url</i>
           Include `Referer: <i>url</i>' header in HTTP request.  Useful for
           retrieving documents with server-side processing that assume
           they are always being retrieved by interactive web browsers
           and only come out properly when Referer is set to one of the
           pages that point to them.

       <b>--save-headers</b>
           Save the headers sent by the HTTP server to the file,
           preceding the actual contents, with an empty line as the
           separator.

       <b>-U </b><i>agent-string</i>
       <b>--user-agent=</b><i>agent-string</i>
           Identify as <i>agent-string</i> to the HTTP server.

           The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves
           using a "User-Agent" header field.  This enables
           distinguishing the WWW software, usually for statistical
           purposes or for tracing of protocol violations.  Wget
           normally identifies as <b>Wget/</b><i>version</i>, <i>version</i> being the
           current version number of Wget.

           However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of
           tailoring the output according to the "User-Agent"-supplied
           information.  While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it
           has been abused by servers denying information to clients
           other than (historically) Netscape or, more frequently,
           Microsoft Internet Explorer.  This option allows you to
           change the "User-Agent" line issued by Wget.  Use of this
           option is discouraged, unless you really know what you are
           doing.

           Specifying empty user agent with <b>--user-agent="" </b>instructs
           Wget not to send the "User-Agent" header in HTTP requests.

       <b>--post-data=</b><i>string</i>
       <b>--post-file=</b><i>file</i>
           Use POST as the method for all HTTP requests and send the
           specified data in the request body.  <b>--post-data </b>sends <i>string</i>
           as data, whereas <b>--post-file </b>sends the contents of <i>file</i>.
           Other than that, they work in exactly the same way. In
           particular, they <i>both</i> expect content of the form
           "key1=value1&amp;key2=value2", with percent-encoding for special
           characters; the only difference is that one expects its
           content as a command-line parameter and the other accepts its
           content from a file. In particular, <b>--post-file </b>is <i>not</i> for
           transmitting files as form attachments: those must appear as
           "key=value" data (with appropriate percent-coding) just like
           everything else. Wget does not currently support
           "multipart/form-data" for transmitting POST data; only
           "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". Only one of <b>--post-data</b>
           and <b>--post-file </b>should be specified.

           Please note that wget does not require the content to be of
           the form "key1=value1&amp;key2=value2", and neither does it test
           for it. Wget will simply transmit whatever data is provided
           to it. Most servers however expect the POST data to be in the
           above format when processing HTML Forms.

           When sending a POST request using the <b>--post-file </b>option,
           Wget treats the file as a binary file and will send every
           character in the POST request without stripping trailing
           newline or formfeed characters. Any other control characters
           in the text will also be sent as-is in the POST request.

           Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the POST
           data in advance.  Therefore the argument to "--post-file"
           must be a regular file; specifying a FIFO or something like
           <i>/dev/stdin</i> won't work.  It's not quite clear how to work
           around this limitation inherent in HTTP/1.0.  Although
           HTTP/1.1 introduces <i>chunked</i> transfer that doesn't require
           knowing the request length in advance, a client can't use
           chunked unless it knows it's talking to an HTTP/1.1 server.
           And it can't know that until it receives a response, which in
           turn requires the request to have been completed -- a
           chicken-and-egg problem.

           Note: As of version 1.15 if Wget is redirected after the POST
           request is completed, its behaviour will depend on the
           response code returned by the server.  In case of a 301 Moved
           Permanently, 302 Moved Temporarily or 307 Temporary Redirect,
           Wget will, in accordance with RFC2616, continue to send a
           POST request.  In case a server wants the client to change
           the Request method upon redirection, it should send a 303 See
           Other response code.

           This example shows how to log in to a server using POST and
           then proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only
           accessible to authorized users:

                   # Log in to the server.  This can be done only once.
                   wget --save-cookies cookies.txt \
                        --post-data 'user=foo&amp;password=bar' \
                        <a href="http://example.com/auth.php">http://example.com/auth.php</a>

                   # Now grab the page or pages we care about.
                   wget --load-cookies cookies.txt \
                        -p <a href="http://example.com/interesting/article.php">http://example.com/interesting/article.php</a>

           If the server is using session cookies to track user
           authentication, the above will not work because
           <b>--save-cookies </b>will not save them (and neither will browsers)
           and the <i>cookies.txt</i> file will be empty.  In that case use
           <b>--keep-session-cookies </b>along with <b>--save-cookies </b>to force
           saving of session cookies.

       <b>--method=</b><i>HTTP-Method</i>
           For the purpose of RESTful scripting, Wget allows sending of
           other HTTP Methods without the need to explicitly set them
           using <b>--header=Header-Line</b>.  Wget will use whatever string is
           passed to it after <b>--method </b>as the HTTP Method to the server.

       <b>--body-data=</b><i>Data-String</i>
       <b>--body-file=</b><i>Data-File</i>
           Must be set when additional data needs to be sent to the
           server along with the Method specified using <b>--method</b>.
           <b>--body-data </b>sends <i>string</i> as data, whereas <b>--body-file </b>sends
           the contents of <i>file</i>.  Other than that, they work in exactly
           the same way.

           Currently, <b>--body-file </b>is <i>not</i> for transmitting files as a
           whole.  Wget does not currently support "multipart/form-data"
           for transmitting data; only
           "application/x-www-form-urlencoded". In the future, this may
           be changed so that wget sends the <b>--body-file </b>as a complete
           file instead of sending its contents to the server. Please be
           aware that Wget needs to know the contents of BODY Data in
           advance, and hence the argument to <b>--body-file </b>should be a
           regular file. See <b>--post-file </b>for a more detailed
           explanation.  Only one of <b>--body-data </b>and <b>--body-file </b>should
           be specified.

           If Wget is redirected after the request is completed, Wget
           will suspend the current method and send a GET request till
           the redirection is completed.  This is true for all
           redirection response codes except 307 Temporary Redirect
           which is used to explicitly specify that the request method
           should <i>not</i> change.  Another exception is when the method is
           set to "POST", in which case the redirection rules specified
           under <b>--post-data </b>are followed.

       <b>--content-disposition</b>
           If this is set to on, experimental (not fully-functional)
           support for "Content-Disposition" headers is enabled. This
           can currently result in extra round-trips to the server for a
           "HEAD" request, and is known to suffer from a few bugs, which
           is why it is not currently enabled by default.

           This option is useful for some file-downloading CGI programs
           that use "Content-Disposition" headers to describe what the
           name of a downloaded file should be.

           When combined with <b>--metalink-over-http </b>and
           <b>--trust-server-names</b>, a <b>Content-Type:</b>
           <b>application/metalink4+xml </b>file is named using the
           "Content-Disposition" filename field, if available.

       <b>--content-on-error</b>
           If this is set to on, wget will not skip the content when the
           server responds with a http status code that indicates error.

       <b>--trust-server-names</b>
           If this is set, on a redirect, the local file name will be
           based on the redirection URL.  By default the local file name
           is based on the original URL.  When doing recursive
           retrieving this can be helpful because in many web sites
           redirected URLs correspond to an underlying file structure,
           while link URLs do not.

       <b>--auth-no-challenge</b>
           If this option is given, Wget will send Basic HTTP
           authentication information (plaintext username and password)
           for all requests, just like Wget 1.10.2 and prior did by
           default.

           Use of this option is not recommended, and is intended only
           to support some few obscure servers, which never send HTTP
           authentication challenges, but accept unsolicited auth info,
           say, in addition to form-based authentication.

       <b>--retry-on-host-error</b>
           Consider host errors, such as "Temporary failure in name
           resolution", as non-fatal, transient errors.

       <b>--retry-on-http-error=</b><i>code[,code,...]</i>
           Consider given HTTP response codes as non-fatal, transient
           errors.  Supply a comma-separated list of 3-digit HTTP
           response codes as argument. Useful to work around special
           circumstances where retries are required, but the server
           responds with an error code normally not retried by Wget.
           Such errors might be 503 (Service Unavailable) and 429 (Too
           Many Requests). Retries enabled by this option are performed
           subject to the normal retry timing and retry count
           limitations of Wget.

           Using this option is intended to support special use cases
           only and is generally not recommended, as it can force
           retries even in cases where the server is actually trying to
           decrease its load. Please use wisely and only if you know
           what you are doing.

   <b>HTTPS (SSL/TLS) Options</b>
       To support encrypted HTTP (HTTPS) downloads, Wget must be
       compiled with an external SSL library. The current default is
       GnuTLS.  In addition, Wget also supports HSTS (HTTP Strict
       Transport Security).  If Wget is compiled without SSL support,
       none of these options are available.

       <b>--secure-protocol=</b><i>protocol</i>
           Choose the secure protocol to be used.  Legal values are
           <b>auto</b>, <b>SSLv2</b>, <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1_1</b>, <b>TLSv1_2</b>, <b>TLSv1_3 </b>and <b>PFS</b>.
           If <b>auto </b>is used, the SSL library is given the liberty of
           choosing the appropriate protocol automatically, which is
           achieved by sending a TLSv1 greeting. This is the default.

           Specifying <b>SSLv2</b>, <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1_1</b>, <b>TLSv1_2 </b>or <b>TLSv1_3</b>
           forces the use of the corresponding protocol.  This is useful
           when talking to old and buggy SSL server implementations that
           make it hard for the underlying SSL library to choose the
           correct protocol version.  Fortunately, such servers are
           quite rare.

           Specifying <b>PFS </b>enforces the use of the so-called Perfect
           Forward Security cipher suites. In short, PFS adds security
           by creating a one-time key for each SSL connection. It has a
           bit more CPU impact on client and server.  We use known to be
           secure ciphers (e.g. no MD4) and the TLS protocol. This mode
           also explicitly excludes non-PFS key exchange methods, such
           as RSA.

       <b>--https-only</b>
           When in recursive mode, only HTTPS links are followed.

       <b>--ciphers</b>
           Set the cipher list string. Typically this string sets the
           cipher suites and other SSL/TLS options that the user wish
           should be used, in a set order of preference (GnuTLS calls it
           'priority string'). This string will be fed verbatim to the
           SSL/TLS engine (OpenSSL or GnuTLS) and hence its format and
           syntax is dependent on that. Wget will not process or
           manipulate it in any way. Refer to the OpenSSL or GnuTLS
           documentation for more information.

       <b>--no-check-certificate</b>
           Don't check the server certificate against the available
           certificate authorities.  Also don't require the URL host
           name to match the common name presented by the certificate.

           As of Wget 1.10, the default is to verify the server's
           certificate against the recognized certificate authorities,
           breaking the SSL handshake and aborting the download if the
           verification fails.  Although this provides more secure
           downloads, it does break interoperability with some sites
           that worked with previous Wget versions, particularly those
           using self-signed, expired, or otherwise invalid
           certificates.  This option forces an "insecure" mode of
           operation that turns the certificate verification errors into
           warnings and allows you to proceed.

           If you encounter "certificate verification" errors or ones
           saying that "common name doesn't match requested host name",
           you can use this option to bypass the verification and
           proceed with the download.  <i>Only use this option if you are</i>
           <i>otherwise convinced of the site's authenticity, or if you</i>
           <i>really don't care about the validity of its certificate.</i>  It
           is almost always a bad idea not to check the certificates
           when transmitting confidential or important data.  For
           self-signed/internal certificates, you should download the
           certificate and verify against that instead of forcing this
           insecure mode.  If you are really sure of not desiring any
           certificate verification, you can specify
           --check-certificate=quiet to tell wget to not print any
           warning about invalid certificates, albeit in most cases this
           is the wrong thing to do.

       <b>--certificate=</b><i>file</i>
           Use the client certificate stored in <i>file</i>.  This is needed
           for servers that are configured to require certificates from
           the clients that connect to them.  Normally a certificate is
           not required and this switch is optional.

       <b>--certificate-type=</b><i>type</i>
           Specify the type of the client certificate.  Legal values are
           <b>PEM </b>(assumed by default) and <b>DER</b>, also known as <b>ASN1</b>.

       <b>--private-key=</b><i>file</i>
           Read the private key from <i>file</i>.  This allows you to provide
           the private key in a file separate from the certificate.

       <b>--private-key-type=</b><i>type</i>
           Specify the type of the private key.  Accepted values are <b>PEM</b>
           (the default) and <b>DER</b>.

       <b>--ca-certificate=</b><i>file</i>
           Use <i>file</i> as the file with the bundle of certificate
           authorities ("CA") to verify the peers.  The certificates
           must be in PEM format.

           Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the
           system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation
           time.

       <b>--ca-directory=</b><i>directory</i>
           Specifies directory containing CA certificates in PEM format.
           Each file contains one CA certificate, and the file name is
           based on a hash value derived from the certificate.  This is
           achieved by processing a certificate directory with the
           "c_rehash" utility supplied with OpenSSL.  Using
           <b>--ca-directory </b>is more efficient than <b>--ca-certificate </b>when
           many certificates are installed because it allows Wget to
           fetch certificates on demand.

           Without this option Wget looks for CA certificates at the
           system-specified locations, chosen at OpenSSL installation
           time.

       <b>--crl-file=</b><i>file</i>
           Specifies a CRL file in <i>file</i>.  This is needed for
           certificates that have been revocated by the CAs.

       <b>--pinnedpubkey=file/hashes</b>
           Tells wget to use the specified public key file (or hashes)
           to verify the peer.  This can be a path to a file which
           contains a single public key in PEM or DER format, or any
           number of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by "sha256//"
           and separated by ";"

           When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a
           certificate indicating its identity. A public key is
           extracted from this certificate and if it does not exactly
           match the public key(s) provided to this option, wget will
           abort the connection before sending or receiving any data.

       <b>--random-file=</b><i>file</i>
           [OpenSSL and LibreSSL only] Use <i>file</i> as the source of random
           data for seeding the pseudo-random number generator on
           systems without <i>/dev/urandom</i>.

           On such systems the SSL library needs an external source of
           randomness to initialize.  Randomness may be provided by EGD
           (see <b>--egd-file </b>below) or read from an external source
           specified by the user.  If this option is not specified, Wget
           looks for random data in $RANDFILE or, if that is unset, in
           <i>$HOME/.rnd</i>.

           If you're getting the "Could not seed OpenSSL PRNG; disabling
           SSL."  error, you should provide random data using some of
           the methods described above.

       <b>--egd-file=</b><i>file</i>
           [OpenSSL only] Use <i>file</i> as the EGD socket.  EGD stands for
           <i>Entropy Gathering Daemon</i>, a user-space program that collects
           data from various unpredictable system sources and makes it
           available to other programs that might need it.  Encryption
           software, such as the SSL library, needs sources of non-
           repeating randomness to seed the random number generator used
           to produce cryptographically strong keys.

           OpenSSL allows the user to specify his own source of entropy
           using the "RAND_FILE" environment variable.  If this variable
           is unset, or if the specified file does not produce enough
           randomness, OpenSSL will read random data from EGD socket
           specified using this option.

           If this option is not specified (and the equivalent startup
           command is not used), EGD is never contacted.  EGD is not
           needed on modern Unix systems that support <i>/dev/urandom</i>.

       <b>--no-hsts</b>
           Wget supports HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security, RFC 6797)
           by default.  Use <b>--no-hsts </b>to make Wget act as a non-HSTS-
           compliant UA. As a consequence, Wget would ignore all the
           "Strict-Transport-Security" headers, and would not enforce
           any existing HSTS policy.

       <b>--hsts-file=</b><i>file</i>
           By default, Wget stores its HSTS database in <i>~/.wget-hsts</i>.
           You can use <b>--hsts-file </b>to override this. Wget will use the
           supplied file as the HSTS database. Such file must conform to
           the correct HSTS database format used by Wget. If Wget cannot
           parse the provided file, the behaviour is unspecified.

           The Wget's HSTS database is a plain text file. Each line
           contains an HSTS entry (ie. a site that has issued a
           "Strict-Transport-Security" header and that therefore has
           specified a concrete HSTS policy to be applied). Lines
           starting with a dash ("#") are ignored by Wget. Please note
           that in spite of this convenient human-readability hand-
           hacking the HSTS database is generally not a good idea.

           An HSTS entry line consists of several fields separated by
           one or more whitespace:

           "&lt;hostname&gt; SP [&lt;port&gt;] SP &lt;include subdomains&gt; SP &lt;created&gt;
           SP &lt;max-age&gt;"

           The <i>hostname</i> and <i>port</i> fields indicate the hostname and port
           to which the given HSTS policy applies. The <i>port</i> field may be
           zero, and it will, in most of the cases. That means that the
           port number will not be taken into account when deciding
           whether such HSTS policy should be applied on a given request
           (only the hostname will be evaluated). When <i>port</i> is different
           to zero, both the target hostname and the port will be
           evaluated and the HSTS policy will only be applied if both of
           them match. This feature has been included for
           testing/development purposes only.  The Wget testsuite (in
           <i>testenv/</i>) creates HSTS databases with explicit ports with the
           purpose of ensuring Wget's correct behaviour. Applying HSTS
           policies to ports other than the default ones is discouraged
           by RFC 6797 (see Appendix B "Differences between HSTS Policy
           and Same-Origin Policy"). Thus, this functionality should not
           be used in production environments and <i>port</i> will typically be
           zero. The last three fields do what they are expected to. The
           field <i>include_subdomains</i> can either be 1 or 0 and it signals
           whether the subdomains of the target domain should be part of
           the given HSTS policy as well. The <i>created</i> and <i>max-age</i> fields
           hold the timestamp values of when such entry was created
           (first seen by Wget) and the HSTS-defined value 'max-age',
           which states how long should that HSTS policy remain active,
           measured in seconds elapsed since the timestamp stored in
           <i>created</i>. Once that time has passed, that HSTS policy will no
           longer be valid and will eventually be removed from the
           database.

           If you supply your own HSTS database via <b>--hsts-file</b>, be
           aware that Wget may modify the provided file if any change
           occurs between the HSTS policies requested by the remote
           servers and those in the file. When Wget exits, it
           effectively updates the HSTS database by rewriting the
           database file with the new entries.

           If the supplied file does not exist, Wget will create one.
           This file will contain the new HSTS entries. If no HSTS
           entries were generated (no "Strict-Transport-Security"
           headers were sent by any of the servers) then no file will be
           created, not even an empty one. This behaviour applies to the
           default database file (<i>~/.wget-hsts</i>) as well: it will not be
           created until some server enforces an HSTS policy.

           Care is taken not to override possible changes made by other
           Wget processes at the same time over the HSTS database.
           Before dumping the updated HSTS entries on the file, Wget
           will re-read it and merge the changes.

           Using a custom HSTS database and/or modifying an existing one
           is discouraged.  For more information about the potential
           security threats arose from such practice, see section 14
           "Security Considerations" of RFC 6797, specially section 14.9
           "Creative Manipulation of HSTS Policy Store".

       <b>--warc-file=</b><i>file</i>
           Use <i>file</i> as the destination WARC file.

       <b>--warc-header=</b><i>string</i>
           Use <i>string</i> into as the warcinfo record.

       <b>--warc-max-size=</b><i>size</i>
           Set the maximum size of the WARC files to <i>size</i>.

       <b>--warc-cdx</b>
           Write CDX index files.

       <b>--warc-dedup=</b><i>file</i>
           Do not store records listed in this CDX file.

       <b>--no-warc-compression</b>
           Do not compress WARC files with GZIP.

       <b>--no-warc-digests</b>
           Do not calculate SHA1 digests.

       <b>--no-warc-keep-log</b>
           Do not store the log file in a WARC record.

       <b>--warc-tempdir=</b><i>dir</i>
           Specify the location for temporary files created by the WARC
           writer.

   <b>FTP Options</b>
       <b>--ftp-user=</b><i>user</i>
       <b>--ftp-password=</b><i>password</i>
           Specify the username <i>user</i> and password <i>password</i> on an FTP
           server.  Without this, or the corresponding startup option,
           the password defaults to <b>-wget@</b>, normally used for anonymous
           FTP.

           Another way to specify username and password is in the URL
           itself.  Either method reveals your password to anyone who
           bothers to run "ps".  To prevent the passwords from being
           seen, store them in <i>.wgetrc</i> or <i>.netrc</i>, and make sure to
           protect those files from other users with "chmod".  If the
           passwords are really important, do not leave them lying in
           those files either---edit the files and delete them after
           Wget has started the download.

       <b>--no-remove-listing</b>
           Don't remove the temporary <i>.listing</i> files generated by FTP
           retrievals.  Normally, these files contain the raw directory
           listings received from FTP servers.  Not removing them can be
           useful for debugging purposes, or when you want to be able to
           easily check on the contents of remote server directories
           (e.g. to verify that a mirror you're running is complete).

           Note that even though Wget writes to a known filename for
           this file, this is not a security hole in the scenario of a
           user making <i>.listing</i> a symbolic link to <i>/etc/passwd</i> or
           something and asking "root" to run Wget in his or her
           directory.  Depending on the options used, either Wget will
           refuse to write to <i>.listing</i>, making the
           globbing/recursion/time-stamping operation fail, or the
           symbolic link will be deleted and replaced with the actual
           <i>.listing</i> file, or the listing will be written to a
           <i>.listing.number</i> file.

           Even though this situation isn't a problem, though, "root"
           should never run Wget in a non-trusted user's directory.  A
           user could do something as simple as linking <i>index.html</i> to
           <i>/etc/passwd</i> and asking "root" to run Wget with <b>-N </b>or <b>-r </b>so
           the file will be overwritten.

       <b>--no-glob</b>
           Turn off FTP globbing.  Globbing refers to the use of shell-
           like special characters (<i>wildcards</i>), like <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>[ </b>and <b>] </b>to
           retrieve more than one file from the same directory at once,
           like:

                   wget ftp://gnjilux.srk.fer.hr/*.msg

           By default, globbing will be turned on if the URL contains a
           globbing character.  This option may be used to turn globbing
           on or off permanently.

           You may have to quote the URL to protect it from being
           expanded by your shell.  Globbing makes Wget look for a
           directory listing, which is system-specific.  This is why it
           currently works only with Unix FTP servers (and the ones
           emulating Unix "ls" output).

       <b>--no-passive-ftp</b>
           Disable the use of the <i>passive</i> FTP transfer mode.  Passive
           FTP mandates that the client connect to the server to
           establish the data connection rather than the other way
           around.

           If the machine is connected to the Internet directly, both
           passive and active FTP should work equally well.  Behind most
           firewall and NAT configurations passive FTP has a better
           chance of working.  However, in some rare firewall
           configurations, active FTP actually works when passive FTP
           doesn't.  If you suspect this to be the case, use this
           option, or set "passive_ftp=off" in your init file.

       <b>--preserve-permissions</b>
           Preserve remote file permissions instead of permissions set
           by umask.

       <b>--retr-symlinks</b>
           By default, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a
           symbolic link is encountered, the symbolic link is traversed
           and the pointed-to files are retrieved.  Currently, Wget does
           not traverse symbolic links to directories to download them
           recursively, though this feature may be added in the future.

           When <b>--retr-symlinks=no </b>is specified, the linked-to file is
           not downloaded.  Instead, a matching symbolic link is created
           on the local file system.  The pointed-to file will not be
           retrieved unless this recursive retrieval would have
           encountered it separately and downloaded it anyway.  This
           option poses a security risk where a malicious FTP Server may
           cause Wget to write to files outside of the intended
           directories through a specially crafted .LISTING file.

           Note that when retrieving a file (not a directory) because it
           was specified on the command-line, rather than because it was
           recursed to, this option has no effect.  Symbolic links are
           always traversed in this case.

   <b>FTPS Options</b>
       <b>--ftps-implicit</b>
           This option tells Wget to use FTPS implicitly. Implicit FTPS
           consists of initializing SSL/TLS from the very beginning of
           the control connection. This option does not send an "AUTH
           TLS" command: it assumes the server speaks FTPS and directly
           starts an SSL/TLS connection. If the attempt is successful,
           the session continues just like regular FTPS ("PBSZ" and
           "PROT" are sent, etc.).  Implicit FTPS is no longer a
           requirement for FTPS implementations, and thus many servers
           may not support it. If <b>--ftps-implicit </b>is passed and no
           explicit port number specified, the default port for implicit
           FTPS, 990, will be used, instead of the default port for the
           "normal" (explicit) FTPS which is the same as that of FTP,
           21.

       <b>--no-ftps-resume-ssl</b>
           Do not resume the SSL/TLS session in the data channel. When
           starting a data connection, Wget tries to resume the SSL/TLS
           session previously started in the control connection.
           SSL/TLS session resumption avoids performing an entirely new
           handshake by reusing the SSL/TLS parameters of a previous
           session. Typically, the FTPS servers want it that way, so
           Wget does this by default. Under rare circumstances however,
           one might want to start an entirely new SSL/TLS session in
           every data connection.  This is what <b>--no-ftps-resume-ssl </b>is
           for.

       <b>--ftps-clear-data-connection</b>
           All the data connections will be in plain text. Only the
           control connection will be under SSL/TLS. Wget will send a
           "PROT C" command to achieve this, which must be approved by
           the server.

       <b>--ftps-fallback-to-ftp</b>
           Fall back to FTP if FTPS is not supported by the target
           server. For security reasons, this option is not asserted by
           default. The default behaviour is to exit with an error.  If
           a server does not successfully reply to the initial "AUTH
           TLS" command, or in the case of implicit FTPS, if the initial
           SSL/TLS connection attempt is rejected, it is considered that
           such server does not support FTPS.

   <b>Recursive Retrieval Options</b>
       <b>-r</b>
       <b>--recursive</b>
           Turn on recursive retrieving.    The default maximum depth is
           5.

       <b>-l </b><i>depth</i>
       <b>--level=</b><i>depth</i>
           Set the maximum number of subdirectories that Wget will
           recurse into to <i>depth</i>.  In order to prevent one from
           accidentally downloading very large websites when using
           recursion this is limited to a depth of 5 by default, i.e.,
           it will traverse at most 5 directories deep starting from the
           provided URL.  Set <b>-l 0 </b>or <b>-l inf </b>for infinite recursion
           depth.

                   wget -r -l 0 <a href="#">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a>

           Ideally, one would expect this to download just <i>1.html</i>.  but
           unfortunately this is not the case, because <b>-l 0 </b>is
           equivalent to <b>-l inf</b>---that is, infinite recursion.  To
           download a single HTML page (or a handful of them), specify
           them all on the command line and leave away <b>-r </b>and <b>-l</b>. To
           download the essential items to view a single HTML page, see
           <b>page requisites</b>.

       <b>--delete-after</b>
           This option tells Wget to delete every single file it
           downloads, <i>after</i> having done so.  It is useful for pre-
           fetching popular pages through a proxy, e.g.:

                   wget -r -nd --delete-after <a href="http://whatever.com/~popular/page/">http://whatever.com/~popular/page/</a>

           The <b>-r </b>option is to retrieve recursively, and <b>-nd </b>to not
           create directories.

           Note that <b>--delete-after </b>deletes files on the local machine.
           It does not issue the <b>DELE </b>command to remote FTP sites, for
           instance.  Also note that when <b>--delete-after </b>is specified,
           <b>--convert-links </b>is ignored, so <b>.orig </b>files are simply not
           created in the first place.

       <b>-k</b>
       <b>--convert-links</b>
           After the download is complete, convert the links in the
           document to make them suitable for local viewing.  This
           affects not only the visible hyperlinks, but any part of the
           document that links to external content, such as embedded
           images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-HTML
           content, etc.

           Each link will be changed in one of the two ways:

           â€¢   The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will
               be changed to refer to the file they point to as a
               relative link.

               Example: if the downloaded file <i>/foo/doc.html</i> links to
               <i>/bar/img.gif</i>, also downloaded, then the link in <i>doc.html</i>
               will be modified to point to <b>../bar/img.gif</b>.  This kind
               of transformation works reliably for arbitrary
               combinations of directories.

           â€¢   The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget
               will be changed to include host name and absolute path of
               the location they point to.

               Example: if the downloaded file <i>/foo/doc.html</i> links to
               <i>/bar/img.gif</i> (or to <i>../bar/img.gif</i>), then the link in
               <i>doc.html</i> will be modified to point to
               <i><a href="http://hostname/bar/img.gif">http://hostname/bar/img.gif</a> </i>.

           Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked
           file was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name;
           if it was not downloaded, the link will refer to its full
           Internet address rather than presenting a broken link.  The
           fact that the former links are converted to relative links
           ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to another
           directory.

           Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which
           links have been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done
           by <b>-k </b>will be performed at the end of all the downloads.

       <b>--convert-file-only</b>
           This option converts only the filename part of the URLs,
           leaving the rest of the URLs untouched. This filename part is
           sometimes referred to as the "basename", although we avoid
           that term here in order not to cause confusion.

           It works particularly well in conjunction with
           <b>--adjust-extension</b>, although this coupling is not enforced.
           It proves useful to populate Internet caches with files
           downloaded from different hosts.

           Example: if some link points to <i>//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz</i> with
           <b>--adjust-extension </b>asserted and its local destination is
           intended to be <i>./foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css</i>, then the link would
           be converted to <i>//foo.com/bar.cgi?xyz.css</i>. Note that only the
           filename part has been modified. The rest of the URL has been
           left untouched, including the net path ("//") which would
           otherwise be processed by Wget and converted to the effective
           scheme (ie. "http://").

       <b>-K</b>
       <b>--backup-converted</b>
           When converting a file, back up the original version with a
           <b>.orig </b>suffix.  Affects the behavior of <b>-N</b>.

       <b>-m</b>
       <b>--mirror</b>
           Turn on options suitable for mirroring.  This option turns on
           recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth
           and keeps FTP directory listings.  It is currently equivalent
           to <b>-r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing</b>.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--page-requisites</b>
           This option causes Wget to download all the files that are
           necessary to properly display a given HTML page.  This
           includes such things as inlined images, sounds, and
           referenced stylesheets.

           Ordinarily, when downloading a single HTML page, any
           requisite documents that may be needed to display it properly
           are not downloaded.  Using <b>-r </b>together with <b>-l </b>can help, but
           since Wget does not ordinarily distinguish between external
           and inlined documents, one is generally left with "leaf
           documents" that are missing their requisites.

           For instance, say document <i>1.html</i> contains an "&lt;IMG&gt;" tag
           referencing <i>1.gif</i> and an "&lt;A&gt;" tag pointing to external
           document <i>2.html</i>.  Say that <i>2.html</i> is similar but that its
           image is <i>2.gif</i> and it links to <i>3.html</i>.  Say this continues up
           to some arbitrarily high number.

           If one executes the command:

                   wget -r -l 2 <a href="#">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a>

           then <i>1.html</i>, <i>1.gif</i>, <i>2.html</i>, <i>2.gif</i>, and <i>3.html</i> will be
           downloaded.  As you can see, <i>3.html</i> is without its requisite
           <i>3.gif</i> because Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up
           to 2) away from <i>1.html</i> in order to determine where to stop
           the recursion.  However, with this command:

                   wget -r -l 2 -p <a href="#">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a>

           all the above files <i>and 3.html</i>'s requisite <i>3.gif</i> will be
           downloaded.  Similarly,

                   wget -r -l 1 -p <a href="#">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a>

           will cause <i>1.html</i>, <i>1.gif</i>, <i>2.html</i>, and <i>2.gif</i> to be downloaded.
           One might think that:

                   wget -r -l 0 -p <a href="#">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a>

           would download just <i>1.html</i> and <i>1.gif</i>, but unfortunately this
           is not the case, because <b>-l 0 </b>is equivalent to <b>-l inf</b>---that
           is, infinite recursion.  To download a single HTML page (or a
           handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a <b>-i</b>
           URL input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave
           off <b>-r </b>and <b>-l</b>:

                   wget -p <a href="#">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a>

           Note that Wget will behave as if <b>-r </b>had been specified, but
           only that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.
           Links from that page to external documents will not be
           followed.  Actually, to download a single page and all its
           requisites (even if they exist on separate websites), and
           make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author
           likes to use a few options in addition to <b>-p</b>:

                   wget -E -H -k -K -p <a href="#">http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;</a>

           To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea
           of an external document link is any URL specified in an "&lt;A&gt;"
           tag, an "&lt;AREA&gt;" tag, or a "&lt;LINK&gt;" tag other than "&lt;LINK
           REL="stylesheet"&gt;".

       <b>--strict-comments</b>
           Turn on strict parsing of HTML comments.  The default is to
           terminate comments at the first occurrence of <b>--&gt;</b>.

           According to specifications, HTML comments are expressed as
           SGML <i>declarations</i>.  Declaration is special markup that begins
           with <b>&lt;! </b>and ends with <b>&gt;</b>, such as <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt;</b>, that may
           contain comments between a pair of <b>-- </b>delimiters.  HTML
           comments are "empty declarations", SGML declarations without
           any non-comment text.  Therefore, <b>&lt;!--foo--&gt; </b>is a valid
           comment, and so is <b>&lt;!--one-- --two--&gt;</b>, but <b>&lt;!--1--2--&gt; </b>is
           not.

           On the other hand, most HTML writers don't perceive comments
           as anything other than text delimited with <b>&lt;!-- </b>and <b>--&gt;</b>,
           which is not quite the same.  For example, something like
           <b>&lt;!------------&gt; </b>works as a valid comment as long as the
           number of dashes is a multiple of four (!).  If not, the
           comment technically lasts until the next <b>--</b>, which may be at
           the other end of the document.  Because of this, many popular
           browsers completely ignore the specification and implement
           what users have come to expect: comments delimited with <b>&lt;!--</b>
           and <b>--&gt;</b>.

           Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which
           resulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed
           fine in browsers, but had the misfortune of containing non-
           compliant comments.  Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has
           joined the ranks of clients that implements "naive" comments,
           terminating each comment at the first occurrence of <b>--&gt;</b>.

           If, for whatever reason, you want strict comment parsing, use
           this option to turn it on.

   <b>Recursive Accept/Reject Options</b>
       <b>-A </b><i>acclist</i> <b>--accept </b><i>acclist</i>
       <b>-R </b><i>rejlist</i> <b>--reject </b><i>rejlist</i>
           Specify comma-separated lists of file name suffixes or
           patterns to accept or reject. Note that if any of the
           wildcard characters, <b>*</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>[ </b>or <b>]</b>, appear in an element of
           <i>acclist</i> or <i>rejlist</i>, it will be treated as a pattern, rather
           than a suffix.  In this case, you have to enclose the pattern
           into quotes to prevent your shell from expanding it, like in
           <b>-A "*.mp3" </b>or <b>-A '*.mp3'</b>.

       <b>--accept-regex </b><i>urlregex</i>
       <b>--reject-regex </b><i>urlregex</i>
           Specify a regular expression to accept or reject the complete
           URL.

       <b>--regex-type </b><i>regextype</i>
           Specify the regular expression type.  Possible types are
           <b>posix </b>or <b>pcre</b>.  Note that to be able to use <b>pcre </b>type, wget
           has to be compiled with libpcre support.

       <b>-D </b><i>domain-list</i>
       <b>--domains=</b><i>domain-list</i>
           Set domains to be followed.  <i>domain-list</i> is a comma-separated
           list of domains.  Note that it does <i>not</i> turn on <b>-H</b>.

       <b>--exclude-domains </b><i>domain-list</i>
           Specify the domains that are <i>not</i> to be followed.

       <b>--follow-ftp</b>
           Follow FTP links from HTML documents.  Without this option,
           Wget will ignore all the FTP links.

       <b>--follow-tags=</b><i>list</i>
           Wget has an internal table of HTML tag / attribute pairs that
           it considers when looking for linked documents during a
           recursive retrieval.  If a user wants only a subset of those
           tags to be considered, however, he or she should be specify
           such tags in a comma-separated <i>list</i> with this option.

       <b>--ignore-tags=</b><i>list</i>
           This is the opposite of the <b>--follow-tags </b>option.  To skip
           certain HTML tags when recursively looking for documents to
           download, specify them in a comma-separated <i>list</i>.

           In the past, this option was the best bet for downloading a
           single page and its requisites, using a command-line like:

                   wget --ignore-tags=a,area -H -k -K -r <a href="#">http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;</a>

           However, the author of this option came across a page with
           tags like "&lt;LINK REL="home" HREF="/"&gt;" and came to the
           realization that specifying tags to ignore was not enough.
           One can't just tell Wget to ignore "&lt;LINK&gt;", because then
           stylesheets will not be downloaded.  Now the best bet for
           downloading a single page and its requisites is the dedicated
           <b>--page-requisites </b>option.

       <b>--ignore-case</b>
           Ignore case when matching files and directories.  This
           influences the behavior of -R, -A, -I, and -X options, as
           well as globbing implemented when downloading from FTP sites.
           For example, with this option, <b>-A "*.txt" </b>will match
           <b>file1.txt</b>, but also <b>file2.TXT</b>, <b>file3.TxT</b>, and so on.  The
           quotes in the example are to prevent the shell from expanding
           the pattern.

       <b>-H</b>
       <b>--span-hosts</b>
           Enable spanning across hosts when doing recursive retrieving.

       <b>-L</b>
       <b>--relative</b>
           Follow relative links only.  Useful for retrieving a specific
           home page without any distractions, not even those from the
           same hosts.

       <b>-I </b><i>list</i>
       <b>--include-directories=</b><i>list</i>
           Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to
           follow when downloading.  Elements of <i>list</i> may contain
           wildcards.

       <b>-X </b><i>list</i>
       <b>--exclude-directories=</b><i>list</i>
           Specify a comma-separated list of directories you wish to
           exclude from download.  Elements of <i>list</i> may contain
           wildcards.

       <b>-np</b>
       <b>--no-parent</b>
           Do not ever ascend to the parent directory when retrieving
           recursively.  This is a useful option, since it guarantees
           that only the files <i>below</i> a certain hierarchy will be
           downloaded.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Wget supports proxies for both HTTP and FTP retrievals.  The
       standard way to specify proxy location, which Wget recognizes, is
       using the following environment variables:

       <b>http_proxy</b>
       <b>https_proxy</b>
           If set, the <b>http_proxy </b>and <b>https_proxy </b>variables should
           contain the URLs of the proxies for HTTP and HTTPS
           connections respectively.

       <b>ftp_proxy</b>
           This variable should contain the URL of the proxy for FTP
           connections.  It is quite common that <b>http_proxy </b>and
           <b>ftp_proxy </b>are set to the same URL.

       <b>no_proxy</b>
           This variable should contain a comma-separated list of domain
           extensions proxy should <i>not</i> be used for.  For instance, if
           the value of <b>no_proxy </b>is <b>.mit.edu</b>, proxy will not be used to
           retrieve documents from MIT.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       Wget may return one of several error codes if it encounters
       problems.

       0   No problems occurred.

       1   Generic error code.

       2   Parse error---for instance, when parsing command-line
           options, the <b>.wgetrc </b>or <b>.netrc</b>...

       3   File I/O error.

       4   Network failure.

       5   SSL verification failure.

       6   Username/password authentication failure.

       7   Protocol errors.

       8   Server issued an error response.

       With the exceptions of 0 and 1, the lower-numbered exit codes
       take precedence over higher-numbered ones, when multiple types of
       errors are encountered.

       In versions of Wget prior to 1.12, Wget's exit status tended to
       be unhelpful and inconsistent. Recursive downloads would
       virtually always return 0 (success), regardless of any issues
       encountered, and non-recursive fetches only returned the status
       corresponding to the most recently-attempted download.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>/usr/local/etc/wgetrc</b>
           Default location of the <i>global</i> startup file.

       <b>.wgetrc</b>
           User startup file.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       You are welcome to submit bug reports via the GNU Wget bug
       tracker (see
       &lt;<b><a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=additem&amp;group=wget">https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=additem&amp;group=wget</a> </b>&gt;) or to
       our mailing list &lt;<b>bug-wget@gnu.org</b>&gt;.

       Visit &lt;<b><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget">https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-wget</a> </b>&gt; to get
       more info (how to subscribe, list archives, ...).

       Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a
       few simple guidelines.

       1.  Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a
           bug.  If Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave
           as documented, it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you
           are not sure about the way they are supposed to work, it
           might well be a bug, but you might want to double-check the
           documentation and the mailing lists.

       2.  Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.
           E.g. if Wget crashes while downloading <b>wget -rl0 -kKE -t5</b>
           <b>--no-proxy <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a> -o /tmp/log</b>, you should try to
           see if the crash is repeatable, and if will occur with a
           simpler set of options.  You might even try to start the
           download at the page where the crash occurred to see if that
           page somehow triggered the crash.

           Also, while I will probably be interested to know the
           contents of your <i>.wgetrc</i> file, just dumping it into the debug
           message is probably a bad idea.  Instead, you should first
           try to see if the bug repeats with <i>.wgetrc</i> moved out of the
           way.  Only if it turns out that <i>.wgetrc</i> settings affect the
           bug, mail me the relevant parts of the file.

       3.  Please start Wget with <b>-d </b>option and send us the resulting
           output (or relevant parts thereof).  If Wget was compiled
           without debug support, recompile it---it is <i>much</i> easier to
           trace bugs with debug support on.

           Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive
           information from the debug log before sending it to the bug
           address.  The "-d" won't go out of its way to collect
           sensitive information, but the log <i>will</i> contain a fairly
           complete transcript of Wget's communication with the server,
           which may include passwords and pieces of downloaded data.
           Since the bug address is publicly archived, you may assume
           that all bug reports are visible to the public.

       4.  If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. "gdb
           `which wget` core" and type "where" to get the backtrace.
           This may not work if the system administrator has disabled
           core files, but it is safe to try.
