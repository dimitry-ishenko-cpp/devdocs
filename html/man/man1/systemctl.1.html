SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>systemctl </b>[OPTIONS...] COMMAND [UNIT...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>systemctl </b>may be used to introspect and control the state of the
       "systemd" system and service manager. Please refer to <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>
       for an introduction into the basic concepts and functionality
       this tool manages.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands are understood:

   <b>Unit Commands (Introspection and Modification)</b>
       <b>list-units </b>[<i>PATTERN</i>...]
           List units that <b>systemd </b>currently has in memory. This
           includes units that are either referenced directly or through
           a dependency, units that are pinned by applications
           programmatically, or units that were active in the past and
           have failed. By default only units which are active, have
           pending jobs, or have failed are shown; this can be changed
           with option <b>--all</b>. If one or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified,
           only units matching one of them are shown. The units that are
           shown are additionally filtered by <b>--type= </b>and <b>--state= </b>if
           those options are specified.

           Note that this command does not show unit templates, but only
           instances of unit templates. Units templates that aren't
           instantiated are not runnable, and will thus never show up in
           the output of this command. Specifically this means that
           foo@.service will never be shown in this list — unless
           instantiated, e.g. as foo@bar.service. Use <b>list-unit-files</b>
           (see below) for listing installed unit template files.

           Produces output similar to

                 UNIT                         LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
                 sys-module-fuse.device       loaded active plugged /sys/module/fuse
                 -.mount                      loaded active mounted Root Mount
                 boot-efi.mount               loaded active mounted /boot/efi
                 systemd-journald.service     loaded active running Journal Service
                 systemd-logind.service       loaded active running Login Service
               ● user@1000.service            loaded failed failed  User Manager for UID 1000
                 ...
                 systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer loaded active waiting Daily Cleanup of Temporary Directories

               LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
               ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
               SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

               123 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
               To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.

           The header and the last unit of a given type are underlined
           if the terminal supports that. A colored dot is shown next to
           services which were masked, not found, or otherwise failed.

           The LOAD column shows the load state, one of <b>loaded</b>,
           <b>not-found</b>, <b>bad-setting</b>, <b>error</b>, <b>masked</b>. The ACTIVE columns
           shows the general unit state, one of <b>active</b>, <b>reloading</b>,
           <b>inactive</b>, <b>failed</b>, <b>activating</b>, <b>deactivating</b>. The SUB column
           shows the unit-type-specific detailed state of the unit,
           possible values vary by unit type. The list of possible LOAD,
           ACTIVE, and SUB states is not constant and new systemd
           releases may both add and remove values.

               systemctl --state=help

           command may be used to display the current set of possible
           values.

           This is the default command.

       <b>list-automounts </b>[<i>PATTERN</i>...]
           List automount units currently in memory, ordered by mount
           path. If one or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only automount
           units matching one of them are shown. Produces output similar
           to

               WHAT        WHERE                    MOUNTED IDLE TIMEOUT UNIT

               2 automounts listed.

           Also see <b>--show-types</b>, <b>--all</b>, and <b>--state=</b>.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>list-paths </b>[<i>PATTERN</i>...]
           List path units currently in memory, ordered by path. If one
           or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only path units matching one
           of them are shown. Produces output similar to

               PATH                           CONDITION         UNIT                               ACTIVATES

               /run/systemd/ask-password      DirectoryNotEmpty systemd-ask-password-wall.path     systemd-ask-password-wall.service
               /var/cache/cups/org.cups.cupsd PathExists        cups.path                          cups.service

               3 paths listed.

           Also see <b>--show-types</b>, <b>--all</b>, and <b>--state=</b>.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>list-sockets </b>[<i>PATTERN</i>...]
           List socket units currently in memory, ordered by listening
           address. If one or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only socket
           units matching one of them are shown. Produces output similar
           to

               LISTEN           UNIT                        ACTIVATES
               /dev/initctl     systemd-initctl.socket      systemd-initctl.service
               ...

               kobject-uevent 1 systemd-udevd-kernel.socket systemd-udevd.service

               5 sockets listed.

           Note: because the addresses might contains spaces, this
           output is not suitable for programmatic consumption.

           Also see <b>--show-types</b>, <b>--all</b>, and <b>--state=</b>.

           Added in version 202.

       <b>list-timers </b>[<i>PATTERN</i>...]
           List timer units currently in memory, ordered by the time
           they elapse next. If one or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only
           units matching one of them are shown. Produces output similar
           to

               NEXT                         LEFT          LAST                         PASSED     UNIT                         ACTIVATES

           <i>NEXT</i> shows the next time the timer will run.

           <i>LEFT</i> shows how long till the next time the timer runs.

           <i>LAST</i> shows the last time the timer ran.

           <i>PASSED</i> shows how long has passed since the timer last ran.

           <i>UNIT</i> shows the name of the timer

           <i>ACTIVATES</i> shows the name the service the timer activates when
           it runs.

           Also see <b>--all </b>and <b>--state=</b>.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>is-active </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Check whether any of the specified units are active (i.e.
           running). Returns an exit code <b>0 </b>if at least one is active,
           or non-zero otherwise. Unless <b>--quiet </b>is specified, this will
           also print the current unit state to standard output.

       <b>is-failed [</b><i>PATTERN</i>...]
           Check whether any of the specified units is in the "failed"
           state. If no unit is specified, check whether there are any
           failed units, which corresponds to the "degraded" state
           returned by <b>is-system-running</b>. Returns an exit code <b>0 </b>if at
           least one has failed, non-zero otherwise. Unless <b>--quiet </b>is
           specified, this will also print the current unit or system
           state to standard output.

           Added in version 197.

       <b>status </b>[<i>PATTERN</i>...|<i>PID</i>...]]
           Show runtime status information about the whole system or
           about one or more units followed by most recent log data from
           the journal. If no positional arguments are specified, and no
           unit filter is given with <b>--type=</b>, <b>--state=</b>, or <b>--failed</b>,
           shows the status of the whole system. If combined with <b>--all</b>,
           follows that with the status of all units. If positional
           arguments are specified, each positional argument is treated
           as either a unit name to show, or a glob pattern to show
           units whose names match that pattern, or a PID to show the
           unit containing that PID. When <b>--type=</b>, <b>--state=</b>, or <b>--failed</b>
           are used, units are additionally filtered by the TYPE and
           ACTIVE state.

           This function is intended to generate human-readable output.
           If you are looking for computer-parsable output, use <b>show</b>
           instead. By default, this function only shows 10 lines of
           output and ellipsizes lines to fit in the terminal window.
           This can be changed with <b>--lines </b>and <b>--full</b>, see above. In
           addition, <b>journalctl --unit=</b><i>NAME</i> or <b>journalctl</b>
           <b>--user-unit=</b><i>NAME</i> use a similar filter for messages and might
           be more convenient.

           Note that this operation only displays <i>runtime</i> status, i.e.
           information about the current invocation of the unit (if it
           is running) or the most recent invocation (if it is not
           running anymore, and has not been released from memory).
           Information about earlier invocations, invocations from
           previous system boots, or prior invocations that have already
           been released from memory may be retrieved via <b>journalctl</b>
           <b>--unit=</b>.

           systemd implicitly loads units as necessary, so just running
           the <b>status </b>will attempt to load a file. The command is thus
           not useful for determining if something was already loaded or
           not. The units may possibly also be quickly unloaded after
           the operation is completed if there's no reason to keep it in
           memory thereafter.

           The dot ("●") uses color on supported terminals to summarize
           the unit state at a glance. Along with its color, its shape
           varies according to its state: "inactive" or "maintenance" is
           a white circle ("○"), "active" is a green dot ("●"),
           "deactivating" is a white dot, "failed" or "error" is a red
           cross ("×"), and "reloading" is a green clockwise circle
           arrow ("↻").

           The "Loaded:" line in the output will show "loaded" if the
           unit has been loaded into memory. Other possible values for
           "Loaded:" include: "error" if there was a problem loading it,
           "not-found" if no unit file was found for this unit,
           "bad-setting" if an essential unit file setting could not be
           parsed and "masked" if the unit file has been masked. Along
           with showing the path to the unit file, this line will also
           show the enablement state. Enabled units are included in the
           dependency network between units, and thus are started at
           boot or via some other form of activation. See the full table
           of possible enablement states — including the definition of
           "masked" — in the documentation for the <b>is-enabled </b>command.

           The "Active:" line shows active state. The value is usually
           "active" or "inactive". Active could mean started, bound,
           plugged in, etc depending on the unit type. The unit could
           also be in process of changing states, reporting a state of
           "activating" or "deactivating". A special "failed" state is
           entered when the service failed in some way, such as a crash,
           exiting with an error code or timing out. If the failed state
           is entered the cause will be logged for later reference.

       <b>show </b>[<i>PATTERN</i>...|<i>JOB</i>...]
           Show properties of one or more units, jobs, or the manager
           itself. If no argument is specified, properties of the
           manager will be shown. If a unit name is specified,
           properties of the unit are shown, and if a job ID is
           specified, properties of the job are shown. By default, empty
           properties are suppressed. Use <b>--all </b>to show those too. To
           select specific properties to show, use <b>--property=</b>. This
           command is intended to be used whenever computer-parsable
           output is required. Use <b>status </b>if you are looking for
           formatted human-readable output.

           Many properties shown by <b>systemctl show </b>map directly to
           configuration settings of the system and service manager and
           its unit files. Note that the properties shown by the command
           are generally more low-level, normalized versions of the
           original configuration settings and expose runtime state in
           addition to configuration. For example, properties shown for
           service units include the service's current main process
           identifier as "MainPID" (which is runtime state), and time
           settings are always exposed as properties ending in the
           "...USec" suffix even if a matching configuration options end
           in "...Sec", because microseconds is the normalized time unit
           used internally by the system and service manager.

           For details about many of these properties, see the
           documentation of the D-Bus interface backing these
           properties, see <a href="../man5/org.freedesktop.systemd1.5.html">org.freedesktop.systemd1(5)</a>.

       <b>cat </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Show backing files of one or more units. Prints the
           "fragment" and "drop-ins" (source files) of units. Each file
           is preceded by a comment which includes the file name. Note
           that this shows the contents of the backing files on disk,
           which might not match the system manager's understanding of
           these units if any unit files were updated on disk and the
           <b>daemon-reload </b>command wasn't issued since.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>help </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...|</b><i>PID</i><b>...</b>
           Show manual pages for one or more units, if available. If a
           PID is given, the manual pages for the unit the process
           belongs to are shown.

           Added in version 185.

       <b>list-dependencies </b>[<i>UNIT</i>...]
           Shows units required and wanted by the specified units. This
           recursively lists units following the <i>Requires=</i>, <i>Requisite=</i>,
           <i>Wants=</i>, <i>ConsistsOf=</i>, <i>BindsTo=</i>, and <i>Upholds=</i> dependencies. If
           no units are specified, default.target is implied.

           The units that are shown are additionally filtered by <b>--type=</b>
           and <b>--state= </b>if those options are specified. Note that we
           won't be able to use a tree structure in this case, so
           <b>--plain </b>is implied.

           By default, only target units are recursively expanded. When
           <b>--all </b>is passed, all other units are recursively expanded as
           well.

           Options <b>--reverse</b>, <b>--after</b>, <b>--before </b>may be used to change
           what types of dependencies are shown.

           Note that this command only lists units currently loaded into
           memory by the service manager. In particular, this command is
           not suitable to get a comprehensive list at all reverse
           dependencies on a specific unit, as it won't list the
           dependencies declared by units currently not loaded.

           Added in version 198.

       <b>start </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Start (activate) one or more units specified on the command
           line.

           Note that unit glob patterns expand to names of units
           currently in memory. Units which are not active and are not
           in a failed state usually are not in memory, and will not be
           matched by any pattern. In addition, in case of instantiated
           units, systemd is often unaware of the instance name until
           the instance has been started. Therefore, using glob patterns
           with <b>start </b>has limited usefulness. Also, secondary alias
           names of units are not considered.

           Option <b>--all </b>may be used to also operate on inactive units
           which are referenced by other loaded units. Note that this is
           not the same as operating on "all" possible units, because as
           the previous paragraph describes, such a list is ill-defined.
           Nevertheless, <b>systemctl start --all </b><i>GLOB</i> may be useful if all
           the units that should match the pattern are pulled in by some
           target which is known to be loaded.

       <b>stop </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Stop (deactivate) one or more units specified on the command
           line.

           This command will fail if the unit does not exist or if
           stopping of the unit is prohibited (see <i>RefuseManualStop=</i> in
           <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>). It will <i>not</i> fail if any of the commands
           configured to stop the unit (<i>ExecStop=</i>, etc.) fail, because
           the manager will still forcibly terminate the unit.

           If a unit that gets stopped can still be triggered by other
           units, a warning containing the names of the triggering units
           is shown.  <b>--no-warn </b>can be used to suppress the warning.

       <b>reload </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Asks all units listed on the command line to reload their
           configuration. Note that this will reload the
           service-specific configuration, not the unit configuration
           file of systemd. If you want systemd to reload the
           configuration file of a unit, use the <b>daemon-reload </b>command.
           In other words: for the example case of Apache, this will
           reload Apache's httpd.conf in the web server, not the
           apache.service systemd unit file.

           This command should not be confused with the <b>daemon-reload</b>
           command.

       <b>restart </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Stop and then start one or more units specified on the
           command line. If the units are not running yet, they will be
           started.

           Note that restarting a unit with this command does not
           necessarily flush out all of the unit's resources before it
           is started again. For example, the per-service file
           descriptor storage facility (see <i>FileDescriptorStoreMax=</i> in
           <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>) will remain intact as long as the unit
           has a job pending, and is only cleared when the unit is fully
           stopped and no jobs are pending anymore. If it is intended
           that the file descriptor store is flushed out, too, during a
           restart operation an explicit <b>systemctl stop </b>command followed
           by <b>systemctl start </b>should be issued.

       <b>try-restart </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Stop and then start one or more units specified on the
           command line if the units are running. This does nothing if
           units are not running.

       <b>reload-or-restart </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Reload one or more units if they support it. If not, stop and
           then start them instead. If the units are not running yet,
           they will be started.

       <b>try-reload-or-restart </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Reload one or more units if they support it. If not, stop and
           then start them instead. This does nothing if the units are
           not running.

           Added in version 229.

       <b>isolate </b><i>UNIT</i>
           Start the unit specified on the command line and its
           dependencies and stop all others, unless they have
           <b>IgnoreOnIsolate=yes </b>(see <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>). If a unit name
           with no extension is given, an extension of ".target" will be
           assumed.

           This command is dangerous, since it will immediately stop
           processes that are not enabled in the new target, possibly
           including the graphical environment or terminal you are
           currently using.

           Note that this operation is allowed only on units where
           <b>AllowIsolate= </b>is enabled. See <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for details.

       <b>kill </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Send a UNIX process signal to one or more processes of the
           unit. Use <b>--kill-whom= </b>to select which process to send the
           signal to. Use <b>--signal= </b>to select the signal to send.
           Combine with <b>--kill-value= </b>to enqueue a POSIX Realtime Signal
           with an associated value.

       <b>clean </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Remove the configuration, state, cache, logs or runtime data
           of the specified units. Use <b>--what= </b>to select which kind of
           resource to remove. For service units this may be used to
           remove the directories configured with
           <i>ConfigurationDirectory=</i>, <i>StateDirectory=</i>, <i>CacheDirectory=</i>,
           <i>LogsDirectory=</i> and <i>RuntimeDirectory=</i>, see <a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec(5)</a> for
           details. It may also be used to clear the file descriptor
           store as enabled via <i>FileDescriptorStoreMax=</i>, see
           <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a> for details. For timer units this may be
           used to clear out the persistent timestamp data if
           <i>Persistent=</i> is used and <b>--what=state </b>is selected, see
           <a href="../man5/systemd.timer.5.html">systemd.timer(5)</a>. This command only applies to units that use
           either of these settings. If <b>--what= </b>is not specified, the
           cache and runtime data as well as the file descriptor store
           are removed (as these three types of resources are generally
           redundant and reproducible on the next invocation of the
           unit). Note that the specified units must be stopped to
           invoke this operation.

       <b>freeze </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Freeze one or more units specified on the command line using
           cgroup freezer

           Freezing the unit will cause all processes contained within
           the cgroup corresponding to the unit to be suspended. Being
           suspended means that unit's processes won't be scheduled to
           run on CPU until thawed. Note that this command is supported
           only on systems that use unified cgroup hierarchy. Unit is
           automatically thawed just before we execute a job against the
           unit, e.g. before the unit is stopped.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>thaw </b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...</b>
           Thaw (unfreeze) one or more units specified on the command
           line.

           This is the inverse operation to the <b>freeze </b>command and
           resumes the execution of processes in the unit's cgroup.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>set-property </b><i>UNIT PROPERTY</i><b>=</b><i>VALUE</i><b>...</b>
           Set the specified unit properties at runtime where this is
           supported. This allows changing configuration parameter
           properties such as resource control settings at runtime. Not
           all properties may be changed at runtime, but many resource
           control settings (primarily those in
           <a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control(5)</a>) may. The changes are applied
           immediately, and stored on disk for future boots, unless
           <b>--runtime </b>is passed, in which case the settings only apply
           until the next reboot. The syntax of the property assignment
           follows closely the syntax of assignments in unit files.

           Example: <b>systemctl set-property foobar.service CPUWeight=200</b>

           If the specified unit appears to be inactive, the changes
           will be only stored on disk as described previously hence
           they will be effective when the unit will be started.

           Note that this command allows changing multiple properties at
           the same time, which is preferable over setting them
           individually.

           Example: <b>systemctl set-property foobar.service CPUWeight=200</b>
           <b>MemoryMax=2G IPAccounting=yes</b>

           Like with unit file configuration settings, assigning an
           empty setting usually resets a property to its defaults.

           Example: <b>systemctl set-property avahi-daemon.service</b>
           <b>IPAddressDeny=</b>

           Added in version 206.

       <b>bind </b><i>UNIT PATH</i> [<i>PATH</i>]
           Bind-mounts a file or directory from the host into the
           specified unit's mount namespace. The first path argument is
           the source file or directory on the host, the second path
           argument is the destination file or directory in the unit's
           mount namespace. When the latter is omitted, the destination
           path in the unit's mount namespace is the same as the source
           path on the host. When combined with the <b>--read-only </b>switch,
           a ready-only bind mount is created. When combined with the
           <b>--mkdir </b>switch, the destination path is first created before
           the mount is applied.

           Note that this option is currently only supported for units
           that run within a mount namespace (e.g.: with <b>RootImage=</b>,
           <b>PrivateMounts=</b>, etc.). This command supports bind-mounting
           directories, regular files, device nodes, <b>AF_UNIX </b>socket
           nodes, as well as FIFOs. The bind mount is ephemeral, and it
           is undone as soon as the current unit process exists. Note
           that the namespace mentioned here, where the bind mount will
           be added to, is the one where the main service process runs.
           Other processes (those exececuted by <b>ExecReload=</b>,
           <b>ExecStartPre=</b>, etc.) run in distinct namespaces.

           If supported by the kernel, any prior mount on the selected
           target will be replaced by the new mount. If not supported,
           any prior mount will be over-mounted, but remain pinned and
           inaccessible.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>mount-image </b><i>UNIT IMAGE</i> [<i>PATH</i> [<i>PARTITION_NAME</i>:<i>MOUNT_OPTIONS</i>]]
           Mounts an image from the host into the specified unit's mount
           namespace. The first path argument is the source image on the
           host, the second path argument is the destination directory
           in the unit's mount namespace (i.e. inside
           <b>RootImage=</b>/<b>RootDirectory=</b>). The following argument, if any,
           is interpreted as a colon-separated tuple of partition name
           and comma-separated list of mount options for that partition.
           The format is the same as the service <b>MountImages= </b>setting.
           When combined with the <b>--read-only </b>switch, a ready-only mount
           is created. When combined with the <b>--mkdir </b>switch, the
           destination path is first created before the mount is
           applied.

           Note that this option is currently only supported for units
           that run within a mount namespace (i.e. with <b>RootImage=</b>,
           <b>PrivateMounts=</b>, etc.). Note that the namespace mentioned here
           where the image mount will be added to, is the one where the
           main service process runs. Note that the namespace mentioned
           here, where the bind mount will be added to, is the one where
           the main service process runs. Other processes (those
           exececuted by <b>ExecReload=</b>, <b>ExecStartPre=</b>, etc.) run in
           distinct namespaces.

           If supported by the kernel, any prior mount on the selected
           target will be replaced by the new mount. If not supported,
           any prior mount will be over-mounted, but remain pinned and
           inaccessible.

           Example:

               systemctl mount-image foo.service /tmp/img.raw /var/lib/image root:ro,nosuid

               systemctl mount-image --mkdir bar.service /tmp/img.raw /var/lib/baz/img

           Added in version 248.

       <b>service-log-level </b><i>SERVICE</i> [<i>LEVEL</i>]
           If the <i>LEVEL</i> argument is not given, print the current log
           level as reported by service <i>SERVICE</i>.

           If the optional argument <i>LEVEL</i> is provided, then change the
           current log level of the service to <i>LEVEL</i>. The log level
           should be a typical syslog log level, i.e. a value in the
           range 0...7 or one of the strings <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>,
           <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>; see <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a> for details.

           The service must have the appropriate <i>BusName=destination</i>
           property and also implement the generic
           <a href="../man5/org.freedesktop.logcontrol1.5.html">org.freedesktop.LogControl1(5)</a> interface. (systemctl will use
           the generic D-Bus protocol to access the
           org.freedesktop.LogControl1.LogLevel interface for the D-Bus
           name <i>destination</i>.)

           Added in version 247.

       <b>service-log-target </b><i>SERVICE</i> [<i>TARGET</i>]
           If the <i>TARGET</i> argument is not given, print the current log
           target as reported by service <i>SERVICE</i>.

           If the optional argument <i>TARGET</i> is provided, then change the
           current log target of the service to <i>TARGET</i>. The log target
           should be one of the strings <b>console </b>(for log output to the
           service's standard error stream), <b>kmsg </b>(for log output to the
           kernel log buffer), <b>journal </b>(for log output to
           <a href="../man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service(8)</a> using the native journal
           protocol), <b>syslog </b>(for log output to the classic syslog
           socket /dev/log), <b>null </b>(for no log output whatsoever) or <b>auto</b>
           (for an automatically determined choice, typically equivalent
           to <b>console </b>if the service is invoked interactively, and
           <b>journal </b>or <b>syslog </b>otherwise).

           For most services, only a small subset of log targets make
           sense. In particular, most "normal" services should only
           implement <b>console</b>, <b>journal</b>, and <b>null</b>. Anything else is only
           appropriate for low-level services that are active in very
           early boot before proper logging is established.

           The service must have the appropriate <i>BusName=destination</i>
           property and also implement the generic
           <a href="../man5/org.freedesktop.logcontrol1.5.html">org.freedesktop.LogControl1(5)</a> interface. (systemctl will use
           the generic D-Bus protocol to access the
           org.freedesktop.LogControl1.LogLevel interface for the D-Bus
           name <i>destination</i>.)

           Added in version 247.

       <b>reset-failed [</b><i>PATTERN</i><b>...]</b>
           Reset the "failed" state of the specified units, or if no
           unit name is passed, reset the state of all units. When a
           unit fails in some way (i.e. process exiting with non-zero
           error code, terminating abnormally or timing out), it will
           automatically enter the "failed" state and its exit code and
           status is recorded for introspection by the administrator
           until the service is stopped/re-started or reset with this
           command.

           In addition to resetting the "failed" state of a unit it also
           resets various other per-unit properties: the start rate
           limit counter of all unit types is reset to zero, as is the
           restart counter of service units. Thus, if a unit's start
           limit (as configured with
           <i>StartLimitIntervalSec=</i>/<i>StartLimitBurst=</i>) is hit and the unit
           refuses to be started again, use this command to make it
           startable again.

       <b>whoami [</b><i>PID</i><b>...]</b>
           Returns the units the processes referenced by the given PIDs
           belong to (one per line). If no PID is specified returns the
           unit the <b>systemctl </b>command is invoked in.

           Added in version 254.

   <b>Unit File Commands</b>
       <b>list-unit-files </b>[<i>PATTERN...</i>]
           List unit files installed on the system, in combination with
           their enablement state (as reported by <b>is-enabled</b>). If one or
           more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only unit files whose name
           matches one of them are shown (patterns matching unit file
           system paths are not supported).

           Unlike <b>list-units </b>this command will list template units in
           addition to explicitly instantiated units.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>enable </b><i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>, <b>enable </b><i>PATH</i><b>...</b>
           Enable one or more units or unit instances. This will create
           a set of symlinks, as encoded in the [Install] sections of
           the indicated unit files. After the symlinks have been
           created, the system manager configuration is reloaded (in a
           way equivalent to <b>daemon-reload</b>), in order to ensure the
           changes are taken into account immediately. Note that this
           does <i>not</i> have the effect of also starting any of the units
           being enabled. If this is desired, combine this command with
           the <b>--now </b>switch, or invoke <b>start </b>with appropriate arguments
           later. Note that in case of unit instance enablement (i.e.
           enablement of units of the form foo@bar.service), symlinks
           named the same as instances are created in the unit
           configuration directory, however they point to the single
           template unit file they are instantiated from.

           This command expects either valid unit names (in which case
           various unit file directories are automatically searched for
           unit files with appropriate names), or absolute paths to unit
           files (in which case these files are read directly). If a
           specified unit file is located outside of the usual unit file
           directories, an additional symlink is created, linking it
           into the unit configuration path, thus ensuring it is found
           when requested by commands such as <b>start</b>. The file system
           where the linked unit files are located must be accessible
           when systemd is started (e.g. anything underneath /home/ or
           /var/ is not allowed, unless those directories are located on
           the root file system).

           This command will print the file system operations executed.
           This output may be suppressed by passing <b>--quiet</b>.

           Note that this operation creates only the symlinks suggested
           in the [Install] section of the unit files. While this
           command is the recommended way to manipulate the unit
           configuration directory, the administrator is free to make
           additional changes manually by placing or removing symlinks
           below this directory. This is particularly useful to create
           configurations that deviate from the suggested default
           installation. In this case, the administrator must make sure
           to invoke <b>daemon-reload </b>manually as necessary, in order to
           ensure the changes are taken into account.

           When using this operation on units without install
           information, a warning about it is shown.  <b>--no-warn </b>can be
           used to suppress the warning.

           Enabling units should not be confused with starting
           (activating) units, as done by the <b>start </b>command. Enabling
           and starting units is orthogonal: units may be enabled
           without being started and started without being enabled.
           Enabling simply hooks the unit into various suggested places
           (for example, so that the unit is automatically started on
           boot or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged in).
           Starting actually spawns the daemon process (in case of
           service units), or binds the socket (in case of socket
           units), and so on.

           Depending on whether <b>--system</b>, <b>--user</b>, <b>--runtime</b>, or <b>--global</b>
           is specified, this enables the unit for the system, for the
           calling user only, for only this boot of the system, or for
           all future logins of all users. Note that in the last case,
           no systemd daemon configuration is reloaded.

           Using <b>enable </b>on masked units is not supported and results in
           an error.

       <b>disable </b><i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>
           Disables one or more units. This removes all symlinks to the
           unit files backing the specified units from the unit
           configuration directory, and hence undoes any changes made by
           <b>enable </b>or <b>link</b>. Note that this removes <i>all</i> symlinks to
           matching unit files, including manually created symlinks, and
           not just those actually created by <b>enable </b>or <b>link</b>. Note that
           while <b>disable </b>undoes the effect of <b>enable</b>, the two commands
           are otherwise not symmetric, as <b>disable </b>may remove more
           symlinks than a prior <b>enable </b>invocation of the same unit
           created.

           This command expects valid unit names only, it does not
           accept paths to unit files.

           In addition to the units specified as arguments, all units
           are disabled that are listed in the <i>Also=</i> setting contained
           in the [Install] section of any of the unit files being
           operated on.

           This command implicitly reloads the system manager
           configuration after completing the operation. Note that this
           command does not implicitly stop the units that are being
           disabled. If this is desired, either combine this command
           with the <b>--now </b>switch, or invoke the <b>stop </b>command with
           appropriate arguments later.

           This command will print information about the file system
           operations (symlink removals) executed. This output may be
           suppressed by passing <b>--quiet</b>.

           If a unit gets disabled but its triggering units are still
           active, a warning containing the names of the triggering
           units is shown.  <b>--no-warn </b>can be used to suppress the
           warning.

           When this command is used with <b>--user</b>, the units being
           operated on might still be enabled in global scope, and thus
           get started automatically even after a successful disablement
           in user scope. In this case, a warning about it is shown,
           which can be suppressed using <b>--no-warn</b>.

           This command honors <b>--system</b>, <b>--user</b>, <b>--runtime</b>, <b>--global </b>and
           <b>--no-warn </b>in a similar way as <b>enable</b>.

           Added in version 238.

       <b>reenable </b><i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>
           Reenable one or more units, as specified on the command line.
           This is a combination of <b>disable </b>and <b>enable </b>and is useful to
           reset the symlinks a unit file is enabled with to the
           defaults configured in its [Install] section. This command
           expects a unit name only, it does not accept paths to unit
           files.

           Added in version 238.

       <b>preset </b><i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>
           Reset the enable/disable status one or more unit files, as
           specified on the command line, to the defaults configured in
           the preset policy files. This has the same effect as <b>disable</b>
           or <b>enable</b>, depending how the unit is listed in the preset
           files.

           Use <b>--preset-mode= </b>to control whether units shall be enabled
           and disabled, or only enabled, or only disabled.

           If the unit carries no install information, it will be
           silently ignored by this command.  <i>UNIT</i> must be the real unit
           name, any alias names are ignored silently.

           For more information on the preset policy format, see
           <a href="../man5/systemd.preset.5.html">systemd.preset(5)</a>.

           Added in version 238.

       <b>preset-all</b>
           Resets all installed unit files to the defaults configured in
           the preset policy file (see above).

           Use <b>--preset-mode= </b>to control whether units shall be enabled
           and disabled, or only enabled, or only disabled.

           Added in version 215.

       <b>is-enabled </b><i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>
           Checks whether any of the specified unit files are enabled
           (as with <b>enable</b>). Returns an exit code of 0 if at least one
           is enabled, non-zero otherwise. Prints the current enable
           status (see table). To suppress this output, use <b>--quiet</b>. To
           show installation targets, use <b>--full</b>.

       <b>mask </b><i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>
           Mask one or more units, as specified on the command line.
           This will link these unit files to /dev/null, making it
           impossible to start them. This is a stronger version of
           <b>disable</b>, since it prohibits all kinds of activation of the
           unit, including enablement and manual activation. Use this
           option with care. This honors the <b>--runtime </b>option to only
           mask temporarily until the next reboot of the system. The
           <b>--now </b>option may be used to ensure that the units are also
           stopped. This command expects valid unit names only, it does
           not accept unit file paths.

           Note that this will create a symlink under the unit's name in
           /etc/systemd/system/ (in case <b>--runtime </b>is not specified) or
           /run/systemd/system/ (in case <b>--runtime </b>is specified). If a
           matching unit file already exists under these directories
           this operation will hence fail. This means that the operation
           is primarily useful to mask units shipped by the vendor (as
           those are shipped in /usr/lib/systemd/system/ and not the
           aforementioned two directories), but typically doesn't work
           for units created locally (as those are typically placed
           precisely in the two aforementioned directories). Similar
           restrictions apply for <b>--user </b>mode, in which case the
           directories are below the user's home directory however.

           If a unit gets masked but its triggering units are still
           active, a warning containing the names of the triggering
           units is shown.  <b>--no-warn </b>can be used to suppress the
           warning.

           Added in version 238.

       <b>unmask </b><i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>
           Unmask one or more unit files, as specified on the command
           line. This will undo the effect of <b>mask</b>. This command expects
           valid unit names only, it does not accept unit file paths.

           Added in version 238.

       <b>link </b><i>PATH</i><b>...</b>
           Link a unit file that is not in the unit file search path
           into the unit file search path. This command expects an
           absolute path to a unit file. The effect of this may be
           undone with <b>disable</b>. The effect of this command is that a
           unit file is made available for commands such as <b>start</b>, even
           though it is not installed directly in the unit search path.
           The file system where the linked unit files are located must
           be accessible when systemd is started (e.g. anything
           underneath /home/ or /var/ is not allowed, unless those
           directories are located on the root file system).

           Added in version 233.

       <b>revert </b><i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>
           Revert one or more unit files to their vendor versions. This
           command removes drop-in configuration files that modify the
           specified units, as well as any user-configured unit file
           that overrides a matching vendor supplied unit file.
           Specifically, for a unit "foo.service" the matching
           directories "foo.service.d/" with all their contained files
           are removed, both below the persistent and runtime
           configuration directories (i.e. below /etc/systemd/system and
           /run/systemd/system); if the unit file has a vendor-supplied
           version (i.e. a unit file located below /usr/) any matching
           persistent or runtime unit file that overrides it is removed,
           too. Note that if a unit file has no vendor-supplied version
           (i.e. is only defined below /etc/systemd/system or
           /run/systemd/system, but not in a unit file stored below
           /usr/), then it is not removed. Also, if a unit is masked, it
           is unmasked.

           Effectively, this command may be used to undo all changes
           made with <b>systemctl edit</b>, <b>systemctl set-property </b>and
           <b>systemctl mask </b>and puts the original unit file with its
           settings back in effect.

           Added in version 230.

       <b>add-wants </b><i>TARGET UNIT</i><b>...</b>, <b>add-requires </b><i>TARGET UNIT</i><b>...</b>
           Adds "Wants=" or "Requires=" dependencies, respectively, to
           the specified <i>TARGET</i> for one or more units.

           This command honors <b>--system</b>, <b>--user</b>, <b>--runtime </b>and <b>--global</b>
           in a way similar to <b>enable</b>.

           Added in version 217.

       <b>edit </b><i>UNIT</i><b>...</b>
           Edit or replace a drop-in snippet or the main unit file, to
           extend or override the definition of the specified unit.

           Depending on whether <b>--system </b>(the default), <b>--user</b>, or
           <b>--global </b>is specified, this command will operate on the
           system unit files, unit files for the calling user, or the
           unit files shared between all users.

           The editor (see the "Environment" section below) is invoked
           on temporary files which will be written to the real location
           if the editor exits successfully. After the editing is
           finished, configuration is reloaded, equivalent to <b>systemctl</b>
           <b>daemon-reload --system </b>or <b>systemctl daemon-reload --user</b>. For
           <b>edit --global</b>, the reload is not performed and the edits will
           take effect only for subsequent logins (or after a reload is
           requested in a different way).

           If <b>--full </b>is specified, a replacement for the main unit file
           will be created or edited. Otherwise, a drop-in file will be
           created or edited.

           If <b>--drop-in= </b>is specified, the given drop-in file name will
           be used instead of the default override.conf.

           The unit must exist, i.e. its main unit file must be present.
           If <b>--force </b>is specified, this requirement is ignored and a
           new unit may be created (with <b>--full</b>), or a drop-in for a
           nonexistent unit may be created.

           If <b>--runtime </b>is specified, the changes will be made
           temporarily in /run/ and they will be lost on the next
           reboot.

           If <b>--stdin </b>is specified, the new contents will be read from
           standard input. In this mode, the old contents of the file
           are discarded.

           If the temporary file is empty upon exit, the modification of
           the related unit is canceled.

           Note that this command cannot be used to remotely edit units
           and that you cannot temporarily edit units which are in
           /etc/, since they take precedence over /run/.

           Added in version 218.

       <b>get-default</b>
           Return the default target to boot into. This returns the
           target unit name default.target is aliased (symlinked) to.

           Added in version 205.

       <b>set-default </b><i>TARGET</i>
           Set the default target to boot into. This sets (symlinks) the
           default.target alias to the given target unit.

           Added in version 205.

   <b>Machine Commands</b>
       <b>list-machines </b>[<i>PATTERN</i>...]
           List the host and all running local containers with their
           state. If one or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are specified, only containers
           matching one of them are shown.

           Added in version 212.

   <b>Job Commands</b>
       <b>list-jobs [</b><i>PATTERN...</i>]
           List jobs that are in progress. If one or more <i>PATTERN</i>s are
           specified, only jobs for units matching one of them are
           shown.

           When combined with <b>--after </b>or <b>--before </b>the list is augmented
           with information on which other job each job is waiting for,
           and which other jobs are waiting for it, see above.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>cancel [</b><i>JOB</i>...]
           Cancel one or more jobs specified on the command line by
           their numeric job IDs. If no job ID is specified, cancel all
           pending jobs.

           Added in version 233.

   <b>Environment Commands</b>
       <b>systemd </b>supports an environment block that is passed to processes
       the manager spawns. The names of the variables can contain ASCII
       letters, digits, and the underscore character. Variable names
       cannot be empty or start with a digit. In variable values, most
       characters are allowed, but the whole sequence must be valid
       UTF-8. (Note that control characters like newline (<b>NL</b>), tab
       (<b>TAB</b>), or the escape character (<b>ESC</b>), <i>are</i> valid ASCII and thus
       valid UTF-8). The total length of the environment block is
       limited to <b>_SC_ARG_MAX </b>value defined by <a href="../man3/sysconf.3.html">sysconf(3)</a>.

       <b>show-environment</b>
           Dump the systemd manager environment block. This is the
           environment block that is passed to all processes the manager
           spawns. The environment block will be dumped in
           straightforward form suitable for sourcing into most shells.
           If no special characters or whitespace is present in the
           variable values, no escaping is performed, and the
           assignments have the form "VARIABLE=value". If whitespace or
           characters which have special meaning to the shell are
           present, dollar-single-quote escaping is used, and
           assignments have the form "VARIABLE=$'value'". This syntax is
           known to be supported by <a href="bash.1.html">bash(1)</a>, <b>zsh</b>(1), <b>ksh</b>(1), and
           <b>busybox</b>(1)'s <b>ash</b>(1), but not <a href="dash.1.html">dash(1)</a> or <b>fish</b>(1).

           Note that this shows the <i>effective</i> block, i.e. the
           combination of environment variables configured via
           configuration files, environment generators and via IPC (i.e.
           via the <b>set-environment </b>described below). At the moment a
           unit process is forked off this combined environment block
           will be further combined with per-unit environment variables,
           which are not visible in this command.

       <b>set-environment </b><i>VARIABLE=VALUE</i><b>...</b>
           Set one or more service manager environment variables, as
           specified on the command line. This command will fail if
           variable names and values do not conform to the rules listed
           above.

           Note that this operates on an environment block separate from
           the environment block configured from service manager
           configuration and environment generators. Whenever a process
           is invoked the two blocks are combined (also incorporating
           any per-service environment variables), and passed to it. The
           <b>show-environment </b>verb will show the combination of the
           blocks, see above.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>unset-environment </b><i>VARIABLE</i><b>...</b>
           Unset one or more systemd manager environment variables. If
           only a variable name is specified, it will be removed
           regardless of its value. If a variable and a value are
           specified, the variable is only removed if it has the
           specified value.

           Note that this operates on an environment block separate from
           the environment block configured from service manager
           configuration and environment generators. Whenever a process
           is invoked the two blocks are combined (also incorporating
           any per-service environment variables), and passed to it. The
           <b>show-environment </b>verb will show the combination of the
           blocks, see above. Note that this means this command cannot
           be used to unset environment variables defined in the service
           manager configuration files or via generators.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>import-environment </b><i>VARIABLE...</i>
           Import all, one or more environment variables set on the
           client into the systemd manager environment block. If a list
           of environment variable names is passed, client-side values
           are then imported into the manager's environment block. If
           any names are not valid environment variable names or have
           invalid values according to the rules described above, an
           error is raised. If no arguments are passed, the entire
           environment block inherited by the <b>systemctl </b>process is
           imported. In this mode, any inherited invalid environment
           variables are quietly ignored.

           Importing of the full inherited environment block (calling
           this command without any arguments) is deprecated. A shell
           will set dozens of variables which only make sense locally
           and are only meant for processes which are descendants of the
           shell. Such variables in the global environment block are
           confusing to other processes.

           Added in version 209.

   <b>Manager State Commands</b>
       <b>daemon-reload</b>
           Reload the systemd manager configuration. This will rerun all
           generators (see <a href="../man7/systemd.generator.7.html">systemd.generator(7)</a>), reload all unit files,
           and recreate the entire dependency tree. While the daemon is
           being reloaded, all sockets systemd listens on behalf of user
           configuration will stay accessible.

           This command should not be confused with the <b>reload </b>command.

       <b>daemon-reexec</b>
           Reexecute the systemd manager. This will serialize the
           manager state, reexecute the process and deserialize the
           state again. This command is of little use except for
           debugging and package upgrades. Sometimes, it might be
           helpful as a heavy-weight <b>daemon-reload</b>. While the daemon is
           being reexecuted, all sockets systemd listening on behalf of
           user configuration will stay accessible.

       <b>log-level </b>[<i>LEVEL</i>]
           If no argument is given, print the current log level of the
           manager. If an optional argument <i>LEVEL</i> is provided, then the
           command changes the current log level of the manager to <i>LEVEL</i>
           (accepts the same values as <b>--log-level= </b>described in
           <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>).

           Added in version 244.

       <b>log-target </b>[<i>TARGET</i>]
           If no argument is given, print the current log target of the
           manager. If an optional argument <i>TARGET</i> is provided, then the
           command changes the current log target of the manager to
           <i>TARGET</i> (accepts the same values as <b>--log-target=</b>, described
           in <a href="systemd.1.html">systemd(1)</a>).

           Added in version 244.

       <b>service-watchdogs </b>[yes|no]
           If no argument is given, print the current state of service
           runtime watchdogs of the manager. If an optional boolean
           argument is provided, then globally enables or disables the
           service runtime watchdogs (<b>WatchdogSec=</b>) and emergency
           actions (e.g.  <b>OnFailure= </b>or <b>StartLimitAction=</b>); see
           <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>. The hardware watchdog is not affected by
           this setting.

           Added in version 244.

   <b>System Commands</b>
       <b>is-system-running</b>
           Checks whether the system is operational. This returns
           success (exit code 0) when the system is fully up and
           running, specifically not in startup, shutdown or maintenance
           mode, and with no failed services. Failure is returned
           otherwise (exit code non-zero). In addition, the current
           state is printed in a short string to standard output, see
           the table below. Use <b>--quiet </b>to suppress this output.

           Use <b>--wait </b>to wait until the boot process is completed before
           printing the current state and returning the appropriate
           error status. If <b>--wait </b>is in use, states <i>initializing</i> or
           <i>starting</i> will not be reported, instead the command will block
           until a later state (such as <i>running</i> or <i>degraded</i>) is reached.

       <b>default</b>
           Enter default mode. This is equivalent to <b>systemctl isolate</b>
           <b>default.target</b>. This operation is blocking by default, use
           <b>--no-block </b>to request asynchronous behavior.

       <b>rescue</b>
           Enter rescue mode. This is equivalent to <b>systemctl isolate</b>
           <b>rescue.target</b>. This operation is blocking by default, use
           <b>--no-block </b>to request asynchronous behavior.

       <b>emergency</b>
           Enter emergency mode. This is equivalent to <b>systemctl isolate</b>
           <b>emergency.target</b>. This operation is blocking by default, use
           <b>--no-block </b>to request asynchronous behavior.

       <b>halt</b>
           Shut down and halt the system. This is mostly equivalent to
           <b>systemctl start halt.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly</b>
           <b>--no-block</b>, but also prints a wall message to all users. This
           command is asynchronous; it will return after the halt
           operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.
           Note that this operation will simply halt the OS kernel after
           shutting down, leaving the hardware powered on. Use <b>systemctl</b>
           <b>poweroff </b>for powering off the system (see below).

           If combined with <b>--force</b>, shutdown of all running services is
           skipped, however all processes are killed and all file
           systems are unmounted or mounted read-only, immediately
           followed by the system halt. If <b>--force </b>is specified twice,
           the operation is immediately executed without terminating any
           processes or unmounting any file systems. This may result in
           data loss. Note that when <b>--force </b>is specified twice the halt
           operation is executed by <b>systemctl </b>itself, and the system
           manager is not contacted. This means the command should
           succeed even when the system manager has crashed.

           If combined with <b>--when=</b>, shutdown will be scheduled after
           the given timestamp. And <b>--when=cancel </b>will cancel the
           shutdown.

       <b>poweroff</b>
           Shut down and power-off the system. This is mostly equivalent
           to <b>systemctl start poweroff.target</b>
           <b>--job-mode=replace-irreversibly --no-block</b>, but also prints a
           wall message to all users. This command is asynchronous; it
           will return after the power-off operation is enqueued,
           without waiting for it to complete.

           This command honors <b>--force </b>and <b>--when= </b>in a similar way as
           <b>halt</b>.

       <b>reboot</b>
           Shut down and reboot the system.

           This command mostly equivalent to <b>systemctl start</b>
           <b>reboot.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly --no-block</b>, but
           also prints a wall message to all users. This command is
           asynchronous; it will return after the reboot operation is
           enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.

           If the switch <b>--reboot-argument= </b>is given, it will be passed
           as the optional argument to the <a href="../man2/reboot.2.html">reboot(2)</a> system call.

           Options <b>--boot-loader-entry=</b>, <b>--boot-loader-menu=</b>, and
           <b>--firmware-setup </b>can be used to select what to do <i>after</i> the
           reboot. See the descriptions of those options for details.

           This command honors <b>--force </b>and <b>--when= </b>in a similar way as
           <b>halt</b>.

           If a new kernel has been loaded via <b>kexec --load</b>, a <b>kexec</b>
           will be performed instead of a reboot, unless
           "SYSTEMCTL_SKIP_AUTO_KEXEC=1" has been set. If a new root
           file system has been set up on "/run/nextroot/", a
           <b>soft-reboot </b>will be performed instead of a reboot, unless
           "SYSTEMCTL_SKIP_AUTO_SOFT_REBOOT=1" has been set.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>kexec</b>
           Shut down and reboot the system via <b>kexec</b>. This command will
           load a kexec kernel if one wasn't loaded yet or fail. A
           kernel may be loaded earlier by a separate step, this is
           particularly useful if a custom initrd or additional kernel
           command line options are desired. The <b>--force </b>can be used to
           continue without a kexec kernel, i.e. to perform a normal
           reboot. The final reboot step is equivalent to <b>systemctl</b>
           <b>start kexec.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly</b>
           <b>--no-block</b>.

           To load a kernel, an enumeration is performed following the
           <b>Boot Loader Specification</b>[1], and the default boot entry is
           loaded. For this step to succeed, the system must be using
           UEFI and the boot loader entries must be configured
           appropriately.  <b>bootctl list </b>may be used to list boot
           entries, see <a href="bootctl.1.html">bootctl(1)</a>.

           This command is asynchronous; it will return after the reboot
           operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.

           This command honors <b>--force </b>and <b>--when= </b>similarly to <b>halt</b>.

           If a new kernel has been loaded via <b>kexec --load</b>, a <b>kexec</b>
           will be performed when <b>reboot </b>is invoked, unless
           "SYSTEMCTL_SKIP_AUTO_KEXEC=1" has been set.

       <b>soft-reboot</b>
           Shut down and reboot userspace. This is equivalent to
           <b>systemctl start soft-reboot.target</b>
           <b>--job-mode=replace-irreversibly --no-block</b>. This command is
           asynchronous; it will return after the reboot operation is
           enqueued, without waiting for it to complete.

           This command honors <b>--force </b>and <b>--when= </b>in a similar way as
           <b>halt</b>.

           This operation only reboots userspace, leaving the kernel
           running. See <a href="../man8/systemd-soft-reboot.service.8.html">systemd-soft-reboot.service(8)</a> for details.

           If a new root file system has been set up on
           "/run/nextroot/", a <b>soft-reboot </b>will be performed when <b>reboot</b>
           is invoked, unless "SYSTEMCTL_SKIP_AUTO_SOFT_REBOOT=1" has
           been set.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>exit </b>[<i>EXIT_CODE</i>]
           Ask the service manager to quit. This is only supported for
           user service managers (i.e. in conjunction with the <b>--user</b>
           option) or in containers and is equivalent to <b>poweroff</b>
           otherwise. This command is asynchronous; it will return after
           the exit operation is enqueued, without waiting for it to
           complete.

           The service manager will exit with the specified exit code,
           if <i>EXIT_CODE</i> is passed.

           Added in version 227.

       <b>switch-root </b>[<i>ROOT</i> [<i>INIT</i>]]
           Switches to a different root directory and executes a new
           system manager process below it. This is intended for use in
           the initrd, and will transition from the initrd's system
           manager process (a.k.a. "init" process, PID 1) to the main
           system manager process which is loaded from the actual host
           root files system. This call takes two arguments: the
           directory that is to become the new root directory, and the
           path to the new system manager binary below it to execute as
           PID 1. If both are omitted or the former is an empty string
           it defaults to /sysroot/. If the latter is omitted or is an
           empty string, a systemd binary will automatically be searched
           for and used as service manager. If the system manager path
           is omitted, equal to the empty string or identical to the
           path to the systemd binary, the state of the initrd's system
           manager process is passed to the main system manager, which
           allows later introspection of the state of the services
           involved in the initrd boot phase.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>sleep</b>
           Put the system to sleep, through <b>suspend</b>, <b>hibernate</b>,
           <b>hybrid-sleep</b>, or <b>suspend-then-hibernate</b>. The sleep operation
           to use is automatically selected by
           <a href="../man8/systemd-logind.service.8.html">systemd-logind.service(8)</a>. By default, <b>suspend-then-hibernate</b>
           is used, and falls back to <b>suspend </b>and then <b>hibernate </b>if not
           supported. Refer to <i>SleepOperation=</i> setting in <a href="../man5/logind.conf.5.html">logind.conf(5)</a>
           for more details. This command is asynchronous, and will
           return after the sleep operation is successfully enqueued. It
           will not wait for the sleep/resume cycle to complete.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>suspend</b>
           Suspend the system. This will trigger activation of the
           special target unit suspend.target. This command is
           asynchronous, and will return after the suspend operation is
           successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the
           suspend/resume cycle to complete.

           If <b>--force </b>is specified, and <b>systemd-logind </b>returned error
           for the operation, the error will be ignored and the
           operation will be tried again directly through starting the
           target unit.

       <b>hibernate</b>
           Hibernate the system. This will trigger activation of the
           special target unit hibernate.target. This command is
           asynchronous, and will return after the hibernation operation
           is successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the
           hibernate/thaw cycle to complete.

           This command honors <b>--force </b>in the same way as <b>suspend</b>.

       <b>hybrid-sleep</b>
           Hibernate and suspend the system. This will trigger
           activation of the special target unit hybrid-sleep.target.
           This command is asynchronous, and will return after the
           hybrid sleep operation is successfully enqueued. It will not
           wait for the sleep/wake-up cycle to complete.

           This command honors <b>--force </b>in the same way as <b>suspend</b>.

           Added in version 196.

       <b>suspend-then-hibernate</b>
           Suspend the system and hibernate it when the battery is low,
           or when the delay specified in systemd-sleep.conf elapsed.
           This will trigger activation of the special target unit
           suspend-then-hibernate.target. This command is asynchronous,
           and will return after the hybrid sleep operation is
           successfully enqueued. It will not wait for the sleep/wake-up
           or hibernate/thaw cycle to complete.

           This command honors <b>--force </b>in the same way as <b>suspend</b>.

           Added in version 240.

   <b>Parameter Syntax</b>
       Unit commands listed above take either a single unit name
       (designated as <i>UNIT</i>), or multiple unit specifications (designated
       as <i>PATTERN</i>...). In the first case, the unit name with or without
       a suffix must be given. If the suffix is not specified (unit name
       is "abbreviated"), systemctl will append a suitable suffix,
       ".service" by default, and a type-specific suffix in case of
       commands which operate only on specific unit types. For example,

           # systemctl start sshd

       and

           # systemctl start sshd.service

       are equivalent, as are

           # systemctl isolate default

       and

           # systemctl isolate default.target

       Note that (absolute) paths to device nodes are automatically
       converted to device unit names, and other (absolute) paths to
       mount unit names.

           # systemctl status /dev/sda
           # systemctl status /home

       are equivalent to:

           # systemctl status dev-sda.device
           # systemctl status home.mount

       In the second case, shell-style globs will be matched against the
       primary names of all units currently in memory; literal unit
       names, with or without a suffix, will be treated as in the first
       case. This means that literal unit names always refer to exactly
       one unit, but globs may match zero units and this is not
       considered an error.

       Glob patterns use <a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch(3)</a>, so normal shell-style globbing
       rules are used, and "*", "?", "[]" may be used. See <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob(7)</a> for
       more details. The patterns are matched against the primary names
       of units currently in memory, and patterns which do not match
       anything are silently skipped. For example:

           # systemctl stop "sshd@*.service"

       will stop all sshd@.service instances. Note that alias names of
       units, and units that aren't in memory are not considered for
       glob expansion.

       For unit file commands, the specified <i>UNIT</i> should be the name of
       the unit file (possibly abbreviated, see above), or the absolute
       path to the unit file:

           # systemctl enable foo.service

       or

           # systemctl link /path/to/foo.service
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--type=</b>
           The argument is a comma-separated list of unit types such as
           <b>service </b>and <b>socket</b>. When units are listed with <b>list-units</b>,
           <b>list-dependencies</b>, <b>show</b>, or <b>status</b>, only units of the
           specified types will be shown. By default, units of all types
           are shown.

           As a special case, if one of the arguments is <b>help</b>, a list of
           allowed values will be printed and the program will exit.

       <b>--state=</b>
           The argument is a comma-separated list of unit LOAD, SUB, or
           ACTIVE states. When listing units with <b>list-units</b>,
           <b>list-dependencies</b>, <b>show </b>or <b>status</b>, show only those in the
           specified states. Use <b>--state=failed </b>or <b>--failed </b>to show only
           failed units.

           As a special case, if one of the arguments is <b>help</b>, a list of
           allowed values will be printed and the program will exit.

           Added in version 206.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--property=</b>
           When showing unit/job/manager properties with the <b>show</b>
           command, limit display to properties specified in the
           argument. The argument should be a comma-separated list of
           property names, such as "MainPID". Unless specified, all
           known properties are shown. If specified more than once, all
           properties with the specified names are shown. Shell
           completion is implemented for property names.

           For the manager itself, <b>systemctl show </b>will show all
           available properties, most of which are derived or closely
           match the options described in <a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf(5)</a>.

           Properties for units vary by unit type, so showing any unit
           (even a non-existent one) is a way to list properties
           pertaining to this type. Similarly, showing any job will list
           properties pertaining to all jobs. Properties for units are
           documented in <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a>, and the pages for individual
           unit types <a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service(5)</a>, <a href="../man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket(5)</a>, etc.

       <b>-P</b>
           Equivalent to <b>--value --property=</b>, i.e. shows the value of
           the property without the property name or "=". Note that
           using <b>-P </b>once will also affect all properties listed with
           <b>-p</b>/<b>--property=</b>.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
           When listing units with <b>list-units</b>, also show inactive units
           and units which are following other units. When showing
           unit/job/manager properties, show all properties regardless
           whether they are set or not.

           To list all units installed in the file system, use the
           <b>list-unit-files </b>command instead.

           When listing units with <b>list-dependencies</b>, recursively show
           dependencies of all dependent units (by default only
           dependencies of target units are shown).

           When used with <b>status</b>, show journal messages in full, even if
           they include unprintable characters or are very long. By
           default, fields with unprintable characters are abbreviated
           as "blob data". (Note that the pager may escape unprintable
           characters again.)

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--recursive</b>
           When listing units, also show units of local containers.
           Units of local containers will be prefixed with the container
           name, separated by a single colon character (":").

           Added in version 212.

       <b>--reverse</b>
           Show reverse dependencies between units with
           <b>list-dependencies</b>, i.e. follow dependencies of type
           <i>WantedBy=</i>, <i>RequiredBy=</i>, <i>UpheldBy=</i>, <i>PartOf=</i>, <i>BoundBy=</i>, instead
           of <i>Wants=</i> and similar.

           Added in version 203.

       <b>--after</b>
           With <b>list-dependencies</b>, show the units that are ordered
           before the specified unit. In other words, recursively list
           units following the <i>After=</i> dependency.

           Note that any <i>After=</i> dependency is automatically mirrored to
           create a <i>Before=</i> dependency. Temporal dependencies may be
           specified explicitly, but are also created implicitly for
           units which are <i>WantedBy=</i> targets (see <a href="../man5/systemd.target.5.html">systemd.target(5)</a>),
           and as a result of other directives (for example
           <i>RequiresMountsFor=</i>). Both explicitly and implicitly
           introduced dependencies are shown with <b>list-dependencies</b>.

           When passed to the <b>list-jobs </b>command, for each printed job
           show which other jobs are waiting for it. May be combined
           with <b>--before </b>to show both the jobs waiting for each job as
           well as all jobs each job is waiting for.

           Added in version 203.

       <b>--before</b>
           With <b>list-dependencies</b>, show the units that are ordered after
           the specified unit. In other words, recursively list units
           following the <i>Before=</i> dependency.

           When passed to the <b>list-jobs </b>command, for each printed job
           show which other jobs it is waiting for. May be combined with
           <b>--after </b>to show both the jobs waiting for each job as well as
           all jobs each job is waiting for.

           Added in version 212.

       <b>--with-dependencies</b>
           When used with <b>status</b>, <b>cat</b>, <b>list-units</b>, and <b>list-unit-files</b>,
           those commands print all specified units and the dependencies
           of those units.

           Options <b>--reverse</b>, <b>--after</b>, <b>--before </b>may be used to change
           what types of dependencies are shown.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--full</b>
           Do not ellipsize unit names, process tree entries, journal
           output, or truncate unit descriptions in the output of
           <b>status</b>, <b>list-units</b>, <b>list-jobs</b>, and <b>list-timers</b>.

           Also, show installation targets in the output of <b>is-enabled</b>.

       <b>--value</b>
           When printing properties with <b>show</b>, only print the value, and
           skip the property name and "=". Also see option <b>-P </b>above.

           Added in version 230.

       <b>--show-types</b>
           When showing sockets, show the type of the socket.

           Added in version 202.

       <b>--job-mode=</b>
           When queuing a new job, this option controls how to deal with
           already queued jobs. It takes one of "fail", "replace",
           "replace-irreversibly", "isolate", "ignore-dependencies",
           "ignore-requirements", "flush", "triggering", or
           "restart-dependencies". Defaults to "replace", except when
           the <b>isolate </b>command is used which implies the "isolate" job
           mode.

           If "fail" is specified and a requested operation conflicts
           with a pending job (more specifically: causes an already
           pending start job to be reversed into a stop job or vice
           versa), cause the operation to fail.

           If "replace" (the default) is specified, any conflicting
           pending job will be replaced, as necessary.

           If "replace-irreversibly" is specified, operate like
           "replace", but also mark the new jobs as irreversible. This
           prevents future conflicting transactions from replacing these
           jobs (or even being enqueued while the irreversible jobs are
           still pending). Irreversible jobs can still be cancelled
           using the <b>cancel </b>command. This job mode should be used on any
           transaction which pulls in shutdown.target.

           "isolate" is only valid for start operations and causes all
           other units to be stopped when the specified unit is started.
           This mode is always used when the <b>isolate </b>command is used.

           "flush" will cause all queued jobs to be canceled when the
           new job is enqueued.

           If "ignore-dependencies" is specified, then all unit
           dependencies are ignored for this new job and the operation
           is executed immediately. If passed, no required units of the
           unit passed will be pulled in, and no ordering dependencies
           will be honored. This is mostly a debugging and rescue tool
           for the administrator and should not be used by applications.

           "ignore-requirements" is similar to "ignore-dependencies",
           but only causes the requirement dependencies to be ignored,
           the ordering dependencies will still be honored.

           "triggering" may only be used with <b>systemctl stop</b>. In this
           mode, the specified unit and any active units that trigger it
           are stopped. See the discussion of <i>Triggers=</i> in
           <a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit(5)</a> for more information about triggering units.

           "restart-dependencies" may only be used with <b>systemctl start</b>.
           In this mode, dependencies of the specified unit will receive
           restart propagation, as if a restart job had been enqueued
           for the unit.

           Added in version 209.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--show-transaction</b>
           When enqueuing a unit job (for example as effect of a
           <b>systemctl start </b>invocation or similar), show brief
           information about all jobs enqueued, covering both the
           requested job and any added because of unit dependencies.
           Note that the output will only include jobs immediately part
           of the transaction requested. It is possible that service
           start-up program code run as effect of the enqueued jobs
           might request further jobs to be pulled in. This means that
           completion of the listed jobs might ultimately entail more
           jobs than the listed ones.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>--fail</b>
           Shorthand for <b>--job-mode=</b>fail.

           When used with the <b>kill </b>command, if no units were killed, the
           operation results in an error.

           Added in version 227.

       <b>--check-inhibitors=</b>
           When system shutdown or sleep state is requested, this option
           controls checking of inhibitor locks. It takes one of "auto",
           "yes" or "no". Defaults to "auto", which will behave like
           "yes" for interactive invocations (i.e. from a TTY) and "no"
           for non-interactive invocations.  "yes" lets the request
           respect inhibitor locks.  "no" lets the request ignore
           inhibitor locks.

           Applications can establish inhibitor locks to prevent certain
           important operations (such as CD burning) from being
           interrupted by system shutdown or sleep. Any user may take
           these locks and privileged users may override these locks. If
           any locks are taken, shutdown and sleep state requests will
           normally fail (unless privileged). However, if "no" is
           specified or "auto" is specified on a non-interactive
           requests, the operation will be attempted. If locks are
           present, the operation may require additional privileges.

           Option <b>--force </b>provides another way to override inhibitors.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>-i</b>
           Shortcut for <b>--check-inhibitors=no</b>.

           Added in version 198.

       <b>--dry-run</b>
           Just print what would be done. Currently supported by verbs
           <b>halt</b>, <b>poweroff</b>, <b>reboot</b>, <b>kexec</b>, <b>suspend</b>, <b>hibernate</b>,
           <b>hybrid-sleep</b>, <b>suspend-then-hibernate</b>, <b>default</b>, <b>rescue</b>,
           <b>emergency</b>, and <b>exit</b>.

           Added in version 236.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Suppress printing of the results of various commands and also
           the hints about truncated log lines. This does not suppress
           output of commands for which the printed output is the only
           result (like <b>show</b>). Errors are always printed.

       <b>--no-warn</b>
           Don't generate the warnings shown by default in the following
           cases:

           •   when <b>systemctl </b>is invoked without procfs mounted on
               /proc/,

           •   when using <b>enable </b>or <b>disable </b>on units without install
               information (i.e. don't have or have an empty [Install]
               section),

           •   when using <b>disable </b>combined with <b>--user </b>on units that are
               enabled in global scope,

           •   when a <b>stop</b>-ped, <b>disable</b>-d, or <b>mask</b>-ed unit still has
               active triggering units,

           •   when a unit file is changed and requires <b>daemon-reload</b>.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--no-block</b>
           Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to
           finish. If this is not specified, the job will be verified,
           enqueued and <b>systemctl </b>will wait until the unit's start-up is
           completed. By passing this argument, it is only verified and
           enqueued. This option may not be combined with <b>--wait</b>.

       <b>--wait</b>
           When used with <b>start </b>or <b>restart</b>, synchronously wait for
           started units to terminate again. This option may not be
           combined with <b>--no-block</b>. Note that this will wait forever if
           any given unit never terminates (by itself or by getting
           stopped explicitly); particularly services which use
           "RemainAfterExit=yes".

           When used with <b>is-system-running</b>, wait until the boot process
           is completed before returning.

           When used with <b>kill</b>, wait until the signalled units
           terminate. Note that this will wait forever if any given unit
           never terminates.

           Added in version 232.

       <b>--user</b>
           Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than
           the service manager of the system.

       <b>--system</b>
           Talk to the service manager of the system. This is the
           implied default.

       <b>--failed</b>
           List units in failed state. This is equivalent to
           <b>--state=failed</b>.

           Added in version 233.

       <b>--no-wall</b>
           Do not send wall message before halt, power-off and reboot.

       <b>--global</b>
           When used with <b>enable </b>and <b>disable</b>, operate on the global user
           configuration directory, thus enabling or disabling a unit
           file globally for all future logins of all users.

       <b>--no-reload</b>
           When used with <b>enable </b>and <b>disable</b>, do not implicitly reload
           daemon configuration after executing the changes.

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           When used with <b>start </b>and related commands, disables asking
           for passwords. Background services may require input of a
           password or passphrase string, for example to unlock system
           hard disks or cryptographic certificates. Unless this option
           is specified and the command is invoked from a terminal,
           <b>systemctl </b>will query the user on the terminal for the
           necessary secrets. Use this option to switch this behavior
           off. In this case, the password must be supplied by some
           other means (for example graphical password agents) or the
           service might fail. This also disables querying the user for
           authentication for privileged operations.

       <b>--kill-whom=</b>
           When used with <b>kill</b>, choose which processes to send a UNIX
           process signal to. Must be one of <b>main</b>, <b>control </b>or <b>all </b>to
           select whether to kill only the main process, the control
           process or all processes of the unit. The main process of the
           unit is the one that defines the life-time of it. A control
           process of a unit is one that is invoked by the manager to
           induce state changes of it. For example, all processes
           started due to the <i>ExecStartPre=</i>, <i>ExecStop=</i> or <i>ExecReload=</i>
           settings of service units are control processes. Note that
           there is only one control process per unit at a time, as only
           one state change is executed at a time. For services of type
           <i>Type=forking</i>, the initial process started by the manager for
           <i>ExecStart=</i> is a control process, while the process ultimately
           forked off by that one is then considered the main process of
           the unit (if it can be determined). This is different for
           service units of other types, where the process forked off by
           the manager for <i>ExecStart=</i> is always the main process itself.
           A service unit consists of zero or one main process, zero or
           one control process plus any number of additional processes.
           Not all unit types manage processes of these types however.
           For example, for mount units, control processes are defined
           (which are the invocations of /usr/bin/mount and
           /usr/bin/umount), but no main process is defined. If omitted,
           defaults to <b>all</b>.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--kill-value=</b><i>INT</i>
           If used with the <b>kill </b>command, enqueues a signal along with
           the specified integer value parameter to the specified
           process(es). This operation is only available for POSIX
           Realtime Signals (i.e.  <b>--signal=SIGRTMIN+...  </b>or
           <b>--signal=SIGRTMAX-...</b>), and ensures the signals are generated
           via the <a href="../man3/sigqueue.3.html">sigqueue(3)</a> system call, rather than <b>kill</b>(3). The
           specified value must be a 32-bit signed integer, and may be
           specified either in decimal, in hexadecimal (if prefixed with
           "0x"), octal (if prefixed with "0o") or binary (if prefixed
           with "0b")

           If this option is used the signal will only be enqueued on
           the control or main process of the unit, never on other
           processes belonging to the unit, i.e.  <b>--kill-whom=all </b>will
           only affect main and control processes but no other
           processes.

           Added in version 254.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--signal=</b>
           When used with <b>kill</b>, choose which signal to send to selected
           processes. Must be one of the well-known signal specifiers
           such as <b>SIGTERM</b>, <b>SIGINT </b>or <b>SIGSTOP</b>. If omitted, defaults to
           <b>SIGTERM</b>.

           The special value "help" will list the known values and the
           program will exit immediately, and the special value "list"
           will list known values along with the numerical signal
           numbers and the program will exit immediately.

       <b>--what=</b>
           Select what type of per-unit resources to remove when the
           <b>clean </b>command is invoked, see above. Takes one of
           <b>configuration</b>, <b>state</b>, <b>cache</b>, <b>logs</b>, <b>runtime</b>, <b>fdstore </b>to select
           the type of resource. This option may be specified more than
           once, in which case all specified resource types are removed.
           Also accepts the special value <b>all </b>as a shortcut for
           specifying all six resource types. If this option is not
           specified defaults to the combination of <b>cache</b>, <b>runtime </b>and
           <b>fdstore</b>, i.e. the three kinds of resources that are generally
           considered to be redundant and can be reconstructed on next
           invocation. Note that the explicit removal of the <b>fdstore</b>
           resource type is only useful if the
           <i>FileDescriptorStorePreserve=</i> option is enabled, since the
           file descriptor store is otherwise cleaned automatically when
           the unit is stopped.

           Added in version 243.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
           When used with <b>enable</b>, overwrite any existing conflicting
           symlinks.

           When used with <b>edit</b>, create all of the specified units which
           do not already exist.

           When used with <b>suspend</b>, <b>hibernate</b>, <b>hybrid-sleep</b>, or
           <b>suspend-then-hibernate</b>, the error returned by <b>systemd-logind</b>
           will be ignored, and the operation will be performed directly
           through starting the corresponding units.

           When used with <b>halt</b>, <b>poweroff</b>, <b>reboot</b>, or <b>kexec</b>, execute the
           selected operation without shutting down all units. However,
           all processes will be killed forcibly and all file systems
           are unmounted or remounted read-only. This is hence a drastic
           but relatively safe option to request an immediate reboot. If
           <b>--force </b>is specified twice for these operations (with the
           exception of <b>kexec</b>), they will be executed immediately,
           without terminating any processes or unmounting any file
           systems.

               <b>Warning</b>
               Specifying <b>--force </b>twice with any of these operations
               might result in data loss. Note that when <b>--force </b>is
               specified twice the selected operation is executed by
               <b>systemctl </b>itself, and the system manager is not
               contacted. This means the command should succeed even
               when the system manager has crashed.

       <b>--message=</b>
           When used with <b>halt</b>, <b>poweroff </b>or <b>reboot</b>, set a short message
           explaining the reason for the operation. The message will be
           logged together with the default shutdown message.

           Added in version 225.

       <b>--now</b>
           When used with <b>enable</b>, the units will also be started. When
           used with <b>disable </b>or <b>mask</b>, the units will also be stopped.
           The start or stop operation is only carried out when the
           respective enable or disable operation has been successful.

           Added in version 220.

       <b>--root=</b>
           When used with <b>enable</b>/<b>disable</b>/<b>is-enabled </b>(and related
           commands), use the specified root path when looking for unit
           files. If this option is present, <b>systemctl </b>will operate on
           the file system directly, instead of communicating with the
           <b>systemd </b>daemon to carry out changes.

       <b>--image=</b><i>image</i>
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If
           specified, all operations are applied to file system in the
           indicated disk image. This option is similar to <b>--root=</b>, but
           operates on file systems stored in disk images or block
           devices. The disk image should either contain just a file
           system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table,
           following the <b>Discoverable Partitions Specification</b>[2]. For
           further information on supported disk images, see
           <a href="systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn(1)</a>'s switch of the same name.

           Added in version 252.

       <b>--image-policy=</b><i>policy</i>
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per
           <a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy(7)</a>. The policy is enforced when
           operating on the disk image specified via <b>--image=</b>, see
           above. If not specified defaults to the "*" policy, i.e. all
           recognized file systems in the image are used.

       <b>--runtime</b>
           When used with <b>enable</b>, <b>disable</b>, <b>edit</b>, (and related commands),
           make changes only temporarily, so that they are lost on the
           next reboot. This will have the effect that changes are not
           made in subdirectories of /etc/ but in /run/, with identical
           immediate effects, however, since the latter is lost on
           reboot, the changes are lost too.

           Similarly, when used with <b>set-property</b>, make changes only
           temporarily, so that they are lost on the next reboot.

       <b>--preset-mode=</b>
           Takes one of "full" (the default), "enable-only",
           "disable-only". When used with the <b>preset </b>or <b>preset-all</b>
           commands, controls whether units shall be disabled and
           enabled according to the preset rules, or only enabled, or
           only disabled.

           Added in version 215.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--lines=</b>
           When used with <b>status</b>, controls the number of journal lines
           to show, counting from the most recent ones. Takes a positive
           integer argument, or 0 to disable journal output. Defaults to
           10.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output=</b>
           When used with <b>status</b>, controls the formatting of the journal
           entries that are shown. For the available choices, see
           <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a>. Defaults to "short".

       <b>--firmware-setup</b>
           When used with the <b>reboot</b>, <b>poweroff</b>, or <b>halt </b>command,
           indicate to the system's firmware to reboot into the firmware
           setup interface for the next boot. Note that this
           functionality is not available on all systems.

           Added in version 220.

       <b>--boot-loader-menu=</b><i>timeout</i>
           When used with the <b>reboot</b>, <b>poweroff</b>, or <b>halt </b>command,
           indicate to the system's boot loader to show the boot loader
           menu on the following boot. Takes a time value as parameter —
           indicating the menu timeout. Pass zero in order to disable
           the menu timeout. Note that not all boot loaders support this
           functionality.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>--boot-loader-entry=</b><i>ID</i>
           When used with the <b>reboot</b>, <b>poweroff</b>, or <b>halt </b>command,
           indicate to the system's boot loader to boot into a specific
           boot loader entry on the following boot. Takes a boot loader
           entry identifier as argument, or "help" in order to list
           available entries. Note that not all boot loaders support
           this functionality.

           Added in version 242.

       <b>--reboot-argument=</b>
           This switch is used with <b>reboot</b>. The value is architecture
           and firmware specific. As an example, "recovery" might be
           used to trigger system recovery, and "fota" might be used to
           trigger a “firmware over the air” update.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>--plain</b>
           When used with <b>list-dependencies</b>, <b>list-units </b>or
           <b>list-machines</b>, the output is printed as a list instead of a
           tree, and the bullet circles are omitted.

           Added in version 203.

       <b>--timestamp=</b>
           Change the format of printed timestamps. The following values
           may be used:

           <b>pretty </b>(this is the default)
               "Day YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ"

               Added in version 248.

           <b>unix</b>
               "@seconds-since-the-epoch"

               Added in version 251.

           <b>us</b>, <b>μs</b>
               "Day YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.UUUUUU TZ"

               Added in version 248.

           <b>utc</b>
               "Day YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC"

               Added in version 248.

           <b>us+utc</b>, <b>μs+utc</b>
               "Day YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.UUUUUU UTC"

               Added in version 248.

           Added in version 247.

       <b>--mkdir</b>
           When used with <b>bind</b>, creates the destination file or
           directory before applying the bind mount. Note that even
           though the name of this option suggests that it is suitable
           only for directories, this option also creates the
           destination file node to mount over if the object to mount is
           not a directory, but a regular file, device node, socket or
           FIFO.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--marked</b>
           Only allowed with <b>reload-or-restart</b>. Enqueues restart jobs
           for all units that have the "needs-restart" mark, and reload
           jobs for units that have the "needs-reload" mark. When a unit
           marked for reload does not support reload, restart will be
           queued. Those properties can be set using <b>set-property</b>
           <b>Markers=...</b>.

           Unless <b>--no-block </b>is used, <b>systemctl </b>will wait for the queued
           jobs to finish.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--read-only</b>
           When used with <b>bind</b>, creates a read-only bind mount.

           Added in version 248.

       <b>--drop-in=</b><i>NAME</i>
           When used with <b>edit</b>, use <i>NAME</i> as the drop-in file name
           instead of override.conf.

           Added in version 253.

       <b>--when=</b>
           When used with <b>halt</b>, <b>poweroff</b>, <b>reboot </b>or <b>kexec</b>, schedule the
           action to be performed at the given timestamp, which should
           adhere to the syntax documented in <a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time(7)</a> section
           "PARSING TIMESTAMPS". Specially, if "show" is given, the
           currently scheduled action will be shown, which can be
           canceled by passing an empty string or "cancel".

           Added in version 254.

       <b>--stdin</b>
           When used with <b>edit</b>, the contents of the file will be read
           from standard input and the editor will not be launched. In
           this mode, the old contents of the file are completely
           replaced. This is useful to "edit" unit files from scripts:

               $ systemctl edit --drop-in=limits.conf --stdin some-service.service &lt;&lt;EOF
               [Unit]
               AllowedCPUs=7,11
               EOF

           Multiple drop-ins may be "edited" in this mode; the same
           contents will be written to all of them.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a
           username and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The
           hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is
           listening on, separated by ":", and then a container name,
           separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific
           container on the specified host. This will use SSH to talk to
           the remote machine manager instance. Container names may be
           enumerated with <b>machinectl -H </b><i>HOST</i>. Put IPv6 addresses in
           brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container
           name to connect to, optionally prefixed by a user name to
           connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special
           string ".host" is used in place of the container name, a
           connection to the local system is made (which is useful to
           connect to a specific user's user bus: "--user
           --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
           connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used
           either the left hand side or the right hand side may be
           omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and
           ".host" are implied.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--capsule=</b>
           Execute operation on a capsule. Specify a capsule name to
           connect to. See <a href="../man5/capsule@.service.5.html">capsule@.service(5)</a> for details about
           capsules.

           Added in version 256.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--legend=</b><i>BOOL</i>
           Enable or disable printing of the legend, i.e. column headers
           and the footer with hints. The legend is printed by default,
           unless disabled with <b>--quiet </b>or similar.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       The mapping of LSB service states to systemd unit states is
       imperfect, so it is better to not rely on those return values but
       to look for specific unit states and substates instead.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <i>$SYSTEMD_EDITOR</i>
           Editor to use when editing units; overrides <i>$EDITOR</i> and
           <i>$VISUAL</i>. If neither <i>$SYSTEMD_EDITOR</i> nor <i>$EDITOR</i> nor <i>$VISUAL</i>
           are present or if it is set to an empty string or if their
           execution failed, systemctl will try to execute well known
           editors in this order: <b>editor</b>(1), <b>nano</b>(1), <b>vim</b>(1), <b>vi</b>(1).

           Added in version 218.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</i>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a
           higher log level, i.e. less important ones, will be
           suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value
           may be either one of (in order of decreasing importance)
           <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an
           integer in the range 0...7. See <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a> for more
           information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with one
           of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg </b>or <b>journal </b>followed by a colon to
           set the maximum log level for that specific log target (e.g.
           <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info </b>specifies to log at
           debug level except when logging to the console which should
           be at info level). Note that the global maximum log level
           takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be
           colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and other
           tools that display logs will color messages based on the log
           level on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</i>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed
           with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written
           directly to the terminal or a file, because <a href="journalctl.1.html">journalctl(1)</a> and
           other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on
           the entry metadata on their own.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</i>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename
           and line number in the source code where the message
           originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to
           journal entries anyway. Including it directly in the message
           text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</i>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console </b>(log to the
           attached tty), <b>console-prefixed </b>(log to the attached tty but
           with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see
           <a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog(3)</a>, <b>kmsg </b>(log to the kernel circular log buffer),
           <b>journal </b>(log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg </b>(log to the
           journal if available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto </b>(determine
           the appropriate log target automatically, the default), <b>null</b>
           (disable log output).

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager </b>is not given; overrides <i>$PAGER</i>.
           If neither <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> nor <i>$PAGER</i> are set, a set of
           well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including
           <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> and <a href="more.1.html">more(1)</a>, until one is found. If no pager
           implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting
           this environment variable to an empty string or the value
           "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> (as
           well as <i>$PAGER</i>) will be silently ignored.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i>
           Override the options passed to <b>less </b>(by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when
               Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less </b>to handle Ctrl+C itself
               to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this
               option.

               If the value of <i>$SYSTEMD_LESS</i> does not include "K", and
               the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C will be ignored
               by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap
               initialization and deinitialization strings to the
               terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to
               remain visible in the terminal even after the pager
               exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager
               functionality from working, in particular paged output
               cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESS</i> environment variable has
           no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

           See <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> for more discussion.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</i>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less </b>(by default "utf-8", if
           the invoking terminal is determined to be UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <i>$LESSCHARSET</i> environment
           variable has no effect for <b>less </b>invocations by systemd tools.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the
           pager is enabled; if false, disabled. If <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i>
           is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective
           UID is not the same as the owner of the login session, see
           <a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid(2)</a> and <a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid(3)</a>. In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1 </b>will be set when invoking the pager, and the
           pager shall disable commands that open or create new files or
           start new subprocesses. When <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> is not set
           at all, pagers which are not known to implement secure mode
           will not be used. (Currently only <a href="less.1.html">less(1)</a> implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for
           example under <a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo(8)</a> or <b>pkexec</b>(1), care must be taken to
           ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled.
           "Secure" mode for the pager may be enabled automatically as
           describe above. Setting <i>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</i> or not removing
           it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke
           arbitrary commands. Note that if the <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</i> or <i>$PAGER</i>
           variables are to be honoured, <i>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</i> must be
           set too. It might be reasonable to completely disable the
           pager using <b>--no-pager </b>instead.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</i>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd </b>and related
           utilities will use colors in their output, otherwise the
           output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can
           take one of the following special values: "16", "256" to
           restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic
           decision based on <i>$TERM</i> and what the console is connected to.

       <i>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</i>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links
           should be generated in the output for terminal emulators
           supporting this. This can be specified to override the
           decision that <b>systemd </b>makes based on <i>$TERM</i> and other
           conditions.
