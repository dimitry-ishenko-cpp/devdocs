</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-imap-send - Send a collection of patches from stdin to an
       IMAP folder
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git imap-send</i> [-v] [-q] [--[no-]curl]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This command uploads a mailbox generated with <i>git format-patch</i>
       into an IMAP drafts folder. This allows patches to be sent as
       other email is when using mail clients that cannot read mailbox
       files directly. The command also works with any general mailbox
       in which emails have the fields "From", "Date", and "Subject" in
       that order.

       Typical usage is something like:

       git format-patch --signoff --stdout --attach origin | git
       imap-send
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

       -q, --quiet
           Be quiet.

       --curl
           Use libcurl to communicate with the IMAP server, unless
           tunneling into it. Ignored if Git was built without the
           USE_CURL_FOR_IMAP_SEND option set.

       --no-curl
           Talk to the IMAP server using git’s own IMAP routines instead
           of using libcurl. Ignored if Git was built with the
           NO_OPENSSL option set.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       To use the tool, <b>imap.folder </b>and either <b>imap.tunnel </b>or <b>imap.host</b>
       must be set to appropriate values.

       Everything above this line in this section isn’t included from
       the <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> documentation. The content that follows is the
       same as what’s found there:

       imap.folder
           The folder to drop the mails into, which is typically the
           Drafts folder. For example: "INBOX.Drafts", "INBOX/Drafts" or
           "[Gmail]/Drafts". Required.

       imap.tunnel
           Command used to set up a tunnel to the IMAP server through
           which commands will be piped instead of using a direct
           network connection to the server. Required when imap.host is
           not set.

       imap.host
           A URL identifying the server. Use an <b>imap:// </b>prefix for
           non-secure connections and an <b>imaps:// </b>prefix for secure
           connections. Ignored when imap.tunnel is set, but required
           otherwise.

       imap.user
           The username to use when logging in to the server.

       imap.pass
           The password to use when logging in to the server.

       imap.port
           An integer port number to connect to on the server. Defaults
           to 143 for imap:// hosts and 993 for imaps:// hosts. Ignored
           when imap.tunnel is set.

       imap.sslverify
           A boolean to enable/disable verification of the server
           certificate used by the SSL/TLS connection. Default is <b>true</b>.
           Ignored when imap.tunnel is set.

       imap.preformattedHTML
           A boolean to enable/disable the use of html encoding when
           sending a patch. An html encoded patch will be bracketed with
           &lt;pre&gt; and have a content type of text/html. Ironically,
           enabling this option causes Thunderbird to send the patch as
           a plain/text, format=fixed email. Default is <b>false</b>.

       imap.authMethod
           Specify the authentication method for authenticating with the
           IMAP server. If Git was built with the NO_CURL option, or if
           your curl version is older than 7.34.0, or if you’re running
           git-imap-send with the <b>--no-curl </b>option, the only supported
           method is <i>CRAM-MD5</i>. If this is not set then <i>git imap-send</i>
           uses the basic IMAP plaintext LOGIN command.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Using tunnel mode:

           [imap]
               folder = "INBOX.Drafts"
               tunnel = "ssh -q -C user@example.com /usr/bin/imapd ./Maildir 2&gt; /dev/null"

       Using direct mode:

           [imap]
               folder = "INBOX.Drafts"
               host = imap://imap.example.com
               user = bob
               pass = p4ssw0rd

       Using direct mode with SSL:

           [imap]
               folder = "INBOX.Drafts"
               host = imaps://imap.example.com
               user = bob
               pass = p4ssw0rd
               port = 123
               ; sslVerify = false

           <b>Note</b>

           You may want to use <b>sslVerify=false </b>while troubleshooting, if
           you suspect that the reason you are having trouble connecting
           is because the certificate you use at the private server
           <b>example.com </b>you are trying to set up (or have set up) may not
           be verified correctly.

       Using Gmail’s IMAP interface:

           [imap]
                   folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"
                   host = imaps://imap.gmail.com
                   user = user@gmail.com
                   port = 993

           <b>Note</b>

           You might need to instead use: <b>folder = "[Google</b>
           <b>Mail]/Drafts" </b>if you get an error that the "Folder doesn’t
           exist".

           <b>Note</b>

           If your Gmail account is set to another language than
           English, the name of the "Drafts" folder will be localized.

       Once the commits are ready to be sent, run the following command:

           $ git format-patch --cover-letter -M --stdout origin/master | git imap-send

       Just make sure to disable line wrapping in the email client
       (Gmail’s web interface will wrap lines no matter what, so you
       need to use a real IMAP client).
</pre> <h2>
CAUTION </h2>
<pre>
       It is still your responsibility to make sure that the email
       message sent by your email program meets the standards of your
       project. Many projects do not like patches to be attached. Some
       mail agents will transform patches (e.g. wrap lines, send them as
       format=flowed) in ways that make them fail. You will get angry
       flames ridiculing you if you don’t check this.

       Thunderbird in particular is known to be problematic. Thunderbird
