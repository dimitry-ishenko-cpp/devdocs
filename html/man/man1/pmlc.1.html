NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlc </b>- configure active Performance Co-Pilot pmlogger(s)
       interactively
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlc </b>[<b>-eiPz?</b>]  [<b>-h </b><i>host</i>] [<b>-n </b><i>pmnsfile</i>] [<b>-p </b><i>port</i>] [<b>-Z </b><i>timezone</i>]
       [<i>pid</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlc </b>may be used to change those metrics and instances which a
       <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> writes to a Performance Co-Pilot archive (see
       <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a>), the frequency with which the metrics are collected
       and whether the logging is mandatory, advisory, on or off.  It
       also reports the current logging status of metrics and instances.
       <b>pmlc </b>may be used to control pmlogger instances on remote hosts as
       well as those on the local host.

       Normally <b>pmlc </b>operates on the distributed Performance Metrics
       Name Space (PMNS), however if the <b>-n </b>option is specified an
       alternative local PMNS is loaded from the file <i>pmnsfile</i>.

       If the <b>-P </b>option is specified, <b>pmlc </b>will attempt to start with a
       connection to the primary pmlogger on the local host.  If the <b>-p</b>
       option is specified, then <b>pmlc </b>will attempt to start with a
       connection to the pmlogger on this TCP/IP <i>port</i>.  Alternatively,
       if <i>pid</i> is specified, a connection to the pmlogger instance with
       that process id will be attempted on startup.  The <b>-h </b>option may
       only be used if <b>-P, -p </b><i>port</i> or a <i>pid</i> is also specified.  In that
       case <b>pmlc </b>will initially connect to the specified (remote)
       pmlogger instance on <i>host</i> rather than the local host.  If the
       connection to the specified pmlogger instance cannot be
       established, <b>pmlc </b>will start with no connection.  These options
       typically allow the same file of <b>pmlc </b>commands to be directed to
       multiple pmlogger instances by varying the command line
       arguments.  Note that <b>-P</b>, <b>-p </b><i>port</i>, <i>pid</i> and <b>-h </b>are used only when
       making an initial connection to a pmlogger instance.  They are
       not used as defaults if subsequent connections are made
       interactively (see the <b>connect </b>command below).

       By default, <b>pmlc </b>reports the time of day according to the local
       timezone on the system where <b>pmlc </b>is run.  The <b>-Z </b>option changes
       the timezone to <i>timezone</i> in the format of the environment
       variable <b>TZ </b>as described in <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a>.  The <b>-z </b>option changes
       the timezone to the timezone of the pmlogger instance from which
       information is being obtained.  Only one of <b>-z </b>or <b>-Z </b>may be
       specified.

       If standard input is from a tty, <b>pmlc </b>is interactive, with
       prompts.  The <b>-i </b>flag may be used to force interactive behavior,
       and is typically used in conjunction with <b>-e </b>to echo all command
       input on standard output.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following commands may be used:

       <b>show </b>[ <b>loggers </b>] [ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]
           Displays the process identities of all pmlogger instances
           running on the local host (or <i>host</i>, if specified).  The
           primary pmlogger pid is parenthesized because it can be
           referred to as "primary" as well as by its pid.

       <b>connect </b><i>pid</i> [ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]
       <b>connect primary </b>[ <b>@</b><i>host</i> ]
           Connects <b>pmlc </b>to the specified pmlogger process.  Any
           existing connection to a pmlogger instance is closed first.
           Each pmlogger instance will accept at most one connection at
           a time, so if the connection is successfully established,
           your <b>pmlc </b>will be the only one controlling the pmlogger
           instance it is connected to.

       <b>new volume</b>
           This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger
           instance is established.  It tells the pmlogger to close the
           current volume of the archive and open a new volume.  Closed
           volumes may be compressed and/or moved to a remote system,
           remote storage or off-line storage, e.g. as part of a regular
           archive management procedure to control the size of the
           physical archive files on the system where <b>pmlogger </b>is
           running.

       <b>status</b>
           This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger
           instance is established.  It prints information about the
           state of the pmlogger instance and its associated archive.

       <b>timezone local </b>| <b>logger </b>| <b>"</b><i>timezone</i><b>"</b>
           This command sets the time zone used when times are printed.
           <b>local </b>means use the time zone of the machine that <b>pmlc </b>is
           running on.  <b>logger </b>means use the time zone of the machine
           where the pmlogger instance is running.  Alternatively an
           explicit <i>timezone</i> enclosed in quotes may be supplied (refer
           to <b>TZ </b>in <a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ(7)</a> for details).  The default time zone is
           <b>local </b>unless one of the <b>-z </b>or <b>-Z </b>options has been supplied on
           the command line.

       <b>flush</b>
           This command works only while a connection to a pmlogger
           instance is established, and requests the pmlogger instance
           to flush to disk all buffers associated with the current
           archive.  For old-timers, <b>sync </b>is a synonym for <b>flush</b>.  In
           current versions of <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> all writes are unbuffered and
           aligned with the logical records in the external files, so
           this command achieves nothing, but is retained for backwards
           compatibility.

       <b>disconnect</b>
           Disconnect <b>pmlc </b>from the current pmlogger instance, if any.

       <b>sleep </b><i>delay</i>
           Pause <b>pmlc </b>for <i>delay</i> milliseconds.  This may be helpful in
           scripted uses of <b>pmlc </b>to allow the current pmlogger instance
           to make progress on recent requests before interrogating the
           status.

       <b>help</b>
           Displays a summary of the available commands.
           <b>h </b>and <b>? </b>are synonyms for <b>help</b>.

       <b>quit</b>
           Exits from <b>pmlc</b>.

       The remaining commands query and change the logging state of
       metrics and instances.  They will work only if <b>pmlc </b>has a
       connection to a pmlogger instance.  Metrics may be specified as
       fully qualified names (e.g. hinv.ncpu) or subtrees of the PMNS
       (e.g. hinv) which are expanded to include all metrics in the
       subtree (e.g. hinv.ncpu, hinv.cpuclock, etc.).  Lists of metrics
       may be specified by enclosing them in braces with spaces or a
       comma between metrics (e.g. {hinv.ncpu hinv.ndisk}).  Subtrees of
       metrics may be included in such lists.

       Each individual metric specification may be further qualified
       with a space or comma separated list of instances in square
       brackets (e.g. kernel.all.load["1 minute", "5 minute"]).
       External instance names or numeric internal instance identifiers
       or both may be used in the same list (e.g.
       sample.colour.[red,1,"blue"]).  If an instance qualification is
       applied to a subtree of the PMNS all of the metrics in the
       subtree must have the same instance domain.  Instance
       qualifications may not be applied to entire lists of metrics but
       may appear inside such lists.

       If no instances are specified for a metric, all instances are
       used.  All instances means all instances available at the time
       the pmlogger instance in question fetches the metrics for
       logging.  If an instance domain changes over time this is not
       always the same as the set of instances displayed by <b>pmlc</b>, which
       can only display the currently available instances.  To prevent
       unintentional errors, only the instances that are currently
       available to <b>pmlc </b>may appear in instance specifications.

       <b>query </b><i>metriclist</i>
           The current logging state of each metric (and instances,
           where applicable) in <i>metriclist</i> is displayed.  This includes
           the logging state (e.g. on, maybe, off) and the logging
           interval for each metric (and instance) requested.  The
           following abbreviations pertaining to metrics (and instances)
           may appear in the output: <b>adv</b>, advisory; <b>mand</b>, mandatory; <b>nl</b>,
           not logged (not in the archive); <b>na</b>, in the archive but not
           currently available from its Performance Metrics Domain Agent
           (PMDA).  Where appropriate, an instance name will appear last
           on a line preceded by its numeric internal instance
           identifier.

       [ <b>log </b>] <b>mandatory on </b><i>interval metriclist</i>
           This form of the <b>log </b>command turns on logging for the metrics
           (and any instances) in <i>metriclist.</i>  <i>interval</i> specifies how
           often the specified metrics/instances should be logged.  <b>once</b>
           indicates that the metrics/instances should appear at most
           once in the archive.  More often one would use the optional
           keyword <b>every </b>followed by a positive number and one of
           <b>millisecond </b>(or <b>msec</b>), <b>second </b>(or <b>sec</b>), <b>minute </b>(or <b>min</b>), <b>hour</b>
           or their plurals.
           Note that the keyword <b>default </b>which may be used for the
           default <i>interval</i> in a <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> configuration file cannot
           be used in <b>pmlc</b>.
           Internal limitations require the <i>interval</i> to be less than
           (approximately) 74 hours.  An <i>interval</i> value of zero is a
           synonym for <b>once</b>.

       [ <b>log </b>] <b>mandatory off </b><i>metriclist</i>
           This tells the pmlogger instance not to archive any of the
           metrics/instances in <i>metriclist</i>.

       [ <b>log </b>] <b>mandatory maybe </b><i>metriclist</i>
           This tells the pmlogger instance to honor any subsequent
           advisory logging requests for the metrics/instances in
           <i>metriclist</i>.  If the current logging state of the
           metrics/instances is mandatory (either on or off) the new
           state will be set to maybe (effectively advisory off).  If
           the current state of the metrics/instances is already
           advisory (either on or off) the state(s) for the
           metrics/instances will remain as they are.

       [ <b>log </b>] <b>advisory on </b><i>interval metriclist</i>
       [ <b>log </b>] <b>advisory off </b><i>metriclist</i>
           Advisory logging is only applicable if the last logging state
           specified for a metric/instance was "mandatory maybe" (which
           permits subsequent advisory logging control) or if the
           logging state is already advisory.  These two statements turn
           advisory logging on or off (respectively) for the specified
           metrics/instances.
           The interpretation for <i>interval</i> is as above for the <b>mandatory</b>
           case.

       There is no continuation character required for commands that
       span lines.

       The word <b>at </b>may be used interchangeably with <b>@</b>.

       A request to archive all instances of a metric will supersede any
       prior request to log either all or specific instances of a metric
       (if the request specifies a permissible transition in the logging
       state).  A request to archive specific instances of a metric when
       all instances of a metric are already being logged is refused by
       <b>pmlogger</b>.

</pre> <h2>
ACCESS CONTROL </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmlc </b>may have restricted access to and control over <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a>
       processes.

       If a <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> is unable to export its control information to
       the local <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, then that <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> cannot cannot be
       connected to nor controlled by <b>pmlc</b>.  In practice, this means the
       <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> process has to be owned by the user ``pcp'' and/or
       the group ``pcp''.  If <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> is running on the host ``foo''
       then use ``pminfo -f -h foo pmcd.pmlogger'' to verify that the
       <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> of interest is known to <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>, alternatively
       <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> instances that are not reported from the <b>pmlc show</b>
       <b>loggers @foo </b>command are not known to <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> on the host
       ``foo''.

       If <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> is launched with a configuration file that
       contains an <b>[access] </b>section, then <b>pmlc </b>will be unable to connect
       to that <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> unless the access controls allow <b>some </b>access
       from the host where <b>pmlc </b>is being run.  Minimally this requires
       the <b>enquire </b>access to be permitted in the <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> access
       control section.

       If <b>pmlc </b>is able to connect to the <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> of interest, then
       the following table summarizes the permissions needed to perform
       different <b>pmlc </b>commands:

</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       If all instances of a metric are being logged and a request is
       made to log specific instances of the metric with the same state
       and frequency, the request may appear to succeed, even though
       <b>pmlogger </b>has refused the request.  This is not normally a
       problem, as the required information will still be placed into
       the archive by <b>pmlogger</b>.

       However in the case where the metric is to be logged once, the
       outcome is not what might be expected.  When <b>pmlogger </b>receives a
       request to archive a metric once, it places the current value(s)
       of the metric into the archive as soon as it can, regardless of
       whether the metric is already in the archive.  This may be used
       to force values into the archive.  When a request to archive
       specific instances of a metric arrives and is refused because all
       instances of the metric are already being logged, <b>pmlogger </b>does
       not place values for the instances requested into the archive.
       It returns the current logging state for each instance requested
       to <b>pmlc</b>.  The requested and returned states are identical, so
       <b>pmlc </b>doesn't raise an error as it should.

       To ensure that only certain instances of a metric are being
       logged, one should always turn off logging for all instances of
       the metric prior to turning on logging for the specific instances
       required.
</pre> <h2>
DIAGNOSTICS </h2>
<pre>
       Most error or warning messages are self-explanatory.  A message
       of the form
               Warning: unable to change logging state for...
       followed by a list of metrics (and possibly instances) indicates
       that <b>pmlogger </b>refused the request for the metrics (and instances)
       that appear.  Any metrics (and instances) that were specified but
       do not appear in the message have had their logging state updated
       successfully (no news is good news).  Usually this warning
       results from requesting advisory logging when a mandatory control
       is already in place, or requesting logging for specific instances
       when all instances are already being logged.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       If the <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT </b>environment variable is not set
       or set to 0 (zero), then <b>pmlc </b>will block until a connection is
       established with <a href="pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger(1)</a> on the requested <i>port</i>.  If
       <b>PMLOGGER_REQUEST_TIMEOUT </b>is set to a value greater than zero,
       then <b>pmlc </b>will fail with an error after that many seconds if a
       connection isn't established.  This may be used by administrative
       scripts such as <a href="pmlogger_daily.1.html">pmlogger_daily(1)</a> to poll <b>pmlogger </b>when is
       starting up until it is ready and listening on it's control <i>port</i>.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
