NAME </h2>
<pre>
       lexgrog - parse header information in man pages
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lexgrog </b>[<b>-m</b>|<b>-c</b>] [<b>-dfw?V</b>] [<b>-E </b><i>encoding</i>] <i>file</i> ...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lexgrog </b>is an implementation of the traditional “groff guess”
       utility in <b>lex</b>.  It reads the list of files on its command line
       as either man page source files or preformatted “cat” pages, and
       displays their name and description as used by <b>apropos </b>and
       <b>whatis</b>, the list of preprocessing filters required by the man
       page before it is passed to <b>nroff </b>or <b>troff</b>, or both.

       If its input is badly formatted, <b>lexgrog </b>will print “parse
       failed”; this may be useful for external programs that need to
       check man pages for correctness.  If one of <b>lexgrog</b>'s input files
       is “-”, it will read from standard input; if any input file is
       compressed, a decompressed version will be read automatically.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
              Print debugging information.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--man</b>
              Parse input as man page source files.  This is the default
              if neither <b>--man </b>nor <b>--cat </b>is given.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cat</b>
              Parse input as preformatted man pages (“cat pages”).
              <b>--man </b>and <b>--cat </b>may not be given simultaneously.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--whatis</b>
              Display the name and description from the man page's
              header, as used by <b>apropos </b>and <b>whatis</b>.  This is the
              default if neither <b>--whatis </b>nor <b>--filters </b>is given.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--filters</b>
              Display the list of filters needed to preprocess the man
              page before formatting with <b>nroff </b>or <b>troff</b>.

       <b>-E </b><i>encoding</i>, <b>--encoding </b><i>encoding</i>
              Override the guessed character set for the page to
              <i>encoding</i>.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a help message and exit.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0      </b>Successful program execution.

       <b>1      </b>Usage error.

       <b>2      lexgrog </b>failed to parse one or more of its input files.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
         $ lexgrog man.1
         man.1: "man - an interface to the system reference manuals"
         $ lexgrog -fw man.1
         man.1 (t): "man - an interface to the system reference manuals"
         $ lexgrog -c whatis.cat1
         whatis.cat1: "whatis - display manual page descriptions"
         $ lexgrog broken.1
         broken.1: parse failed
</pre> <h2>
WHATIS PARSING </h2>
<pre>
       <b>mandb </b>(which uses the same code as <b>lexgrog</b>) parses the <b>NAME</b>
       section at the top of each manual page looking for names and
       descriptions of the features documented in each.  While the
       parser is quite tolerant, as it has to cope with a number of
       different forms that have historically been used, it may
       sometimes fail to extract the required information.

       When using the traditional <i>man</i> macro set, a correct <b>NAME </b>section
       looks something like this:

              .SH NAME
              foo \- program to do something

       Some manual pagers require the ‘\-’ to be exactly as shown; <b>mandb</b>
       is more tolerant, but for compatibility with other systems it is
       nevertheless a good idea to retain the backslash.

       On the left-hand side, there may be several names, separated by
       commas.  Names containing whitespace will be ignored to avoid
       pathological behaviour on certain ill-formed <b>NAME </b>sections.  The
       text on the right-hand side is free-form, and may be spread over
       multiple lines.  If several features with different descriptions
       are being documented in the same manual page, the following form
       is therefore used:

              .SH NAME
              foo, bar \- programs to do something
              .br
              baz \- program to do nothing

       (A macro which starts a new paragraph, like <b>.PP</b>, may be used
       instead of the break macro <b>.br</b>.)

       When using the BSD-derived <i>mdoc</i> macro set, a correct <b>NAME </b>section
       looks something like this:

              .Sh NAME
              .Nm foo
              .Nd program to do something

       There are several common reasons why whatis parsing fails.
       Sometimes authors of manual pages replace ‘.SH NAME’ with ‘.SH
       MYPROGRAM’, and then <b>mandb </b>cannot find the section from which to
       extract the information it needs.  Sometimes authors include a
       NAME section, but place free-form text there rather than ‘name \-
       description’.  However, any syntax resembling the above should be
       accepted.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>lexgrog </b>attempts to parse files containing .so requests, but will
       only be able to do so correctly if the files are properly
       installed in a manual page hierarchy.
