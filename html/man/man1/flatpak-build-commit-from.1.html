NAME </h2>
<pre>
       flatpak-build-commit-from - Create new commits based on existing
       one (possibly from another repository)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>flatpak build-commit-from </b>[OPTION...] DST-REPO DST-REF...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Creates new commits on the DST-REF branch in the DST-REPO, with
       the contents (and most of the metadata) taken from another
       branch, either from another repo, or from another branch in the
       same repository.

       The collection ID set on DST-REPO (if set) will be used for the
       newly created commits.

       This command is very useful when you want to maintain a branch
       with a clean history that has no unsigned or broken commits. For
       instance, you can import the head from a different repository
       from an automatic builder when you've verified that it worked.
       The new commit will have no parents or signatures from the
       autobuilder, and can be properly signed with the official key.

       Any deltas that affect the original commit and that match parent
       commits in the destination repository are copied and rewritten
       for the new commit id.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>--src-repo=SRC-REPO</b>
           The (local) repository to pull the source branch from.
           Defaults to the destination repository.

       <b>--src-ref=SRC-REF</b>
           The branch to use as the source for the new commit. Defaults
           to the same as the destination ref, which is useful only if a
           different source repo has been specified.

       <b>--extra-collection-id=COLLECTION-ID</b>
           Add an extra collection-ref binding for this collection, in
           addition to whatever would normally be added due to the
           destination repository collection id. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--subset=SUBSET</b>
           Mark the commit to be included in the named subset. This will
           cause the commit to be put in the named subset summary (in
           addition to the main one), allowing users to see only this
           subset instead of the whole repo.

       <b>--untrusted</b>
           The source repostory is not trusted, all objects are copied
           (not hardlinked) and all checksums are verified.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--subject=SUBJECT</b>
           One line subject for the commit message. If not specified,
           will be taken from the source commit.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--body=BODY</b>
           Full description for the commit message. If not specified,
           will be taken from the source commit.

       <b>--update-appstream</b>
           Update the appstream branch after the build.

       <b>--no-update-summary</b>
           Don't update the summary file after the new commit is added.
           This means the repository will not be useful for serving over
           http until build-update-repo has been run. This is useful is
           you want to do multiple repo operations before finally
           updating the summary.

       <b>--force</b>
           Create new commit even if the content didn't change from the
           existing branch head.

       <b>--disable-fsync</b>
           Don't fsync when writing to the repository. This can result
           in data loss in exceptional situations, but can improve
           performance when working with temporary or test repositories.

       <b>--gpg-sign=KEYID</b>
           Sign the commit with this GPG key. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--gpg-homedir=PATH</b>
           GPG Homedir to use when looking for keyrings

       <b>--end-of-life=REASON</b>
           Mark build as end-of-life

       <b>--end-of-life-rebase=OLDID=NEWID</b>
           Mark new refs as end-of-life. Unlike <b>--end-of-life</b>, this one
           takes an ID that supersedes the current one. By the user's
           request, the application data may be preserved for the new
           application. Note, this is actually a prefix match, so if you
           say org.the.app=org.new.app, then something like
           org.the.app.Locale will be rebased to org.new.app.Locale.

       <b>--timestamp=TIMESTAMP</b>
           Override the timestamp of the commit. Use an ISO 8601
           formatted date, or NOW for the current time

       <b>--disable-fsync</b>
           Don't fsync when writing to the repository. This can result
           in data loss in exceptional situations, but can improve
           performance when working with temporary or test repositories.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
