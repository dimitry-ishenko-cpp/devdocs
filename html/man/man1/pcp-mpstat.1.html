NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcp-mpstat </b>- Report CPU and interrupt related statistics.
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcp </b>[<i>pcp options</i>] <b>mpstat [ -A ] [ -u ] [ -V ] [ -I { SUM | CPU |</b>
       <b>SCPU | ALL } ] [ -P { </b><i>cpu1,cpu2</i> <b>[,...] | ON | ALL } ] [ -t</b>
       <i>interval</i> <b>] [ -s </b><i>count</i> <b>] [ -a </b><i>archive</i> <b>] [ -? ]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcp-mpstat </b>command writes to standard output activities for each
       available processor, processor 0 being the first one.  If no
       activity/option has been selected, then the default report is the
       CPU utilization (<b>-u</b>) report.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report.  The default is one second.  The value of
       <i>count</i> parameter determines the number of samples to be displayed.
       The default is continuous.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       When invoked via the <a href="pcp.1.html">pcp(1)</a> command, the <b>-h</b>/<b>--host</b>, <b>-a</b>/<b>--archive</b>,
       <b>-O</b>/<b>--origin</b>, <b>-s</b>/<b>--samples</b>, <b>-t</b>/<b>--interval</b>, <b>-Z</b>/<b>--timezone </b>and
       several other <i>pcp options</i> become indirectly available; refer to
       <a href="pcpintro.1.html">PCPIntro(1)</a> for a complete description of these options.

       The additional command line options available for <b>pcp-mpstat </b>are:

       -A     This option is equivalent to specifying <b>-u -I ALL -P ALL</b>

       -I { SUM | CPU | SCPU | ALL }
              Report interrupts statistics.
              With the <b>SUM </b>keyword, the <b>pcp-mpstat </b>command reports the
              total number of interrupts per processor.  The following
              values are displayed:

       <b>CPU</b>
                     Processor number.  The keyword <i>all</i> indicates that
                     statistics are calculated as averages among all
                     processors.

              <b>intr/s</b>
                     Show the total number of interrupts received per
                     second by the CPU or CPUs.

              With the <b>CPU </b>keyword, the number of each individual
              interrupt received per second by the CPU or CPUs is
              displayed.  Interrupts are those under the
              kernel.percpu.interrupts metric tree.

              With the <b>SCPU </b>keyword, the number of each individual
              software interrupt received per second by the CPU or CPUs
              is displayed.  Software interrupts are those under the
              kernel.percpu.softirqs tree

              The <b>ALL </b>keyword is equivalent to specifying all the
              keywords above and therefore all the interrupts statistics
              are displayed.

       -P { cpu1,cpu2[,...] | ON | ALL }
              Indicate the processor number for which statistics are to
              be reported.  <i>cpu1 and cpu2</i> are the processor numbers.  A
              list of required processor numbers can be provided.  Note
              that processor 0 is the first processor.

              The <b>ON </b>keyword indicates that statistics are to be
              reported for every online processor, whereas the <b>ALL</b>
              keyword indicates that statistics are to be reported for
              all processors.

       -u     Report CPU utilization.  The following values are
              displayed:

              <b>CPU</b>
                     Processor number.  The keyword <i>ALL</i> indicates that
                     statistics are calculated as averages among all
                     processors.

              <b>%usr</b>
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
                     occurred while executing at the user level
                     (application).

              <b>%nice</b>
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
                     occurred while executing at the user level with
                     nice priority.

              <b>%sys</b>
                     Show the percentage of CPU utilization that
                     occurred while executing at the system level
                     (kernel).  Note that this does not include time
                     spent servicing hardware and software interrupts.

              <b>%iowait</b>
                     Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
                     were idle during which the system had an
                     outstanding disk I/O request.

              <b>%irq</b>
                     Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                     CPUs to service hardware interrupts.

              <b>%soft</b>
                     Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                     CPUs to service software interrupts.

              <b>%steal</b>
                     Show the percentage of time spent in involuntary
                     wait by the virtual CPU or CPUs while the
                     hypervisor was servicing another virtual processor.

              <b>%guest</b>
                     Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                     CPUs to run a virtual processor.

              <b>%gnice</b>
                     Show the percentage of time spent by the CPU or
                     CPUs to run a niced guest.

              <b>%idle</b>
                     Show the percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs
                     were idle and the system did not have an
                     outstanding disk I/O request.

              Note: On SMP machines a processor that does not have any
              activity at all is a disabled (offline) processor.

       -s  N , --samples = N
              Set the number of samples to be displayed.  Since the
              first sample is used for the rate conversion of some of
              the metrics, the total number of samples reported are one
              less that N.  Default is continuous.

       -t DELTA , --interval = DELTA
              Set the interval between two samples.  The default is one
              second.

       -a  FILE , --archive = FILE
              Causes <b>pcp-mpstat </b>to use the specified archive than
              connecting to PMCD.  The argument to <b>-a </b>is a comma-
              separated list of names, each of which may be the base
              name of an archive or the name of a directory containing
              one or more archives.

       -V , --version
              Print version number then exit.

       -? , --help
              Print usage message then exit.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcp-mpstat -t 2 -s 5</b>
              Display four reports of global statistics among all
              processors at two second intervals.

       <b>pcp mpstat -P ALL -t 2 -s 5</b>
              Display four reports of statistics for all processors at
              two second intervals.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pcp-mpstat </b>is inspired by the <a href="mpstat.1.html">mpstat(1)</a> command and aims to be
       command line and output compatible with it.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>TZ </b>and <b>LC_TIME </b>environment variables can be used to override the
       default date display format for <b>pcp-mpstat</b>.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.

       For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
       <a href="../man3/pmgetoptions.3.html">pmGetOptions(3)</a>.
