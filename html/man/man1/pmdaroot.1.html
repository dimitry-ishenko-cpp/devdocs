NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaroot </b>- a privileged PMCD helper performance metrics domain
       agent
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/root/pmdaroot </b>[<b>-d </b><i>domain</i>] [<b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>] [<b>-s</b>
       <i>sockname</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdaroot </b>is a special Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which cooperates closely with <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and other PMDAs to provide
       limited privileged services to these unprivileged processes.

       In this role it is used to discover operating system containers
       running on the local host.  It also enables access to performance
       data from within those containers by other PMDAs running on the
       bare-metal host, using the <a href="../man3/pmdarootconnect.3.html">pmdaRootConnect(3)</a> and the associated
       namespace interfaces.

       Like all other PMDAs, it also exports performance metrics from
       the domain it controls.  Currently, this is limited to
       information about the containers on the local system; currently
       Docker and LXC containers can be detected.

       If a non-default Docker parent-cgroup name is being used, this
       value can be indicated to <b>pmdaroot </b>through addition of a
       <b>$PCP_SYSTEMD_CGROUP </b>variable in <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i>.

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>root.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when
            <b>pmdaroot </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.

       <b>-s   </b>Location of the <a href="../man7/unix.7.html">unix(7)</a> domain socket for communication with
            clients seeking privileged operations.  By default, a socket
            file named <b>$PCP_TMP_DIR/pmcd/root.socket </b>is used.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       Access to the names, help text and values for the kernel
       performance metrics is available by default - unlike most other
       agents, no action is required to enable them and they should not
       be removed.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/root/help</b>
              default help text file for metrics exported by the root
              PMDA.
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/root.log</b>
              default log file for error messages and other information
              from the root PMDA.
       <b>$PCP_VAR_DIR/pmcd/root.socket</b>
              default socket file for communication with root PMDA
              clients.
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <i>/etc/pcp.conf</i> contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
