<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME </h2>
<pre>
       qhold — hold batch jobs
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       qhold <b>[</b>-h <i>hold_list</i><b>] </b><i>job_identifier</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A hold is placed on a batch job by a request to the batch server
       that manages the batch job. A batch job that has one or more
       holds is not eligible for execution. The <i>qhold</i> utility is a user-
       accessible client of batch services that requests one or more
       types of hold to be placed on one or more batch jobs.

       The <i>qhold</i> utility shall place holds on those batch jobs for which
       a batch <i>job_identifier</i> is presented to the utility.

       The <i>qhold</i> utility shall place holds on batch jobs in the order in
       which their batch <i>job_identifier</i>s are presented to the utility.
       If the <i>qhold</i> utility fails to process any batch <i>job_identifier</i>
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch <i>job_identifier</i>s, if any.

       The <i>qhold</i> utility shall place holds on each batch job by sending
       a <i>Hold Job Request</i> to the batch server that manages the batch
       job.

       The <i>qhold</i> utility shall not exit until holds have been placed on
       the batch job corresponding to each successfully processed batch
       <i>job_identifier</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qhold</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following option shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-h </b><i>hold_list</i>
                 Define the types of holds to be placed on the batch
                 job.

                 The <i>qhold</i> <b>-h </b>option shall accept a value for the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument that is a string of
                 alphanumeric characters in the portable character set
                 (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <i>Section 6.1</i>, <i>Portable Character Set</i>).

                 The <i>qhold</i> utility shall accept a value for the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument that is a string of one or
                 more of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, or <b>'o'</b>, or the single
                 character <b>'n'</b>.

                 For each unique character in the <i>hold_list</i> option-
                 argument, the <i>qhold</i> utility shall add a value to the
                 <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute of the batch job as follows, each
                 representing a different hold type:

                 u     USER

                 s     SYSTEM

                 o     OPERATOR

                 If any of these characters are duplicated in the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument, the duplicates shall be
                 ignored.

                 An existing <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute can be cleared by the
                 following hold type:

                 n     NO_HOLD

                 The <i>qhold</i> utility shall consider it an error if any
                 hold type other than <b>'n' </b>is combined with hold type
                 <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any
                 of the characters <b>'u'</b>, <b>'s'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n' </b>within the
                 <i>hold_list</i> option-argument. The <i>qhold</i> utility shall
                 permit the repetition of characters, but shall not
                 assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An implementation may define other hold types. The
                 conformance document for an implementation shall
                 describe any additional hold types, how they are
                 specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect
                 the behavior of the utility.

                 If the <b>-h </b>option is not presented to the <i>qhold</i> utility,
                 the implementation shall set the <i>Hold_Types</i> attribute
                 to USER.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qhold</i> utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
       to the syntax for a batch <i>job_identifier</i> (see <i>Section 3.3.1</i>,
       <i>Batch Job Identifier</i>).
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>qhold</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>LOGNAME</i>   Determine the login name of the user.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       In addition to the default behavior, the <i>qhold</i> utility shall not
       be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
       the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
       batch <i>job_identifier</i> does not exist on the server. Whether or not
       the <i>qhold</i> utility waits to output the diagnostic message while
       attempting to locate the job on other servers is implementation-
       defined.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qhold</i> utility allows users to place a hold on one or more
       jobs. A hold makes a batch job ineligible for execution.

       The <i>qhold</i> utility has options that allow the user to specify the
       type of hold.  Should the user wish to place a hold on a set of
       jobs that meet a selection criteria, such a list of jobs can be
       acquired using the <i>qselect</i> utility.

       The <b>-h </b>option allows the user to specify the type of hold that is
       to be placed on the job. This option allows for USER, SYSTEM,
       OPERATOR, and implementation-defined hold types. The USER and
       OPERATOR holds are distinct. The batch server that manages the
       batch job will verify that the user is authorized to set the
       specified hold for the batch job.

       Mail is not required on hold because the administrator has the
       tools and libraries to build this option if he or she wishes.

       Historically, the <i>qhold</i> utility has been a part of some existing
       batch systems, although it has not traditionally been a part of
       the NQS.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>qhold</i> utility may be removed in a future version.
