</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pidstat </b>command is used for monitoring individual tasks
       currently being managed by the Linux kernel.  It writes to
       standard output activities for every task selected with option <b>-p</b>
       or for every task managed by the Linux kernel if option <b>-p ALL</b>
       has been used. Not selecting any tasks is equivalent to
       specifying <b>-p ALL </b>but only active tasks (tasks with non-zero
       statistics values) will appear in the report.

       The <b>pidstat </b>command can also be used for monitoring the child
       processes of selected tasks.  Read about option <b>-T </b>below.

       The <i>interval</i> parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report.  A value of 0 (or no parameters at all)
       indicates that tasks statistics are to be reported for the time
       since system startup (boot). The <i>count</i> parameter can be specified
       in conjunction with the <i>interval</i> parameter if this one is not set
       to zero. The value of <i>count</i> determines the number of reports
       generated at <i>interval</i> seconds apart. If the <i>interval</i> parameter is
       specified without the <i>count</i> parameter, the <b>pidstat </b>command
       generates reports continuously.

       You can select information about specific task activities using
       flags.  Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.

OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-C </b><i>comm</i>
              Display only tasks whose command name includes the string
              <i>comm</i>. This string can be a regular expression.

       <b>-d     </b>Report I/O statistics (kernels 2.6.20 and later only).
              The following values may be displayed:

              UID    The real user identification number of the task
                     being monitored.

              USER   The name of the real user owning the task being
                     monitored.

              PID    The identification number of the task being
                     monitored.

              kB_rd/s
                     Number of kilobytes the task has caused to be read
                     from disk per second.

              kB_wr/s
                     Number of kilobytes the task has caused, or shall
                     cause to be written to disk per second.

              kB_ccwr/s
                     Number of kilobytes whose writing to disk has been
                     cancelled by the task. This may occur when the task
                     truncates some dirty pagecache. In this case, some
                     IO which another task has been accounted for will
                     not be happening.

              iodelay
                     Block I/O delay of the task being monitored,
                     measured in clock ticks. This metric includes the
                     delays spent waiting for sync block I/O completion
                     and for swapin block I/O completion.

              Command
                     The command name of the task.

       <b>--dec={ 0 | 1 | 2 }</b>
              Specify the number of decimal places to use (0 to 2,
              default value is 2).

       <b>-e </b><i>program args</i>
              Execute <i>program</i> with given arguments <i>args</i> and monitor it
              with <b>pidstat</b>.  <b>pidstat </b>stops when <i>program</i> terminates.

       <b>-G </b><i>process_name</i>
              Display only processes whose command name includes the
              string <i>process_name</i>.  This string can be a regular
              expression. If option <b>-t </b>is used together with option <b>-G</b>
              then the threads belonging to that process are also
              displayed (even if their command name doesn't include the
              string <i>process_name</i>).

       <b>-H     </b>Display timestamp in seconds since the epoch.

       <b>-h     </b>Display all activities horizontally on a single line, with
              no average statistics at the end of the report. This is
              intended to make it easier to be parsed by other programs.

       <b>--human</b>
              Print sizes in human readable format (e.g. 1.0k, 1.2M,
              etc.)  The units displayed with this option supersede any
              other default units (e.g.  kilobytes, sectors...)
              associated with the metrics.

       <b>-I     </b>In an SMP environment, indicate that tasks CPU usage (as
              displayed by option <b>-u</b>) should be divided by the total
              number of processors.

       <b>-l     </b>Display the process command name and all its arguments.

       <b>-p { </b><i>pid</i><b>[,...] | SELF | ALL }</b>
              Select tasks (processes) for which statistics are to be
              reported.  <i>pid</i> is the process identification number. The
              <b>SELF </b>keyword indicates that statistics are to be reported
              for the <b>pidstat </b>process itself, whereas the <b>ALL </b>keyword
              indicates that statistics are to be reported for all the
              tasks managed by the system.

       <b>-R     </b>Report realtime priority and scheduling policy
              information.  The following values may be displayed:

       <b>-T { TASK | CHILD | ALL }</b>
              This option specifies what has to be monitored by the
              <b>pidstat </b>command. The <b>TASK </b>keyword indicates that
              statistics are to be reported for individual tasks (this
              is the default option) whereas the <b>CHILD </b>keyword indicates
              that statistics are to be globally reported for the
              selected tasks and all their children. The <b>ALL </b>keyword
              indicates that statistics are to be reported for
              individual tasks and globally for the selected tasks and
              their children.

              Note: Global statistics for tasks and all their children
              are not available for all options of <b>pidstat.  </b>Also these
              statistics are not necessarily relevant to current time
              interval: The statistics of a child process are collected
              only when it finishes or it is killed.

       <b>-t     </b>Also display statistics for threads associated with
              selected tasks.

              This option adds the following values to the reports:

              instead of the UID.  If <i>username</i> is specified, then only
              tasks belonging to the specified user are displayed.

       <b>-u     </b>Report CPU utilization.

              When reporting statistics for individual tasks, the
              following values may be displayed:

              UID    The real user identification number of the task
                     being monitored.

                     to run.

              %CPU   Total percentage of CPU time used by the task. In
                     an SMP environment, the task's CPU usage will be
                     divided by the total number of CPU's if option <b>-I</b>
                     has been entered on the command line.

</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>pidstat </b>command takes into account the following environment
       variables:

       <b>S_COLORS</b>
              By default statistics are displayed in color when the
              output is connected to a terminal.  Use this variable to
              change the settings. Possible values for this variable are
              <i>never</i>, <i>always</i> or <i>auto</i> (the latter is equivalent to the
              default settings).
              Please note that the color (being red, yellow, or some
              other color) used to display a value is not indicative of
              any kind of issue simply because of the color. It only
              indicates different ranges of values.

       <b>S_COLORS_SGR</b>
              Specify the colors and other attributes used to display
              statistics on the terminal.  Its value is a colon-
              separated list of capabilities that defaults to
              <b>I=32;22:N=34;1:W=35;1:X=31;1:Z=34;22</b>.  Supported
              capabilities are:

              <b>I=     </b>SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) substring for item
                     values like PID, UID or CPU number.

              <b>N=     </b>SGR substring for non-zero statistics values and
                     for tasks names.

              <b>W= </b>(or <b>M=</b>)
                     SGR substring for percentage values in the range
                     from 75% to 90% (or in the range 10% to 25%
                     depending on the metric's meaning).

              <b>X= </b>(or <b>H=</b>)
                     SGR substring for percentage values greater than or
                     equal to 90% (or lower than or equal to 10%
                     depending on the metric's meaning).

              <b>Z=     </b>SGR substring for zero values and for threads
                     names.

       <b>S_TIME_FORMAT</b>
              If this variable exists and its value is <b>ISO </b>then the
              current locale will be ignored when printing the date in
              the report header. The <b>pidstat </b>command will use the ISO
              8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp will also
              be compliant with ISO 8601 format.

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pidstat 2 5</b>
              Display five reports of CPU statistics for every active
              task in the system at two second intervals.

       <b>pidstat -r -p 1643 2 5</b>
              Display five reports of page faults and memory statistics
              for PID 1643 at two second intervals.

       <b>pidstat -C "fox|bird" -r -p ALL</b>
              Display global page faults and memory statistics for all
              the processes whose command name includes the string "fox"
              or "bird".

       <b>pidstat -T CHILD -r 2 5</b>
              Display five reports of page faults statistics at two
              second intervals for the child processes of all tasks in
              the system. Only child processes with non-zero statistics
              values are displayed.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc</i> filesystem must be mounted for the <b>pidstat </b>command to work.

       Although <b>pidstat </b>speaks of kilobytes (kB), megabytes (MB)..., it
       actually uses kibibytes (kiB), mebibytes (MiB)...  A kibibyte is
       equal to 1024 bytes, and a mebibyte is equal to 1024 kibibytes.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/proc</i> contains various files with system statistics.
