NAME </h2>
<pre>
       zenmap - Graphical Nmap frontend and results viewer
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>

       <b>zenmap </b>[<i>options</i>] [<i>results file</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical Nmap frontend and results
       viewer. Zenmap aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use while
       giving experienced Nmap users advanced features. Frequently used
       scans can be saved as profiles to make them easy to run
       repeatedly. A command creator allows interactive creation of Nmap
       command lines. Scan results can be saved and viewed later. Saved
       scan results can be compared with one another to see how they
       differ. The results of recent scans are stored in a searchable
       database.

       This man page only describes the few Zenmap command-line options
       and some critical notes. A much more detailed Zenmap User's Guide
       is available at <b><a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html">https://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html</a> </b>. Other
       documentation and information is available from the Zenmap web
       page at <b><a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap/">https://nmap.org/zenmap/</a> </b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS SUMMARY </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file </b><i>results file</i>
           Open the given results file for viewing. The results file may
           be an Nmap XML output file (.xml, as produced by <b>nmap -oX</b>) or
           a Umit scan results file (.usr). This option may be given
           more than once.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show a help message and exit.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nmap </b><i>Nmap command line</i>
           Run the given Nmap command within the Zenmap interface. After
           <b>-n </b>or <b>--nmap</b>, every remaining command line argument is read
           as the command line to execute. This means that <b>-n </b>or <b>--nmap</b>
           must be given last, after any other options. Note that the
           command line must include the <b>nmap </b>executable name: <b>zenmap -n</b>
           <b>nmap -sS target</b>.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--profile </b><i>profile</i>
           Start with the given profile selected. The profile name is
           just a string: "Regular scan". If combined with <b>-t</b>, begin a
           scan with the given profile against the specified target.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--target </b><i>target</i>
           Start with the given target. If combined with <b>-p</b>, begin a
           scan with the given profile against the specified target.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Increase verbosity (of Zenmap, not Nmap). This option may be
           given multiple times to get even more verbosity.

       Any other arguments are taken to be the names of results files to
       open.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>ZENMAP_DEVELOPMENT</b>
           Set <b>ZENMAP_DEVELOPMENT </b>to disable automatic crash reporting.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Like their authors, Nmap and Zenmap aren’t perfect. But you can
       help make them better by sending bug reports or even writing
       patches. If Nmap or Zenmap doesn’t behave the way you expect,
       first upgrade to the latest version available from
       <b><a href="https://nmap.org">https://nmap.org</a> </b>. If the problem persists, do some research to
       determine whether it has already been discovered and addressed.
       Try Googling the error message or browsing the nmap-dev archives
       at <b><a href="https://seclists.org/">https://seclists.org/</a> </b>. Read this full manual page as well. If
       nothing comes of this, mail a bug report to &lt;dev@nmap.org&gt;.
       Please include everything you have learned about the problem, as
       well as what version of Zenmap you are running and what operating
       system version it is running on. Problem reports and Zenmap usage
       questions sent to dev@nmap.org are far more likely to be answered
       than those sent to Fyodor directly.

       Code patches to fix bugs are even better than bug reports. Basic
       instructions for creating patch files with your changes are
       available at <b><a href="https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING">https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/HACKING</a> </b>. Patches may be
       sent to nmap-dev (recommended) or to Fyodor directly.

HISTORY </h2>
<pre>
       Zenmap was originally derived from Umit, an Nmap GUI created
       during the Google-sponsored Nmap Summer of Code in 2005 and 2006.
       The primary author of Umit was Adriano Monteiro Marques. When
       Umit was modified and integrated into Nmap in 2007, it was
       renamed Zenmap.

       Hundreds of people have made valuable contributions to Nmap over
       the years. These are detailed in the CHANGELOG file which is
       distributed with Nmap and also available from
       <b><a href="https://nmap.org/changelog.html">https://nmap.org/changelog.html</a> </b>.

   <b>Umit</b>
       Zenmap is derived from the Umit Nmap frontend, which was started
       by Adriano Monteiro Marques as an Nmap/Google Summer of Code
       project (&lt;py.adriano@gmail.com&gt;, <b><a href="http://www.umitproject.org">http://www.umitproject.org</a> </b>).
