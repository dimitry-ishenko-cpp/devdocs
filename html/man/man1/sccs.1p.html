PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sccs — front end for the SCCS subsystem (<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       sccs <b>[</b>-r<b>] [</b>-d <i>path</i><b>] [</b>-p <i>path</i><b>] </b><i>command</i> <b>[</b><i>options</i>...<b>] [</b><i>operands</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sccs</i> utility is a front end to the SCCS programs. It also
       includes the capability to run set-user-id to another user to
       provide additional protection.

       The <i>sccs</i> utility shall invoke the specified <i>command</i> with the
       specified <i>options</i> and <i>operands</i>.  By default, each of the <i>operands</i>
       shall be modified by prefixing it with the string <b>"SCCS/s."</b>.

       The <i>command</i> can be the name of one of the SCCS utilities in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 (<i>admin</i>, <i>delta</i>, <i>get</i>, <i>prs</i>, <i>rmdel</i>, <i>sact</i>,
       <i>unget</i>, <i>val</i>, or <i>what</i>) or one of the pseudo-utilities listed in the
       EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>sccs</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       that <i>options</i> operands are actually options to be passed to the
       utility named by <i>command</i>.  When the portion of the command:

           <i>command</i> <b>[</b><i>options</i> ... <b>] [</b><i>operands</i> ... <b>]</b>

       is considered, all of the pseudo-utilities used as <i>command</i> shall
       support the Utility Syntax Guidelines. Any of the other SCCS
       utilities that can be invoked in this manner support the
       Guidelines to the extent indicated by their individual OPTIONS
       sections.

       The following options shall be supported preceding the <i>command</i>
       operand:

       <b>-d </b><i>path</i>   A pathname of a directory to be used as a root
                 directory for the SCCS files. The default shall be the
                 current directory. The <b>-d </b>option shall take precedence
                 over the <i>PROJECTDIR</i> variable. See <b>-p</b>.

       <b>-p </b><i>path</i>   A pathname of a directory in which the SCCS files are
                 located. The default shall be the <b>SCCS </b>directory.

                 The <b>-p </b>option differs from the <b>-d </b>option in that the <b>-d</b>
                 option-argument shall be prefixed to the entire
                 pathname and the <b>-p </b>option-argument shall be inserted
                 before the final component of the pathname. For
                 example:

                     sccs -d /x -p y get a/b

                 converts to:

                     get /x/a/y/s.b

                 This allows the creation of aliases such as:

                     alias syssccs="sccs -d /usr/src"

                 which is used as:

                     syssccs get cmd/who.c

       <b>-r        </b>Invoke <i>command</i> with the real user ID of the process,
                 not any effective user ID that the <i>sccs</i> utility is set
                 to. Certain commands (<i>admin</i>, <b>check</b>, <b>clean</b>, <b>diffs</b>, <b>info</b>,
                 <i>rmdel</i>, and <b>tell</b>) cannot be run set-user-ID by all
                 users, since this would allow anyone to change the
                 authorizations. These commands are always run as the
                 real user.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>command</i>   An SCCS utility name or the name of one of the pseudo-
                 utilities listed in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

       <i>options</i>   An option or option-argument to be passed to <i>command</i>.

       <i>operands</i>  An operand to be passed to <i>command</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       See the utility description for the specified <i>command</i>.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       See the utility description for the specified <i>command</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>sccs</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>PROJECTDIR</i>
                 Provide a default value for the <b>-d </b><i>path</i> option. If the
                 value of <i>PROJECTDIR</i> begins with a &lt;slash&gt;, it shall be
                 considered an absolute pathname; otherwise, the value
                 of <i>PROJECTDIR</i> is treated as a user name and that user's
                 initial working directory shall be examined for a
                 subdirectory <b>src </b>or <b>source</b>.  If such a directory is
                 found, it shall be used. Otherwise, the value shall be
                 used as a relative pathname.

       Additional environment variable effects may be found in the
       utility description for the specified <i>command</i>.

</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The following pseudo-utilities shall be supported as <i>command</i>
       operands. All options referred to in the following list are
       values given in the <i>options</i> operands following <i>command</i>.

       <b>check   </b>Equivalent to <b>info</b>, except that nothing shall be printed
               if nothing is being edited, and a non-zero exit status
               shall be returned if anything is being edited. The intent
               is to have this included in an ``install'' entry in a
               makefile to ensure that everything is included into the
               SCCS file before a version is installed.

       <b>clean   </b>Remove everything from the current directory that can be
               recreated from SCCS files, but do not remove any files
               being edited. If the <b>-b </b>option is given, branches shall
               be ignored in the determination of whether they are being
               edited; this is dangerous if branches are kept in the
               same directory.

       <b>create  </b>Create an SCCS file, taking the initial contents from the
               file of the same name. Any options to <i>admin</i> are accepted.
               If the creation is successful, the original files shall
               be renamed by prefixing the basenames with a comma. These
               renamed files should be removed after it has been
               verified that the SCCS files have been created
               successfully.

       <b>delget  </b>Perform a <i>delta</i> on the named files and then <i>get</i> new
               versions. The new versions shall have ID keywords
               expanded and shall not be editable. Any <b>-m</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-s</b>,
               and <b>-y </b>options shall be passed to <i>delta</i>, and any <b>-b</b>, <b>-c</b>,
               <b>-e</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-k</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-s</b>, and <b>-x </b>options shall be passed to
               <i>get</i>.

       <b>deledit </b>Equivalent to <b>delget</b>, except that the <i>get</i> phase shall
               include the <b>-e </b>option. This option is useful for making a
               checkpoint of the current editing phase. The same options
               shall be passed to <i>delta</i> as described above, and all the
               options listed for <i>get</i> above except <b>-e </b>shall be passed to
               <b>edit</b>.

       <b>diffs   </b>Write a difference listing between the current version of
               the files checked out for editing and the versions in
               SCCS format. Any <b>-r</b>, <b>-c</b>, <b>-i</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-t </b>options shall be
               passed to <i>get</i>; any <b>-l</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-h</b>, and <b>-b </b>options
               shall be passed to <i>diff</i>.  A <b>-C </b>option shall be passed to
               <i>diff</i> as <b>-c</b>.

       <b>edit    </b>Equivalent to <i>get</i> <b>-e</b>.

       <b>fix     </b>Remove the named delta, but leave a copy of the delta
               with the changes that were in it. It is useful for fixing
               small compiler bugs, and so on. The application shall
               ensure that it is followed by a <b>-r </b><i>SID</i> option. Since <b>fix</b>
               does not leave audit trails, it should be used carefully.

       <b>info    </b>Write a listing of all files being edited. If the <b>-b</b>
               option is given, branches (that is, SIDs with two or
               fewer components) shall be ignored. If a <b>-u </b><i>user</i> option
               is given, then only files being edited by the named user
               shall be listed. A <b>-U </b>option shall be equivalent to
               <b>-u</b>&lt;<i>current user</i>&gt;.

       <b>print   </b>Write out verbose information about the named files,
               equivalent to <i>sccs prs</i>.

       <b>tell    </b>Write a &lt;newline&gt;-separated list of the files being
               edited to standard output. Takes the <b>-b</b>, <b>-u</b>, and <b>-U</b>
               options like <b>info </b>and <b>check</b>.

       <b>unedit  </b>This is the opposite of an <b>edit </b>or a <i>get</i> <b>-e</b>.  It should
               be used with caution, since any changes made since the
               <i>get</i> are lost.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Many of the SCCS utilities take directory names as operands as
       well as specific filenames. The pseudo-utilities supported by
       <i>sccs</i> are not described as having this capability, but are not
       prohibited from doing so.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. To get a file for editing, edit it and produce a new delta:

               sccs get -e file.c
               ex file.c
               sccs delta file.c

        2. To get a file from another directory:

               sccs -p /usr/src/sccs/s. get cc.c

           or:

               sccs get /usr/src/sccs/s.cc.c

        3. To make a delta of a large number of files in the current
           directory:

               sccs delta *.c

        4. To get a list of files being edited that are not on branches:

               sccs info -b

        5. To delta everything being edited by the current user:

               sccs delta $(sccs tell -U)

        6. In a makefile, to get source files from an SCCS file if it
           does not already exist:

               SRCS = &lt;<i>list of source files</i>&gt;
               $(SRCS):
                   sccs get $(REL) $@
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       <i>sccs</i> and its associated utilities are part of the XSI Development
       Utilities option within the XSI option.

       SCCS is an abbreviation for Source Code Control System. It is a
       maintenance and enhancement tracking tool. When a file is put
       under SCCS, the source code control system maintains the file
       and, when changes are made, identifies and stores them in the
       file with the original source code and/or documentation. As other
       changes are made, they too are identified and retained in the
       file.

       Retrieval of the original and any set of changes is possible. Any
       version of the file as it develops can be reconstructed for
       inspection or additional modification. History data can be stored
       with each version, documenting why the changes were made, who
       made them, and when they were made.
