PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cflow — generate a C-language flowgraph (<b>DEVELOPMENT</b>)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       cflow <b>[</b>-r<b>] [</b>-d <i>num</i><b>] [</b>-D <i>name</i><b>[</b>=<i>def</i><b>]]</b>... <b>[</b>-i <i>incl</i><b>] [</b>-I <i>dir</i><b>]</b>...
           <b>[</b>-U <i>dir</i><b>]</b>... <i>file</i>...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cflow</i> utility shall analyze a collection of object files or
       assembler, C-language, <i>lex</i>, or <i>yacc</i> source files, and attempt to
       build a graph, written to standard output, charting the external
       references.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>cflow</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>, except
       that the order of the <b>-D</b>, <b>-I</b>, and <b>-U </b>options (which are identical
       to their interpretation by <i>c99</i>) is significant.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-d </b><i>num</i>    Indicate the depth at which the flowgraph is cut off.
                 The application shall ensure that the argument <i>num</i> is a
                 decimal integer. By default this is a very large number
                 (typically greater than 32000). Attempts to set the
                 cut-off depth to a non-positive integer shall be
                 ignored.

       <b>-i </b><i>incl</i>   Increase the number of included symbols. The <i>incl</i>
                 option-argument is one of the following characters:

                 <i>x</i>     Include external and static data symbols. The
                       default shall be to include only functions in the
                       flowgraph.

                 _     (Underscore) Include names that begin with an
                       &lt;underscore&gt;.  The default shall be to exclude
                       these functions (and data if <b>-i x </b>is used).

       <b>-r        </b>Reverse the caller:callee relationship, producing an
                 inverted listing showing the callers of each function.
                 The listing shall also be sorted in lexicographical
                 order by callee.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand is supported:

       <i>file</i>      The pathname of a file for which a graph is to be
                 generated.  Filenames suffixed by <b>.l </b>shall shall be
                 taken to be <i>lex</i> input, <b>.y </b>as <i>yacc</i> input, <b>.c </b>as <i>c99</i>
                 input, and <b>.i </b>as the output of <i>c99</i> <b>-E</b>.  Such files
                 shall be processed as appropriate, determined by their
                 suffix.

                 Files suffixed by <b>.s </b>(conventionally assembler source)
                 may have more limited information extracted from them.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The input files shall be object files or assembler, C-language,
       <i>lex</i>, or <i>yacc</i> source files.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>cflow</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the ordering of the output
                 when the <b>-r </b>option is used.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The flowgraph written to standard output shall be formatted as
       follows:

           "%d %s:%s\n", &lt;<i>reference number</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>global</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>definition</i>&gt;

       Each line of output begins with a reference (that is, line)
       number, followed by indentation of at least one column position
       per level.  This is followed by the name of the global, a
       &lt;colon&gt;, and its definition. Normally globals are only functions
       not defined as an external or beginning with an &lt;underscore&gt;; see
       the OPTIONS section for the <b>-i </b>inclusion option. For information
       extracted from C-language source, the definition consists of an
       abstract type declaration (for example, <b>char *</b>) and, delimited by
       angle brackets, the name of the source file and the line number
       where the definition was found. Definitions extracted from object
       files indicate the filename and location counter under which the
       symbol appeared (for example, <i>text</i>).

       Once a definition of a name has been written, subsequent
       references to that name contain only the reference number of the
       line where the definition can be found. For undefined references,
       only <b>"&lt;&gt;" </b>shall be written.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       Files produced by <i>lex</i> and <i>yacc</i> cause the reordering of line
       number declarations, and this can confuse <i>cflow</i>.  To obtain
       proper results, the input of <i>yacc</i> or <i>lex</i> must be directed to
       <i>cflow</i>.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Given the following in <b>file.c</b>:

           int i;
           int f();
           int g();
           int h();
           int
           main()
           {
               f();
               g();
               f();
           }
           int
           f()
           {
               i = h();
           }

       The command:

           cflow -i x file.c

       produces the output:

           1 main: int(), &lt;file.c 6&gt;
           2    f: int(), &lt;file.c 13&gt;
           3        h: &lt;&gt;
           4        i: int, &lt;file.c 1&gt;
           5    g: &lt;&gt;
