NAME </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdabind2 </b>- BIND performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       This PMDA extracts performance data from BIND (Berkeley Internet
       Name Domain).  It enables collection of most of the statistics
       metrics from the Bind server version 9 or later, which includes:

       • overall memory statistics

       • overall per-query statistics (general queries, EDNS/truncated
         responses, Update/Notify/AXFR/IXFR messages)

       • overall error statistics (Rejected, SERVFAIL, Update/XFR
         failures ...)

       • overall statistics per transport protocol, EDNS and per version
         of IP protocol

       • resolver statistics (successes, errors, round-trip times in
         several ranges)

       • detailed per-socket statistics with respect to the transport
         protocol and IP version including errors

       • detailed per-file-descriptor statistics including errors

       The PMDA performs per-second collection of the whole data set
       (148 metrics on the test environment) with modest requirements
       (2% CPU usage on Intel i7-4700MQ @2.4 GHz, cca 30 MB RAM).

       If more than 1 requests/sec is performed, the memoized values are
       used so that the statistics interface of the Bind server does not
       get overloaded.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       Configure BIND to export XML statistics via its REST interface.
       This requires BIND configuration to enable statistics exporting
       locally (at least).

           <b>statistics-channels {</b>
               <b>inet 127.0.0.1 port 8080 allow { 127.0.0.1; };</b>
           <b>}</b>
           <b>options { zone-statistics yes; }</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       The hostname (localhost), port (8080 above) and other
       configuration information must be specified in both the BIND
       configuration file as well as the $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/bind2.conf
       file.

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2</b>
           <b># [ edit bind2.conf ]</b>
             <b>host=localhost.localdomain:8080</b>

       Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
       bind2 performance metrics by doing the following as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2</b>
           <b># ./Install</b>

       To uninstall, the following must be done as root:

           <b># cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2</b>
           <b># ./Remove</b>

       <b>pmdabind2 </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/bind2.conf</b>
           mandatory configuration file listing monitored bind2
           instances

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/Install</b>
           installation script for the <b>pmdabind2 </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bind2/Remove</b>
           undo installation script for the <b>pmdabind2 </b>agent

       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/bind2.log</b>
           default log file for error messages from <b>pmdabind2</b>
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by <b>PCP</b>. On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
