NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-request-pull - Generates a summary of pending changes
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git request-pull</i> [-p] &lt;start&gt; &lt;URL&gt; [&lt;end&gt;]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Generate a request asking your upstream project to pull changes
       into their tree. The request, printed to the standard output,
       begins with the branch description, summarizes the changes, and
       indicates from where they can be pulled.

       The upstream project is expected to have the commit named by
       <b>&lt;start&gt; </b>and the output asks it to integrate the changes you made
       since that commit, up to the commit named by <b>&lt;end&gt;</b>, by visiting
       the repository named by <b>&lt;URL&gt;</b>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -p
           Include patch text in the output.

       &lt;start&gt;
           Commit to start at. This names a commit that is already in
           the upstream history.

       &lt;URL&gt;
           The repository URL to be pulled from.

       &lt;end&gt;
           Commit to end at (defaults to HEAD). This names the commit at
           the tip of the history you are asking to be pulled.

           When the repository named by <b>&lt;URL&gt; </b>has the commit at a tip of
           a ref that is different from the ref you have locally, you
           can use the <b>&lt;local&gt;:&lt;remote&gt; </b>syntax, to have its local name,
           a colon <b>:</b>, and its remote name.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       Imagine that you built your work on your <b>master </b>branch on top of
       the <b>v1.0 </b>release, and want it to be integrated into the project.
       First you push that change to your public repository for others
       to see:

           git push <a href="https://git.ko.xz/project">https://git.ko.xz/project</a> master

       Then, you run this command:

           git request-pull v1.0 <a href="https://git.ko.xz/project">https://git.ko.xz/project</a> master

       which will produce a request to the upstream, summarizing the
       changes between the <b>v1.0 </b>release and your <b>master</b>, to pull it from
       your public repository.

       If you pushed your change to a branch whose name is different
       from the one you have locally, e.g.

           git push <a href="https://git.ko.xz/project">https://git.ko.xz/project</a> master:for-linus

       then you can ask that to be pulled with

           git request-pull v1.0 <a href="https://git.ko.xz/project">https://git.ko.xz/project</a> master:for-linus
