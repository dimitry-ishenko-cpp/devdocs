PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       du — estimate file space usage
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       du <b>[</b>-a|-s<b>] [</b>-kx<b>] [</b>-H|-L<b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       By default, the <i>du</i> utility shall write to standard output the
       size of the file space allocated to, and the size of the file
       space allocated to each subdirectory of, the file hierarchy
       rooted in each of the specified files. By default, when a
       symbolic link is encountered on the command line or in the file
       hierarchy, <i>du</i> shall count the size of the symbolic link (rather
       than the file referenced by the link), and shall not follow the
       link to another portion of the file hierarchy. The size of the
       file space allocated to a file of type directory shall be defined
       as the sum total of space allocated to all files in the file
       hierarchy rooted in the directory plus the space allocated to the
       directory itself.

       When <i>du</i> cannot <i>stat</i>() files or <i>stat</i>() or read directories, it
       shall report an error condition and the final exit status is
       affected. A file that occurs multiple times under one file
       operand and that has a link count greater than 1 shall be counted
       and written for only one entry. It is implementation-defined
       whether a file that has a link count no greater than 1 is counted
       and written just once, or is counted and written for each
       occurrence. It is implementation-defined whether a file that
       occurs under one file operand is counted for other file operands.
       The directory entry that is selected in the report is
       unspecified. By default, file sizes shall be written in 512-byte
       units, rounded up to the next 512-byte unit.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>du</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-a        </b>In addition to the default output, report the size of
                 each file not of type directory in the file hierarchy
                 rooted in the specified file.  The <b>-a </b>option shall not
                 affect whether non-directories given as <i>file</i> operands
                 are listed.

       <b>-H        </b>If a symbolic link is specified on the command line, <i>du</i>
                 shall count the size of the file or file hierarchy
                 referenced by the link.

       <b>-k        </b>Write the files sizes in units of 1024 bytes, rather
                 than the default 512-byte units.

       <b>-L        </b>If a symbolic link is specified on the command line or
                 encountered during the traversal of a file hierarchy,
                 <i>du</i> shall count the size of the file or file hierarchy
                 referenced by the link.

       <b>-s        </b>Instead of the default output, report only the total
                 sum for each of the specified files.

       <b>-x        </b>When evaluating file sizes, evaluate only those files
                 that have the same device as the file specified by the
                 <i>file</i> operand.

       Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options <b>-H </b>and
       <b>-L </b>shall not be considered an error. The last option specified
       shall determine the behavior of the utility.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      The pathname of a file whose size is to be written. If
                 no <i>file</i> is specified, the current directory shall be
                 used.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>du</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The use of 512-byte units is historical practice and maintains
       compatibility with <i>ls</i> and other utilities in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. This does not mandate that the file system itself
       be based on 512-byte blocks. The <b>-k </b>option was added as a
       compromise measure. It was agreed by the standard developers that
       512 bytes was the best default unit because of its complete
       historical consistency on System V (<i>versus</i> the mixed
       512/1024-byte usage on BSD systems), and that a <b>-k </b>option to
       switch to 1024-byte units was a good compromise. Users who prefer
       the 1024-byte quantity can easily alias <i>du</i> to <i>du</i> <b>-k </b>without
       breaking the many historical scripts relying on the 512-byte
       units.

       The <b>-b </b>option was added to an early proposal to provide a
       resolution to the situation where System V and BSD systems give
       figures for file sizes in <i>blocks</i>, which is an implementation-
       defined concept. (In common usage, the block size is 512 bytes
       for System V and 1024 bytes for BSD systems.)  However, <b>-b </b>was
       later deleted, since the default was eventually decided as
       512-byte units.

       Historical file systems provided no way to obtain exact figures
       for the space allocation given to files. There are two known
       areas of inaccuracies in historical file systems: cases of
       <i>indirect blocks</i> being used by the file system or <i>sparse</i> files
       yielding incorrectly high values. An indirect block is space used
       by the file system in the storage of the file, but that need not
       be counted in the space allocated to the file. A <i>sparse</i> file is
       one in which an <i>lseek</i>() call has been made to a position beyond
       the end of the file and data has subsequently been written at
       that point. A file system need not allocate all the intervening
       zero-filled blocks to such a file. It is up to the implementation
       to define exactly how accurate its methods are.

       The <b>-a </b>and <b>-s </b>options were mutually-exclusive in the original
       version of <i>du</i>.  The POSIX Shell and Utilities description is
       implied by the language in the SVID where <b>-s </b>is described as
       causing ``only the grand total'' to be reported. Some systems may
       produce output for <b>-sa</b>, but a Strictly Conforming POSIX Shell and
       Utilities Application cannot use that combination.

       The <b>-a </b>and <b>-s </b>options were adopted from the SVID except that the
       System V behavior of not listing non-directories explicitly given
       as operands, unless the <b>-a </b>option is specified, was considered a
       bug; the BSD-based behavior (report for all operands) is
       mandated. The default behavior of <i>du</i> in the SVID with regard to
       reporting the failure to read files (it produces no messages) was
       considered counter-intuitive, and thus it was specified that the
       POSIX Shell and Utilities default behavior shall be to produce
       such messages. These messages can be turned off with shell
       redirection to achieve the System V behavior.

       The <b>-x </b>option is historical practice on recent BSD systems. It
       has been adopted by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because there was
       no other historical method of limiting the <i>du</i> search to a single
       file hierarchy. This limitation of the search is necessary to
       make it possible to obtain file space usage information about a
       file system on which other file systems are mounted, without
       having to resort to a lengthy <i>find</i> and <i>awk</i> script.
</pre> <h2>
FUTURE DIRECTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       A future version of this standard may require that a file that
       occurs multiple times shall be counted and written for only one
       entry, even if the occurrences are under different file operands.
