</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-upload-archive - Send archive back to git-archive
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git upload-archive</i> &lt;repository&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Invoked by <i>git archive --remote</i> and sends a generated archive to
       the other end over the Git protocol.

       This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The
       UI for the protocol is on the <i>git archive</i> side, and the program
       pair is meant to be used to get an archive from a remote
       repository.
</pre> <h2>
SECURITY </h2>
<pre>
       In order to protect the privacy of objects that have been removed
       from history but may not yet have been pruned, <b>git-upload-archive</b>
       avoids serving archives for commits and trees that are not
       reachable from the repository’s refs. However, because
       calculating object reachability is computationally expensive,
       <b>git-upload-archive </b>implements a stricter but easier-to-check set
       of rules:

        1. Clients may request a commit or tree that is pointed to
           directly by a ref. E.g., <b>git archive --remote=origin v1.0</b>.

        2. Clients may request a sub-tree within a commit or tree using
           the <b>ref:path </b>syntax. E.g., <b>git archive --remote=origin</b>
           <b>v1.0:Documentation</b>.

        3. Clients may <i>not</i> use other sha1 expressions, even if the end
           result is reachable. E.g., neither a relative commit like
           <b>master^ </b>nor a literal sha1 like <b>abcd1234 </b>is allowed, even if
           the result is reachable from the refs.

       Note that rule 3 disallows many cases that do not have any
       privacy implications. These rules are subject to change in future
       versions of git, and the server accessed by <b>git archive --remote</b>
       may or may not follow these exact rules.

       If the config option <b>uploadArchive.allowUnreachable </b>is true,
       these rules are ignored, and clients may use arbitrary sha1
       expressions. This is useful if you do not care about the privacy
       of unreachable objects, or if your object database is already
       publicly available for access via non-smart-http.
