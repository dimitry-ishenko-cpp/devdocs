PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       uucp — system-to-system copy
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       uucp <b>[</b>-cCdfjmr<b>] [</b>-n <i>user</i><b>] </b><i>source-file</i>... <i>destination-file</i>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>uucp</i> utility shall copy files named by the <i>source-file</i>
       argument to the <i>destination-file</i> argument. The files named can be
       on local or remote systems.

       The <i>uucp</i> utility cannot guarantee support for all character
       encodings in all circumstances. For example, transmission data
       may be restricted to 7 bits by the underlying network, 8-bit data
       and filenames need not be portable to non-internationalized
       systems, and so on. Under these circumstances, it is recommended
       that only characters defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
       International Reference Version (equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range
       of characters be used, and that only characters defined in the
       portable filename character set be used for naming files. The
       protocol for transfer of files is unspecified by POSIX.1‐2008.

       Typical implementations of this utility require a communications
       line configured to use the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i>, but other
       communications means may be used. On systems where there are no
       available communications means (either temporarily or
       permanently), this utility shall write an error message
       describing the problem and exit with a non-zero exit status.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>uucp</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-c        </b>Do not copy local file to the spool directory for
                 transfer to the remote machine (default).

       <b>-C        </b>Force the copy of local files to the spool directory
                 for transfer.

       <b>-d        </b>Make all necessary directories for the file copy
                 (default).

       <b>-f        </b>Do not make intermediate directories for the file copy.

       <b>-j        </b>Write the job identification string to standard output.
                 This job identification can be used by <i>uustat</i> to obtain
                 the status or terminate a job.

       <b>-m        </b>Send mail to the requester when the copy is completed.

       <b>-n </b><i>user</i>   Notify <i>user</i> on the remote system that a file was sent.

       <b>-r        </b>Do not start the file transfer; just queue the job.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>destination-file</i>, <i>source-file</i>
                 A pathname of a file to be copied to, or from,
                 respectively. Either name can be a pathname on the
                 local machine, or can have the form:

                     <i>system-name</i>!<i>pathname</i>

                 where <i>system-name</i> is taken from a list of system names
                 that <i>uucp</i> knows about.  The destination <i>system-name</i> can
                 also be a list of names such as:

                     <i>system-name</i>!<i>system-name</i>!...!<i>system-name</i>!<i>pathname</i>

                 in which case, an attempt is made to send the file via
                 the specified route to the destination. Care should be
                 taken to ensure that intermediate nodes in the route
                 are willing to forward information.

                 The shell pattern matching notation characters <b>'?'</b>,
                 <b>'*'</b>, and <b>"[...]" </b>appearing in <i>pathname</i> shall be
                 expanded on the appropriate system.

                 Pathnames can be one of:

                  1. An absolute pathname.

                  2. A pathname preceded by ~<i>user</i> where <i>user</i> is a login
                     name on the specified system and is replaced by
                     that user's login directory. Note that if an
                     invalid login is specified, the default is to the
                     public directory (called <i>PUBDIR</i>; the actual
                     location of <i>PUBDIR</i> is implementation-defined).

                  3. A pathname preceded by ~/<i>destination</i> where
                     <i>destination</i> is appended to <i>PUBDIR</i>.

                     <b>Note:  </b>This destination is treated as a filename
                            unless more than one file is being
                            transferred by this request or the
                            destination is already a directory. To
                            ensure that it is a directory, follow the
                            destination with a <b>'/'</b>.  For example, <b>~/dan/</b>
                            as the destination makes the directory
                            <b>PUBDIR/dan </b>if it does not exist and puts the
                            requested files in that directory.

                  4. Anything else shall be prefixed by the current
                     directory.

                 If the result is an erroneous pathname for the remote
                 system, the copy shall fail. If the <i>destination-file</i> is
                 a directory, the last part of the <i>source-file</i> name
                 shall be used.

                 The read, write, and execute permissions given by <i>uucp</i>
                 are implementation-defined.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The files to be copied are regular files.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>uucp</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_COLLATE</i>
                 Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                 equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                 elements within bracketed filename patterns.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files) and the
                 behavior of character classes within bracketed filename
                 patterns (for example, <b>"'[[:lower:]]*'"</b>).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error, and informative messages written to
                 standard output.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       The output files (which may be on other systems) are copies of
       the input files.

       If <b>-m </b>is used, mail files are modified.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       This utility is part of the UUCP Utilities option and need not be
       supported by all implementations.

       The domain of remotely accessible files can (and for obvious
       security reasons usually should) be severely restricted.

       Note that the <b>'!'  </b>character in addresses has to be escaped when
       using <i>csh</i> as a command interpreter because of its history
       substitution syntax.  For <i>ksh</i> and <i>sh</i> the escape is not necessary,
       but may be used.

       As noted above, shell metacharacters appearing in pathnames are
       expanded on the appropriate system. On an internationalized
       system, this is done under the control of local settings of
       <i>LC_COLLATE</i> and <i>LC_CTYPE</i>.  Thus, care should be taken when using
       bracketed filename patterns, as collation and typing rules may
       vary from one system to another. Also be aware that certain types
       of expression (that is, equivalence classes, character classes,
       and collating symbols) need not be supported on non-
       internationalized systems.
