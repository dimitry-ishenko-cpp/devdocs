</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       dh_perl - calculates Perl dependencies and cleans up after
       MakeMaker
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_perl </b>[<i>debhelper options</i>] [<b>-d</b>] [<i>library dirs</i> ...]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>dh_perl </b>is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating
       the <b>${perl:Depends} </b>substitutions and adding them to substvars
       files.

       The program will look at Perl scripts and modules in your
       package, and will use this information to generate a dependency
       on <b>perl </b>or <b>perlapi</b>. The dependency will be substituted into your
       package's <i>control</i> file wherever you place the token
       <b>${perl:Depends}</b>.

       <b>dh_perl </b>also cleans up empty directories that MakeMaker can
       generate when installing Perl modules.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-d  </b>In some specific cases you may want to depend on <b>perl-base</b>
           rather than the full <b>perl </b>package. If so, you can pass the -d
           option to make <b>dh_perl </b>generate a dependency on the correct
           base package. This is only necessary for some packages that
           are included in the base system.

           Note that this flag may cause no dependency on <b>perl-base </b>to
           be generated at all. <b>perl-base </b>is Essential, so its
           dependency can be left out, unless a versioned dependency is
           needed.

       <b>-V  </b>By default, scripts and architecture independent modules
           don't depend on any specific version of <b>perl</b>. The <b>-V </b>option
           causes the current version of the <b>perl </b>(or <b>perl-base </b>with <b>-d</b>)
           package to be specified.

       <i>library dirs</i>
           If your package installs Perl modules in non-standard
           directories, you can make <b>dh_perl </b>check those directories by
           passing their names on the command line. It will only check
           the <i>vendorlib</i> and <i>vendorarch</i> directories by default.
