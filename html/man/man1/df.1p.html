PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       df — report free disk space
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       df <b>[</b>-k<b>] [</b>-P|-t<b>] [</b><i>file</i>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>df</i> utility shall write the amount of available space and file
       slots for file systems on which the invoking user has appropriate
       read access. File systems shall be specified by the <i>file</i>
       operands; when none are specified, information shall be written
       for all file systems. The format of the default output from <i>df</i> is
       unspecified, but all space figures are reported in 512-byte
       units, unless the <b>-k </b>option is specified. This output shall
       contain at least the file system names, amount of available space
       on each of these file systems, and, if no options other than <b>-t</b>
       are specified, the number of free file slots, or <i>inode</i>s,
       available; when <b>-t </b>is specified, the output shall contain the
       total allocated space as well.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>df</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-k        </b>Use 1024-byte units, instead of the default 512-byte
                 units, when writing space figures.

       <b>-P        </b>Produce output in the format described in the STDOUT
                 section.

       <b>-t        </b>Include total allocated-space figures in the output.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <i>file</i>      A pathname of a file within the hierarchy of the
                 desired file system.  If a file other than a FIFO, a
                 regular file, a directory, or a special file
                 representing the device containing the file system (for
                 example, <b>/dev/dsk/0s1</b>) is specified, the results are
                 unspecified. If the <i>file</i> operand names a file other
                 than a special file containing a file system, <i>df</i> shall
                 write the amount of free space in the file system
                 containing the specified <i>file</i> operand.  Otherwise, <i>df</i>
                 shall write the amount of free space in that file
                 system.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>df</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error and informative messages written to
                 standard output.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       When both the <b>-k </b>and <b>-P </b>options are specified, the following
       header line shall be written (in the POSIX locale):

           "Filesystem 1024-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on\n"

       When the <b>-P </b>option is specified without the <b>-k </b>option, the
       following header line shall be written (in the POSIX locale):

           "Filesystem 512-blocks Used Available Capacity Mounted on\n"

       The implementation may adjust the spacing of the header line and
       the individual data lines so that the information is presented in
       orderly columns.

       The remaining output with <b>-P </b>shall consist of one line of
       information for each specified file system. These lines shall be
       formatted as follows:

           "%s %d %d %d %d%% %s\n", &lt;<i>file system name</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>total space</i>&gt;,
               &lt;<i>space used</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>space free</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>percentage used</i>&gt;,
               &lt;<i>file system root</i>&gt;

       In the following list, all quantities expressed in 512-byte units
       (1024-byte when <b>-k </b>is specified) shall be rounded up to the next
       higher unit. The fields are:

       &lt;<i>file system name</i>&gt;
                 The name of the file system, in an implementation-
                 defined format.

       &lt;<i>total space</i>&gt;
                 The total size of the file system in 512-byte units.
                 The exact meaning of this figure is implementation-
                 defined, but should include &lt;<i>space used</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>space free</i>&gt;,
                 plus any space reserved by the system not normally
                 available to a user.

       &lt;<i>space used</i>&gt;
                 The total amount of space allocated to existing files
                 in the file system, in 512-byte units.

       &lt;<i>space free</i>&gt;
                 The total amount of space available within the file
                 system for the creation of new files by unprivileged
                 users, in 512-byte units. When this figure is less than
                 or equal to zero, it shall not be possible to create
                 any new files on the file system without first deleting
                 others, unless the process has appropriate privileges.
                 The figure written may be less than zero.

       &lt;<i>percentage used</i>&gt;
                 The percentage of the normally available space that is
                 currently allocated to all files on the file system.
                 This shall be calculated using the fraction:

                     &lt;<i>space used</i>&gt;/( &lt;<i>space used</i>&gt;+ &lt;<i>space free</i>&gt;)

                 expressed as a percentage. This percentage may be
                 greater than 100 if &lt;<i>space free</i>&gt; is less than zero. The
                 percentage value shall be expressed as a positive
                 integer, with any fractional result causing it to be
                 rounded to the next highest integer.

       &lt;<i>file system root</i>&gt;
                 The directory below which the file system hierarchy
                 appears.

       The output format is unspecified when <b>-t </b>is used.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       On most systems, the ``name of the file system, in an
       implementation-defined format'' is the special file on which the
       file system is mounted.

       On large file systems, the calculation specified for percentage
       used can create huge rounding errors.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. The following example writes portable information about the
           <b>/usr </b>file system:

               df -P /usr

        2. Assuming that <b>/usr/src </b>is part of the <b>/usr </b>file system, the
           following produces the same output as the previous example:

               df -P /usr/src
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The behavior of <i>df</i> with the <b>-P </b>option is the default action of
       the 4.2 BSD <i>df</i> utility. The uppercase <b>-P </b>was selected to avoid
       collision with a known industry extension using <b>-p</b>.

       Historical <i>df</i> implementations vary considerably in their default
       output. It was therefore necessary to describe the default output
       in a loose manner to accommodate all known historical
       implementations and to add a portable option (<b>-P</b>) to provide
       information in a portable format.

       The use of 512-byte units is historical practice and maintains
       compatibility with <i>ls</i> and other utilities in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017. This does not mandate that the file system itself
       be based on 512-byte blocks. The <b>-k </b>option was added as a
       compromise measure. It was agreed by the standard developers that
       512 bytes was the best default unit because of its complete
       historical consistency on System V (<i>versus</i> the mixed
       512/1024-byte usage on BSD systems), and that a <b>-k </b>option to
       switch to 1024-byte units was a good compromise. Users who prefer
       the more logical 1024-byte quantity can easily alias <i>df</i> to <i>df</i> <b>-k</b>
       without breaking many historical scripts relying on the 512-byte
       units.

       It was suggested that <i>df</i> and the various related utilities be
       modified to access a <i>BLOCKSIZE</i> environment variable to achieve
       consistency and user acceptance. Since this is not historical
       practice on any system, it is left as a possible area for system
       extensions and will be re-evaluated in a future version if it is
       widely implemented.
