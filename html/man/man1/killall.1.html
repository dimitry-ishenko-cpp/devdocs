DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>killall  </b>sends  a  signal  to  all  processes  running any of the
       specified commands.  If no signal name is specified,  SIGTERM  is
       sent.

       Signals can be specified either by name (e.g. <b>-HUP </b>or <b>-SIGHUP</b>) or
       by number (e.g. <b>-1</b>) or by option <b>-s</b>.

       If  the  command  name  is not regular expression (option <b>-r</b>) and
       contains a slash (<b>/</b>), processes executing  that  particular  file
       will be selected for killing, independent of their name.

       <b>killall  </b>returns  a  zero return code if at least one process has
       been killed for each listed command, or no commands  were  listed
       and  at  least one process matched the <b>-u </b>and <b>-Z </b>search criteria.
       <b>killall </b>returns non-zero otherwise.

       A <b>killall </b>process never kills itself (but may kill other  <b>killall</b>
       processes).
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-e</b>, <b>--exact</b>
              Require an exact match for very long names.  If a command
              name is longer than 15 characters, the full name may be
              unavailable (i.e.  it is swapped out).  In this case,
              <b>killall </b>will kill everything that matches within the first
              15 characters.  With <b>-e</b>, such entries are skipped.
              <b>killall </b>prints a message for each skipped entry if <b>-v </b>is
              specified in addition to <b>-e</b>.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--ignore-case</b>
              Do case insensitive process name match.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--process-group</b>
              Kill the process group to which the process belongs.  The
              kill signal is only sent once per group, even if multiple
              processes belonging to the same process group were found.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--interactive</b>
              Interactively ask for confirmation before killing.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              List all known signal names.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--ns</b>
              Match against the PID namespace of the given PID. The
              default is to match against all namespaces.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--older-than</b>
              Match only processes that are older (started before) the
              time specified.  The time is specified as a float then a
              unit.  The units are s,m,h,d,w,M,y for seconds, minutes,
              hours, days, weeks, months and years respectively.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Do not complain if no processes were killed.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--regexp</b>
              Interpret process name pattern as a POSIX extended regular
              expression, per <a href="../man3/regex.3.html">regex(3)</a>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--signal</b>, <b>-</b><i>SIGNAL</i>
              Send this signal instead of SIGTERM.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
              Kill only processes the specified user owns.  Command
              names are optional.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Report if the signal was successfully sent.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wait</b>
              Wait for all killed processes to die.  <b>killall </b>checks once
              per second if any of the killed processes still exist and
              only returns if none are left.  Note that <b>killall </b>may wait
              forever if the signal was ignored, had no effect, or if
              the process stays in zombie state.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--younger-than</b>
              Match only processes that are younger (started after) the
              time specified.  The time is specified as a float then a
              unit.  The units are s,m,h,d,w,M,y for seconds, minutes,
              hours, days, weeks, Months and years respectively.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--context</b>
              Specify security context: kill only processes having
              security context that match with given extended regular
              expression pattern.  Must precede other arguments on the
              command line.  Command names are optional.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       /proc  location of the proc file system
</pre> <h2>
KNOWN BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Killing by file only works for executables that are kept open
       during execution, i.e. impure executables can't be killed this
       way.

       Be warned that typing <b>killall </b><i>name</i> may not have the desired
       effect on non-Linux systems, especially when done by a privileged
       user.

       <b>killall -w </b>doesn't detect if a process disappears and is replaced
       by a new process with the same PID between scans.

       If processes change their name, <b>killall </b>may not be able to match
       them correctly.

       <b>killall </b>has a limit of names that can be specified on the command
       line.  This figure is the size of an unsigned long integer
       multiplied by 8.  For most 32 bit systems the limit is 32 and
       similarly for a 64 bit system the limit is usually 64.
