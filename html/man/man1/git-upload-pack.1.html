</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-upload-pack - Send objects packed back to git-fetch-pack
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git-upload-pack</i> [--[no-]strict] [--timeout=&lt;n&gt;] [--stateless-rpc]
                         [--advertise-refs] &lt;directory&gt;
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Invoked by <i>git fetch-pack</i>, learns what objects the other side is
       missing, and sends them after packing.

       This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The
       UI for the protocol is on the <i>git fetch-pack</i> side, and the
       program pair is meant to be used to pull updates from a remote
       repository. For push operations, see <i>git send-pack</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       --[no-]strict
           Do not try &lt;directory&gt;/.git/ if &lt;directory&gt; is not a Git
           directory.

       --timeout=&lt;n&gt;
           Interrupt transfer after &lt;n&gt; seconds of inactivity.

       --stateless-rpc
           Perform only a single read-write cycle with stdin and stdout.
           This fits with the HTTP POST request processing model where a
           program may read the request, write a response, and must
           exit.

       --http-backend-info-refs
           Used by <a href="git-http-backend.1.html">git-http-backend(1)</a> to serve up
           <b>$GIT_URL/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack </b>requests. See
           "Smart Clients" in <a href="../man5/gitprotocol-http.5.html">gitprotocol-http(5)</a> and "HTTP Transport"
           in the <a href="../man5/gitprotocol-v2.5.html">gitprotocol-v2(5)</a> documentation. Also understood by
           <a href="git-receive-pack.1.html">git-receive-pack(1)</a>.

       &lt;directory&gt;
           The repository to sync from.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b>
           Internal variable used for handshaking the wire protocol.
           Server admins may need to configure some transports to allow
           this variable to be passed. See the discussion in <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>.

       <b>GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH</b>
           When cloning or fetching from a partial repository (i.e., one
           itself cloned with <b>--filter</b>), the server-side <b>upload-pack </b>may
           need to fetch extra objects from its upstream in order to
           complete the request. By default, <b>upload-pack </b>will refuse to
           perform such a lazy fetch, because <b>git fetch </b>may run
           arbitrary commands specified in configuration and hooks of
           the source repository (and <b>upload-pack </b>tries to be safe to
           run even in untrusted <b>.git </b>directories).

           This is implemented by having <b>upload-pack </b>internally set the
           <b>GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH </b>variable to <b>1</b>. If you want to override it
           (because you are fetching from a partial clone, and you are
           sure you trust it), you can explicitly set <b>GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH</b>
           to <b>0</b>.
</pre> <h2>
SECURITY </h2>
<pre>
       Most Git commands should not be run in an untrusted <b>.git</b>
       directory (see the section <b>SECURITY </b>in <a href="git.1.html">git(1)</a>). <b>upload-pack </b>tries
       to avoid any dangerous configuration options or hooks from the
       repository it’s serving, making it safe to clone an untrusted
       directory and run commands on the resulting clone.

       For an extra level of safety, you may be able to run <b>upload-pack</b>
       as an alternate user. The details will be platform dependent, but
       on many systems you can run:

           git clone --no-local --upload-pack='sudo -u nobody git-upload-pack' ...
