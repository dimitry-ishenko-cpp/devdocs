</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects
       necessary to complete the given refs.

       You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time
       you push into it, by setting up <i>hooks</i> there. See documentation
       for <a href="git-receive-pack.1.html">git-receive-pack(1)</a>.

       When the command line does not specify where to push with the
       <b>&lt;repository&gt; </b>argument, <b>branch.*.remote </b>configuration for the
       current branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the
       configuration is missing, it defaults to <i>origin</i>.

       When the command line does not specify what to push with
       <b>&lt;refspec&gt;... </b>arguments or <b>--all</b>, <b>--mirror</b>, <b>--tags </b>options, the
       command finds the default <b>&lt;refspec&gt; </b>by consulting <b>remote.*.push</b>
       configuration, and if it is not found, honors <b>push.default</b>
       configuration to decide what to push (See <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> for the
       meaning of <b>push.default</b>).

       When neither the command-line nor the configuration specifies
       what to push, the default behavior is used, which corresponds to
       the <b>simple </b>value for <b>push.default</b>: the current branch is pushed
       to the corresponding upstream branch, but as a safety measure,
       the push is aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same
       name as the local one.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       &lt;repository&gt;
           The "remote" repository that is the destination of a push
           operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the
           section GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the
           section REMOTES below).

       &lt;refspec&gt;...
           Specify what destination ref to update with what source
           object. The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional
           plus <b>+</b>, followed by the source object &lt;src&gt;, followed by a
           colon <b>:</b>, followed by the destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.

           The &lt;src&gt; is often the name of the branch you would want to
           push, but it can be any arbitrary "SHA-1 expression", such as
           <b>master~4 </b>or <b>HEAD </b>(see <a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions(7)</a>).

           The &lt;dst&gt; tells which ref on the remote side is updated with
           this push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an
           actual ref must be named. If <b>git push [&lt;repository&gt;] </b>without
           any <b>&lt;refspec&gt; </b>argument is set to update some ref at the
           destination with <b>&lt;src&gt; </b>with <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.push</b>
           configuration variable, <b>:&lt;dst&gt; </b>part can be omitted—such a
           push will update a ref that <b>&lt;src&gt; </b>normally updates without
           any <b>&lt;refspec&gt; </b>on the command line. Otherwise, missing <b>:&lt;dst&gt;</b>
           means to update the same ref as the <b>&lt;src&gt;</b>.

           If &lt;dst&gt; doesn’t start with <b>refs/ </b>(e.g.  <b>refs/heads/master</b>)
           we will try to infer where in <b>refs/* </b>on the destination
           &lt;repository&gt; it belongs based on the type of &lt;src&gt; being
           pushed and whether &lt;dst&gt; is ambiguous.

           •   If &lt;dst&gt; unambiguously refers to a ref on the
               &lt;repository&gt; remote, then push to that ref.

           •   If &lt;src&gt; resolves to a ref starting with refs/heads/ or
               refs/tags/, then prepend that to &lt;dst&gt;.

           •   Other ambiguity resolutions might be added in the future,
               but for now any other cases will error out with an error
               indicating what we tried, and depending on the
               <b>advice.pushUnqualifiedRefname </b>configuration (see
               <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>) suggest what refs/ namespace you may have
               wanted to push to.

           The object referenced by &lt;src&gt; is used to update the &lt;dst&gt;
           reference on the remote side. Whether this is allowed depends
           on where in <b>refs/* </b>the &lt;dst&gt; reference lives as described in
           detail below, in those sections "update" means any
           modifications except deletes, which as noted after the next
           few sections are treated differently.

           The <b>refs/heads/* </b>namespace will only accept commit objects,
           and updates only if they can be fast-forwarded.

           The <b>refs/tags/* </b>namespace will accept any kind of object (as
           commits, trees and blobs can be tagged), and any updates to
           them will be rejected.

           It’s possible to push any type of object to any namespace
           outside of <b>refs/{tags,heads}/*</b>. In the case of tags and
           commits, these will be treated as if they were the commits
           inside <b>refs/heads/* </b>for the purposes of whether the update is
           allowed.

           I.e. a fast-forward of commits and tags outside
           <b>refs/{tags,heads}/* </b>is allowed, even in cases where what’s
           being fast-forwarded is not a commit, but a tag object which
           happens to point to a new commit which is a fast-forward of
           the commit the last tag (or commit) it’s replacing. Replacing
           a tag with an entirely different tag is also allowed, if it
           points to the same commit, as well as pushing a peeled tag,
           i.e. pushing the commit that existing tag object points to,
           or a new tag object which an existing commit points to.

           Tree and blob objects outside of <b>refs/{tags,heads}/* </b>will be
           treated the same way as if they were inside <b>refs/tags/*</b>, any
           update of them will be rejected.

           All of the rules described above about what’s not allowed as
           an update can be overridden by adding an the optional leading
           <b>+ </b>to a refspec (or using <b>--force </b>command line option). The
           only exception to this is that no amount of forcing will make
           the <b>refs/heads/* </b>namespace accept a non-commit object. Hooks
           and configuration can also override or amend these rules, see
           e.g.  <b>receive.denyNonFastForwards </b>in <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> and
           <b>pre-receive </b>and <b>update </b>in <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a>.

           Pushing an empty &lt;src&gt; allows you to delete the &lt;dst&gt; ref
           from the remote repository. Deletions are always accepted
           without a leading <b>+ </b>in the refspec (or <b>--force</b>), except when
           forbidden by configuration or hooks. See <b>receive.denyDeletes</b>
           in <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> and <b>pre-receive </b>and <b>update </b>in <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a>.

           The special refspec <b>: </b>(or <b>+: </b>to allow non-fast-forward
           updates) directs Git to push "matching" branches: for every
           branch that exists on the local side, the remote side is
           updated if a branch of the same name already exists on the
           remote side.

           <b>tag &lt;tag&gt; </b>means the same as <b>refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</b>.

       --all, --branches
           Push all branches (i.e. refs under <b>refs/heads/</b>); cannot be
           used with other &lt;refspec&gt;.

       --prune
           Remove remote branches that don’t have a local counterpart.
           For example a remote branch <b>tmp </b>will be removed if a local
           branch with the same name doesn’t exist any more. This also
           respects refspecs, e.g.  <b>git push --prune remote</b>
           <b>refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/* </b>would make sure that remote
           <b>refs/tmp/foo </b>will be removed if <b>refs/heads/foo </b>doesn’t exist.

       --mirror
           Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs
           under <b>refs/ </b>(which includes but is not limited to
           <b>refs/heads/</b>, <b>refs/remotes/</b>, and <b>refs/tags/</b>) be mirrored to
           the remote repository. Newly created local refs will be
           pushed to the remote end, locally updated refs will be force
           updated on the remote end, and deleted refs will be removed
           from the remote end. This is the default if the configuration
           option <b>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.mirror </b>is set.

       -n, --dry-run
           Do everything except actually send the updates.

       --porcelain
           Produce machine-readable output. The output status line for
           each ref will be tab-separated and sent to stdout instead of
           stderr. The full symbolic names of the refs will be given.

       -d, --delete
           All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository. This
           is the same as prefixing all refs with a colon.

       --tags
           All refs under <b>refs/tags </b>are pushed, in addition to refspecs
           explicitly listed on the command line.

       --follow-tags
           Push all the refs that would be pushed without this option,
           and also push annotated tags in <b>refs/tags </b>that are missing
           from the remote but are pointing at commit-ish that are
           reachable from the refs being pushed. This can also be
           specified with configuration variable <b>push.followTags</b>. For
           more information, see <b>push.followTags </b>in <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>.

       --[no-]signed, --signed=(true|false|if-asked)
           GPG-sign the push request to update refs on the receiving
           side, to allow it to be checked by the hooks and/or be
           logged. If <b>false </b>or <b>--no-signed</b>, no signing will be
           attempted. If <b>true </b>or <b>--signed</b>, the push will fail if the
           server does not support signed pushes. If set to <b>if-asked</b>,
           sign if and only if the server supports signed pushes. The
           push will also fail if the actual call to <b>gpg --sign </b>fails.
           See <a href="git-receive-pack.1.html">git-receive-pack(1)</a> for the details on the receiving end.

       --[no-]atomic
           Use an atomic transaction on the remote side if available.
           Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are
           updated. If the server does not support atomic pushes the
           push will fail.

       -o &lt;option&gt;, --push-option=&lt;option&gt;
           Transmit the given string to the server, which passes them to
           the pre-receive as well as the post-receive hook. The given
           string must not contain a NUL or LF character. When multiple
           <b>--push-option=&lt;option&gt; </b>are given, they are all sent to the
           other side in the order listed on the command line. When no
           <b>--push-option=&lt;option&gt; </b>is given from the command line, the
           values of configuration variable <b>push.pushOption </b>are used
           instead.

       --receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;, --exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;
           Path to the <i>git-receive-pack</i> program on the remote end.
           Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote repository over
           ssh, and you do not have the program in a directory on the
           default $PATH.

       --[no-]force-with-lease, --force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;,
       --force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;
           Usually, "git push" refuses to update a remote ref that is
           not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it.

           This option overrides this restriction if the current value
           of the remote ref is the expected value. "git push" fails
           otherwise.

           Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already
           published. You will have to bypass the "must fast-forward"
           rule in order to replace the history you originally published
           with the rebased history. If somebody else built on top of
           your original history while you are rebasing, the tip of the
           branch at the remote may advance with their commit, and
           blindly pushing with <b>--force </b>will lose their work.

           This option allows you to say that you expect the history you
           are updating is what you rebased and want to replace. If the
           remote ref still points at the commit you specified, you can
           be sure that no other people did anything to the ref. It is
           like taking a "lease" on the ref without explicitly locking
           it, and the remote ref is updated only if the "lease" is
           still valid.

           <b>--force-with-lease </b>alone, without specifying the details,
           will protect all remote refs that are going to be updated by
           requiring their current value to be the same as the
           remote-tracking branch we have for them.

           <b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</b>, without specifying the expected
           value, will protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to
           be updated, by requiring its current value to be the same as
           the remote-tracking branch we have for it.

           <b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt; </b>will protect the named
           ref (alone), if it is going to be updated, by requiring its
           current value to be the same as the specified value <b>&lt;expect&gt;</b>
           (which is allowed to be different from the remote-tracking
           branch we have for the refname, or we do not even have to
           have such a remote-tracking branch when this form is used).
           If <b>&lt;expect&gt; </b>is the empty string, then the named ref must not
           already exist.

           Note that all forms other than
           <b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt; </b>that specifies the
           expected current value of the ref explicitly are still
           experimental and their semantics may change as we gain
           experience with this feature.

           "--no-force-with-lease" will cancel all the previous
           --force-with-lease on the command line.

           A general note on safety: supplying this option without an
           expected value, i.e. as <b>--force-with-lease </b>or
           <b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt; </b>interacts very badly with
           anything that implicitly runs <b>git fetch </b>on the remote to be
           pushed to in the background, e.g.  <b>git fetch origin </b>on your
           repository in a cronjob.

           The protection it offers over <b>--force </b>is ensuring that
           subsequent changes your work wasn’t based on aren’t
           clobbered, but this is trivially defeated if some background
           process is updating refs in the background. We don’t have
           anything except the remote tracking info to go by as a
           heuristic for refs you’re expected to have seen &amp; are willing
           to clobber.

           If your editor or some other system is running <b>git fetch </b>in
           the background for you a way to mitigate this is to simply
           set up another remote:

               git remote add origin-push $(git config remote.origin.url)
               git fetch origin-push

           Now when the background process runs <b>git fetch origin </b>the
           references on <b>origin-push </b>won’t be updated, and thus commands
           like:

               git push --force-with-lease origin-push

           Will fail unless you manually run <b>git fetch origin-push</b>. This
           method is of course entirely defeated by something that runs
           <b>git fetch --all</b>, in that case you’d need to either disable it
           or do something more tedious like:

               git fetch              # update 'master' from remote
               git tag base master    # mark our base point
               git rebase -i master   # rewrite some commits
               git push --force-with-lease=master:base master:master

           I.e. create a <b>base </b>tag for versions of the upstream code that
           you’ve seen and are willing to overwrite, then rewrite
           history, and finally force push changes to <b>master </b>if the
           remote version is still at <b>base</b>, regardless of what your
           local <b>remotes/origin/master </b>has been updated to in the
           background.

           Alternatively, specifying <b>--force-if-includes </b>as an ancillary
           option along with <b>--force-with-lease[=&lt;refname&gt;] </b>(i.e.,
           without saying what exact commit the ref on the remote side
           must be pointing at, or which refs on the remote side are
           being protected) at the time of "push" will verify if updates
           from the remote-tracking refs that may have been implicitly
           updated in the background are integrated locally before
           allowing a forced update.

       -f, --force
           Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that is
           not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. Also,
           when <b>--force-with-lease </b>option is used, the command refuses
           to update a remote ref whose current value does not match
           what is expected.

           This flag disables these checks, and can cause the remote
           repository to lose commits; use it with care.

           Note that <b>--force </b>applies to all the refs that are pushed,
           hence using it with <b>push.default </b>set to <b>matching </b>or with
           multiple push destinations configured with <b>remote.*.push </b>may
           overwrite refs other than the current branch (including local
           refs that are strictly behind their remote counterpart). To
           force a push to only one branch, use a <b>+ </b>in front of the
           refspec to push (e.g <b>git push origin +master </b>to force a push
           to the <b>master </b>branch). See the <b>&lt;refspec&gt;...  </b>section above
           for details.

       --[no-]force-if-includes
           Force an update only if the tip of the remote-tracking ref
           has been integrated locally.

           This option enables a check that verifies if the tip of the
           remote-tracking ref is reachable from one of the "reflog"
           entries of the local branch based in it for a rewrite. The
           check ensures that any updates from the remote have been
           incorporated locally by rejecting the forced update if that
           is not the case.

           If the option is passed without specifying
           <b>--force-with-lease</b>, or specified along with
           <b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</b>, it is a "no-op".

           Specifying <b>--no-force-if-includes </b>disables this behavior.

       --repo=&lt;repository&gt;
           This option is equivalent to the &lt;repository&gt; argument. If
           both are specified, the command-line argument takes
           precedence.

       -u, --set-upstream
           For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed,
           add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less
           <a href="git-pull.1.html">git-pull(1)</a> and other commands. For more information, see
           <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge </b>in <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>.

       --[no-]thin
           These options are passed to <a href="git-send-pack.1.html">git-send-pack(1)</a>. A thin transfer
           significantly reduces the amount of sent data when the sender
           and receiver share many of the same objects in common. The
           default is <b>--thin</b>.

       -q, --quiet
           Suppress all output, including the listing of updated refs,
           unless an error occurs. Progress is not reported to the
           standard error stream.

       -v, --verbose
           Run verbosely.

       --progress
           Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by
           default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is
           specified. This flag forces progress status even if the
           standard error stream is not directed to a terminal.

       --no-recurse-submodules,
       --recurse-submodules=check|on-demand|only|no
           May be used to make sure all submodule commits used by the
           revisions to be pushed are available on a remote-tracking
           branch. If <i>check</i> is used Git will verify that all submodule
           commits that changed in the revisions to be pushed are
           available on at least one remote of the submodule. If any
           commits are missing the push will be aborted and exit with
           non-zero status. If <i>on-demand</i> is used all submodules that
           changed in the revisions to be pushed will be pushed. If
           on-demand was not able to push all necessary revisions it
           will also be aborted and exit with non-zero status. If <i>only</i>
           is used all submodules will be pushed while the superproject
           is left unpushed. A value of <i>no</i> or using
           <b>--no-recurse-submodules </b>can be used to override the
           push.recurseSubmodules configuration variable when no
           submodule recursion is required.

           When using <i>on-demand</i> or <i>only</i>, if a submodule has a
           "push.recurseSubmodules={on-demand,only}" or
           "submodule.recurse" configuration, further recursion will
           occur. In this case, "only" is treated as "on-demand".

       --[no-]verify
           Toggle the pre-push hook (see <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a>). The default is
           --verify, giving the hook a chance to prevent the push. With
           --no-verify, the hook is bypassed completely.

       -4, --ipv4
           Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.

       -6, --ipv6
           Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses.
</pre> <h2>
GIT URLS </h2>
<pre>
       In general, URLs contain information about the transport
       protocol, the address of the remote server, and the path to the
       repository. Depending on the transport protocol, some of this
       information may be absent.

       Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition,
       ftp and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient
       and deprecated; do not use them).

       The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
       should be used with caution on unsecured networks.

       The following syntaxes may be used with them:

       •   <b>ssh://</b>[<i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>@</b>]<i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i>

       •   <b>git://</b><i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[:<i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i>

       •   <b>http</b>[<b>s</b>]<b>://</b><i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i>

       •   <b>ftp</b>[<b>s</b>]<b>://</b><i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i>

       An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh
       protocol:

       •   [<i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>@</b>]<i>&lt;host&gt;</i><b>:/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i>

       This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
       first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains
       a colon. For example the local path <b>foo:bar </b>could be specified as
       an absolute path or <b>./foo:bar </b>to avoid being misinterpreted as an
       ssh url.

       The ssh and git protocols additionally support <b>~</b><i>&lt;username&gt;</i>
       expansion:

       •   <b>ssh://</b>[<i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>@</b>]<i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/~</b><i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i>

       •   <b>git://</b><i>&lt;host&gt;</i>[<b>:</b><i>&lt;port&gt;</i>]<b>/~</b><i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i>

       •   [<i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>@</b>]<i>&lt;host&gt;</i><b>:~</b><i>&lt;user&gt;</i><b>/</b><i>&lt;path-to-git-repo&gt;</i>

       For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the
       following syntaxes may be used:

       •   <b>/path/to/repo.git/</b>

       •   <b>file:///path/to/repo.git/</b>

       These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning,
       when the former implies <b>--local </b>option. See <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a> for
       details.

       <b>git clone</b>, <b>git fetch </b>and <b>git pull</b>, but not <b>git push</b>, will also
       accept a suitable bundle file. See <a href="git-bundle.1.html">git-bundle(1)</a>.

       When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol,
       it attempts to use the <b>remote-</b><i>&lt;transport&gt;</i> remote helper, if one
       exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following
       syntax may be used:

       •   <i>&lt;transport&gt;</i>::<i>&lt;address&gt;</i>

       where <i>&lt;address&gt;</i> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary
       URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
       invoked. See <a href="../man7/gitremote-helpers.7.html">gitremote-helpers(7)</a> for details.

       If there are a large number of similarly-named remote
       repositories and you want to use a different format for them
       (such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that
       work), you can create a configuration section of the form:

                   [url "<i>&lt;actual-url-base&gt;</i>"]
                           insteadOf = <i>&lt;other-url-base&gt;</i>

       For example, with this:

                   [url "git://git.host.xz/"]
                           insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                           insteadOf = work:

       a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git"
       will be rewritten in any context that takes a URL to be
       "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

       If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
       configuration section of the form:

                   [url "<i>&lt;actual-url-base&gt;</i>"]
                           pushInsteadOf = <i>&lt;other-url-base&gt;</i>

       For example, with this:

                   [url "ssh://example.org/"]
                           pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/

       a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten
       to "ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for pushes, but pulls
       will still use the original URL.
</pre> <h2>
REMOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as
       <b>&lt;repository&gt; </b>argument:

       •   a remote in the Git configuration file: <b>$GIT_DIR/config</b>,

       •   a file in the <b>$GIT_DIR/remotes </b>directory, or

       •   a file in the <b>$GIT_DIR/branches </b>directory.

       All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command
       line because they each contain a refspec which git will use by
       default.

   <b>Named remote in configuration file</b>
       You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had
       previously configured using <a href="git-remote.1.html">git-remote(1)</a>, <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> or even
       by a manual edit to the <b>$GIT_DIR/config </b>file. The URL of this
       remote will be used to access the repository. The refspec of this
       remote will be used by default when you do not provide a refspec
       on the command line. The entry in the config file would appear
       like this:

                   [remote "&lt;name&gt;"]
                           url = &lt;URL&gt;
                           pushurl = &lt;pushurl&gt;
                           push = &lt;refspec&gt;
                           fetch = &lt;refspec&gt;

       The <b>&lt;pushurl&gt; </b>is used for pushes only. It is optional and
       defaults to <b>&lt;URL&gt;</b>. Pushing to a remote affects all defined
       pushurls or all defined urls if no pushurls are defined. Fetch,
       however, will only fetch from the first defined url if multiple
       urls are defined.

   <b>Named file in $GIT_DIR/remotes</b>
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in <b>$GIT_DIR/remotes</b>.
       The URL in this file will be used to access the repository. The
       refspec in this file will be used as default when you do not
       provide a refspec on the command line. This file should have the
       following format:

                   URL: one of the above URL formats
                   Push: &lt;refspec&gt;
                   Pull: &lt;refspec&gt;

       <b>Push: </b>lines are used by <i>git push</i> and <b>Pull: </b>lines are used by <i>git</i>
       <i>pull</i> and <i>git fetch</i>. Multiple <b>Push: </b>and <b>Pull: </b>lines may be
       specified for additional branch mappings.

   <b>Named file in $GIT_DIR/branches</b>
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in
       <b>$GIT_DIR/branches</b>. The URL in this file will be used to access
       the repository. This file should have the following format:

                   &lt;URL&gt;#&lt;head&gt;

       <b>&lt;URL&gt; </b>is required; <b>#&lt;head&gt; </b>is optional.

       Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following
       refspecs, if you don’t provide one on the command line. <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>
       is the name of this file in <b>$GIT_DIR/branches </b>and <b>&lt;head&gt; </b>defaults
       to <b>master</b>.

       git fetch uses:

                   refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;:refs/heads/&lt;branch&gt;

       git push uses:

                   HEAD:refs/heads/&lt;head&gt;
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT </h2>
<pre>
       The output of "git push" depends on the transport method used;
       this section describes the output when pushing over the Git
       protocol (either locally or via ssh).

       The status of the push is output in tabular form, with each line
       representing the status of a single ref. Each line is of the
       form:

            &lt;flag&gt; &lt;summary&gt; &lt;from&gt; -&gt; &lt;to&gt; (&lt;reason&gt;)

       If --porcelain is used, then each line of the output is of the
       form:

            &lt;flag&gt; \t &lt;from&gt;:&lt;to&gt; \t &lt;summary&gt; (&lt;reason&gt;)

       The status of up-to-date refs is shown only if --porcelain or
       --verbose option is used.

       flag
           A single character indicating the status of the ref:

           (space)
               for a successfully pushed fast-forward;

           <b>+</b>
               for a successful forced update;

           <b>-</b>
               for a successfully deleted ref;

           <b>*</b>
               for a successfully pushed new ref;

           <b>!</b>
               for a ref that was rejected or failed to push; and

           <b>=</b>
               for a ref that was up to date and did not need pushing.

       summary
           For a successfully pushed ref, the summary shows the old and
           new values of the ref in a form suitable for using as an
           argument to <b>git log </b>(this is <b>&lt;old&gt;..&lt;new&gt; </b>in most cases, and
           <b>&lt;old&gt;...&lt;new&gt; </b>for forced non-fast-forward updates).

           For a failed update, more details are given:

           rejected
               Git did not try to send the ref at all, typically because
               it is not a fast-forward and you did not force the
               update.

           remote rejected
               The remote end refused the update. Usually caused by a
               hook on the remote side, or because the remote repository
               has one of the following safety options in effect:
               <b>receive.denyCurrentBranch </b>(for pushes to the checked out
               branch), <b>receive.denyNonFastForwards </b>(for forced
               non-fast-forward updates), <b>receive.denyDeletes </b>or
               <b>receive.denyDeleteCurrent</b>. See <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>.

           remote failure
               The remote end did not report the successful update of
               the ref, perhaps because of a temporary error on the
               remote side, a break in the network connection, or other
               transient error.

       from
           The name of the local ref being pushed, minus its
           <b>refs/&lt;type&gt;/ </b>prefix. In the case of deletion, the name of the
           local ref is omitted.

       to
           The name of the remote ref being updated, minus its
           <b>refs/&lt;type&gt;/ </b>prefix.

       reason
           A human-readable explanation. In the case of successfully
           pushed refs, no explanation is needed. For a failed ref, the
           reason for failure is described.
</pre> <h2>
NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS </h2>
<pre>
       When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that
       used to point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is
       called a fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of
       A.

       In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the
       original commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits the
       new commit B builds on top of. Hence, it does not lose any
       history.

       In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history. For
       example, suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit
       X, and you built a history leading to commit B while the other
       person built a history leading to commit A. The history looks
       like this:

                 B
                /
            ---X---A

       Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes
       leading to A back to the original repository from which you two
       obtained the original commit X.

       The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to
       point at commit X to point at commit A. It is a fast-forward.

       But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch
       (that now points at A) with commit B. This does <i>not</i> fast-forward.
       If you did so, the changes introduced by commit A will be lost,
       because everybody will now start building on top of B.

       The command by default does not allow an update that is not a
       fast-forward to prevent such loss of history.

       If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the
       work by the other person (history from X to A), you would need to
       first fetch the history from the repository, create a history
       that contains changes done by both parties, and push the result
       back.

       You can perform "git pull", resolve potential conflicts, and "git
       push" the result. A "git pull" will create a merge commit C
       between commits A and B.

                 B---C
                /   /
            ---X---A

       Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and
       your push will be accepted.

       Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top
       of A, with "git pull --rebase", and push the result back. The
       rebase will create a new commit D that builds the change between
       X and B on top of A.

                 B   D
                /   /
            ---X---A

       Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your
       push will be accepted.

       There is another common situation where you may encounter
       non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push, and it is
       possible even when you are pushing into a repository nobody else
       pushes into. After you push commit A yourself (in the first
       picture in this section), replace it with "git commit --amend" to
       produce commit B, and you try to push it out, because forgot that
       you have pushed A out already. In such a case, and only if you
       are certain that nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier
       commit A (and started building on top of it), you can run "git
       push --force" to overwrite it. In other words, "git push --force"
       is a method reserved for a case where you do mean to lose
       history.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>git push</b>
           Works like <b>git push &lt;remote&gt;</b>, where &lt;remote&gt; is the current
           branch’s remote (or <b>origin</b>, if no remote is configured for
           the current branch).

       <b>git push origin</b>
           Without additional configuration, pushes the current branch
           to the configured upstream (<b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge </b>configuration
           variable) if it has the same name as the current branch, and
           errors out without pushing otherwise.

           The default behavior of this command when no &lt;refspec&gt; is
           given can be configured by setting the <b>push </b>option of the
           remote, or the <b>push.default </b>configuration variable.

           For example, to default to pushing only the current branch to
           <b>origin </b>use <b>git config remote.origin.push HEAD</b>. Any valid
           &lt;refspec&gt; (like the ones in the examples below) can be
           configured as the default for <b>git push origin</b>.

       <b>git push origin :</b>
           Push "matching" branches to <b>origin</b>. See &lt;refspec&gt; in the
           OPTIONS section above for a description of "matching"
           branches.

       <b>git push origin master</b>
           Find a ref that matches <b>master </b>in the source repository (most
           likely, it would find <b>refs/heads/master</b>), and update the same
           ref (e.g.  <b>refs/heads/master</b>) in <b>origin </b>repository with it.
           If <b>master </b>did not exist remotely, it would be created.

       <b>git push origin HEAD</b>
           A handy way to push the current branch to the same name on
           the remote.

       <b>git push mothership master:satellite/master dev:satellite/dev</b>
           Use the source ref that matches <b>master </b>(e.g.
           <b>refs/heads/master</b>) to update the ref that matches
           <b>satellite/master </b>(most probably
           <b>refs/remotes/satellite/master</b>) in the <b>mothership </b>repository;
           do the same for <b>dev </b>and <b>satellite/dev</b>.

           See the section describing <b>&lt;refspec&gt;...  </b>above for a
           discussion of the matching semantics.

           This is to emulate <b>git fetch </b>run on the <b>mothership </b>using <b>git</b>
           <b>push </b>that is run in the opposite direction in order to
           integrate the work done on <b>satellite</b>, and is often necessary
           when you can only make connection in one way (i.e. satellite
           can ssh into mothership but mothership cannot initiate
           connection to satellite because the latter is behind a
           firewall or does not run sshd).

           After running this <b>git push </b>on the <b>satellite </b>machine, you
           would ssh into the <b>mothership </b>and run <b>git merge </b>there to
           complete the emulation of <b>git pull </b>that were run on
           <b>mothership </b>to pull changes made on <b>satellite</b>.

       <b>git push origin HEAD:master</b>
           Push the current branch to the remote ref matching <b>master </b>in
           the <b>origin </b>repository. This form is convenient to push the
           current branch without thinking about its local name.

       <b>git push origin master:refs/heads/experimental</b>
           Create the branch <b>experimental </b>in the <b>origin </b>repository by
           copying the current <b>master </b>branch. This form is only needed
           to create a new branch or tag in the remote repository when
           the local name and the remote name are different; otherwise,
           the ref name on its own will work.

       <b>git push origin :experimental</b>
           Find a ref that matches <b>experimental </b>in the <b>origin </b>repository
           (e.g.  <b>refs/heads/experimental</b>), and delete it.

       <b>git push origin +dev:master</b>
           Update the origin repository’s master branch with the dev
           branch, allowing non-fast-forward updates.  <b>This can leave</b>
           <b>unreferenced commits dangling in the origin repository.</b>
           Consider the following situation, where a fast-forward is not
           possible:

                           o---o---o---A---B  origin/master
                                    \
                                     X---Y---Z  dev

           The above command would change the origin repository to

                                     A---B  (unnamed branch)
                                    /
                           o---o---o---X---Y---Z  master

           Commits A and B would no longer belong to a branch with a
           symbolic name, and so would be unreachable. As such, these
           commits would be removed by a <b>git gc </b>command on the origin
           repository.

SECURITY </h2>
<pre>
       The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side
       from stealing data from the other repository that was not
       intended to be shared. If you have private data that you need to
       protect from a malicious peer, your best option is to store it in
       another repository. This applies to both clients and servers. In
       particular, namespaces on a server are not effective for read
       access control; you should only grant read access to a namespace
       to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire
       repository.

       The known attack vectors are as follows:

        1. The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects
           it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but can
           be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them.
           The attacker chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref
           to X, but isn’t required to send the content of X because the
           victim already has it. Now the victim believes that the
           attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the
           attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a
           client to perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the
           namespace the client has access to and then fetching it. The
           most likely way for a server to perform it on a client is to
           "merge" X into a public branch and hope that the user does
           additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the
           server without noticing the merge.)

        2. As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The
           victim sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and
           the attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the
           victim sends Y as a delta against X. The delta reveals
           regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker.

CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively
       included from the <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> documentation. The content is the
       same as what’s found there:

       push.autoSetupRemote
           If set to "true" assume <b>--set-upstream </b>on default push when
           no upstream tracking exists for the current branch; this
           option takes effect with push.default options <i>simple</i>,
           <i>upstream</i>, and <i>current</i>. It is useful if by default you want
           new branches to be pushed to the default remote (like the
           behavior of <i>push.default=current</i>) and you also want the
           upstream tracking to be set. Workflows most likely to benefit
           from this option are <i>simple</i> central workflows where all
           branches are expected to have the same name on the remote.

       push.default
           Defines the action <b>git push </b>should take if no refspec is
           given (whether from the command-line, config, or elsewhere).
           Different values are well-suited for specific workflows; for
           instance, in a purely central workflow (i.e. the fetch source
           is equal to the push destination), <b>upstream </b>is probably what
           you want. Possible values are:

           •   <b>nothing </b>- do not push anything (error out) unless a
               refspec is given. This is primarily meant for people who
               want to avoid mistakes by always being explicit.

           •   <b>current </b>- push the current branch to update a branch with
               the same name on the receiving end. Works in both central
               and non-central workflows.

           •   <b>upstream </b>- push the current branch back to the branch
               whose changes are usually integrated into the current
               branch (which is called <b>@{upstream}</b>). This mode only
               makes sense if you are pushing to the same repository you
               would normally pull from (i.e. central workflow).

           •   <b>tracking </b>- This is a deprecated synonym for <b>upstream</b>.

           •   <b>simple </b>- push the current branch with the same name on
               the remote.

               If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to
               the same repository you pull from, which is typically
               <b>origin</b>), then you need to configure an upstream branch
               with the same name.

               This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest
               option suited for beginners.

           •   <b>matching </b>- push all branches having the same name on both
               ends. This makes the repository you are pushing to
               remember the set of branches that will be pushed out
               (e.g. if you always push <i>maint</i> and <i>master</i> there and no
               other branches, the repository you push to will have
               these two branches, and your local <i>maint</i> and <i>master</i> will
               be pushed there).

               To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure <i>all</i>
               the branches you would push out are ready to be pushed
               out before running <i>git push</i>, as the whole point of this
               mode is to allow you to push all of the branches in one
               go. If you usually finish work on only one branch and
               push out the result, while other branches are unfinished,
               this mode is not for you. Also this mode is not suitable
               for pushing into a shared central repository, as other
               people may add new branches there, or update the tip of
               existing branches outside your control.

               This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0
               (<b>simple </b>is the new default).

       push.followTags
           If set to true, enable <b>--follow-tags </b>option by default. You
           may override this configuration at time of push by specifying
           <b>--no-follow-tags</b>.

       push.gpgSign
           May be set to a boolean value, or the string <i>if-asked</i>. A true
           value causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as if <b>--signed </b>is
           passed to <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a>. The string <i>if-asked</i> causes pushes to
           be signed if the server supports it, as if <b>--signed=if-asked</b>
           is passed to <i>git push</i>. A false value may override a value
           from a lower-priority config file. An explicit command-line
           flag always overrides this config option.

       push.pushOption
           When no <b>--push-option=&lt;option&gt; </b>argument is given from the
           command line, <b>git push </b>behaves as if each &lt;value&gt; of this
           variable is given as <b>--push-option=&lt;value&gt;</b>.

           This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be
           used in a higher priority configuration file (e.g.
           <b>.git/config </b>in a repository) to clear the values inherited
           from a lower priority configuration files (e.g.
           <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b>).

               Example:

               /etc/gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = a
                 push.pushoption = b

               ~/.gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = c

               repo/.git/config
                 push.pushoption =
                 push.pushoption = b

               This will result in only b (a and c are cleared).

       push.recurseSubmodules
           May be "check", "on-demand", "only", or "no", with the same
           behavior as that of "push --recurse-submodules". If not set,
           <i>no</i> is used by default, unless <i>submodule.recurse</i> is set (in
           which case a <i>true</i> value means <i>on-demand</i>).

       push.useForceIfIncludes
           If set to "true", it is equivalent to specifying
           <b>--force-if-includes </b>as an option to <a href="git-push.1.html">git-push(1)</a> in the
           command line. Adding <b>--no-force-if-includes </b>at the time of
           push overrides this configuration setting.

       push.negotiate
           If set to "true", attempt to reduce the size of the packfile
           sent by rounds of negotiation in which the client and the
           server attempt to find commits in common. If "false", Git
           will rely solely on the server’s ref advertisement to find
           commits in common.

       push.useBitmaps
           If set to "false", disable use of bitmaps for "git push" even
           if <b>pack.useBitmaps </b>is "true", without preventing other git
           operations from using bitmaps. Default is true.
