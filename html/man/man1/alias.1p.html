PROLOG </h2>
<pre>
       This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
       Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
       corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
       or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.
</pre> <h2>
NAME </h2>
<pre>
       alias — define or display aliases
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       alias <b>[</b><i>alias-name</i><b>[</b>=<i>string</i><b>]</b>...<b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>alias</i> utility shall create or redefine alias definitions or
       write the values of existing alias definitions to standard
       output. An alias definition provides a string value that shall
       replace a command name when it is encountered; see <i>Section 2.3.1</i>,
       <i>Alias Substitution</i>.

       An alias definition shall affect the current shell execution
       environment and the execution environments of the subshells of
       the current shell. When used as specified by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, the alias definition shall not affect the parent
       process of the current shell nor any utility environment invoked
       by the shell; see <i>Section 2.12</i>, <i>Shell Execution Environment</i>.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>alias-name</i>
                 Write the alias definition to standard output.

       <i>alias-name</i>=<i>string</i>
                 Assign the value of <i>string</i> to the alias <i>alias-name</i>.

       If no operands are given, all alias definitions shall be written
       to standard output.
</pre> <h2>
STDIN </h2>
<pre>
       Not used.
</pre> <h2>
INPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>alias</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.
</pre> <h2>
ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.
</pre> <h2>
STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       The format for displaying aliases (when no operands or only <i>name</i>
       operands are specified) shall be:

           "%s=%s\n", <i>name</i>, <i>value</i>

       The <i>value</i> string shall be written with appropriate quoting so
       that it is suitable for reinput to the shell. See the description
       of shell quoting in <i>Section 2.2</i>, <i>Quoting</i>.
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.
</pre> <h2>
OUTPUT FILES </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXTENDED DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    One of the <i>name</i> operands specified did not have an alias
             definition, or an error occurred.
</pre> <h2>
CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS </h2>
<pre>
       Default.

       <i>The following sections are informative.</i>
</pre> <h2>
APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       None.
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. Create a short alias for a commonly used <i>ls</i> command:

               alias lf="ls -CF"

        2. Create a simple ``redo'' command to repeat previous entries
           in the command history file:

               alias r='fc -s'

        3. Use 1K units for <i>du</i>:

               alias du=du\ -k

        4. Set up <i>nohup</i> so that it can deal with an argument that is
           itself an alias name:

               alias nohup="nohup "
</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>alias</i> description is based on historical KornShell
       implementations. Known differences exist between that and the C
       shell. The KornShell version was adopted to be consistent with
       all the other KornShell features in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
       such as command line editing.

       Since <i>alias</i> affects the current shell execution environment, it
       is generally provided as a shell regular built-in.

       Historical versions of the KornShell have allowed aliases to be
       exported to scripts that are invoked by the same shell. This is
       triggered by the <i>alias</i> <b>-x </b>flag; it is allowed by this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017 only when an explicit extension such as <b>-x </b>is used.
       The standard developers considered that aliases were of use
       primarily to interactive users and that they should normally not
       affect shell scripts called by those users; functions are
       available to such scripts.

       Historical versions of the KornShell had not written aliases in a
       quoted manner suitable for reentry to the shell, but this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 has made this a requirement for all similar
       output. Therefore, consistency was chosen over this detail of
       historical practice.
