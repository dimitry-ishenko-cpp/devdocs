</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>at</i> utility shall read commands from standard input and group
       them together as an <i>at-job</i>, to be executed at a later time.

       The at-job shall be executed in a separate invocation of the
       shell, running in a separate process group with no controlling
       terminal, except that the environment variables, current working
       directory, file creation mask, and other implementation-defined
       execution-time attributes in effect when the <i>at</i> utility is
       executed shall be retained and used when the at-job is executed.

       When the at-job is submitted, the <i>at_job_id</i> and scheduled time
       shall be written to standard error. The <i>at_job_id</i> is an
       identifier that shall be a string consisting solely of
       alphanumeric characters and the &lt;period&gt; character. The <i>at_job_id</i>
       shall be assigned by the system when the job is scheduled such
       that it uniquely identifies a particular job.

       User notification and the processing of the job's standard output
       and standard error are described under the <b>-m </b>option.

       Users shall be permitted to use <i>at</i> if their name appears in the
       file <b>at.allow </b>which is located in an implementation-defined
       directory.  If that file does not exist, the file <b>at.deny</b>, which
       is located in an implementation-defined directory, shall be
       checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access to
       <i>at</i>.  If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate
       privileges shall be allowed to submit a job. If only <b>at.deny</b>
       exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The
       <b>at.allow </b>and <b>at.deny </b>files shall consist of one user name per
       line.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>at</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax Guidelines</i>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-f </b><i>file</i>   Specify the pathname of a file to be used as the source
                 of the at-job, instead of standard input.

       <b>-l        </b>(The letter ell.) Report all jobs scheduled for the
                 invoking user if no <i>at_job_id</i> operands are specified.
                 If <i>at_job_id</i>s are specified, report only information
                 for these jobs. The output shall be written to standard
                 output.

       <b>-m        </b>Send mail to the invoking user after the at-job has
                 run, announcing its completion. Standard output and
                 standard error produced by the at-job shall be mailed
                 to the user as well, unless redirected elsewhere. Mail
                 shall be sent even if the job produces no output.

                 If <b>-m </b>is not used, the job's standard output and
                 standard error shall be provided to the user by means
                 of mail, unless they are redirected elsewhere; if there
                 is no such output to provide, the implementation need
                 not notify the user of the job's completion.

       <b>-q </b><i>queuename</i>
                 Specify in which queue to schedule a job for
                 submission. When used with the <b>-l </b>option, limit the
                 search to that particular queue. By default, at-jobs
                 shall be scheduled in queue <i>a</i>.  In contrast, queue <i>b</i>
                 shall be reserved for batch jobs; see <i>batch</i>.  The
                 meanings of all other <i>queuename</i>s are implementation-
                 defined. If <b>-q </b>is specified along with either of the <b>-t</b>
                 <i>time_arg</i> or <i>timespec</i> arguments, the results are
                 unspecified.

       <b>-r        </b>Remove the jobs with the specified <i>at_job_id</i> operands
                 that were previously scheduled by the <i>at</i> utility.

       <b>-t </b><i>time_arg</i>
                 Submit the job to be run at the time specified by the
                 <i>time</i> option-argument, which the application shall
                 ensure has the format as specified by the <i>touch</i> <b>-t </b><i>time</i>
                 utility.
</pre> <h2>
OPERANDS </h2>
<pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <i>at_job_id</i> The name reported by a previous invocation of the <i>at</i>
                 utility at the time the job was scheduled.

       <i>timespec</i>  Submit the job to be run at the date and time
                 specified. All of the <i>timespec</i> operands are interpreted
                 as if they were separated by &lt;space&gt; characters and
                 concatenated, and shall be parsed as described in the
                 grammar at the end of this section. The date and time
                 shall be interpreted as being in the timezone of the
                 user (as determined by the <i>TZ</i> variable), unless a
                 timezone name appears as part of <i>time</i>, below.

                 In the POSIX locale, the following describes the three
                 parts of the time specification string. All of the
                 values from the <i>LC_TIME</i> categories in the POSIX locale
                 shall be recognized in a case-insensitive manner.

                 <i>time</i>      The time can be specified as one, two, or
                           four digits. One-digit and two-digit numbers
                           shall be taken to be hours; four-digit
                           numbers to be hours and minutes. The time can
                           alternatively be specified as two numbers
                           separated by a &lt;colon&gt;, meaning <i>hour</i>:<i>minute</i>.
                           An AM/PM indication (one of the values from
                           the <b>am_pm </b>keywords in the <i>LC_TIME</i> locale
                           category) can follow the time; otherwise, a
                           24-hour clock time shall be understood. A
                           timezone name can also follow to further
                           qualify the time. The acceptable timezone
                           names are implementation-defined, except that
                           they shall be case-insensitive and the string
                           <b>utc </b>is supported to indicate the time is in
                           Coordinated Universal Time.  In the POSIX
                           locale, the <i>time</i> field can also be one of the
                           following tokens:

                           <b>midnight  </b>Indicates the time 12:00 am
                                     (00:00).

                           <b>noon      </b>Indicates the time 12:00 pm.

                           <b>now       </b>Indicates the current day and time.
                                     Invoking <i>at</i> &lt;<b>now</b>&gt; shall submit an
                                     at-job for potentially immediate
                                     execution (that is, subject only to
                                     unspecified scheduling delays).

                 <i>date</i>      An optional <i>date</i> can be specified as either a
                           month name (one of the values from the <b>mon </b>or
                           <b>abmon </b>keywords in the <i>LC_TIME</i> locale
                           category) followed by a day number (and
                           possibly year number preceded by a comma), or
                           a day of the week (one of the values from the
                           <b>day </b>or <b>abday </b>keywords in the <i>LC_TIME</i> locale
                           category). In the POSIX locale, two special
                           days shall be recognized:

                           <b>today     </b>Indicates the current day.

                           <b>tomorrow  </b>Indicates the day following the
                                     current day.

                           If no <i>date</i> is given, <b>today </b>shall be assumed
                           if the given time is greater than the current
                           time, and <b>tomorrow </b>shall be assumed if it is
                           less. If the given month is less than the
                           current month (and no year is given), next
                           year shall be assumed.

                 <i>increment</i> The optional <i>increment</i> shall be a number
                           preceded by a &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) and suffixed
                           by one of the following: <b>minutes</b>, <b>hours</b>,
                           <b>days</b>, <b>weeks</b>, <b>months</b>, or <b>years</b>.  (The singular
                           forms shall also be accepted.) The keyword
                           <b>next </b>shall be equivalent to an increment
                           number of +1. For example, the following are
                           equivalent commands:

                               at 2pm + 1 week
                               at 2pm next week

       The following grammar describes the precise format of <i>timespec</i> in
       the POSIX locale. The general conventions for this style of
       grammar are described in <i>Section 1.3</i>, <i>Grammar Conventions</i>.  This
       formal syntax shall take precedence over the preceding text
       syntax description. The longest possible token or delimiter shall
       be recognized at a given point. When used in a <i>timespec</i>, white
       space shall also delimit tokens.

</pre> <h2>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES </h2>
<pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       <i>at</i>:

       <i>LANG</i>      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                 Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 8.2</i>,
                 <i>Internationalization Variables</i> for the precedence of
                 internationalization variables used to determine the
                 values of locale categories.)

       <i>LC_ALL</i>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                 of all the other internationalization variables.

       <i>LC_CTYPE</i>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                 sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                 example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                 characters in arguments and input files).

       <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                 format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                 standard error and informative messages written to
                 standard output.

       <i>NLSPATH</i>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                 processing of <i>LC_MESSAGES</i>.

       <i>LC_TIME</i>   Determine the format and contents for date and time
                 strings written and accepted by <i>at</i>.

       <i>SHELL</i>     Determine a name of a command interpreter to be used to
                 invoke the at-job. If the variable is unset or null, <i>sh</i>
                 shall be used. If it is set to a value other than a
                 name for <i>sh</i>, the implementation shall do one of the
                 following: use that shell; use <i>sh</i>; use the login shell
                 from the user database; or any of the preceding
                 accompanied by a warning diagnostic about which was
                 chosen.

       <i>TZ</i>        Determine the timezone. The job shall be submitted for
                 execution at the time specified by <i>timespec</i> or <b>-t </b><i>time</i>
                 relative to the timezone specified by the <i>TZ</i> variable.
                 If <i>timespec</i> specifies a timezone, it shall override <i>TZ</i>.
                 If <i>timespec</i> does not specify a timezone and <i>TZ</i> is unset
                 or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

STDOUT </h2>
<pre>
       When standard input is a terminal, prompts of unspecified format
       for each line of the user input described in the STDIN section
       may be written to standard output.

       In the POSIX locale, the following shall be written to the
       standard output for each job when jobs are listed in response to
       the <b>-l </b>option:

           "%s\t%s\n", <i>at_job_id</i>, &lt;<i>date</i>&gt;

       where <i>date</i> shall be equivalent in format to the output of:

           date +"%a %b %e %T %Y"

       The date and time written shall be adjusted so that they appear
       in the timezone of the user (as determined by the <i>TZ</i> variable).
</pre> <h2>
STDERR </h2>
<pre>
       In the POSIX locale, the following shall be written to standard
       error when a job has been successfully submitted:

           "job %s at %s\n", <i>at_job_id</i>, &lt;<i>date</i>&gt;

       where <i>date</i> has the same format as that described in the STDOUT
       section. Neither this, nor warning messages concerning the
       selection of the command interpreter, shall be considered a
       diagnostic that changes the exit status.

       Diagnostic messages, if any, shall be written to standard error.

APPLICATION USAGE </h2>
<pre>
       The format of the <i>at</i> command line shown here is guaranteed only
       for the POSIX locale. Other cultures may be supported with
       substantially different interfaces, although implementations are
       encouraged to provide comparable levels of functionality.

       Since the commands run in a separate shell invocation, running in
       a separate process group with no controlling terminal, open file
       descriptors, traps, and priority inherited from the invoking
       environment are lost.

       Some implementations do not allow substitution of different
       shells using <i>SHELL</i>.  System V systems, for example, have used the
       login shell value for the user in <b>/etc/passwd</b>.  To select
       reliably another command interpreter, the user must include it as
       part of the script, such as:

           <b>$ </b>at 1800
           myshell myscript
           EOT
           <b>job ... at ...</b>
           <b>$</b>
</pre> <h2>
EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
        1. This sequence can be used at a terminal:

               at -m 0730 tomorrow
               sort &lt; file &gt;outfile
               EOT

        2. This sequence, which demonstrates redirecting standard error
           to a pipe, is useful in a command procedure (the sequence of
           output redirection specifications is significant):

               at now + 1 hour &lt;&lt;!
               diff file1 file2 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;outfile | mailx mygroup
               !

        3. To have a job reschedule itself, <i>at</i> can be invoked from
           within the at-job. For example, this daily processing script
           named <b>my.daily </b>runs every day (although <i>crontab</i> is a more
           appropriate vehicle for such work):

               # my.daily runs every day
               <i>daily processing</i>
               at now tomorrow &lt; my.daily

        4. The spacing of the three portions of the POSIX locale
           <i>timespec</i> is quite flexible as long as there are no
           ambiguities. Examples of various times and operand
           presentation include:

               at 0815am Jan 24
               at 8 :15amjan24
               at now "+ 1day"
               at 5 pm FRIday
               at '17

</pre> <h2>
RATIONALE </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>at</i> utility reads from standard input the commands to be
       executed at a later time. It may be useful to redirect standard
       output and standard error within the specified commands.

       The <b>-t </b><i>time</i> option was added as a new capability to support an
       internationalized way of specifying a time for execution of the
       submitted job.

       Early proposals added a ``jobname'' concept as a way of giving
       submitted jobs names that are meaningful to the user submitting
       them.  The historical, system-specified <i>at_job_id</i> gives no
       indication of what the job is. Upon further reflection, it was
       decided that the benefit of this was not worth the change in
       historical interface. The <i>at</i> functionality is useful in simple
       environments, but in large or complex situations, the
       functionality provided by the Batch Services option is more
       suitable.

       The <b>-q </b>option historically has been an undocumented option, used
       mainly by the <i>batch</i> utility.

       The System V <b>-m </b>option was added to provide a method for
       informing users that an at-job had completed. Otherwise, users
       are only informed when output to standard error or standard
       output are not redirected.

       The behavior of <i>at</i> &lt;<b>now</b>&gt; was changed in an early proposal from
       being unspecified to submitting a job for potentially immediate
       execution. Historical BSD <i>at</i> implementations support this.
       Historical System V implementations give an error in that case,
       but a change to the System V versions should have no backwards-
       compatibility ramifications.

       On BSD-based systems, a <b>-u </b><i>user</i> option has allowed those with
       appropriate privileges to access the work of other users. Since
       this is primarily a system administration feature and is not
       universally implemented, it has been omitted. Similarly, a
       specification for the output format for a user with appropriate
       privileges viewing the queues of other users has been omitted.

       The <b>-f </b><i>file</i> option from System V is used instead of the BSD
       method of using the last operand as the pathname. The BSD method
       is ambiguous—does:

           at 1200 friday

       mean the same thing if there is a file named <b>friday </b>in the
       current directory?

       The <i>at_job_id</i> is composed of a limited character set in
       historical practice, and it is mandated here to invalidate
       systems that might try using characters that require shell
       quoting or that could not be easily parsed by shell scripts.

       The <i>at</i> utility varies between System V and BSD systems in the way
       timezones are used. On System V systems, the <i>TZ</i> variable affects
       the at-job submission times and the times displayed for the user.
       On BSD systems, <i>TZ</i> is not taken into account. The BSD behavior is
       easily achieved with the current specification. If the user
       wishes to have the timezone default to that of the system, they
       merely need to issue the <i>at</i> command immediately following an
       unsetting or null assignment to <i>TZ</i>.  For example:

           TZ= at noon ...

       gives the desired BSD result.

       While the <i>yacc</i>-like grammar specified in the OPERANDS section is
       lexically unambiguous with respect to the digit strings, a
       lexical analyzer would probably be written to look for and return
       digit strings in those cases. The parser could then check whether
       the digit string returned is a valid <i>day_number</i>, <i>year_number</i>, and
       so on, based on the context.
