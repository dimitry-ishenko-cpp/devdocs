DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository.

       A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you
       to check out more than one branch at a time. With <b>git worktree</b>
       <b>add </b>a new working tree is associated with the repository, along
       with additional metadata that differentiates that working tree
       from others in the same repository. The working tree, along with
       this metadata, is called a "worktree".

       This new worktree is called a "linked worktree" as opposed to the
       "main worktree" prepared by <a href="git-init.1.html">git-init(1)</a> or <a href="git-clone.1.html">git-clone(1)</a>. A
       repository has one main worktree (if it’s not a bare repository)
       and zero or more linked worktrees. When you are done with a
       linked worktree, remove it with <b>git worktree remove</b>.

       In its simplest form, <b>git worktree add &lt;path&gt; </b>automatically
       creates a new branch whose name is the final component of <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>,
       which is convenient if you plan to work on a new topic. For
       instance, <b>git worktree add ../hotfix </b>creates new branch <b>hotfix</b>
       and checks it out at path <b>../hotfix</b>. To instead work on an
       existing branch in a new worktree, use <b>git worktree add &lt;path&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>. On the other hand, if you just plan to make some
       experimental changes or do testing without disturbing existing
       development, it is often convenient to create a <i>throwaway</i>
       worktree not associated with any branch. For instance, <b>git</b>
       <b>worktree add -d &lt;path&gt; </b>creates a new worktree with a detached
       <b>HEAD </b>at the same commit as the current branch.

       If a working tree is deleted without using <b>git worktree remove</b>,
       then its associated administrative files, which reside in the
       repository (see "DETAILS" below), will eventually be removed
       automatically (see <b>gc.worktreePruneExpire </b>in <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>), or
       you can run <b>git worktree prune </b>in the main or any linked worktree
       to clean up any stale administrative files.

       If the working tree for a linked worktree is stored on a portable
       device or network share which is not always mounted, you can
       prevent its administrative files from being pruned by issuing the
       <b>git worktree lock </b>command, optionally specifying <b>--reason </b>to
       explain why the worktree is locked.
</pre> <h2>
COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       add &lt;path&gt; [&lt;commit-ish&gt;]
           Create a worktree at <b>&lt;path&gt; </b>and checkout <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt; </b>into
           it. The new worktree is linked to the current repository,
           sharing everything except per-worktree files such as <b>HEAD</b>,
           <b>index</b>, etc. As a convenience, <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt; </b>may be a bare "<b>-</b>",
           which is synonymous with <b>@{-1}</b>.

           If <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt; </b>is a branch name (call it <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>) and is
           not found, and neither <b>-b </b>nor <b>-B </b>nor <b>--detach </b>are used, but
           there does exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote
           (call it <b>&lt;remote&gt;</b>) with a matching name, treat as equivalent
           to:

               $ git worktree add --track -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;path&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;

           If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is
           named by the <b>checkout.defaultRemote </b>configuration variable,
           we’ll use that one for the purposes of disambiguation, even
           if the <b>&lt;branch&gt; </b>isn’t unique across all remotes. Set it to
           e.g.  <b>checkout.defaultRemote=origin </b>to always checkout remote
           branches from there if <b>&lt;branch&gt; </b>is ambiguous but exists on
           the <b>origin </b>remote. See also <b>checkout.defaultRemote </b>in
           <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>.

           If <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt; </b>is omitted and neither <b>-b </b>nor <b>-B </b>nor <b>--detach</b>
           used, then, as a convenience, the new worktree is associated
           with a branch (call it <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>) named after <b>$(basename</b>
           <b>&lt;path&gt;)</b>. If <b>&lt;branch&gt; </b>doesn’t exist, a new branch based on
           <b>HEAD </b>is automatically created as if <b>-b &lt;branch&gt; </b>was given. If
           <b>&lt;branch&gt; </b>does exist, it will be checked out in the new
           worktree, if it’s not checked out anywhere else, otherwise
           the command will refuse to create the worktree (unless
           <b>--force </b>is used).

           If <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt; </b>is omitted, neither <b>--detach</b>, or <b>--orphan </b>is
           used, and there are no valid local branches (or remote
           branches if <b>--guess-remote </b>is specified) then, as a
           convenience, the new worktree is associated with a new unborn
           branch named <b>&lt;branch&gt; </b>(after <b>$(basename &lt;path&gt;) </b>if neither <b>-b</b>
           or <b>-B </b>is used) as if <b>--orphan </b>was passed to the command. In
           the event the repository has a remote and <b>--guess-remote </b>is
           used, but no remote or local branches exist, then the command
           fails with a warning reminding the user to fetch from their
           remote first (or override by using <b>-f/--force</b>).

       list
           List details of each worktree. The main worktree is listed
           first, followed by each of the linked worktrees. The output
           details include whether the worktree is bare, the revision
           currently checked out, the branch currently checked out (or
           "detached HEAD" if none), "locked" if the worktree is locked,
           "prunable" if the worktree can be pruned by the <b>prune</b>
           command.

       lock
           If a worktree is on a portable device or network share which
           is not always mounted, lock it to prevent its administrative
           files from being pruned automatically. This also prevents it
           from being moved or deleted. Optionally, specify a reason for
           the lock with <b>--reason</b>.

       move
           Move a worktree to a new location. Note that the main
           worktree or linked worktrees containing submodules cannot be
           moved with this command. (The <b>git worktree repair </b>command,
           however, can reestablish the connection with linked worktrees
           if you move the main worktree manually.)

       prune
           Prune worktree information in <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b>.

       remove
           Remove a worktree. Only clean worktrees (no untracked files
           and no modification in tracked files) can be removed. Unclean
           worktrees or ones with submodules can be removed with
           <b>--force</b>. The main worktree cannot be removed.

       repair [&lt;path&gt;...]
           Repair worktree administrative files, if possible, if they
           have become corrupted or outdated due to external factors.

           For instance, if the main worktree (or bare repository) is
           moved, linked worktrees will be unable to locate it. Running
           <b>repair </b>in the main worktree will reestablish the connection
           from linked worktrees back to the main worktree.

           Similarly, if the working tree for a linked worktree is moved
           without using <b>git worktree move</b>, the main worktree (or bare
           repository) will be unable to locate it. Running <b>repair</b>
           within the recently-moved worktree will reestablish the
           connection. If multiple linked worktrees are moved, running
           <b>repair </b>from any worktree with each tree’s new <b>&lt;path&gt; </b>as an
           argument, will reestablish the connection to all the
           specified paths.

           If both the main worktree and linked worktrees have been
           moved manually, then running <b>repair </b>in the main worktree and
           specifying the new <b>&lt;path&gt; </b>of each linked worktree will
           reestablish all connections in both directions.

       unlock
           Unlock a worktree, allowing it to be pruned, moved or
           deleted.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       -f, --force
           By default, <b>add </b>refuses to create a new worktree when
           <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt; </b>is a branch name and is already checked out by
           another worktree, or if <b>&lt;path&gt; </b>is already assigned to some
           worktree but is missing (for instance, if <b>&lt;path&gt; </b>was deleted
           manually). This option overrides these safeguards. To add a
           missing but locked worktree path, specify <b>--force </b>twice.

           <b>move </b>refuses to move a locked worktree unless <b>--force </b>is
           specified twice. If the destination is already assigned to
           some other worktree but is missing (for instance, if
           <b>&lt;new-path&gt; </b>was deleted manually), then <b>--force </b>allows the
           move to proceed; use <b>--force </b>twice if the destination is
           locked.

           <b>remove </b>refuses to remove an unclean worktree unless <b>--force</b>
           is used. To remove a locked worktree, specify <b>--force </b>twice.

       -b &lt;new-branch&gt;, -B &lt;new-branch&gt;
           With <b>add</b>, create a new branch named <b>&lt;new-branch&gt; </b>starting at
           <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>, and check out <b>&lt;new-branch&gt; </b>into the new
           worktree. If <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt; </b>is omitted, it defaults to <b>HEAD</b>. By
           default, <b>-b </b>refuses to create a new branch if it already
           exists.  <b>-B </b>overrides this safeguard, resetting <b>&lt;new-branch&gt;</b>
           to <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>.

       -d, --detach
           With <b>add</b>, detach <b>HEAD </b>in the new worktree. See "DETACHED
           HEAD" in <a href="git-checkout.1.html">git-checkout(1)</a>.

       --[no-]checkout
           By default, <b>add </b>checks out <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>, however,
           <b>--no-checkout </b>can be used to suppress checkout in order to
           make customizations, such as configuring sparse-checkout. See
           "Sparse checkout" in <a href="git-read-tree.1.html">git-read-tree(1)</a>.

       --[no-]guess-remote
           With <b>worktree add &lt;path&gt;</b>, without <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b>, instead of
           creating a new branch from <b>HEAD</b>, if there exists a tracking
           branch in exactly one remote matching the basename of <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>,
           base the new branch on the remote-tracking branch, and mark
           the remote-tracking branch as "upstream" from the new branch.

           This can also be set up as the default behaviour by using the
           <b>worktree.guessRemote </b>config option.

       --[no-]track
           When creating a new branch, if <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt; </b>is a branch, mark
           it as "upstream" from the new branch. This is the default if
           <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt; </b>is a remote-tracking branch. See <b>--track </b>in
           <a href="git-branch.1.html">git-branch(1)</a> for details.

       --lock
           Keep the worktree locked after creation. This is the
           equivalent of <b>git worktree lock </b>after <b>git worktree add</b>, but
           without a race condition.

       -n, --dry-run
           With <b>prune</b>, do not remove anything; just report what it would
           remove.

       --orphan
           With <b>add</b>, make the new worktree and index empty, associating
           the worktree with a new unborn branch named <b>&lt;new-branch&gt;</b>.

       --porcelain
           With <b>list</b>, output in an easy-to-parse format for scripts.
           This format will remain stable across Git versions and
           regardless of user configuration. It is recommended to
           combine this with <b>-z</b>. See below for details.

       -z
           Terminate each line with a NUL rather than a newline when
           <b>--porcelain </b>is specified with <b>list</b>. This makes it possible to
           parse the output when a worktree path contains a newline
           character.

       -q, --quiet
           With <b>add</b>, suppress feedback messages.

       -v, --verbose
           With <b>prune</b>, report all removals.

           With <b>list</b>, output additional information about worktrees (see
           below).

       --expire &lt;time&gt;
           With <b>prune</b>, only expire unused worktrees older than <b>&lt;time&gt;</b>.

           With <b>list</b>, annotate missing worktrees as prunable if they are
           older than <b>&lt;time&gt;</b>.

       --reason &lt;string&gt;
           With <b>lock </b>or with <b>add --lock</b>, an explanation why the worktree
           is locked.

       &lt;worktree&gt;
           Worktrees can be identified by path, either relative or
           absolute.

           If the last path components in the worktree’s path is unique
           among worktrees, it can be used to identify a worktree. For
           example if you only have two worktrees, at <b>/abc/def/ghi </b>and
           <b>/abc/def/ggg</b>, then <b>ghi </b>or <b>def/ghi </b>is enough to point to the
           former worktree.
</pre> <h2>
REFS </h2>
<pre>
       When using multiple worktrees, some refs are shared between all
       worktrees, but others are specific to an individual worktree. One
       example is <b>HEAD</b>, which is different for each worktree. This
       section is about the sharing rules and how to access refs of one
       worktree from another.

       In general, all pseudo refs are per-worktree and all refs
       starting with <b>refs/ </b>are shared. Pseudo refs are ones like <b>HEAD</b>
       which are directly under <b>$GIT_DIR </b>instead of inside
       <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b>. There are exceptions, however: refs inside
       <b>refs/bisect</b>, <b>refs/worktree </b>and <b>refs/rewritten </b>are not shared.

       Refs that are per-worktree can still be accessed from another
       worktree via two special paths, <b>main-worktree </b>and <b>worktrees</b>. The
       former gives access to per-worktree refs of the main worktree,
       while the latter to all linked worktrees.

       For example, <b>main-worktree/HEAD </b>or <b>main-worktree/refs/bisect/good</b>
       resolve to the same value as the main worktree’s <b>HEAD </b>and
       <b>refs/bisect/good </b>respectively. Similarly, <b>worktrees/foo/HEAD </b>or
       <b>worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad </b>are the same as
       <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/foo/HEAD </b>and
       <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</b>.

       To access refs, it’s best not to look inside <b>$GIT_DIR </b>directly.
       Instead use commands such as <a href="git-rev-parse.1.html">git-rev-parse(1)</a> or
       <a href="git-update-ref.1.html">git-update-ref(1)</a> which will handle refs correctly.
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION FILE </h2>
<pre>
       By default, the repository <b>config </b>file is shared across all
       worktrees. If the config variables <b>core.bare </b>or <b>core.worktree </b>are
       present in the common config file and <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b>
       is disabled, then they will be applied to the main worktree only.

       In order to have worktree-specific configuration, you can turn on
       the <b>worktreeConfig </b>extension, e.g.:

           $ git config extensions.worktreeConfig true

       In this mode, specific configuration stays in the path pointed by
       <b>git rev-parse --git-path config.worktree</b>. You can add or update
       configuration in this file with <b>git config --worktree</b>. Older Git
       versions will refuse to access repositories with this extension.

       Note that in this file, the exception for <b>core.bare </b>and
       <b>core.worktree </b>is gone. If they exist in <b>$GIT_DIR/config</b>, you must
       move them to the <b>config.worktree </b>of the main worktree. You may
       also take this opportunity to review and move other configuration
       that you do not want to share to all worktrees:

       •   <b>core.worktree </b>should never be shared.

       •   <b>core.bare </b>should not be shared if the value is
           <b>core.bare=true</b>.

       •   <b>core.sparseCheckout </b>should not be shared, unless you are sure
           you always use sparse checkout for all worktrees.

       See the documentation of <b>extensions.worktreeConfig </b>in
       <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> for more details.
</pre> <h2>
DETAILS </h2>
<pre>
       Each linked worktree has a private sub-directory in the
       repository’s <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees </b>directory. The private
       sub-directory’s name is usually the base name of the linked
       worktree’s path, possibly appended with a number to make it
       unique. For example, when <b>$GIT_DIR=/path/main/.git </b>the command
       <b>git worktree add /path/other/test-next next </b>creates the linked
       worktree in <b>/path/other/test-next </b>and also creates a
       <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next </b>directory (or
       <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next1 </b>if <b>test-next </b>is already taken).

       Within a linked worktree, <b>$GIT_DIR </b>is set to point to this
       private directory (e.g. <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next </b>in
       the example) and <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR </b>is set to point back to the main
       worktree’s <b>$GIT_DIR </b>(e.g. <b>/path/main/.git</b>). These settings are
       made in a <b>.git </b>file located at the top directory of the linked
       worktree.

       Path resolution via <b>git rev-parse --git-path </b>uses either <b>$GIT_DIR</b>
       or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR </b>depending on the path. For example, in the
       linked worktree <b>git rev-parse --git-path HEAD </b>returns
       <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/HEAD </b>(not
       <b>/path/other/test-next/.git/HEAD </b>or <b>/path/main/.git/HEAD</b>) while
       <b>git rev-parse --git-path refs/heads/master </b>uses <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b>
       and returns <b>/path/main/.git/refs/heads/master</b>, since refs are
       shared across all worktrees, except <b>refs/bisect</b>, <b>refs/worktree</b>
       and <b>refs/rewritten</b>.

       See <a href="../man5/gitrepository-layout.5.html">gitrepository-layout(5)</a> for more information. The rule of
       thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a path belongs
       to <b>$GIT_DIR </b>or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR </b>when you need to directly access
       something inside <b>$GIT_DIR</b>. Use <b>git rev-parse --git-path </b>to get
       the final path.

       If you manually move a linked worktree, you need to update the
       <b>gitdir </b>file in the entry’s directory. For example, if a linked
       worktree is moved to <b>/newpath/test-next </b>and its <b>.git </b>file points
       to <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b>, then update
       <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/gitdir </b>to reference
       <b>/newpath/test-next </b>instead. Better yet, run <b>git worktree repair</b>
       to reestablish the connection automatically.

       To prevent a <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees </b>entry from being pruned (which
       can be useful in some situations, such as when the entry’s
       worktree is stored on a portable device), use the <b>git worktree</b>
       <b>lock </b>command, which adds a file named <b>locked </b>to the entry’s
       directory. The file contains the reason in plain text. For
       example, if a linked worktree’s <b>.git </b>file points to
       <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next </b>then a file named
       <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/locked </b>will prevent the
       <b>test-next </b>entry from being pruned. See <a href="../man5/gitrepository-layout.5.html">gitrepository-layout(5)</a>
       for details.

       When <b>extensions.worktreeConfig </b>is enabled, the config file
       <b>.git/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree </b>is read after <b>.git/config </b>is.
</pre> <h2>
LIST OUTPUT FORMAT </h2>
<pre>
       The <b>worktree list </b>command has two output formats. The default
       format shows the details on a single line with columns. For
       example:

           $ git worktree list
           /path/to/bare-source            (bare)
           /path/to/linked-worktree        abcd1234 [master]
           /path/to/other-linked-worktree  1234abc  (detached HEAD)

       The command also shows annotations for each worktree, according
       to its state. These annotations are:

       •   <b>locked</b>, if the worktree is locked.

       •   <b>prunable</b>, if the worktree can be pruned via <b>git worktree</b>
           <b>prune</b>.

           $ git worktree list
           /path/to/linked-worktree    abcd1234 [master]
           /path/to/locked-worktree    acbd5678 (brancha) locked
           /path/to/prunable-worktree  5678abc  (detached HEAD) prunable

       For these annotations, a reason might also be available and this
       can be seen using the verbose mode. The annotation is then moved
       to the next line indented followed by the additional information.

           $ git worktree list --verbose
           /path/to/linked-worktree              abcd1234 [master]
           /path/to/locked-worktree-no-reason    abcd5678 (detached HEAD) locked
           /path/to/locked-worktree-with-reason  1234abcd (brancha)
                   locked: worktree path is mounted on a portable device
           /path/to/prunable-worktree            5678abc1 (detached HEAD)
                   prunable: gitdir file points to non-existent location

       Note that the annotation is moved to the next line if the
       additional information is available, otherwise it stays on the
       same line as the worktree itself.

   <b>Porcelain Format</b>
       The porcelain format has a line per attribute. If <b>-z </b>is given
       then the lines are terminated with NUL rather than a newline.
       Attributes are listed with a label and value separated by a
       single space. Boolean attributes (like <b>bare </b>and <b>detached</b>) are
       listed as a label only, and are present only if the value is
       true. Some attributes (like <b>locked</b>) can be listed as a label only
       or with a value depending upon whether a reason is available. The
       first attribute of a worktree is always <b>worktree</b>, an empty line
       indicates the end of the record. For example:

           $ git worktree list --porcelain
           worktree /path/to/bare-source
           bare

           worktree /path/to/linked-worktree
           HEAD abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234
           branch refs/heads/master

           worktree /path/to/other-linked-worktree
           HEAD 1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234a
           detached

           worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-locked-no-reason
           HEAD 5678abc5678abc5678abc5678abc5678abc5678c
           branch refs/heads/locked-no-reason
           locked

           worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-locked-with-reason
           HEAD 3456def3456def3456def3456def3456def3456b
           branch refs/heads/locked-with-reason
           locked reason why is locked

           worktree /path/to/linked-worktree-prunable
           HEAD 1233def1234def1234def1234def1234def1234b
           detached
           prunable gitdir file points to non-existent location

       Unless <b>-z </b>is used any "unusual" characters in the lock reason
       such as newlines are escaped and the entire reason is quoted as
       explained for the configuration variable <b>core.quotePath </b>(see
       <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>). For Example:

           $ git worktree list --porcelain
           ...
           locked "reason\nwhy is locked"
           ...

EXAMPLES </h2>
<pre>
       You are in the middle of a refactoring session and your boss
       comes in and demands that you fix something immediately. You
       might typically use <a href="git-stash.1.html">git-stash(1)</a> to store your changes away
       temporarily, however, your working tree is in such a state of
       disarray (with new, moved, and removed files, and other bits and
       pieces strewn around) that you don’t want to risk disturbing any
       of it. Instead, you create a temporary linked worktree to make
       the emergency fix, remove it when done, and then resume your
       earlier refactoring session.

           $ git worktree add -b emergency-fix ../temp master
           $ pushd ../temp
           # ... hack hack hack ...
           $ git commit -a -m 'emergency fix for boss'
           $ popd
           $ git worktree remove ../temp
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       Multiple checkout in general is still experimental, and the
       support for submodules is incomplete. It is NOT recommended to
       make multiple checkouts of a superproject.
