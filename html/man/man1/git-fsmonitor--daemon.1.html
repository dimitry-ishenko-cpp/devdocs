NAME </h2>
<pre>
       git-fsmonitor--daemon - A Built-in Filesystem Monitor
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>git fsmonitor--daemon</i> start
       <i>git fsmonitor--daemon</i> run
       <i>git fsmonitor--daemon</i> stop
       <i>git fsmonitor--daemon</i> status
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       A daemon to watch the working directory for file and directory
       changes using platform-specific filesystem notification
       facilities.

       This daemon communicates directly with commands like <b>git status</b>
       using the <b>simple IPC</b>[1] interface instead of the slower
       <a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks(5)</a> interface.

       This daemon is built into Git so that no third-party tools are
       required.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       start
           Starts a daemon in the background.

       run
           Runs a daemon in the foreground.

       stop
           Stops the daemon running in the current working directory, if
           present.

       status
           Exits with zero status if a daemon is watching the current
           working directory.
</pre> <h2>
REMARKS </h2>
<pre>
       This daemon is a long running process used to watch a single
       working directory and maintain a list of the recently changed
       files and directories. Performance of commands such as <b>git status</b>
       can be increased if they just ask for a summary of changes to the
       working directory and can avoid scanning the disk.

       When <b>core.fsmonitor </b>is set to <b>true </b>(see <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a>) commands,
       such as <b>git status</b>, will ask the daemon for changes and
       automatically start it (if necessary).

       For more information see the "File System Monitor" section in
       <a href="git-update-index.1.html">git-update-index(1)</a>.
</pre> <h2>
CAVEATS </h2>
<pre>
       The fsmonitor daemon does not currently know about submodules and
       does not know to filter out filesystem events that happen within
       a submodule. If fsmonitor daemon is watching a super repo and a
       file is modified within the working directory of a submodule, it
       will report the change (as happening against the super repo).
       However, the client will properly ignore these extra events, so
       performance may be affected but it will not cause an incorrect
       result.

       By default, the fsmonitor daemon refuses to work with
       network-mounted repositories; this may be overridden by setting
       <b>fsmonitor.allowRemote </b>to <b>true</b>. Note, however, that the fsmonitor
       daemon is not guaranteed to work correctly with all
       network-mounted repositories, so such use is considered
       experimental.

       On Mac OS, the inter-process communication (IPC) between various
       Git commands and the fsmonitor daemon is done via a Unix domain
       socket (UDS) — a special type of file — which is supported by
       native Mac OS filesystems, but not on network-mounted
       filesystems, NTFS, or FAT32. Other filesystems may or may not
       have the needed support; the fsmonitor daemon is not guaranteed
       to work with these filesystems and such use is considered
       experimental.

       By default, the socket is created in the <b>.git </b>directory. However,
       if the <b>.git </b>directory is on a network-mounted filesystem, it will
       instead be created at <b>$HOME/.git-fsmonitor-* </b>unless <b>$HOME </b>itself
       is on a network-mounted filesystem, in which case you must set
       the configuration variable <b>fsmonitor.socketDir </b>to the path of a
       directory on a Mac OS native filesystem in which to create the
       socket file.

       If none of the above directories (<b>.git</b>, <b>$HOME</b>, or
       <b>fsmonitor.socketDir</b>) is on a native Mac OS file filesystem the
       fsmonitor daemon will report an error that will cause the daemon
       and the currently running command to exit.

CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively
       included from the <a href="git-config.1.html">git-config(1)</a> documentation. The content is the
       same as what’s found there:

       fsmonitor.allowRemote
           By default, the fsmonitor daemon refuses to work with
           network-mounted repositories. Setting <b>fsmonitor.allowRemote</b>
           to <b>true </b>overrides this behavior. Only respected when
           <b>core.fsmonitor </b>is set to <b>true</b>.

       fsmonitor.socketDir
           This Mac OS-specific option, if set, specifies the directory
           in which to create the Unix domain socket used for
           communication between the fsmonitor daemon and various Git
           commands. The directory must reside on a native Mac OS
           filesystem. Only respected when <b>core.fsmonitor </b>is set to
           <b>true</b>.
