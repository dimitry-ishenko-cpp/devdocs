NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       Linux kernel uses the badness heuristic to select which process
       gets killed in out of memory conditions.

       The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task
       ranging from 0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to determine
       which process is targeted. The units are roughly a proportion
       along that range of allowed memory the process may allocate from
       based on an estimation of its current memory and swap use. For
       example, if a task is using all allowed memory, its badness score
       will be 1000. If it is using half of its allowed memory, its
       score will be 500.

       There is an additional factor included in the badness score: the
       current memory and swap usage is discounted by 3% for root
       processes.

       The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context in which
       the oom killer was called. If it is due to the memory assigned to
       the allocating task’s cpuset being exhausted, the allowed memory
       represents the set of mems assigned to that cpuset. If it is due
       to a mempolicy’s node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory
       represents the set of mempolicy nodes. If it is due to a memory
       limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed memory is that
       configured limit. Finally, if it is due to the entire system
       being out of memory, the allowed memory represents all
       allocatable resources.

       The adjust score value is added to the badness score before it is
       used to determine which task to kill. Acceptable values range
       from -1000 to +1000. This allows userspace to polarize the
       preference for oom killing either by always preferring a certain
       task or completely disabling it. The lowest possible value,
       -1000, is equivalent to disabling oom killing entirely for that
       task since it will always report a badness score of 0.

       Setting an adjust score value of +500, for example, is roughly
       equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the same
       system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller resources to use
       at least 50% more memory. A value of -500, on the other hand,
       would be roughly equivalent to discounting 50% of the task’s
       allowed memory from being considered as scoring against the task.
