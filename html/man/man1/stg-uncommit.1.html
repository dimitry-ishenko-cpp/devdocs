NAME </h2>
<pre>
       stg-uncommit - Convert regular Git commits into StGit patches
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <i>stg uncommit</i> &lt;patchname-1&gt; [&lt;patchname-2&gt; ...]
       <i>stg uncommit</i> -n number [&lt;patchname-prefix&gt;]
       <i>stg uncommit</i> -t &lt;committish&gt; [-x]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       Convert one or more Git commits from the base of the current
       stack into StGit patches. The original Git commits are not
       modified; the StGit stack extends to incorporate these commits as
       the bottommost applied patches. This is the opposite of
       <a href="stg-commit.1.html">stg-commit(1)</a>.

       By default, the number of patches to uncommit is determined by
       the number of patch names provided on the command line. The first
       provided name is used for the first patch to uncommit, i.e. for
       the newest patch.

       The -n/--number option specifies the number of patches to
       uncommit. In this case, at most one patch name may be specified.
       It is used as prefix to which the patch number is appended. If no
       patch names are provided on the command line, StGit automatically
       generates names based on the first lines of the commit messages.

       The -t/--to option specifies that all commits up to and including
       the given commit should be uncommitted. The -x/--exclusive option
       may be used to exclude the "to" commit.

       Only commits with exactly one parent can be uncommitted; in other
       words, merge commits may not be uncommitted.
