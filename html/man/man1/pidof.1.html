NAME </h2>
<pre>
       pidof - find the process ID of a running program
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pidof </b>[<b>-s</b>] [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-w</b>] [<b>-x</b>] [<b>-o </b><i>omitpid</i>[,...]] ... [<b>-t</b>] [<b>-S</b>
       <i>separator</i>] <i>program</i> ...
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Pidof </b>finds the process id's (pids) of the named programs. It
       prints those id's on the standard output.
</pre> <h2>
OPTIONS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>-s     </b>Single shot - this instructs the program to only return
              one <i>pid</i>.

       <b>-c     </b>Only return process ids that are running with the same
              root directory.  This option is ignored for non-root
              users, as they will be unable to check the current root
              directory of processes they do not own.

       <b>-q     </b>Quiet mode, suppress any output and only sets the exit
              status accordingly.

       <b>-w     </b>Show also processes that do not have visible command line
              (e.g. kernel worker threads).

       <b>-x     </b>Scripts too - this causes the program to also return
              process id's of shells running the named scripts.

       <b>-o </b><i>omitpid</i>
              Tells <b>pidof </b>to omit processes with that process id. The
              special pid <b>%PPID </b>can be used to name the parent process
              of the <b>pidof </b>program, in other words the calling shell or
              shell script.

       <b>-t     </b>Shows all thread ids instead of pids.

       <b>-S </b><i>separator</i>
              Use <i>separator</i> as a separator put between pids. Used only
              when more than one pids are printed for the program.  The
              <b>-d </b>option is an alias for this option for sysvinit <b>pidof</b>
              compatibility.
</pre> <h2>
EXIT STATUS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>0      </b>At least one program was found with the requested name.

       <b>1      </b>No program was found with the requested name.
</pre> <h2>
BUGS </h2>
<pre>
       When using the <b>-x </b>option, <b>pidof </b>only has a simple method for
       detecting scripts and will miss scripts that, for example, use
       env. This limitation is due to how the scripts look in the proc
       filesystem.
