NAME </h2>

       <b>pmdasample </b>- sample performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pmdasample </b>[<b>-d </b><i>domain</i>] [<b>-i </b><i>port</i>] [<b>-l </b><i>logfile</i>] [<b>-p</b>]
       [<b>-u </b><i>socket</i>] [<b>-U </b><i>username</i>]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>pmdasample </b>is a sample Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which exports a variety of synthetic performance metrics.

       This PMDA was developed as part of the quality assurance testing
       for the PCP product, but has other uses, most notably in the
       development of new PCP clients.

       The metrics exported by the sample PMDA cover the full range of
       data types, data semantics, value cardinality, instance domain
       stability and error conditions found in real PMDAs.

       A brief description of the <b>pmdasample </b>command line options
       follows:

       <b>-d   </b>It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics <i>domain</i>
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
            <i>domain</i> should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
            and the same <i>domain</i> number should be used for the same PMDA
            on all hosts.

       <b>-i   </b>Expect PMCD to connect to <b>pmdasample </b>on the specified TCP/IP
            port.  <i>port</i> may be a port number or port name.

       <b>-l   </b>Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            <i>sample.log</i> is written in the current directory of <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a>
            when <b>pmdasample </b>is started, i.e.  <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd</b>.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
            written to the standard error instead.

       <b>-p   </b>Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to
            <b>pmdasample </b>is via standard input and standard output.  This
            is the default connection mode.

       <b>-u   </b>Expect PMCD to connect to <b>pmdasample </b>on the Unix domain
            socket named <i>socket</i>.

       <b>-U   </b>User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
            the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
            but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
            used by default.

       At most one of the options <b>-i</b>, <b>-p </b>and <b>-u </b>may be specified.
</pre> <h2>
INSTALLATION </h2>
<pre>
       If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
       sample performance metrics, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample
            # ./Install

       Note that the installation script also installs the DSO version
       of the sample PMDA, so there are in fact two PMDAs installed, and
       two sets of performance metrics, namely <b>sample.*  </b>and
       <b>sampledso.*</b>.

       If you want to undo the installation (and remove both PMDAs), do
       the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample
            # ./Remove

       <b>pmdasample </b>is launched by <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> and should never be executed
       directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify <a href="pmcd.1.html">pmcd(1)</a> when the
       agent is installed or removed.

FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <b>$PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH</b>
              command line options used to launch <b>pmdasample</b>
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/help</b>
              default help text file for the sample metrics
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/Install</b>
              installation script for the <b>pmdasample </b>agent
       <b>$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sample/Remove</b>
              undo installation script for the <b>pmdasample </b>agent
       <b>$PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/sample.log</b>
              default log file for error messages and other information
              from <b>pmdasample</b>
</pre> <h2>
PCP ENVIRONMENT </h2>
<pre>
       Environment variables with the prefix <b>PCP_ </b>are used to
       parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
       installation, the file <b>/etc/pcp.conf </b>contains the local values
       for these variables.  The <b>$PCP_CONF </b>variable may be used to
       specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
       <a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf(5)</a>.
