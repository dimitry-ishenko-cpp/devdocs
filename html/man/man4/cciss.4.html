NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cciss - HP Smart Array block driver
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       modprobe cciss [ cciss_allow_hpsa=1 ]
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <b>Note</b>: This obsolete driver was removed in Linux 4.14, as it is
       superseded by the <a href="hpsa.4.html">hpsa(4)</a> driver in newer kernels.

       <b>cciss </b>is a block driver for older HP Smart Array RAID
       controllers.

   <b>Options</b>
       <i>cciss_allow_hpsa=1</i>: This option prevents the <b>cciss </b>driver from
       attempting to drive any controllers that the <a href="hpsa.4.html">hpsa(4)</a> driver is
       capable of controlling, which is to say, the <b>cciss </b>driver is
       restricted by this option to the following controllers:

           Smart Array 5300
           Smart Array 5i

   <b>SCSI tape drive and medium changer support</b>
       SCSI sequential access devices and medium changer devices are
       supported and appropriate device nodes are automatically created
       (e.g., <i>/dev/st0</i>, <i>/dev/st1</i>, etc.; see <a href="st.4.html">st(4)</a> for more details.)
       You must enable "SCSI tape drive support for Smart Array 5xxx"
       and "SCSI support" in your kernel configuration to be able to use
       SCSI tape drives with your Smart Array 5xxx controller.

       Additionally, note that the driver will not engage the SCSI core
       at init time.  The driver must be directed to dynamically engage
       the SCSI core via the <i>/proc</i> filesystem entry, which the "block"
       side of the driver creates as <i>/proc/driver/cciss/cciss*</i> at run
       time.  This is because at driver init time, the SCSI core may not
       yet be initialized (because the driver is a block driver) and
       attempting to register it with the SCSI core in such a case would
       cause a hang.  This is best done via an initialization script
       (typically in <i>/etc/init.d</i>, but could vary depending on
       distribution).  For example:

           for x in /proc/driver/cciss/cciss[0-9]*
           do
               echo "engage scsi" &gt; $x
           done

       Once the SCSI core is engaged by the driver, it cannot be
       disengaged (except by unloading the driver, if it happens to be
       linked as a module.)

       Note also that if no sequential access devices or medium changers
       are detected, the SCSI core will not be engaged by the action of
       the above script.

   <b>Hot plug support for SCSI tape drives</b>
       Hot plugging of SCSI tape drives is supported, with some caveats.
       The <b>cciss </b>driver must be informed that changes to the SCSI bus
       have been made.  This may be done via the <i>/proc</i> filesystem.  For
       example:

              echo "rescan" &gt; /proc/scsi/cciss0/1

       This causes the driver to:

              (1)  query the adapter about changes to the physical SCSI
                   buses and/or fiber channel arbitrated loop, and

              (2)  make note of any new or removed sequential access
                   devices or medium changers.

       The driver will output messages indicating which devices have
       been added or removed and the controller, bus, target, and lun
       used to address each device.  The driver then notifies the SCSI
       midlayer of these changes.

       Note that the naming convention of the <i>/proc</i> filesystem entries
       contains a number in addition to the driver name (e.g., "cciss0"
       instead of just "cciss", which you might expect).

       Note: <i>Only</i> sequential access devices and medium changers are
       presented as SCSI devices to the SCSI midlayer by the <b>cciss</b>
       driver.  Specifically, physical SCSI disk drives are <i>not</i>
       presented to the SCSI midlayer.  The only disk devices that are
       presented to the kernel are logical drives that the array
       controller constructs from regions on the physical drives.  The
       logical drives are presented to the block layer (not to the SCSI
       midlayer).  It is important for the driver to prevent the kernel
       from accessing the physical drives directly, since these drives
       are used by the array controller to construct the logical drives.

   <b>SCSI error handling for tape drives and medium changers</b>
       The Linux SCSI midlayer provides an error-handling protocol that
       is initiated whenever a SCSI command fails to complete within a
       certain amount of time (which can vary depending on the command).
       The <b>cciss </b>driver participates in this protocol to some extent.
       The normal protocol is a four-step process:

       (1)  First, the device is told to abort the command.

       (2)  If that doesn't work, the device is reset.

       (3)  If that doesn't work, the SCSI bus is reset.

       (4)  If that doesn't work, the host bus adapter is reset.

       The <b>cciss </b>driver is a block driver as well as a SCSI driver and
       only the tape drives and medium changers are presented to the
       SCSI midlayer.  Furthermore, unlike more straightforward SCSI
       drivers, disk I/O continues through the block side during the
       SCSI error-recovery process.  Therefore, the <b>cciss </b>driver
       implements only the first two of these actions, aborting the
       command, and resetting the device.  Note also that most tape
       drives will not oblige in aborting commands, and sometimes it
       appears they will not even obey a reset command, though in most
       circumstances they will.  If the command cannot be aborted and
       the device cannot be reset, the device will be set offline.

       In the event that the error-handling code is triggered and a tape
       drive is successfully reset or the tardy command is successfully
       aborted, the tape drive may still not allow I/O to continue until
       some command is issued that positions the tape to a known
       position.  Typically you must rewind the tape (by issuing <i>mt -f</i>
       <i>/dev/st0 rewind</i> for example) before I/O can proceed again to a
       tape drive that was reset.
