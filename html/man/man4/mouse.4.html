NAME </h2>
<pre>
       mouse - serial mouse interface
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       Serial mice are connected to a serial RS232/V24 dialout line, see
       <a href="ttys.4.html">ttyS(4)</a> for a description.

DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
   <b>Introduction</b>
       The pinout of the usual 9 pin plug as used for serial mice is:

                       pin   name   used for
                         2    RX    Data
                         3    TX    -12 V, Imax = 10 mA
                         4   DTR    +12 V, Imax = 10 mA
                         7   RTS    +12 V, Imax = 10 mA
                         5   GND    Ground

       This is the specification, in fact 9 V suffices with most mice.

       The mouse driver can recognize a mouse by dropping RTS to low and
       raising it again.  About 14 ms later the mouse will send 0x4D
       ('M') on the data line.  After a further 63 ms, a Microsoft-
       compatible 3-button mouse will send 0x33 ('3').

       The relative mouse movement is sent as <i>dx</i> (positive means right)
       and <i>dy</i> (positive means down).  Various mice can operate at
       different speeds.  To select speeds, cycle through the speeds
       9600, 4800, 2400, and 1200 bit/s, each time writing the two
       characters from the table below and waiting 0.1 seconds.  The
       following table shows available speeds and the strings that
       select them:

                                bit/s   string
                                9600    *q
                                4800    *p
                                2400    *o
                                1200    *n

       The first byte of a data packet can be used for synchronization
       purposes.

   <b>Microsoft protocol</b>
       The <b>Microsoft </b>protocol uses 1 start bit, 7 data bits, no parity
       and one stop bit at the speed of 1200 bits/sec.  Data is sent to
       RxD in 3-byte packets.  The <i>dx</i> and <i>dy</i> movements are sent as
       two's-complement, <i>lb</i> (<i>rb</i>) are set when the left (right) button is
       pressed:

                 byte   d6   d5    d4    d3    d2    d1    d0
                    1   1    lb    rb    dy7   dy6   dx7   dx6
                    2   0    dx5   dx4   dx3   dx2   dx1   dx0
                    3   0    dy5   dy4   dy3   dy2   dy1   dy0

   <b>3-button Microsoft protocol</b>
       Original Microsoft mice only have two buttons.  However, there
       are some three button mice which also use the Microsoft protocol.
       Pressing or releasing the middle button is reported by sending a
       packet with zero movement and no buttons pressed.  (Thus, unlike
       for the other two buttons, the status of the middle button is not
       reported in each packet.)

   <b>Logitech protocol</b>
       Logitech serial 3-button mice use a different extension of the
       Microsoft protocol: when the middle button is up, the above
       3-byte packet is sent.  When the middle button is down a 4-byte
       packet is sent, where the 4th byte has value 0x20 (or at least
       has the 0x20 bit set).  In particular, a press of the middle
       button is reported as 0,0,0,0x20 when no other buttons are down.

   <b>Mousesystems protocol</b>
       The <b>Mousesystems </b>protocol uses 1 start bit, 8 data bits, no
       parity, and two stop bits at the speed of 1200 bits/sec.  Data is
       sent to RxD in 5-byte packets.  <i>dx</i> is sent as the sum of the two
       two's-complement values, <i>dy</i> is send as negated sum of the two
       two's-complement values.  <i>lb</i> (<i>mb</i>, <i>rb</i>) are cleared when the left
       (middle, right) button is pressed:

          byte   d7    d6     d5     d4     d3     d2     d1     d0
             1   1     0      0      0      0      lb     mb     rb
             2   0    dxa6   dxa5   dxa4   dxa3   dxa2   dxa1   dxa0
             3   0    dya6   dya5   dya4   dya3   dya2   dya1   dya0
             4   0    dxb6   dxb5   dxb4   dxb3   dxb2   dxb1   dxb0
             5   0    dyb6   dyb5   dyb4   dyb3   dyb2   dyb1   dyb0

       Bytes 4 and 5 describe the change that occurred since bytes 2 and
       3 were transmitted.

   <b>Sun protocol</b>
       The <b>Sun </b>protocol is the 3-byte version of the above 5-byte
       Mousesystems protocol: the last two bytes are not sent.

   <b>MM protocol</b>
       The <b>MM </b>protocol uses 1 start bit, 8 data bits, odd parity, and
       one stop bit at the speed of 1200 bits/sec.  Data is sent to RxD
       in 3-byte packets.  <i>dx</i> and <i>dy</i> are sent as single signed values,
       the sign bit indicating a negative value.  <i>lb</i> (<i>mb</i>, <i>rb</i>) are set
       when the left (middle, right) button is pressed:

              byte   d7   d6    d5    d4    d3    d2    d1    d0
                 1   1     0     0    dxs   dys   lb    mb    rb
                 2   0    dx6   dx5   dx4   dx3   dx2   dx1   dx0
                 3   0    dy6   dy5   dy4   dy3   dy2   dy1   dy0
