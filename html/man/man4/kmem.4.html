DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/dev/mem</i> is a character device file that is an image of the main
       memory of the computer.  It may be used, for example, to examine
       (and even patch) the system.

       Byte addresses in <i>/dev/mem</i> are interpreted as physical memory
       addresses.  References to nonexistent locations cause errors to
       be returned.

       Examining and patching is likely to lead to unexpected results
       when read-only or write-only bits are present.

       Since Linux 2.6.26, and depending on the architecture, the
       <b>CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM </b>kernel configuration option limits the areas
       which can be accessed through this file.  For example: on x86,
       RAM access is not allowed but accessing memory-mapped PCI regions
       is.

       It is typically created by:

           mknod -m 660 /dev/mem c 1 1
           chown root:kmem /dev/mem

       The file <i>/dev/kmem</i> is the same as <i>/dev/mem</i>, except that the
       kernel virtual memory rather than physical memory is accessed.
       Since Linux 2.6.26, this file is available only if the
       <b>CONFIG_DEVKMEM </b>kernel configuration option is enabled.

       It is typically created by:

           mknod -m 640 /dev/kmem c 1 2
           chown root:kmem /dev/kmem

       <i>/dev/port</i> is similar to <i>/dev/mem</i>, but the I/O ports are accessed.

       It is typically created by:

           mknod -m 660 /dev/port c 1 4
           chown root:kmem /dev/port
