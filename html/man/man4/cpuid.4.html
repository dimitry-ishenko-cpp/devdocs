NAME </h2>
<pre>
       cpuid - x86 CPUID access device
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       CPUID provides an interface for querying information about the
       x86 CPU.

       This device is accessed by <a href="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek(2)</a> or <a href="../man2/pread.2.html">pread(2)</a> to the
       appropriate CPUID level and reading in chunks of 16 bytes.  A
       larger read size means multiple reads of consecutive levels.

       The lower 32 bits of the file position is used as the incoming
       <i>%eax</i>, and the upper 32 bits of the file position as the incoming
       <i>%ecx</i>, the latter is intended for "counting" <i>eax</i> levels like
       <i>eax=4</i>.

       This driver uses <i>/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/cpuid</i>, where <i>CPUNUM</i> is the minor
       number, and on an SMP box will direct the access to CPU <i>CPUNUM</i> as
       listed in <i>/proc/cpuinfo</i>.

       This file is protected so that it can be read only by the user
       <i>root</i>, or members of the group <i>root</i>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The CPUID instruction can be directly executed by a program using
       inline assembler.  However this device allows convenient access
       to all CPUs without changing process affinity.

       Most of the information in <i>cpuid</i> is reported by the kernel in
       cooked form either in <i>/proc/cpuinfo</i> or through subdirectories in
       <i>/sys/devices/system/cpu</i>.  Direct CPUID access through this device
       should only be used in exceptional cases.

       The <i>cpuid</i> driver is not auto-loaded.  On modular kernels you
       might need to use the following command to load it explicitly
       before use:

           $ modprobe cpuid

       There is no support for CPUID functions that require additional
       input registers.

       Early i486 CPUs do not support the CPUID instruction; opening
       this device for those CPUs fails with EIO.
