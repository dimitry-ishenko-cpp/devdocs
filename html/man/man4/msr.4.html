NAME </h2>
<pre>
       msr - x86 CPU MSR access device
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr</i> provides an interface to read and write the
       model-specific registers (MSRs) of an x86 CPU.  <i>CPUNUM</i> is the
       number of the CPU to access as listed in <i>/proc/cpuinfo</i>.

       The register access is done by opening the file and seeking to
       the MSR number as offset in the file, and then reading or writing
       in chunks of 8 bytes.  An I/O transfer of more than 8 bytes means
       multiple reads or writes of the same register.

       This file is protected so that it can be read and written only by
       the user <i>root</i>, or members of the group <i>root</i>.
</pre> <h2>
NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>msr</i> driver is not auto-loaded.  On modular kernels you might
       need to use the following command to load it explicitly before
       use:

           $ modprobe msr
