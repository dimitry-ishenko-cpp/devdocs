NAME </h2>
<pre>
       wavelan - AT&amp;T GIS WaveLAN ISA device driver
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>insmod wavelan_cs.o [io=</b><i>B,B..</i><b>] [ irq=</b><i>I,I..</i><b>] [name=</b><i>N,N..</i><b>]</b>
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>This driver is obsolete:</i> it was removed in Linux 2.6.35.

       <b>wavelan </b>is the low-level device driver for the NCR / AT&amp;T /
       Lucent <b>WaveLAN ISA </b>and Digital (DEC) <b>RoamAbout DS </b>wireless
       ethernet adapter.  This driver is available as a module or might
       be compiled in the kernel.  This driver supports multiple cards
       in both forms (up to 4) and allocates the next available ethernet
       device (eth0..eth#) for each card found, unless a device name is
       explicitly specified (see below).  This device name will be
       reported in the kernel log file with the MAC address, NWID, and
       frequency used by the card.

   <b>Parameters</b>
       This section applies to the module form (parameters passed on the
       <a href="../man8/insmod.8.html">insmod(8)</a> command line).  If the driver is included in the
       kernel, use the <i>ether=IRQ,IO,NAME</i> syntax on the kernel command
       line.

       <b>io     </b>Specify the list of base addresses where to search for
              wavelan cards (setting by dip switch on the card).  If you
              don't specify any io address, the driver will scan 0x390
              and 0x3E0 addresses, which might conflict with other
              hardware...

       <b>irq    </b>Set the list of IRQs that each wavelan card should use
              (the value is saved in permanent storage for future use).

       <b>name   </b>Set the list of names to be used for each wavelan card
              device (name used by <a href="../man8/ifconfig.8.html">ifconfig(8)</a>).

   <b>Wireless extensions</b>
       Use <b>iwconfig</b>(8) to manipulate wireless extensions.

   <b>NWID (or domain)</b>
       Set the network ID [<i>0</i> to <i>FFFF</i>] or disable it [<i>off</i>].  As the NWID
       is stored in the card Permanent Storage Area, it will be reused
       at any further invocation of the driver.

   <b>Frequency &amp; channels</b>
       For the 2.4 GHz 2.00 Hardware, you are able to set the frequency
       by specifying one of the 10 defined channels (<i>2.412, 2.422,</i>
       <i>2.425, 2.4305, 2.432, 2.442, 2.452, 2.460, 2.462</i> or <i>2.484</i>) or
       directly as a numeric value.  The frequency is changed
       immediately and permanently.  Frequency availability depends on
       the regulations...

   <b>Statistics spy</b>
       Set a list of MAC addresses in the driver (up to 8) and get the
       last quality of link for each of those (see <b>iwspy</b>(8)).

   <b>/proc/net/wireless</b>
       <i>status</i> is the status reported by the modem.  <i>Link quality</i> reports
       the quality of the modulation on the air (direct sequence spread
       spectrum) [max = 16].  <i>Level</i> and <i>Noise</i> refer to the signal level
       and noise level [max = 64].  The <i>crypt discarded packet</i> and <i>misc</i>
       <i>discarded packet</i> counters are not implemented.

   <b>Private ioctl</b>
       You may use <b>iwpriv</b>(8) to manipulate private ioctls.

   <b>Quality and level threshold</b>
       Enables you to define the quality and level threshold used by the
       modem (packet below that level are discarded).

   <b>Histogram</b>
       This functionality makes it possible to set a number of signal
       level intervals and to count the number of packets received in
       each of those defined intervals.  This distribution might be used
       to calculate the mean value and standard deviation of the signal
       level.

   <b>Specific notes</b>
       This driver fails to detect some <b>non-NCR/AT&amp;T/Lucent </b>Wavelan
       cards.  If this happens for you, you must look in the source code
       on how to add your card to the detection routine.

       Some of the mentioned features are optional.  You may enable or
       disable them by changing flags in the driver header and
       recompile.
