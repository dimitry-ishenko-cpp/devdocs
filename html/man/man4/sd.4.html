NAME </h2>
<pre>
       sd - driver for SCSI disk drives
</pre> <h2>
SYNOPSIS </h2>
<pre>
       <b>#include &lt;linux/hdreg.h&gt;        </b>/* for HDIO_GETGEO */
       <b>#include &lt;linux/fs.h&gt;           </b>/* for BLKGETSIZE and BLKRRPART */
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       The block device name has the following form: <b>sd</b><i>lp,</i> where <i>l</i> is a
       letter denoting the physical drive, and <i>p</i> is a number denoting
       the partition on that physical drive.  Often, the partition
       number, <i>p</i>, will be left off when the device corresponds to the
       whole drive.

       SCSI disks have a major device number of 8, and a minor device
       number of the form (16 * <i>drive_number</i>) + <i>partition_number</i>, where
       <i>drive_number</i> is the number of the physical drive in order of
       detection, and <i>partition_number</i> is as follows:

       •  partition 0 is the whole drive

       •  partitions 1–4 are the DOS "primary" partitions

       •  partitions 5–8 are the DOS "extended" (or "logical")
          partitions

       For example, <i>/dev/sda</i> will have major 8, minor 0, and will refer
       to all of the first SCSI drive in the system; and <i>/dev/sdb3</i> will
       have major 8, minor 19, and will refer to the third DOS "primary"
       partition on the second SCSI drive in the system.

       At this time, only block devices are provided.  Raw devices have
       not yet been implemented.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The following <i>ioctl</i>s are provided:

       <b>HDIO_GETGEO</b>
              Returns the BIOS disk parameters in the following
              structure:

           struct hd_geometry {
               unsigned char  heads;
               unsigned char  sectors;
               unsigned short cylinders;
               unsigned long  start;
           };

              A pointer to this structure is passed as the <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>
              parameter.

              The information returned in the parameter is the disk
              geometry of the drive <i>as understood by DOS!</i>  This geometry
              is <i>not</i> the physical geometry of the drive.  It is used
              when constructing the drive's partition table, however,
              and is needed for convenient operation of <b>fdisk</b>(1),
              <b>efdisk</b>(1), and <b>lilo</b>(1).  If the geometry information is
              not available, zero will be returned for all of the
              parameters.

       <b>BLKGETSIZE</b>
              Returns the device size in sectors.  The <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a>
              parameter should be a pointer to a <i>long</i>.

       <b>BLKRRPART</b>
              Forces a reread of the SCSI disk partition tables.  No
              parameter is needed.

              The SCSI <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> operations are also supported.  If the
              <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> parameter is required, and it is NULL, then
              <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.
</pre> <h2>
FILES </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/dev/sd[a-h]</i>
              the whole device

       <i>/dev/sd[a-h][0-8]</i>
              individual block partitions
