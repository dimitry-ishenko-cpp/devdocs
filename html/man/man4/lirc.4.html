</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The <i>/dev/lirc*</i> character devices provide a low-level
       bidirectional interface to infra-red (IR) remotes.  Most of these
       devices can receive, and some can send.  When receiving or
       sending data, the driver works in two different modes depending
       on the underlying hardware.

       Some hardware (typically TV-cards) decodes the IR signal
       internally and provides decoded button presses as scancode
       values.  Drivers for this kind of hardware work in
       <b>LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE </b>mode.  Such hardware usually does not support
       sending IR signals.  Furthermore, such hardware can only decode a
       limited set of IR protocols, usually only the protocol of the
       specific remote which is bundled with, for example, a TV-card.

       Other hardware provides a stream of pulse/space durations.  Such
       drivers work in <b>LIRC_MODE_MODE2 </b>mode.  Such hardware can be used
       with (almost) any kind of remote.  This type of hardware can also
       be used in <b>LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE </b>mode, in which case the kernel IR
       decoders will decode the IR.  These decoders can be written in
       extended BPF (see <a href="../man2/bpf.2.html">bpf(2)</a>) and attached to the <b>lirc </b>device.
       Sometimes, this kind of hardware also supports sending IR data.

       The <b>LIRC_GET_FEATURES </b>ioctl (see below) allows probing for
       whether receiving and sending is supported, and in which modes,
       amongst other features.

   <b>Reading input with the LIRC_MODE_MODE2 mode</b>
       In the <b>LIRC_MODE_MODE2 mode</b>, the data returned by <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>
       provides 32-bit values representing a space or a pulse duration.
       The time of the duration (microseconds) is encoded in the lower
       24 bits.  Pulse (also known as flash) indicates a duration of
       infrared light being detected, and space (also known as gap)
       indicates a duration with no infrared.  If the duration of space
       exceeds the inactivity timeout, a special timeout package is
       delivered, which marks the end of a message.  The upper 8 bits
       indicate the type of package:

       <b>LIRC_MODE2_SPACE</b>
           Value reflects a space duration (microseconds).

       <b>LIRC_MODE2_PULSE</b>
           Value reflects a pulse duration (microseconds).

       <b>LIRC_MODE2_FREQUENCY</b>
           Value reflects a frequency (Hz); see the
           <b>LIRC_SET_MEASURE_CARRIER_MODE </b>ioctl.

       <b>LIRC_MODE2_TIMEOUT</b>
           Value reflects a space duration (microseconds).  The package
           reflects a timeout; see the <b>LIRC_SET_REC_TIMEOUT_REPORTS</b>
           ioctl.

       <b>LIRC_MODE2_OVERFLOW</b>
           The IR receiver encountered an overflow, and as a result data
           is missing (since Linux 5.18).

   <b>Reading input with the LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE mode</b>
       In the <b>LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE </b>mode, the data returned by <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read(2)</a>
       reflects decoded button presses, in the struct <i>lirc_scancode</i>.
       The scancode is stored in the <i>scancode</i> field, and the IR protocol
       is stored in <i>rc_proto</i>.  This field has one the values of the <i>enum</i>
       <i>rc_proto</i>.

   <b>Writing output with the LIRC_MODE_PULSE mode</b>
       The data written to the character device using <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> is a
       pulse/space sequence of integer values.  Pulses and spaces are
       only marked implicitly by their position.  The data must start
       and end with a pulse, thus it must always include an odd number
       of samples.  The <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> function blocks until the data has been
       transmitted by the hardware.  If more data is provided than the
       hardware can send, the <a href="../man2/write.2.html">write(2)</a> call fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b>.

   <b>Writing output with the LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE mode</b>
       The data written to the character devices must be a single struct
       <i>lirc_scancode</i>.  The <i>scancode</i> and <i>rc_proto</i> fields must filled in,
       all other fields must be 0.  The kernel IR encoders will convert
       the scancode to pulses and spaces.  The protocol or scancode is
       invalid, or the <b>lirc </b>device cannot transmit.

IOCTL COMMANDS </h2>
<pre>
       #include &lt;linux/lirc.h&gt;    /* But see BUGS */

       int ioctl(int fd, int cmd, int *val);

       The following <a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl(2)</a> operations are provided by the <b>lirc</b>
       character device to probe or change specific <b>lirc </b>hardware
       settings.

   <b>Always Supported Commands</b>
       <i>/dev/lirc*</i> devices always support the following commands:

       <b>LIRC_GET_FEATURES </b>(<i>void</i>)
           Returns a bit mask of combined features bits; see FEATURES.

       If a device returns an error code for <b>LIRC_GET_FEATURES</b>, it is
       safe to assume it is not a <b>lirc </b>device.

   <b>Optional Commands</b>
       Some <b>lirc </b>devices support the commands listed below.  Unless
       otherwise stated, these fail with the error <b>ENOTTY </b>if the
       operation isn't supported, or with the error <b>EINVAL </b>if the
       operation failed, or invalid arguments were provided.  If a
       driver does not announce support of certain features, invoking
       the corresponding ioctls will fail with the error <b>ENOTTY</b>.

       <b>LIRC_GET_REC_MODE </b>(<i>void</i>)
              If the <b>lirc </b>device has no receiver, this operation fails
              with the error <b>ENOTTY</b>.  Otherwise, it returns the receive
              mode, which will be one of:

              <b>LIRC_MODE_MODE2</b>
                     The driver returns a sequence of pulse/space
                     durations.

              <b>LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE</b>
                     The driver returns struct <i>lirc_scancode</i> values,
                     each of which represents a decoded button press.

       <b>LIRC_SET_REC_MODE </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Set the receive mode.  <i>val</i> is either <b>LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE </b>or
              <b>LIRC_MODE_MODE2</b>.  If the <b>lirc </b>device has no receiver, this
              operation fails with the error <b>ENOTTY.</b>

       <b>LIRC_GET_SEND_MODE </b>(<i>void</i>)
              Return the send mode.  <b>LIRC_MODE_PULSE </b>or
              <b>LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE </b>is supported.  If the <b>lirc </b>device
              cannot send, this operation fails with the error <b>ENOTTY.</b>

       <b>LIRC_SET_SEND_MODE </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Set the send mode.  <i>val</i> is either <b>LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE </b>or
              <b>LIRC_MODE_PULSE</b>.  If the <b>lirc </b>device cannot send, this
              operation fails with the error <b>ENOTTY</b>.

       <b>LIRC_SET_SEND_CARRIER </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Set the modulation frequency.  The argument is the
              frequency (Hz).

       <b>LIRC_SET_SEND_DUTY_CYCLE </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Set the carrier duty cycle.  <i>val</i> is a number in the range
              [0,100] which describes the pulse width as a percentage of
              the total cycle.  Currently, no special meaning is defined
              for 0 or 100, but the values are reserved for future use.

       <b>LIRC_GET_MIN_TIMEOUT(</b><i>void</i><b>)</b>
       <b>LIRC_GET_MAX_TIMEOUT(</b><i>void</i><b>)</b>
              Some devices have internal timers that can be used to
              detect when there has been no IR activity for a long time.
              This can help <b>lircd</b>(8) in detecting that an IR signal is
              finished and can speed up the decoding process.  These
              operations return integer values with the minimum/maximum
              timeout that can be set (microseconds).  Some devices have
              a fixed timeout.  For such drivers, <b>LIRC_GET_MIN_TIMEOUT</b>
              and <b>LIRC_GET_MAX_TIMEOUT </b>will fail with the error <b>ENOTTY</b>.

       <b>LIRC_SET_REC_TIMEOUT </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Set the integer value for IR inactivity timeout
              (microseconds).  To be accepted, the value must be within
              the limits defined by <b>LIRC_GET_MIN_TIMEOUT </b>and
              <b>LIRC_GET_MAX_TIMEOUT</b>.  A value of 0 (if supported by the
              hardware) disables all hardware timeouts and data should
              be reported as soon as possible.  If the exact value
              cannot be set, then the next possible value <i>greater</i> than
              the given value should be set.

       <b>LIRC_GET_REC_TIMEOUT </b>(<i>void</i>)
              Return the current inactivity timeout (microseconds).
              Available since Linux 4.18.

       <b>LIRC_SET_REC_TIMEOUT_REPORTS </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Enable (<i>val</i> is 1) or disable (<i>val</i> is 0) timeout packages
              in <b>LIRC_MODE_MODE2</b>.  The behavior of this operation has
              varied across kernel versions:

              •  Since Linux 5.17: timeout packages are always enabled
                 and this ioctl is a no-op.

              •  Since Linux 4.16: timeout packages are enabled by
                 default.  Each time the <b>lirc </b>device is opened, the
                 <b>LIRC_SET_REC_TIMEOUT </b>operation can be used to disable
                 (and, if desired, to later re-enable) the timeout on
                 the file descriptor.

              •  In Linux 4.15 and earlier: timeout packages are
                 disabled by default, and enabling them (via
                 <b>LIRC_SET_REC_TIMEOUT</b>) on any file descriptor associated
                 with the <b>lirc </b>device has the effect of enabling
                 timeouts for all file descriptors referring to that
                 device (until timeouts are disabled again).

       <b>LIRC_SET_REC_CARRIER </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Set the upper bound of the receive carrier frequency (Hz).
              See <b>LIRC_SET_REC_CARRIER_RANGE</b>.

       <b>LIRC_SET_REC_CARRIER_RANGE </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Sets the lower bound of the receive carrier frequency
              (Hz).  For this to take affect, first set the lower bound
              using the <b>LIRC_SET_REC_CARRIER_RANGE </b>ioctl, and then the
              upper bound using the <b>LIRC_SET_REC_CARRIER </b>ioctl.

       <b>LIRC_SET_MEASURE_CARRIER_MODE </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Enable (<i>val</i> is 1) or disable (<i>val</i> is 0) the measure mode.
              If enabled, from the next key press on, the driver will
              send <b>LIRC_MODE2_FREQUENCY </b>packets.  By default, this
              should be turned off.

       <b>LIRC_GET_REC_RESOLUTION </b>(<i>void</i>)
              Return the driver resolution (microseconds).

       <b>LIRC_SET_TRANSMITTER_MASK </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Enable the set of transmitters specified in <i>val</i>, which
              contains a bit mask where each enabled transmitter is a 1.
              The first transmitter is encoded by the least significant
              bit, and so on.  When an invalid bit mask is given, for
              example a bit is set even though the device does not have
              so many transmitters, this operation returns the number of
              available transmitters and does nothing otherwise.

       <b>LIRC_SET_WIDEBAND_RECEIVER </b>(<i>int</i>)
              Some devices are equipped with a special wide band
              receiver which is intended to be used to learn the output
              of an existing remote.  This ioctl can be used to enable
              (<i>val</i> equals 1) or disable (<i>val</i> equals 0) this
              functionality.  This might be useful for devices that
              otherwise have narrow band receivers that prevent them to
              be used with certain remotes.  Wide band receivers may
              also be more precise.  On the other hand, their
              disadvantage usually is reduced range of reception.

              Note: wide band receiver may be implicitly enabled if you
              enable carrier reports.  In that case, it will be disabled
              as soon as you disable carrier reports.  Trying to disable
              a wide band receiver while carrier reports are active will
              do nothing.

FEATURES </h2>
<pre>
       the <b>LIRC_GET_FEATURES </b>ioctl returns a bit mask describing
       features of the driver.  The following bits may be returned in
       the mask:

       <b>LIRC_CAN_REC_MODE2</b>
              The driver is capable of receiving using <b>LIRC_MODE_MODE2</b>.

       <b>LIRC_CAN_REC_SCANCODE</b>
              The driver is capable of receiving using
              <b>LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE</b>.

       <b>LIRC_CAN_SET_SEND_CARRIER</b>
              The driver supports changing the modulation frequency
              using <b>LIRC_SET_SEND_CARRIER</b>.

       <b>LIRC_CAN_SET_SEND_DUTY_CYCLE</b>
              The driver supports changing the duty cycle using

       <b>LIRC_CAN_SET_REC_CARRIER</b>
              The driver supports setting the receive carrier frequency
              using <b>LIRC_SET_REC_CARRIER</b>.  Any <b>lirc </b>device since the
              drivers were merged in Linux 2.6.36 must have
              <b>LIRC_CAN_SET_REC_CARRIER_RANGE </b>set if
              <b>LIRC_CAN_SET_REC_CARRIER </b>feature is set.

       <b>LIRC_CAN_SET_REC_CARRIER_RANGE</b>
              The driver supports <b>LIRC_SET_REC_CARRIER_RANGE</b>.  The lower
              bound of the carrier must first be set using the
              <b>LIRC_SET_REC_CARRIER_RANGE </b>ioctl, before using the
              <b>LIRC_SET_REC_CARRIER </b>ioctl to set the upper bound.

              using <b>LIRC_SET_MEASURE_CARRIER_MODE</b>.

       <b>LIRC_CAN_USE_WIDEBAND_RECEIVER</b>
              The driver supports learning mode using
              <b>LIRC_SET_WIDEBAND_RECEIVER</b>.

       <b>LIRC_CAN_SEND_PULSE</b>
              The driver supports sending using <b>LIRC_MODE_PULSE </b>or
              <b>LIRC_MODE_SCANCODE</b>
