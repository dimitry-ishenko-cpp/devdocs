NAME </h2>
<pre>
       initrd - boot loader initialized RAM disk
</pre> <h2>
CONFIGURATION </h2>
<pre>
       <i>/dev/initrd</i> is a read-only block device assigned major number 1
       and minor number 250.  Typically <i>/dev/initrd</i> is owned by
       root:disk with mode 0400 (read access by root only).  If the
       Linux system does not have <i>/dev/initrd</i> already created, it can be
       created with the following commands:

           mknod -m 400 /dev/initrd b 1 250
           chown root:disk /dev/initrd

       Also, support for both "RAM disk" and "Initial RAM disk" (e.g.,
       <b>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y </b>and <b>CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y</b>) must be
       compiled directly into the Linux kernel to use <i>/dev/initrd</i>.  When
       using <i>/dev/initrd</i>, the RAM disk driver cannot be loaded as a
       module.
</pre> <h2>
DESCRIPTION </h2>
<pre>
       The special file <i>/dev/initrd</i> is a read-only block device.  This
       device is a RAM disk that is initialized (e.g., loaded) by the
       boot loader before the kernel is started.  The kernel then can
       use <i>/dev/initrd</i>'s contents for a two-phase system boot-up.

       In the first boot-up phase, the kernel starts up and mounts an
       initial root filesystem from the contents of <i>/dev/initrd</i> (e.g.,
       RAM disk initialized by the boot loader).  In the second phase,
       additional drivers or other modules are loaded from the initial
       root device's contents.  After loading the additional modules, a
       new root filesystem (i.e., the normal root filesystem) is mounted
       from a different device.

   <b>Boot-up operation</b>
       When booting up with <b>initrd</b>, the system boots as follows:

       (1)  The boot loader loads the kernel program and <i>/dev/initrd</i>'s
            contents into memory.

       (2)  On kernel startup, the kernel uncompresses and copies the
            contents of the device <i>/dev/initrd</i> onto device <i>/dev/ram0</i> and
            then frees the memory used by <i>/dev/initrd</i>.

       (3)  The kernel then read-write mounts the device <i>/dev/ram0</i> as
            the initial root filesystem.

       (4)  If the indicated normal root filesystem is also the initial
            root filesystem (e.g., <i>/dev/ram0</i>) then the kernel skips to
            the last step for the usual boot sequence.

       (5)  If the executable file <i>/linuxrc</i> is present in the initial
            root filesystem, <i>/linuxrc</i> is executed with UID 0.  (The file
            <i>/linuxrc</i> must have executable permission.  The file <i>/linuxrc</i>
            can be any valid executable, including a shell script.)

       (6)  If <i>/linuxrc</i> is not executed or when <i>/linuxrc</i> terminates, the
            normal root filesystem is mounted.  (If <i>/linuxrc</i> exits with
            any filesystems mounted on the initial root filesystem, then
            the behavior of the kernel is <b>UNSPECIFIED</b>.  See the NOTES
            section for the current kernel behavior.)

       (7)  If the normal root filesystem has a directory <i>/initrd</i>, the
            device <i>/dev/ram0</i> is moved from <i>/</i> to <i>/initrd</i>.  Otherwise, if
            the directory <i>/initrd</i> does not exist, the device <i>/dev/ram0</i>
            is unmounted.  (When moved from <i>/</i> to <i>/initrd</i>, <i>/dev/ram0</i> is
            not unmounted and therefore processes can remain running
            from <i>/dev/ram0</i>.  If directory <i>/initrd</i> does not exist on the
            normal root filesystem and any processes remain running from
            <i>/dev/ram0</i> when <i>/linuxrc</i> exits, the behavior of the kernel is
            <b>UNSPECIFIED</b>.  See the NOTES section for the current kernel
            behavior.)

       (8)  The usual boot sequence (e.g., invocation of <i>/sbin/init</i>) is
            performed on the normal root filesystem.

   <b>Options</b>
       The following boot loader options, when used with <b>initrd</b>, affect
       the kernel's boot-up operation:

       <b>initrd=</b><i>filename</i>
              Specifies the file to load as the contents of <i>/dev/initrd</i>.
              For <b>LOADLIN </b>this is a command-line option.  For <b>LILO </b>you
              have to use this command in the <b>LILO </b>configuration file
              <i>/etc/lilo.config</i>.  The filename specified with this option
              will typically be a gzipped filesystem image.

       <b>noinitrd</b>
              This boot option disables the two-phase boot-up operation.
              The kernel performs the usual boot sequence as if
              <i>/dev/initrd</i> was not initialized.  With this option, any
              contents of <i>/dev/initrd</i> loaded into memory by the boot
              loader contents are preserved.  This option permits the
              contents of <i>/dev/initrd</i> to be any data and need not be
              limited to a filesystem image.  However, device
              <i>/dev/initrd</i> is read-only and can be read only one time
              after system startup.

       <b>root=</b><i>device-name</i>
              Specifies the device to be used as the normal root
              filesystem.  For <b>LOADLIN </b>this is a command-line option.
              For <b>LILO </b>this is a boot time option or can be used as an
              option line in the <b>LILO </b>configuration file
              <i>/etc/lilo.config</i>.  The device specified by this option
              must be a mountable device having a suitable root
              filesystem.

   <b>Changing the normal root filesystem</b>
       By default, the kernel's settings (e.g., set in the kernel file
       with <b>rdev</b>(8) or compiled into the kernel file), or the boot
       loader option setting is used for the normal root filesystems.
       For an NFS-mounted normal root filesystem, one has to use the
       <b>nfs_root_name </b>and <b>nfs_root_addrs </b>boot options to give the NFS
       settings.  For more information on NFS-mounted root see the
       kernel documentation file
       <i>Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt</i> (or
       <i>Documentation/filesystems/nfsroot.txt</i> before Linux 2.6.33).  For
       more information on setting the root filesystem see also the <b>LILO</b>
       and <b>LOADLIN </b>documentation.

       It is also possible for the <i>/linuxrc</i> executable to change the
       normal root device.  For <i>/linuxrc</i> to change the normal root
       device, <i>/proc</i> must be mounted.  After mounting <i>/proc</i>, <i>/linuxrc</i>
       changes the normal root device by writing into the proc files
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</i>, <i>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name</i>,
       and <i>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs</i>.  For a physical root device,
       the root device is changed by having <i>/linuxrc</i> write the new root
       filesystem device number into <i>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</i>.
       For an NFS root filesystem, the root device is changed by having
       <i>/linuxrc</i> write the NFS setting into files
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name</i> and
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs</i> and then writing 0xff (e.g., the
       pseudo-NFS-device number) into file
       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</i>.  For example, the following shell
       command line would change the normal root device to <i>/dev/hdb1</i>:

           echo 0x365 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev

       For an NFS example, the following shell command lines would
       change the normal root device to the NFS directory <i>/var/nfsroot</i>
       on a local networked NFS server with IP number 193.8.232.7 for a
       system with IP number 193.8.232.2 and named "idefix":

           echo /var/nfsroot &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-name
           echo 193.8.232.2:193.8.232.7::255.255.255.0:idefix \
               &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/nfs-root-addrs
           echo 255 &gt;/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev

       <b>Note</b>: The use of <i>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</i> to change the
       root filesystem is obsolete.  See the Linux kernel source file
       <i>Documentation/admin-guide/initrd.rst</i> (or <i>Documentation/initrd.txt</i>
       before Linux 4.10) as well as <a href="../man2/pivot_root.2.html">pivot_root(2)</a> and <a href="../man8/pivot_root.8.html">pivot_root(8)</a> for
       information on the modern method of changing the root filesystem.

   <b>Usage</b>
       The main motivation for implementing <b>initrd </b>was to allow for
       modular kernel configuration at system installation.

       A possible system installation scenario is as follows:

       (1)  The loader program boots from floppy or other media with a
            minimal kernel (e.g., support for <i>/dev/ram</i>, <i>/dev/initrd</i>, and
            the ext2 filesystem) and loads <i>/dev/initrd</i> with a gzipped
            version of the initial filesystem.

       (2)  The executable <i>/linuxrc</i> determines what is needed to (1)
            mount the normal root filesystem (i.e., device type, device
            drivers, filesystem) and (2) the distribution media (e.g.,
            CD-ROM, network, tape, ...).  This can be done by asking the
            user, by auto-probing, or by using a hybrid approach.

       (3)  The executable <i>/linuxrc</i> loads the necessary modules from the
            initial root filesystem.

       (4)  The executable <i>/linuxrc</i> creates and populates the root
            filesystem.  (At this stage the normal root filesystem does
            not have to be a completed system yet.)

       (5)  The executable <i>/linuxrc</i> sets <i>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</i>,
            unmounts <i>/proc</i>, the normal root filesystem and any other
            filesystems it has mounted, and then terminates.

       (6)  The kernel then mounts the normal root filesystem.

       (7)  Now that the filesystem is accessible and intact, the boot
            loader can be installed.

       (8)  The boot loader is configured to load into <i>/dev/initrd</i> a
            filesystem with the set of modules that was used to bring up
            the system.  (e.g., device <i>/dev/ram0</i> can be modified, then
            unmounted, and finally, the image is written from <i>/dev/ram0</i>
            to a file.)

       (9)  The system is now bootable and additional installation tasks
            can be performed.

       The key role of <i>/dev/initrd</i> in the above is to reuse the
       configuration data during normal system operation without
       requiring initial kernel selection, a large generic kernel or,
       recompiling the kernel.

       A second scenario is for installations where Linux runs on
       systems with different hardware configurations in a single
       administrative network.  In such cases, it may be desirable to
       use only a small set of kernels (ideally only one) and to keep
       the system-specific part of configuration information as small as
       possible.  In this case, create a common file with all needed
       modules.  Then, only the <i>/linuxrc</i> file or a file executed by
       <i>/linuxrc</i> would be different.

       A third scenario is more convenient recovery disks.  Because
       information like the location of the root filesystem partition is
       not needed at boot time, the system loaded from <i>/dev/initrd</i> can
       use a dialog and/or auto-detection followed by a possible sanity
       check.

       Last but not least, Linux distributions on CD-ROM may use <b>initrd</b>
       for easy installation from the CD-ROM.  The distribution can use
       <b>LOADLIN </b>to directly load <i>/dev/initrd</i> from CD-ROM without the need
       of any floppies.  The distribution could also use a <b>LILO </b>boot
       floppy and then bootstrap a bigger RAM disk via <i>/dev/initrd</i> from
       the CD-ROM.

NOTES </h2>
<pre>
       •  With the current kernel, any filesystems that remain mounted
          when <i>/dev/ram0</i> is moved from <i>/</i> to <i>/initrd</i> continue to be
          accessible.  However, the <i>/proc/mounts</i> entries are not
          updated.

       •  With the current kernel, if directory <i>/initrd</i> does not exist,
          then <i>/dev/ram0</i> will <b>not </b>be fully unmounted if <i>/dev/ram0</i> is
          used by any process or has any filesystem mounted on it.  If
          <i>/dev/ram0</i> is <b>not </b>fully unmounted, then <i>/dev/ram0</i> will remain
          in memory.

       •  Users of <i>/dev/initrd</i> should not depend on the behavior given
          in the above notes.  The behavior may change in future
          versions of the Linux kernel.
