<h3 id="Explanation"> Explanation</h3> <p>The union is at least as big as necessary to hold its largest data member, but is usually not larger. The other data members are intended to be allocated in the same bytes as part of that largest member. The details of that allocation are implementation-defined, except that all non-static data members have the same address. It is undefined behavior to read from the member of the union that wasn't most recently written. Many compilers implement, as a non-standard language extension, the ability to read inactive members of a union.</p>
