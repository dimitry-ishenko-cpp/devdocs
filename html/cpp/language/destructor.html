</ul> <p>A trivial destructor is a destructor that performs no action. Objects with trivial destructors don't require a delete-expression and may be disposed of by simply deallocating their storage. All data types compatible with the C language (POD types) are trivially destructible.</p>
<h3 id="Destruction_sequence"> Destruction sequence</h3> <p>For both user-defined or implicitly-defined destructors, after executing the body of the destructor and destroying any automatic objects allocated within the body, the compiler calls the destructors for all non-static non-variant data members of the class, in reverse order of declaration, then it calls the destructors of all direct non-virtual base classes in <a href="initializer_list.html#Initialization_order" title="cpp/language/initializer list" class="mw-redirect">reverse order of construction</a> (which in turn call the destructors of their members and their base classes, etc), and then, if this object is of most-derived class, it calls the destructors of all virtual bases.</p>
<p>Even when the destructor is called directly (e.g. <code>obj.~Foo();</code>), the return statement in <code>~Foo()</code> does not return control to the caller immediately: it calls all those member and base destructors first.</p>

<p>Although <code><a href="../error/uncaught_exception.html" title="cpp/error/uncaught exception">std::uncaught_exceptions</a></code> may sometimes be used to detect stack unwinding in progress, it is generally considered bad practice to allow any destructor to terminate by throwing an exception.

<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/scope_success" title="cpp/experimental/scope success"><code>std::experimental::scope_success</code></a> in Library fundamental TS v3 may have <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/scope_success/%7Escope_success" title="cpp/experimental/scope success/~scope success">a potentially-throwing destructor</a>, which throws an exception when the scope is exited normally and the exit function throws an exception.</p>
