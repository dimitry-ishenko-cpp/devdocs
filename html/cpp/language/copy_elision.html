<td> <h4 id="Prvalue_semantics_.28.22guaranteed_copy_elision.22.29"> Prvalue semantics ("guaranteed copy elision")</h4> <p>Since C++17, a prvalue is not materialized until needed, and then it is constructed directly into the storage of its final destination. This sometimes means that even when the language syntax visually suggests a copy/move (e.g. <a href="copy_initialization.html" title="cpp/language/copy initialization">copy initialization</a>), no copy/move is performed â€” which means the type need not have an accessible copy/move constructor at all. Examples include:</p>
<ul><li> Initializing the returned object in a <a href="return.html" title="cpp/language/return">return statement</a>, when the operand is a <a href="value_category.html" title="cpp/language/value category">prvalue</a> of the same class type (ignoring <a href="cv.html" title="cpp/language/cv">cv-qualification</a>) as the function return type: </li></ul> <div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">T f()
{
    return U(); // constructs a temporary of type U,
                // then initializes the returned T from the temporary
}
T g()
{
    return T(); // constructs the returned T directly; no move
}</pre></div>  The destructor of the type returned must be accessible at the point of the return statement and non-deleted, even though no T object is destroyed.  <ul><li> In the initialization of an object, when the initializer expression is a <a href="value_category.html" title="cpp/language/value category">prvalue</a> of the same class type (ignoring <a href="cv.html" title="cpp/language/cv">cv-qualification</a>) as the variable type: </li></ul> <div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">T x = T(T(f())); // x is initialized by the result of f() directly; no move</pre></div> This can only apply when the object being initialized is known not to be a potentially-overlapping subobject:  <div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">struct C { /* ... */ };
C f();
 
struct D;
D g();
 
struct D : C
{
    D() : C(f()) {}    // no elision when initializing a base-class subobject
    D(int) : D(g()) {} // no elision because the D object being initialized might
                       // be a base-class subobject of some other class
};</pre></div> <p>Note: This rule does not specify an optimization, and the Standard does not formally describe it as "copy elision" (because nothing is being elided). Instead, the C++17 core language specification of <a href="value_category.html" title="cpp/language/value category">prvalues</a> and <a href="implicit_conversion.html#Temporary_materialization" title="cpp/language/implicit conversion">temporaries</a> is fundamentally different from that of earlier C++ revisions: there is no longer a temporary to copy/move from. Another way to describe C++17 mechanics is "unmaterialized value passing" or "deferred temporary materialization": prvalues are returned and used without ever materializing a temporary.</p>
