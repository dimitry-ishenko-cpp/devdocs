</table> <h3 id="Explanation"> Explanation</h3> <p>A <i>function-try-block</i> associates a sequence of catch clauses with the entire function body, and with the <a href="initializer_list.html" title="cpp/language/initializer list" class="mw-redirect">member initializer list</a> (if used in a constructor) as well. Every exception thrown from any statement in the function body, or (for constructors) from any member or base constructor, or (for destructors) from any member or base destructor, transfers control to the <span class="t-spar">handler-sequence</span> the same way an exception thrown in a regular <a href="try_catch.html" title="cpp/language/try catch">try block</a> would.</p>

<p>The behavior is undefined if the catch-clause of a function-try-block used on a constructor or a destructor accesses a base or a non-static member of the object.</p>
<p>Every catch-clause in the function-try-block for a constructor must terminate by throwing an exception. If the control reaches the end of such handler, the current exception is automatically rethrown as if by <code>throw;</code>. The return statement is not allowed in any catch clause of a constructor's function-try-block.</p>
<p>Reaching the end of a catch clause for a function-try-block on a destructor also automatically rethrows the current exception as if by <code>throw;</code>, but a return statement is allowed.</p>
<p>For all other functions, reaching the end of a catch clause is equivalent to <code>return;</code> if the function's return type is (possibly cv-qualified) <code>void</code>, otherwise the behavior is undefined.</p>
<h3 id="Notes"> Notes</h3> <p>The primary purpose of function-try-blocks is to respond to an exception thrown from the member initializer list in a constructor by logging and rethrowing, modifying the exception object and rethrowing, throwing a different exception instead, or terminating the program. They are rarely used with destructors or with regular functions.</p>
<p>Function-try-block does not catch the exceptions thrown by the copy/move constructors and the destructors of the function parameters passed by value: those exceptions are thrown in context of the caller.</p>
