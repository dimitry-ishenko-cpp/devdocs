    <h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading">Argument-dependent lookup</h1>            <p>Argument-dependent lookup, also known as ADL, or Koenig lookup <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>, is the set of rules for looking up the unqualified function names in <a href="operator_other.html" title="cpp/language/operator other">function-call expressions</a>, including implicit function calls to <a href="operators.html" title="cpp/language/operators">overloaded operators</a>. These function names are looked up in the namespaces of their arguments in addition to the scopes and namespaces considered by the usual <a href="lookup.html" title="cpp/language/lookup">unqualified name lookup</a>.</p>
<div class="t-example">
<p>Argument-dependent lookup makes it possible to use operators defined in a different namespace. Example:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
int main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Test\n"; // There is no operator&lt;&lt; in global namespace, but ADL
                           // examines std namespace because the left argument is in
                           // std and finds std::operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp;, const char*)
    operator&lt;&lt;(std::cout, "Test\n"); // Same, using function call notation
 
    // However,
    std::cout &lt;&lt; endl; // Error: 'endl' is not declared in this namespace.
                       // This is not a function call to endl(), so ADL does not apply
 
    endl(std::cout); // OK: this is a function call: ADL examines std namespace
                     // because the argument of endl is in std, and finds std::endl
 
    (endl)(std::cout); // Error: 'endl' is not declared in this namespace.
                       // The sub-expression (endl) is not an unqualified-id

<p>The set of declarations found by ordinary <a href="lookup.html" title="cpp/language/lookup">unqualified lookup</a> and the set of declarations found in all elements of the associated set produced by ADL, are merged, with the following special rules:</p>

<span class="t-li">3)</span> all names except for the functions and function templates are ignored (no collision with variables).</div> <h3 id="Notes"> Notes</h3> <p>Because of argument-dependent lookup, non-member functions and non-member operators defined in the same namespace as a class are considered part of the public interface of that class (if they are found through ADL) <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>.  ADL is the reason behind the established idiom for swapping two objects in generic code:</p>
<div class="cpp source-cpp"><pre data-language="cpp">using std::swap;
swap(obj1, obj2);</pre></div>because calling <code><a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/swap"><span class="kw1603">std::<span class="me2">swap</span></span></a><span class="br0">(</span>obj1, obj2<span class="br0">)</span></code> directly would not consider the user-defined swap() functions that could be defined in the same namespace as the types of obj1 or obj2, and just calling the unqualified <code>swap(obj1, obj2)</code> would call nothing if no user-defined overload was provided. In particular, <code><a href="../algorithm/iter_swap.html" title="cpp/algorithm/iter swap">std::iter_swap</a></code> and all other standard library algorithms use this approach when dealing with <a href="../named_req/swappable.html" title="cpp/named req/Swappable">Swappable</a> types. <p>Name lookup rules make it impractical to declare operators in global or user-defined namespace that operate on types from the std namespace, e.g. a custom <code>operator&gt;&gt;</code> or <code>operator+</code> for <code><a href="../container/vector.html" title="cpp/container/vector">std::vector</a></code> or for <code><a href="../utility/pair.html" title="cpp/utility/pair">std::pair</a></code> (unless the element types of the vector/pair are user-defined types, which would add their namespace to ADL). Such operators would not be looked up from template instantiations, such as the standard library algorithms. See <a href="dependent_name.html" title="cpp/language/dependent name">dependent names</a> for further details.</p>
<p>ADL can find a <a href="friend.html" title="cpp/language/friend">friend function</a> (typically, an overloaded operator) that is defined entirely within a class or class template, even if it was never declared at namespace level.</p>
