<p>The initial value may be provided in the initializer section of a <a href="declarations.html" title="cpp/language/declarations">declarator</a> or a <a href="new.html" title="cpp/language/new">new expression</a>.

<h3 id="Non-local_variables"> Non-local variables</h3> <p>All non-local variables with static <a href="storage_duration.html" title="cpp/language/storage duration">storage duration</a> are initialized as part of program startup, before the execution of the <a href="main_function.html" title="cpp/language/main function">main function</a> begins (unless deferred, see below). All non-local variables with thread-local storage duration are initialized as part of thread launch, sequenced-before the execution of the thread function begins. For both of these classes of variables, initialization occurs in two distinct stages:</p>
<h4 id="Static_initialization"> Static initialization</h4> <p>There are two forms of static initialization:</p>
<div class="t-li1">
<span class="t-li">1)</span> If possible, <a href="constant_initialization.html" title="cpp/language/constant initialization">constant initialization</a> is applied.</div> <div class="t-li1">
<span class="t-li">2)</span> Otherwise, non-local static and thread-local variables are <a href="zero_initialization.html" title="cpp/language/zero initialization">zero-initialized</a>.</div> <p>In practice:</p>
<ul>
<li> Constant initialization is usually applied at compile time. Pre-calculated object representations are stored as part of the program image. If the compiler doesn't do that, it must still guarantee that the initialization happens before any dynamic initialization. </li>
<li> Variables to be zero-initialized are placed in the <code>.bss</code> segment of the program image, which occupies no space on disk and is zeroed out by the OS when loading the program. </li>
</ul> <h4 id="Dynamic_initialization"> Dynamic initialization</h4> <p>After all static initialization is completed, dynamic initialization of non-local variables occurs in the following situations:</p>
<div class="t-li1">
<span class="t-li">1)</span> <i>Unordered dynamic initialization</i>, which applies only to (static/thread-local) class template <a href="static.html" title="cpp/language/static">static data members</a> <span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx14"><span>and <a href="variable_template.html" title="cpp/language/variable template">variable templates</a></span><span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx14">(since C++14)</span></span></span> that aren't <a href="template_specialization.html" title="cpp/language/template specialization">explicitly specialized</a>.

Initialization of such thread-local variables is unsequenced with respect to all other dynamic initialization.</div> <table class="t-rev-begin"> <tr class="t-rev t-since-cxx17">
<td> <span class="t-li">2)</span> <i>Partially-ordered dynamic initialization</i>, which applies to all inline variables that are not an implicitly or explicitly instantiated specialization. If a partially-ordered V is defined before ordered or partially-ordered W in every translation unit, the initialization of V is sequenced before the initialization of W (or happens-before, if the program starts a thread). </td> <td><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx17">(since C++17)</span></td>
</tr> </table> <div class="t-li1">
<span class="t-li">3)</span> <i>Ordered dynamic initialization</i>, which applies to all other non-local variables: within a single translation unit, initialization of these variables is always <a href="eval_order.html" title="cpp/language/eval order">sequenced</a> in exact order their definitions appear in the source code. Initialization of static variables in different translation units is indeterminately sequenced. Initialization of thread-local variables in different translation units is unsequenced.</div> <p>If the initialization of a non-local variable with static or thread storage duration exits via an exception, <code><a href="../error/terminate.html" title="cpp/error/terminate">std::terminate</a></code> is called.</p>
<h4 id="Early_dynamic_initialization"> Early dynamic initialization</h4> <p>The compilers are allowed to initialize dynamically-initialized variables as part of static initialization (essentially, at compile time), if the following conditions are both true:</p>
<div class="t-li1">
<span class="t-li">1)</span> the dynamic version of the initialization does not change the value of any other object of namespace scope prior to its initialization</div> <div class="t-li1">
<span class="t-li">2)</span> the static version of the initialization produces the same value in the initialized variable as would be produced by the dynamic initialization if all variables not required to be initialized statically were initialized dynamically.</div> <p>Because of the rule above, if initialization of some object <code>o1</code> refers to a namespace-scope object <code>o2</code>, which potentially requires dynamic initialization, but is defined later in the same translation unit, it is unspecified whether the value of <code>o2</code> used will be the value of the fully initialized <code>o2</code> (because the compiler promoted initialization of <code>o2</code> to compile time) or will be the value of <code>o2</code> merely zero-initialized.</p>

                  // dynamically initialized to 1.0 if d1 is statically initialized, or
                  // statically initialized to 0.0 (because that would be its value
                  // if both variables were dynamically initialized)
 
double d1 = fd(); // may be initialized statically or dynamically to 1.0</pre></div> <h4 id="Deferred_dynamic_initialization"> Deferred dynamic initialization</h4> <p>It is implementation-defined whether dynamic initialization happens-before the first statement of the main function (for statics) or the initial function of the thread (for thread-locals), or deferred to happen after.</p>
<p>If the initialization <span class="t-rev-inl t-since-cxx17"><span>of a non-inline variable</span><span><span class="t-mark-rev t-since-cxx17">(since C++17)</span></span></span> is deferred to happen after the first statement of main/thread function, it happens before the first <a href="definition.html#ODR-use" title="cpp/language/definition">odr-use</a> of any variable with static/thread storage duration defined in the same translation unit as the variable to be initialized. If no variable or function is odr-used from a given translation unit, the non-local variables defined in that translation unit may never be initialized (this models the behavior of an on-demand dynamic library). However, as long as anything from a translation unit is odr-used, all non-local variables whose initialization or destruction has side effects will be initialized even if they are not used in the program.</p>
