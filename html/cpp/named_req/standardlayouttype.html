</h1>            <p>Specifies that a type is a standard layout type. Standard layout types are useful for communicating with code written in other programming languages.</p>
<p>Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.</p>
<h3 id="Requirements"> Requirements</h3> <p>The following types are collectively called <i>standard-layout types</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="scalartype.html" title="cpp/named req/ScalarType">scalar types</a> </li>
<li> <a href="../language/classes.html#Standard-layout_class" title="cpp/language/classes">standard-layout class types</a> </li>
<li> arrays of such types </li>
<li> cv-qualified versions of these types </li>
</ul> <h3 id="Properties"> Properties</h3> <p>See <a href="../language/data_members.html#Standard-layout" title="cpp/language/data members">Standard-layout</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Defect_reports"> Defect reports</h3> <p>The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.</p>
