</h1>            <p>The <strong class="selflink">TimedMutex</strong> requirements extend the <a href="timedlockable.html" title="cpp/named req/TimedLockable">TimedLockable</a> requirements to include inter-thread synchronization.</p>
<h3 id="Requirements"> Requirements</h3> <ul>
<li> <a href="timedlockable.html" title="cpp/named req/TimedLockable">TimedLockable</a> </li>
<li> <a href="mutex.html" title="cpp/named req/Mutex">Mutex</a> </li>
</ul> <p>Additionally, for an object <code>m</code> of TimedMutex type:</p>
<ul>
<li> The expression <code>m.try_lock_for(duration)</code> has the following properties </li>
<ul>
<li> Behaves as an atomic operation. </li>
<li> Attempts to obtain exclusive ownership of the mutex within the duration specified by <code>duration</code>. If <code>duration</code> is less or equal <code>duration.zero()</code>, attempts to obtain the ownership without blocking (as if by <code>try_lock()</code>). Otherwise, this function blocks until the mutex is acquired or until the time specified by <code>duration</code> passes. It returns within <code>duration</code> only if it succeeds, but it is allowed to fail to acquire the mutex even if at some point in time during <code>duration</code> it was not owned by another thread. In any case, it returns <code>true</code> if the mutex was acquired and <code>false</code> otherwise. </li>
<li> If <code>try_lock_for(duration)</code> succeeds, prior <code>unlock()</code> operations on the same object <i>synchronize-with</i> this operation (equivalent to release-acquire <code><a href="../atomic/memory_order.html" title="cpp/atomic/memory order">std::memory_order</a></code>). </li>
<li> The behavior is undefined if the calling thread already owns the mutex (except if m is <code><a href="../thread/recursive_timed_mutex.html" title="cpp/thread/recursive timed mutex">std::recursive_timed_mutex</a></code>). </li>
<li> An exception may be thrown by clock, time point, or duration during the execution (clocks, time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw). </li>
</ul>
<li> The expression <code>m.try_lock_until(time_point)</code> has the following properties </li>
<ul>
<li> Behaves as an atomic operation. </li>
<li> Attempts to obtain exclusive ownership of the mutex within the time left until <code>time_point</code>. If <code>time_point</code> already passed, attempts to obtain the ownership without blocking (as if by <code>try_lock()</code>). Otherwise, this function blocks until the mutex is acquired or until the time specified by <code>time_point</code> passes. It returns before <code>time_point</code> only if it succeeds, but it is allowed to fail to acquire the mutex even if at some point in time before <code>time_point</code> it was not owned by another thread. In any case, it returns <code>true</code> if the mutex was acquired and <code>false</code> otherwise. </li>
<li> If <code>try_lock_until(time_point)</code> succeeds, prior <code>unlock()</code> operations on the same object <i>synchronize-with</i> this operation (equivalent to release-acquire <code><a href="../atomic/memory_order.html" title="cpp/atomic/memory order">std::memory_order</a></code>). </li>
<li> The behavior is undefined if the calling thread already owns the mutex (except if m is <code><a href="../thread/recursive_timed_mutex.html" title="cpp/thread/recursive timed mutex">std::recursive_timed_mutex</a></code>). </li>
<li> An exception may be thrown by clock, time point, or duration during the execution (clocks, time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw). </li>
