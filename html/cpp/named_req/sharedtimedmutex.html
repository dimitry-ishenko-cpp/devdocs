</h1>            <p>The <strong class="selflink">SharedTimedMutex</strong> requirements extend the <a href="timedmutex.html" title="cpp/named req/TimedMutex">TimedMutex</a> requirements to include shared lock ownership mode.</p>
<h3 id="Requirements"> Requirements</h3> <ul>
<li> <a href="timedmutex.html" title="cpp/named req/TimedMutex">TimedMutex</a> </li>
<li> <a href="sharedmutex.html" title="cpp/named req/SharedMutex">SharedMutex</a> </li>
</ul> <p>Additionally, an object <code>m</code> of SharedTimedMutex type supports timed shared operations:</p>
<ul>
<li> The expression <code>m.try_lock_shared_for(duration)</code> has the following properties </li>
<ul>
<li> Behaves as an atomic operation. </li>
<li> Attempts to obtain shared ownership of the mutex within the duration specified by <code>duration</code>. If <code>duration</code> is less or equal <code>duration.zero()</code>, attempts to obtain the ownership without waiting (as if by <code>try_lock()</code>). Otherwise, this function blocks until the mutex is acquired or until the time specified by <code>duration</code> passes. It returns within <code>duration</code> only if it succeeds, but it allowed to fail to acquire the mutex even if at some point in time during <code>duration</code> it was not owned by another thread. In any case, it returns <code>true</code> if the mutex was acquired and <code>false</code> otherwise. </li>
<li> If <code>try_lock_shared_for(duration)</code> succeeds, prior <code>unlock()</code> operations on the same object <i>synchronize-with</i> this operation (equivalent to release-acquire <code><a href="../atomic/memory_order.html" title="cpp/atomic/memory order">std::memory_order</a></code>). </li>
<li> The behavior is undefined if the calling thread already owns the mutex in any mode. </li>
<li> An exception may be thrown by clock, time point, or duration during the execution (clocks, time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw). </li>
<li> If an exception is thrown, the shared lock is not acquired. </li>
</ul>
<li> The expression <code>m.try_lock_shared_until(time_point)</code> has the following properties </li>
<ul>
<li> Behaves as an atomic operation. </li>
<li> Attempts to obtain shared ownership of the mutex within the time left until <code>time_point</code>. If <code>time_point</code> already passed, attempts to obtain the ownership without locking (as if by <code>try_lock()</code>). Otherwise, this function blocks until the mutex is acquired or until the time specified by <code>time_point</code> passes. It returns before <code>time_point</code> only if it succeeds, but it allowed to fail to acquire the mutex even if at some point in time before <code>time_point</code> it was not owned by another thread. In any case, it returns <code>true</code> if the mutex was acquired and <code>false</code> otherwise. </li>
<li> If <code>try_lock_shared_until(time_point)</code> succeeds, prior <code>unlock()</code> operations on the same object <i>synchronize-with</i> this operation (equivalent to release-acquire <code><a href="../atomic/memory_order.html" title="cpp/atomic/memory order">std::memory_order</a></code>). </li>
<li> The behavior is undefined if the calling thread already owns the mutex in any mode. </li>
<li> An exception may be thrown by clock, time point, or duration during the execution (clocks, time points, and durations provided by the standard library never throw). </li>
