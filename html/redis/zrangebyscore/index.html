<h1 class="command-name">ZRANGEBYSCORE</h1>
<pre>ZRANGEBYSCORE (deprecated)</pre> <div class="border-l-8 pl-4"> <p>As of Redis version 6.2.0, this command is regarded as deprecated.</p> <p>It can be replaced by <a href="../zrange.html"><code>ZRANGE</code></a> with the <code>BYSCORE</code> argument when migrating or writing new code.</p> </div> <div class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Syntax</div> <pre class="command-syntax">ZRANGEBYSCORE key min max [WITHSCORES] [LIMITÂ offset count]</pre> <dl class="grid grid-cols-[auto,1fr] gap-x-2 mb-12"> <dt class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Available since:</dt> <dd>1.0.5</dd> <dt class="font-semibold text-slate-900">Time complexity:</dt> <dd>O(log(N)+M) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set and M the number of elements being returned. If M is constant (e.g. always asking for the first 10 elements with LIMIT), you can consider it O(log(N)).</dd> <dt class="font-semibold text-slate-900">ACL categories:</dt> <dd> <code>@read</code><span class="mr-1 last:hidden">,</span> <code>@sortedset</code><span class="mr-1 last:hidden">,</span> <code>@slow</code><span class="mr-1 last:hidden">,</span> </dd> </dl> <p>Returns all the elements in the sorted set at <code>key</code> with a score between <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> (including elements with score equal to <code>min</code> or <code>max</code>). The elements are considered to be ordered from low to high scores.</p> <p>The elements having the same score are returned in lexicographical order (this follows from a property of the sorted set implementation in Redis and does not involve further computation).</p> <p>The optional <code>LIMIT</code> argument can be used to only get a range of the matching elements (similar to <em>SELECT LIMIT offset, count</em> in SQL). A negative <code>count</code> returns all elements from the <code>offset</code>. Keep in mind that if <code>offset</code> is large, the sorted set needs to be traversed for <code>offset</code> elements before getting to the elements to return, which can add up to O(N) time complexity.</p> <p>The optional <code>WITHSCORES</code> argument makes the command return both the element and its score, instead of the element alone. This option is available since Redis 2.0.</p> <h2 id="exclusive-intervals-and-infinity">Exclusive intervals and infinity</h2> <p><code>min</code> and <code>max</code> can be <code>-inf</code> and <code>+inf</code>, so that you are not required to know the highest or lowest score in the sorted set to get all elements from or up to a certain score.</p> <p>By default, the interval specified by <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> is closed (inclusive). It is possible to specify an open interval (exclusive) by prefixing the score with the character <code>(</code>. For example:</p> <pre tabindex="0">ZRANGEBYSCORE zset (1 5
</pre>
<p>Will return all elements with <code>1 &lt; score &lt;= 5</code> while:</p> <pre tabindex="0">ZRANGEBYSCORE zset (5 (10
</pre>
<p>Will return all the elements with <code>5 &lt; score &lt; 10</code> (5 and 10 excluded).</p> <h2 id="return">Return</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays">Array reply</a>: list of elements in the specified score range (optionally with their scores).</p> <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>  <pre class="redis-cli overflow-y-auto max-h-80">
ZADD myzset 1 "one"
ZADD myzset 2 "two"

</pre> <h2 id="pattern-weighted-random-selection-of-an-element">Pattern: weighted random selection of an element</h2> <p>Normally <code>ZRANGEBYSCORE</code> is simply used in order to get range of items where the score is the indexed integer key, however it is possible to do less obvious things with the command.</p> <p>For example a common problem when implementing Markov chains and other algorithms is to select an element at random from a set, but different elements may have different weights that change how likely it is they are picked.</p> <p>This is how we use this command in order to mount such an algorithm:</p> <p>Imagine you have elements A, B and C with weights 1, 2 and 3. You compute the sum of the weights, which is 1+2+3 = 6</p> <p>At this point you add all the elements into a sorted set using this algorithm:</p> <pre tabindex="0">SUM = ELEMENTS.TOTAL_WEIGHT // 6 in this case.
SCORE = 0
FOREACH ELE in ELEMENTS
    SCORE += ELE.weight / SUM
    ZADD KEY SCORE ELE
END
</pre>
<p>This means that you set:</p> <pre tabindex="0">A to score 0.16
B to score .5
C to score 1
</pre>
<p>Since this involves approximations, in order to avoid C is set to, like, 0.998 instead of 1, we just modify the above algorithm to make sure the last score is 1 (left as an exercise for the reader...).</p> <p>At this point, each time you want to get a weighted random element, just compute a random number between 0 and 1 (which is like calling <code>rand()</code> in most languages), so you can just do:</p> <pre>RANDOM_ELE = ZRANGEBYSCORE key RAND() +inf LIMIT 0 1
