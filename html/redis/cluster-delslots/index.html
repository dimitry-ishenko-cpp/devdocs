Note that the existence of unbound hash slots occurs naturally when a node has not been configured to handle them (something that can be done with the <a href="../cluster-addslots.html"><code>CLUSTER ADDSLOTS</code></a> command) and if it has not received any information about who owns those hash slots (something that it can learn from heartbeat or update messages).</p> <p>If a node with unbound hash slots receives a heartbeat packet from another node that claims to be the owner of some of those hash slots, the association is established instantly. Moreover, if a heartbeat or update message is received with a configuration epoch greater than the node's own, the association is re-established.</p> <p>However, note that:</p> <ol> <li>The command only works if all the specified slots are already associated with some node.</li> <li>The command fails if the same slot is specified multiple times.</li> <li>As a side effect of the command execution, the node may go into <em>down</em> state because not all hash slots are covered.</li> </ol> <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p>The following command removes the association for slots 5000 and 5001 from the node receiving the command:</p> <pre>&gt; CLUSTER DELSLOTS 5000 5001
OK
</pre> <h2 id="usage-in-redis-cluster">Usage in Redis Cluster</h2> <p>This command only works in cluster mode and may be useful for debugging and in order to manually orchestrate a cluster configuration when a new cluster is created. It is currently not used by <code>redis-cli</code>, and mainly exists for API completeness.</p> <h2 id="return">Return</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-simple-strings">Simple string reply</a>: <code>OK</code> if the command was successful.
