Longer strings are considered greater than shorter strings if the common part is identical.</p> <p>The optional <code>LIMIT</code> argument can be used to only get a range of the matching elements (similar to <em>SELECT LIMIT offset, count</em> in SQL). A negative <code>count</code> returns all elements from the <code>offset</code>. Keep in mind that if <code>offset</code> is large, the sorted set needs to be traversed for <code>offset</code> elements before getting to the elements to return, which can add up to O(N) time complexity.</p> <h2 id="how-to-specify-intervals">How to specify intervals</h2> <p>Valid <em>start</em> and <em>stop</em> must start with <code>(</code> or <code>[</code>, in order to specify if the range item is respectively exclusive or inclusive. The special values of <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> for <em>start</em> and <em>stop</em> have the special meaning or positively infinite and negatively infinite strings, so for instance the command <strong>ZRANGEBYLEX myzset - +</strong> is guaranteed to return all the elements in the sorted set, if all the elements have the same score.</p> <h2 id="details-on-strings-comparison">Details on strings comparison</h2> <p>Strings are compared as binary array of bytes. Because of how the ASCII character set is specified, this means that usually this also have the effect of comparing normal ASCII characters in an obvious dictionary way. However this is not true if non plain ASCII strings are used (for example utf8 strings).</p> <p>However the user can apply a transformation to the encoded string so that the first part of the element inserted in the sorted set will compare as the user requires for the specific application. For example if I want to add strings that will be compared in a case-insensitive way, but I still want to retrieve the real case when querying, I can add strings in the following way:</p> <pre>ZADD autocomplete 0 foo:Foo 0 bar:BAR 0 zap:zap
</pre> <p>Because of the first <em>normalized</em> part in every element (before the colon character), we are forcing a given comparison, however after the range is queries using <code>ZRANGEBYLEX</code> the application can display to the user the second part of the string, after the colon.</p> <p>The binary nature of the comparison allows to use sorted sets as a general purpose index, for example the first part of the element can be a 64 bit big endian number: since big endian numbers have the most significant bytes in the initial positions, the binary comparison will match the numerical comparison of the numbers. This can be used in order to implement range queries on 64 bit values. As in the example below, after the first 8 bytes we can store the value of the element we are actually indexing.</p> <h2 id="return">Return</h2> <p><a href="https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec#resp-arrays">Array reply</a>: list of elements in the specified score range.</p> <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>  <pre class="redis-cli overflow-y-auto max-h-80">
