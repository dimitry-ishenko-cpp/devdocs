</h2> <p><strong>Please note that:</strong></p> <ol> <li>The following pattern is discouraged in favor of <a href="https://redis.io/topics/distlock">the Redlock algorithm</a> which is only a bit more complex to implement, but offers better guarantees and is fault tolerant.</li> <li>We document the old pattern anyway because certain existing implementations link to this page as a reference. Moreover it is an interesting example of how Redis commands can be used in order to mount programming primitives.</li> <li>Anyway even assuming a single-instance locking primitive, starting with 2.6.12 it is possible to create a much simpler locking primitive, equivalent to the one discussed here, using the <a href="../set.html"><code>SET</code></a> command to acquire the lock, and a simple Lua script to release the lock. The pattern is documented in the <a href="../set.html"><code>SET</code></a> command page.</li> </ol> <p>That said, <code>SETNX</code> can be used, and was historically used, as a locking primitive. For example, to acquire the lock of the key <code>foo</code>, the client could try the following:</p> <pre tabindex="0">SETNX lock.foo &lt;current Unix time + lock timeout + 1&gt;
</pre>
<p>If <code>SETNX</code> returns <code>1</code> the client acquired the lock, setting the <code>lock.foo</code> key to the Unix time at which the lock should no longer be considered valid. The client will later use <code>DEL lock.foo</code> in order to release the lock.</p> <p>If <code>SETNX</code> returns <code>0</code> the key is already locked by some other client. We can either return to the caller if it's a non blocking lock, or enter a loop retrying to hold the lock until we succeed or some kind of timeout expires.</p> <h3 id="handling-deadlocks">Handling deadlocks</h3> <p>In the above locking algorithm there is a problem: what happens if a client fails, crashes, or is otherwise not able to release the lock? It's possible to detect this condition because the lock key contains a UNIX timestamp. If such a timestamp is equal to the current Unix time the lock is no longer valid.</p> <p>When this happens we can't just call <a href="../del.html"><code>DEL</code></a> against the key to remove the lock and then try to issue a <code>SETNX</code>, as there is a race condition here, when multiple clients detected an expired lock and are trying to release it.</p> <ul> <li>C1 and C2 read <code>lock.foo</code> to check the timestamp, because they both received <code>0</code> after executing <code>SETNX</code>, as the lock is still held by C3 that crashed after holding the lock.</li> <li>C1 sends <code>DEL lock.foo</code>
</li> <li>C1 sends <code>SETNX lock.foo</code> and it succeeds</li> <li>C2 sends <code>DEL lock.foo</code>
</li> <li>C2 sends <code>SETNX lock.foo</code> and it succeeds</li> <li>
<strong>ERROR</strong>: both C1 and C2 acquired the lock because of the race condition.</li> </ul> <p>Fortunately, it's possible to avoid this issue using the following algorithm. Let's see how C4, our sane client, uses the good algorithm:</p> <ul> <li> <p>C4 sends <code>SETNX lock.foo</code> in order to acquire the lock</p> </li> <li> <p>The crashed client C3 still holds it, so Redis will reply with <code>0</code> to C4.</p> </li> <li> <p>C4 sends <code>GET lock.foo</code> to check if the lock expired. If it is not, it will sleep for some time and retry from the start.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instead, if the lock is expired because the Unix time at <code>lock.foo</code> is older than the current Unix time, C4 tries to perform:</p> <pre tabindex="0">GETSET lock.foo &lt;current Unix timestamp + lock timeout + 1&gt;
</pre>
</li> <li> <p>Because of the <a href="../getset.html"><code>GETSET</code></a> semantic, C4 can check if the old value stored at <code>key</code> is still an expired timestamp. If it is, the lock was acquired.</p> </li> <li> <p>If another client, for instance C5, was faster than C4 and acquired the lock with the <a href="../getset.html"><code>GETSET</code></a> operation, the C4 <a href="../getset.html"><code>GETSET</code></a> operation will return a non expired timestamp. C4 will simply restart from the first step. Note that even if C4 set the key a bit a few seconds in the future this is not a problem.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In order to make this locking algorithm more robust, a client holding a lock should always check the timeout didn't expire before unlocking the key with <a href="../del.html"><code>DEL</code></a> because client failures can be complex, not just crashing but also blocking a lot of time against some operations and trying to issue <a href="../del.html"><code>DEL</code></a> after a lot of time (when the LOCK is already held by another client).</p><div class="_attribution">
