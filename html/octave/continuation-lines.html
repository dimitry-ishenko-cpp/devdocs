<div class="section" id="Continuation-Lines">   <h1 class="section">10.10 Continuation Lines</h1>   <p>In the Octave language, most statements end with a newline character and you must tell Octave to ignore the newline character in order to continue a statement from one line to the next. Lines that end with the characters <code>...</code> are joined with the following line before they are divided into tokens by Octave’s parser. For example, the lines </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">x = long_variable_name ...
    + longer_variable_name ...
    - 42</pre> <p>form a single statement. </p> <p>Any text between the continuation marker and the newline character is ignored. For example, the statement </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">x = long_variable_name ...    # comment one
    + longer_variable_name ...comment two
    - 42                      # last comment</pre> <p>is equivalent to the one shown above. </p>  <p>Inside double-quoted string constants, the character <code>\</code> has to be used as continuation marker. The <code>\</code> must appear at the end of the line just before the newline character: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">s = "This text starts in the first line \
and is continued in the second line."</pre> <p>Input that occurs inside parentheses can be continued to the next line without having to use a continuation marker. For example, it is possible to write statements like </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">if (fine_dining_destination == on_a_boat
    || fine_dining_destination == on_a_train)
  seuss (i, will, not, eat, them, sam, i, am, i,
         will, not, eat, green, eggs, and, ham);
endif</pre> <p>without having to add to the clutter with continuation markers. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
