<div class="subsubsection" id="Sections">   <h1 class="subsubsection">11.11.2.3 Sections</h1> <p>A section is started by typing ‘<samp>##</samp>’ or ‘<samp>%%</samp>’ at the beginning of a new line. A section title can be provided by writing it, separated by a space, in the first line after ‘<samp>##</samp>’ or ‘<samp>%%</samp>’. Without a section title, the section is interpreted as a continuation of the previous section. For <small>MATLAB</small> compatibility ‘<samp>%%%</samp>’ is treated the same way as ‘<samp>%%</samp>’. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">some_code ();
