A section title can be provided by writing it, separated by a space, in the first line after ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ or ‘<samp class="samp">%%</samp>’. Without a section title, the section is interpreted as a continuation of the previous section. For <small class="sc">MATLAB</small> compatibility ‘<samp class="samp">%%%</samp>’ is treated the same way as ‘<samp class="samp">%%</samp>’. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">some_code ();
