<div class="section" id="The-continue-Statement">   <h1 class="section">10.7 The continue Statement</h1>  <p>The <code>continue</code> statement, like <code>break</code>, is used only inside <code>while</code>, <code>do-until</code>, or <code>for</code> loops. It skips over the rest of the loop body, causing the next cycle around the loop to begin immediately. Contrast this with <code>break</code>, which jumps out of the loop altogether. Here is an example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab"># print elements of a vector of random
# integers that are even.

# first, create a row vector of 10 random
# integers with values between 0 and 100:

vec = round (rand (1, 10) * 100);

# print what we're interested in:

for x = vec
  if (rem (x, 2) != 0)
    continue;
  endif
  printf ("%d\n", x);
endfor</pre> <p>If one of the elements of <var>vec</var> is an odd number, this example skips the print statement for that element, and continues back to the first statement in the loop. </p> <p>This is not a practical example of the <code>continue</code> statement, but it should give you a clear understanding of how it works. Normally, one would probably write the loop like this: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">for x = vec
  if (rem (x, 2) == 0)
    printf ("%d\n", x);
  endif
endfor</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
