<div class="section" id="Handling-Errors">   <h1 class="section">12.1 Handling Errors</h1> <p>An error is something that occurs when a program is in a state where it doesn’t make sense to continue. An example is when a function is called with too few input arguments. In this situation the function should abort with an error message informing the user of the lacking input arguments. </p> <p>Since an error can occur during the evaluation of a program, it is very convenient to be able to detect that an error occurred, so that the error can be fixed. This is possible with the <code>try</code> statement described in <a href="the-try-statement.html">The try Statement</a>. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="raising-errors.html" accesskey="1">Raising Errors</a></li> <li><a href="catching-errors.html" accesskey="2">Catching Errors</a></li> <li><a href="recovering-from-errors.html" accesskey="3">Recovering From Errors</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
