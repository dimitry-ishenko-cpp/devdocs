An example is when a function is called with too few input arguments. In this situation the function should abort with an error message informing the user of the lacking input arguments. </p> <p>Since an error can occur during the evaluation of a program, it is very convenient to be able to detect that an error occurred, so that the error can be fixed. This is possible with the <code class="code">try</code> statement described in <a class="ref" href="the-try-statement.html">The try Statement</a>. </p> <ul class="mini-toc"> <li><a href="raising-errors.html" accesskey="1">Raising Errors</a></li> <li><a href="catching-errors.html" accesskey="2">Catching Errors</a></li> <li><a href="recovering-from-errors.html" accesskey="3">Recovering From Errors</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
