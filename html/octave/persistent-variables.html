The difference between persistent variables and global variables is that persistent variables are local in scope to a particular function and are not visible elsewhere. </p> <p>The following example uses a persistent variable to create a function that prints the number of times it has been called. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function count_calls ()
  persistent calls = 0;
  printf ("'count_calls' has been called %d times\n",
          ++calls);

-| 'count_calls' has been called 1 times
-| 'count_calls' has been called 2 times
-| 'count_calls' has been called 3 times</pre> <p>As the example shows, a variable may be declared persistent using a <code class="code">persistent</code> declaration statement. The following statements are all persistent declarations. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">persistent a
persistent a b
persistent c = 2
persistent d = 3 e f = 5</pre> <p>The behavior of persistent variables is equivalent to the behavior of static variables in C. </p> <p>One restriction for persistent variables is, that neither input nor output arguments of a function can be persistent: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function y = foo ()
  persistent y = 0;  # Not allowed!
endfunction

foo ()
-| error: can't make function parameter y persistent</pre> <p>Like global variables, a persistent variable may only be initialized once. For example, after executing the following code </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">persistent pvar = 1
persistent pvar = 2</pre> <p>the value of the persistent variable <code class="code">pvar</code> is 1, not 2. </p> <p>If a persistent variable is declared but not initialized to a specific value, it will contain an empty matrix. So, it is also possible to initialize a persistent variable by checking whether it is empty, as the following example illustrates. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function count_calls ()
  persistent calls;
  if (isempty (calls))
    calls = 0;
  endif
  printf ("'count_calls' has been called %d times\n",
          ++calls);
endfunction</pre> <p>This implementation behaves in exactly the same way as the previous implementation of <code class="code">count_calls</code>. </p> <p>The value of a persistent variable is kept in memory until it is explicitly cleared. Assuming that the implementation of <code class="code">count_calls</code> is saved on disk, we get the following behavior. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">for i = 1:2
  count_calls ();
endfor
-| 'count_calls' has been called 1 times
-| 'count_calls' has been called 2 times

clear
for i = 1:2
  count_calls ();
endfor
-| 'count_calls' has been called 3 times
-| 'count_calls' has been called 4 times

clear all
for i = 1:2
  count_calls ();
endfor
-| 'count_calls' has been called 1 times
-| 'count_calls' has been called 2 times

clear count_calls
for i = 1:2
  count_calls ();
endfor
-| 'count_calls' has been called 1 times
-| 'count_calls' has been called 2 times</pre> <p>That is, the persistent variable is only removed from memory when the function containing the variable is removed. Note that if the function definition is typed directly into the Octave prompt, the persistent variable will be cleared by a simple <code class="code">clear</code> command as the entire function definition will be removed from memory. If you do not want a persistent variable to be removed from memory even if the function is cleared, you should use the <code class="code">mlock</code> function (see <a class="pxref" href="function-locking.html">Function Locking</a>). </p> </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Next: <a href="status-of-variables.html">Status of Variables</a>, Previous: <a href="global-variables.html">Global Variables</a>, Up: <a href="variables.html">Variables</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="concept-index.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
