<div class="subsection" id="Exception-and-Error-Handling-in-Oct_002dFiles">   <h1 class="subsection">A.1.12 Exception and Error Handling in Oct-Files</h1> <p>Another important feature of Octave is its ability to react to the user typing <tt class="key">Control-C</tt> during extended calculations. This ability is based on the C++ exception handler, where memory allocated by the C++ new/delete methods is automatically released when the exception is treated. When writing an oct-file which may run for a long time the programmer must periodically use the macro <code><span class="nolinebreak">OCTAVE_QUIT</span></code>, in order to allow Octave to check and possibly respond to a user typing <tt class="key">Control-C</tt>. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">for (octave_idx_type i = 0; i &lt; a.nelem (); i++)
  {
    OCTAVE_QUIT;
    b.elem (i) = 2. * a.elem (i);
  }</pre> <p>The presence of the <code><span class="nolinebreak">OCTAVE_QUIT</span></code> macro in the inner loop allows Octave to detect and acknowledge a <tt class="key">Control-C</tt> key sequence. Without this macro, the user must either wait for the oct-file function to return before the interrupt is processed, or the user must press <tt class="key">Control-C</tt> three times which will force Octave to exit completely. </p> <p>The <code><span class="nolinebreak">OCTAVE_QUIT</span></code> macro does impose a very small performance penalty; For loops that are known to be small it may not make sense to include <code><span class="nolinebreak">OCTAVE_QUIT</span></code>. </p> <p>When creating an oct-file that uses an external library, the function might spend a significant portion of its time in the external library. It is not generally possible to use the <code><span class="nolinebreak">OCTAVE_QUIT</span></code> macro in this case. The alternative code in this case is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">BEGIN_INTERRUPT_IMMEDIATELY_IN_FOREIGN_CODE;
…  some code that calls a "foreign" function …
END_INTERRUPT_IMMEDIATELY_IN_FOREIGN_CODE;</pre> <p>The disadvantage of this is that if the foreign code allocates any memory internally, then this memory might be lost during an interrupt, without being deallocated. Therefore, ideally Octave itself should allocate any memory that is needed by the foreign code, with either the <code>fortran_vec</code> method or the <code><span class="nolinebreak">OCTAVE_LOCAL_BUFFER</span></code> macro. </p> <p>The Octave <code>unwind_protect</code> mechanism (<a href="the-unwind_005fprotect-statement.html">The unwind_protect Statement</a>) can also be used in oct-files. In conjunction with the exception handling of Octave, it ensures that certain recovery code is always run even if an exception occurs. An example of the use of this mechanism is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">#include &lt;octave/oct.h&gt;
#include &lt;octave/unwind-prot.h&gt;

void
my_err_handler (const char *fmt, ...)
{
  // Do nothing!!
}

void
my_err_with_id_handler (const char *id, const char *fmt, ...)
{
  // Do nothing!!
}

DEFUN_DLD (unwinddemo, args, nargout, "Unwind Demo")
{
  if (args.length () &lt; 2)
    print_usage ();

  NDArray a = args(0).array_value ();
  NDArray b = args(1).array_value ();

  // Create unwind_action objects.  At the end of the enclosing scope,
  // destructors for these objects will call the given functions with
  // the specified arguments.

  octave::unwind_action restore_warning_handler
    (set_liboctave_warning_handler, current_liboctave_warning_handler);

  octave::unwind_action restore_warning_with_id_handler
    (set_liboctave_warning_with_id_handler,
     current_liboctave_warning_with_id_handler);

  set_liboctave_warning_handler (my_err_handler);
  set_liboctave_warning_with_id_handler (my_err_with_id_handler);

  return octave_value (quotient (a, b));
}</pre> <p>As can be seen in the example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">unwinddemo (1, 0)
⇒ Inf
1 / 0
⇒ warning: division by zero
   Inf</pre> <p>The warning for division by zero (and in fact all warnings) are disabled in the <code>unwinddemo</code> function. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
