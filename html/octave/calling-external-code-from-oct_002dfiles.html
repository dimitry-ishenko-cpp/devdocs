<div class="subsection" id="Calling-External-Code-from-Oct_002dFiles">   <h1 class="subsection">A.1.9 Calling External Code from Oct-Files</h1> <p>Linking external C code to Octave is relatively simple, as the C functions can easily be called directly from C++. One possible issue is that the declarations of the external C functions may need to be explicitly defined as C functions to the compiler. If the declarations of the external C functions are in the header <samp>foo.h</samp>, then the tactic to ensure that the C++ compiler treats these declarations as C code is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
{
#endif
#include "foo.h"
#ifdef __cplusplus
}  /* end extern "C" */
#endif</pre> <p>Calling Fortran code, however, can pose more difficulties. This is due to differences in the manner in which compilers treat the linking of Fortran code with C or C++ code. Octave supplies several macros that allow consistent behavior across a number of compilers. </p> <p>The underlying Fortran code should use the <code>XSTOPX</code> function to replace the Fortran <code>STOP</code> function. <code>XSTOPX</code> uses the Octave exception handler to treat failing cases in the Fortran code explicitly. Note that Octave supplies its own replacement <small>BLAS</small> <code>XERBLA</code> function, which uses <code>XSTOPX</code>. </p> <p>If the code calls <code>XSTOPX</code>, then the <code><span class="nolinebreak">F77_XFCN</span></code> macro should be used to call the underlying Fortran function. The Fortran exception state can then be checked with the global variable <code>f77_exception_encountered</code>. If <code>XSTOPX</code> will not be called, then the <code><span class="nolinebreak">F77_FCN</span></code> macro should be used instead to call the Fortran code. </p> <p>There is no great harm in using <code><span class="nolinebreak">F77_XFCN</span></code> in all cases, except that for Fortran code that is short running and executes a large number of times, there is potentially an overhead in doing so. However, if <code><span class="nolinebreak">F77_FCN</span></code> is used with code that calls <code>XSTOP</code>, Octave can generate a segmentation fault. </p> <p>An example of the inclusion of a Fortran function in an oct-file is given in the following example, where the C++ wrapper is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">#include &lt;octave/oct.h&gt;
#include &lt;octave/f77-fcn.h&gt;

extern "C"
{
  F77_RET_T
  F77_FUNC (fortransub, FORTSUB)
    (const F77_INT&amp;, F77_DBLE*, F77_CHAR_ARG_DECL F77_CHAR_ARG_LEN_DECL);
}

    print_usage ();

  NDArray a = args(0).array_value ();

  double *av = a.fortran_vec ();
  octave_idx_type na = a.numel ();

  OCTAVE_LOCAL_BUFFER (char, ctmp, 128);

  F77_XFCN (fortransub, FORTSUB,
            (na, av, ctmp F77_CHAR_ARG_LEN (128)));

  return ovl (a, std::string (ctmp));
}</pre> <p>and the Fortran function is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">subroutine fortransub (n, a, s)
      implicit none
      character*(*) s
      real*8 a(*)
      integer*4 i, n, ioerr
      do i = 1, n
        if (a(i) .eq. 0d0) then
          call xstopx ('fortransub: divide by zero')
        else
          a(i) = 1d0 / a(i)
        endif
      enddo
      write (unit = s, fmt = '(a,i3,a,a)', iostat = ioerr)
     $       'There are ', n,
     $       ' values in the input vector', char(0)
      if (ioerr .ne. 0) then
        call xstopx ('fortransub: error writing string')
      endif
      return
      end</pre> <p>This example demonstrates most of the features needed to link to an external Fortran function, including passing arrays and strings, as well as exception handling. Both the Fortran and C++ files need to be compiled in order for the example to work. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">mkoctfile fortrandemo.cc fortransub.f

⇒
  b = 1.00000   0.50000   0.33333
  s = There are   3 values in the input vector
[b, s] = fortrandemo (0:3)
