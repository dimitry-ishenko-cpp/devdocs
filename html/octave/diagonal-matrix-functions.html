<div class="subsection" id="Diagonal-Matrix-Functions">   <h1 class="subsection">21.3.1 Diagonal Matrix Functions</h1> <p><em>inv</em> and <em>pinv</em> can be applied to a diagonal matrix, yielding again a diagonal matrix. <em>det</em> will use an efficient straightforward calculation when given a diagonal matrix, as well as <em>cond</em>. The following mapper functions can be applied to a diagonal matrix without converting it to a full one: <em>abs</em>, <em>real</em>, <em>imag</em>, <em>conj</em>, <em>sqrt</em>. A diagonal matrix can also be returned from the <em>balance</em> and <em>svd</em> functions. The <em>sparse</em> function will convert a diagonal matrix efficiently to a sparse matrix. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
