The following mapper functions can be applied to a diagonal matrix without converting it to a full one: <em class="dfn">abs</em>, <em class="dfn">real</em>, <em class="dfn">imag</em>, <em class="dfn">conj</em>, <em class="dfn">sqrt</em>. A diagonal matrix can also be returned from the <em class="dfn">balance</em> and <em class="dfn">svd</em> functions. The <em class="dfn">sparse</em> function will convert a diagonal matrix efficiently to a sparse matrix. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
