<div class="subsection" id="Comments-and-the-Help-System">   <h1 class="subsection">2.7.3 Comments and the Help System</h1>    <p>The <code>help</code> command (see <a href="getting-help.html">Commands for Getting Help</a>) is able to find the first block of comments in a function and return those as a documentation string. This means that the same commands used to get help on built-in functions are available for properly formatted user-defined functions. For example, after defining the function <code>f</code> below, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function xdot = f (x, t)

# usage: f (x, t)
#
# This function defines the right-hand
# side functions for a set of nonlinear
# differential equations.

  r = 0.25;
  …
endfunction</pre> <p>the command <kbd>help f</kbd> produces the output </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">usage: f (x, t)

 This function defines the right-hand
 side functions for a set of nonlinear
 differential equations.</pre> <p>Although it is possible to put comment lines into keyboard-composed, throw-away Octave programs, it usually isn’t very useful because the purpose of a comment is to help you or another person understand the program at a later time. </p> <p>The <code>help</code> parser currently only recognizes single line comments (see <a href="single-line-comments.html">Single Line Comments</a>) and not block comments for the initial help text. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
