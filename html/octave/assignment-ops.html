For example, the following expression assigns the value 1 to the variable <code class="code">z</code>: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">z = 1</pre> <p>After this expression is executed, the variable <code class="code">z</code> has the value 1. Whatever old value <code class="code">z</code> had before the assignment is forgotten. The ‘<samp class="samp">=</samp>’ sign is called an <em class="dfn">assignment operator</em>. </p> <p>Assignments can store string values also. For example, the following expression would store the value <code class="code">"this food is good"</code> in the variable <code class="code">message</code>: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">thing = "food"
predicate = "good"
message = [ "this " , thing , " is " , predicate ]
⇒ "this food is good"</pre> <p>(This also illustrates concatenation of strings.) </p>  <p>Most operators (addition, concatenation, and so on) have no effect except to compute a value. If you ignore the value, you might as well not use the operator. An assignment operator is different. It does produce a value, but even if you ignore the value, the assignment still makes itself felt through the alteration of the variable. We call this a <em class="dfn">side effect</em>. </p>  <p>The left-hand operand of an assignment need not be a variable (see <a class="pxref" href="variables.html">Variables</a>). It can also be an element of a matrix (see <a class="pxref" href="index-expressions.html">Index Expressions</a>) or a list of return values (see <a class="pxref" href="calling-functions.html">Calling Functions</a>). These are all called <em class="dfn">lvalues</em>, which means they can appear on the left-hand side of an assignment operator. The right-hand operand may be any expression. It produces the new value which the assignment stores in the specified variable, matrix element, or list of return values. </p> <p>It is important to note that variables do <em class="emph">not</em> have permanent types. The type of a variable is simply the type of whatever value it happens to hold at the moment. In the following program fragment, the variable <code class="code">foo</code> has a numeric value at first, and a string value later on: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; foo = 1
foo = 1
&gt;&gt; foo = "bar"
foo = bar</pre> <p>When the second assignment gives <code class="code">foo</code> a string value, the fact that it previously had a numeric value is forgotten. </p> <p>Assignment of a scalar to an indexed matrix sets all of the elements that are referenced by the indices to the scalar value. For example, if <code class="code">a</code> is a matrix with at least two columns, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a(:, 2) = 5</pre> <p>sets all the elements in the second column of <code class="code">a</code> to 5. </p> <p>When an assignment sets the value of a vector, matrix, or array element at a position or dimension outside of that variable’s current size, the array size will be increased to accommodate the new values: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
a = 1 2 3
&gt;&gt; a(4) = 4
a = 1 2 3 4
&gt;&gt; a(2, :) = [5, 6, 7, 8]
a =
   1   2   3   4
   5   6   7   8</pre> <p>Attempting to increase the size of an array such that the desired output size is ambiguous will result in an error: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; a(9) = 10
-| error: Invalid resizing operation or ambiguous assignment to an
out-of-bounds array element</pre> <p>This is because adding the 9th element creates an ambiguity in the desired array position for the value 10, each possibility requiring a different array size expansion to accommodate the assignment. </p> <p>Assignments may be made with fewer specified elements than would be required to fill the newly expanded array as long as the assignment is unambiguous. In these cases the array will be automatically padded with <em class="emph">null</em> values: </p>
<pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2]
a =   1   2
&gt;&gt; a(4) = 5
a =   1   2   0   5
&gt;&gt; a(3, :) = [6, 7, 8, 9]
a =
   1   2   0   5
   0   0   0   0

&gt;&gt; a(4, 5) = 10
a =

    6    7    8    9    0
    0    0    0    0   10</pre> <p>For all built-in types, the <em class="emph">null</em> value will be appropriate to that object type. </p> <p>Numeric arrays: </p>
<pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; a = int32 ([1, 2])
a = 1, 2
&gt;&gt; a(4) = 5

<pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; e = {1, "foo", [3, 4]};
&gt;&gt; e(5) = "bar"
e =
{
  [1,1] = 1
  [1,2] = foo
  [1,3] =

     3   4

  [1,4] = [](0x0)
  [1,5] = bar
}</pre> <p>Struct arrays: </p>
<pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; a = struct("foo",1,"bar",2);
&gt;&gt; a(3) = struct("foo",3,"bar",9)
a =

  1x3 struct array containing the fields:

    foo
    bar

&gt;&gt; a.foo
ans = 1
ans = [](0x0)
ans = 3
&gt;&gt; a.bar
ans = 2
ans = [](0x0)
ans = 9</pre> <p>Note that Octave currently is unable to concatenate arbitrary object types into arrays. Such behavior must be explicitly defined within the object class or attempts at concatenation will result in an error. See <a class="xref" href="object-oriented-programming.html">Object Oriented Programming</a> </p> <p>Assigning an empty matrix ‘<samp class="samp">[]</samp>’ works in most cases to allow you to delete rows or columns of matrices and vectors. See <a class="xref" href="empty-matrices.html">Empty Matrices</a>. For example, given a 4 by 5 matrix <var class="var">A</var>, the assignment </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">A (3, :) = []</pre> <p>deletes the third row of <var class="var">A</var>, and the assignment </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">A (:, 1:2:5) = []</pre> <p>deletes the first, third, and fifth columns. </p> <p>Deleting part of an array object will necessarily resize the object. When the deletion allows for consistent size reduction across a dimension, e.g., one element of a vector, or one row or column of a matrix, the size along that dimension will be reduced while preserving dimensionality. If, however, dimensionality cannot be maintained, the object will be reshaped into a vector following column-wise element ordering: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4; 5, 6, 7, 8]
a =
   1   2   3   4
   5   6   7   8
&gt;&gt; a(:, 3) = []
a =
   1   2   4
   5   6   8
&gt;&gt; a(4) = []
a = 1 5 2 4 8</pre> <p>An assignment is an expression, so it has a value. Thus, <code class="code">z = 1</code> as an expression has the value 1. One consequence of this is that you can write multiple assignments together: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">x = y = z = 0</pre> <p>stores the value 0 in all three variables. It does this because the value of <code class="code">z = 0</code>, which is 0, is stored into <code class="code">y</code>, and then the value of <code class="code">y = z = 0</code>, which is 0, is stored into <code class="code">x</code>. </p> <p>This is also true of assignments to lists of values, so the following is a valid expression </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[a, b, c] = [u, s, v] = svd (a)</pre> <p>that is exactly equivalent to </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[u, s, v] = svd (a)
a = u
b = s
c = v</pre> <p>In expressions like this, the number of values in each part of the expression need not match. For example, the expression </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[a, b] = [u, s, v] = svd (a)</pre> <p>is equivalent to </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[u, s, v] = svd (a)
a = u
b = s</pre> <p>The number of values on the left side of the expression can, however, not exceed the number of values on the right side. For example, the following will produce an error. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[a, b, c, d] = [u, s, v] = svd (a);
-| error: element number 4 undefined in return list</pre> <p>The symbol <code class="code">~</code> may be used as a placeholder in the list of lvalues, indicating that the corresponding return value should be ignored and not stored anywhere: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[~, s, v] = svd (a);</pre> <p>This is cleaner and more memory efficient than using a dummy variable. The <code class="code">nargout</code> value for the right-hand side expression is not affected. If the assignment is used as an expression, the return value is a comma-separated list with the ignored values dropped. </p>  <p>A very common programming pattern is to increment an existing variable with a given value, like this </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = a + 2;</pre> <p>This can be written in a clearer and more condensed form using the <code class="code">+=</code> operator </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a += 2;</pre>    <p>Similar operators also exist for subtraction (<code class="code">-=</code>), multiplication (<code class="code">*=</code>), and division (<code class="code">/=</code>). An expression of the form </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">expr1 op= expr2</pre> <p>is evaluated as </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">expr1 = (expr1) op (expr2)</pre> <p>where <var class="var">op</var> can be either <code class="code">+</code>, <code class="code">-</code>, <code class="code">*</code>, or <code class="code">/</code>, as long as <var class="var">expr2</var> is a simple expression with no side effects. If <var class="var">expr2</var> also contains an assignment operator, then this expression is evaluated as </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">temp = expr2
expr1 = (expr1) op temp</pre> <p>where <var class="var">temp</var> is a placeholder temporary value storing the computed result of evaluating <var class="var">expr2</var>. So, the expression </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a *= b+1</pre> <p>is evaluated as </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = a * (b+1)</pre> <p>and <em class="emph">not</em> </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = a * b + 1</pre> <p>You can use an assignment anywhere an expression is called for. For example, it is valid to write <code class="code">x != (y = 1)</code> to set <code class="code">y</code> to 1 and then test whether <code class="code">x</code> equals 1. But this style tends to make programs hard to read. Except in a one-shot program, you should rewrite it to get rid of such nesting of assignments. This is never very hard. </p>     </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Next: <a href="increment-ops.html">Increment Operators</a>, Previous: <a href="boolean-expressions.html">Boolean Expressions</a>, Up: <a href="expressions.html">Expressions</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="concept-index.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
