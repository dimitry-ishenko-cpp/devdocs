<div class="subsection" id="The-DESCRIPTION-File">   <h1 class="subsection">37.4.1 The DESCRIPTION File</h1> <p>The <samp>DESCRIPTION</samp> file contains various information about the package, such as its name, author, and version. This file has a very simple format </p> <ul> <li> Lines starting with ‘<samp>#</samp>’ are comments. </li>
<li> Lines starting with a blank character are continuations from the previous line. </li>
<li> Everything else is of the form <code>NameOfOption: ValueOfOption</code>. </li>
</ul> <p>The following is a simple example of a <samp>DESCRIPTION</samp> file </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">Name: The name of my package
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2007-18-04
Author: The name (and possibly email) of the package author.
Maintainer: The name (and possibly email) of the current
 package maintainer.
Title: The title of the package
Description: A short description of the package.  If this
 description gets too long for one line it can continue
 on the next by adding a space to the beginning of the
 following lines.
License: GPLv3+</pre> <p>The package manager currently recognizes the following keywords </p> <dl compact> <dt><span><code>Name</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Name of the package. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Version</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Version of the package. A package version is typically digits separated by dots but may also contain ‘<samp>+</samp>’, ‘<samp>-</samp>’, ‘<samp>~</samp>’, and alphanumeric characters (in the "C" locale). For example, <code>"2.1.0+"</code> could indicate a development version of a package. Versions are compared using <a href="system-information.html#XREFcompare_005fversions">compare_versions</a>. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Date</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Date of last update. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Author</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Original author of the package. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Maintainer</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Maintainer of the package. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Title</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>A one line description of the package. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Description</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>A one paragraph description of the package. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Categories</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Optional keyword describing the package (if no <samp>INDEX</samp> file is given this is mandatory). </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Problems</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Optional list of known problems. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Url</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>Optional list of homepages related to the package. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>Depends</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>A list of other Octave packages that this package depends on. This can include dependencies on particular versions, with the following format: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">Depends: package (&gt;= 1.0.0)</pre> <p>Possible operators are <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> or <code>&gt;</code>. If the part of the dependency in <code>()</code> is missing, any version of the package is acceptable. Multiple dependencies can be defined as a comma separated list. This can be used to define a range of versions of a particular package: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">Depends: package (&gt;= 1.0.0), package (&lt; 1.5.0)</pre> <p>It is also possible to depend on particular versions of Octave core: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">Depends: octave (&gt;= 3.8.0)</pre> </dd> <dt><span><code>License</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>An optional short description of the used license (e.g., GPL version 3 or newer). This is optional since the file <samp>COPYING</samp> is mandatory. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>SystemRequirements</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>These are the external install dependencies of the package and are not checked by the package manager. This is here as a hint to the distribution packager. They follow the same conventions as the <code>Depends</code> keyword. </p> </dd> <dt><span><code>BuildRequires</code></span></dt> <dd>
<p>These are the external build dependencies of the package and are not checked by the package manager. This is here as a hint to the distribution packager. They follow the same conventions as the <code>Depends</code> keyword. Note that in general, packaging systems such as <code>rpm</code> or <code>deb</code> autoprobe the install dependencies from the build dependencies, and therefore a <code>BuildRequires</code> dependency usually removes the need for a <code>SystemRequirements</code> dependency. </p> </dd> </dl> <p>The developer is free to add additional arguments to the <samp>DESCRIPTION</samp> file for their own purposes. One further detail to aid the packager is that the <code>SystemRequirements</code> and <code>BuildRequires</code> keywords can have a distribution dependent section, and the automatic build process will use these. An example of the format of this is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">BuildRequires: libtermcap-devel [Mandriva] libtermcap2-devel</pre> <p>where the first package name will be used as a default and if the RPMs are built on a Mandriva distribution, then the second package name will be used instead. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
