<div class="subsection" id="Private-Functions">   <h1 class="subsection">11.10.3 Private Functions</h1> <p>In many cases one function needs to access one or more helper functions. If the helper function is limited to the scope of a single function, then subfunctions as discussed above might be used. However, if a single helper function is used by more than one function, then this is no longer possible. In this case the helper functions might be placed in a subdirectory, called "private", of the directory in which the functions needing access to this helper function are found. </p> <p>As a simple example, consider a function <code>func1</code>, that calls a helper function <code>func2</code> to do much of the work. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function y = func1 (x)
  y = func2 (x);
endfunction</pre> <p>Then if the path to <code>func1</code> is <code>&lt;directory&gt;/func1.m</code>, and if <code>func2</code> is found in the directory <code>&lt;directory&gt;/private/func2.m</code>, then <code>func2</code> is only available for use of the functions, like <code>func1</code>, that are found in <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
