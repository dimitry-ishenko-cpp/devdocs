<div class="subsection" id="PKG_005fADD-and-PKG_005fDEL-Directives">   <h1 class="subsection">37.4.3 PKG_ADD and PKG_DEL Directives</h1> <p>If the package contains files called <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_ADD</span></code> or <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_DEL</span></code> the commands in these files will be executed when the package is added or removed from the users path. In some situations such files are a bit cumbersome to maintain, so the package manager supports automatic creation of such files. If a source file in the package contains a <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_ADD</span></code> or <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_DEL</span></code> directive they will be added to either the <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_ADD</span></code> or <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_DEL</span></code> files. </p> <p>In <code>m</code>-files a <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_ADD</span></code> directive looks like this </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">## PKG_ADD: some_octave_command</pre> <p>Such lines should be added before the <code>function</code> keyword. In C++ files a <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_ADD</span></code> directive looks like this </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">// PKG_ADD: some_octave_command</pre> <p>In both cases <code>some_octave_command</code> should be replaced by the command that should be placed in the <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_ADD</span></code> file. <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_DEL</span></code> directives work in the same way, except the <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_ADD</span></code> keyword is replaced with <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_DEL</span></code> and the commands get added to the <code><span class="nolinebreak">PKG_DEL</span></code> file. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
