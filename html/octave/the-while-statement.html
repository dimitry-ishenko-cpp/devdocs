<div class="section" id="The-while-Statement">   <h1 class="section">10.3 The while Statement</h1>     <p>In programming, a <em>loop</em> means a part of a program that is (or at least can be) executed two or more times in succession. </p> <p>The <code>while</code> statement is the simplest looping statement in Octave. It repeatedly executes a statement as long as a condition is true. As with the condition in an <code>if</code> statement, the condition in a <code>while</code> statement is considered true if its value is nonzero, and false if its value is zero. If the value of the conditional expression in a <code>while</code> statement is a vector or a matrix, it is considered true only if it is non-empty and <em>all</em> of the elements are nonzero. </p> <p>Octave’s <code>while</code> statement looks like this: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">while (condition)
  body
endwhile</pre> <p>Here <var>body</var> is a statement or list of statements that we call the <em>body</em> of the loop, and <var>condition</var> is an expression that controls how long the loop keeps running. </p> <p>The first thing the <code>while</code> statement does is test <var>condition</var>. If <var>condition</var> is true, it executes the statement <var>body</var>. After <var>body</var> has been executed, <var>condition</var> is tested again, and if it is still true, <var>body</var> is executed again. This process repeats until <var>condition</var> is no longer true. If <var>condition</var> is initially false, the body of the loop is never executed. </p> <p>This example creates a variable <code>fib</code> that contains the first ten elements of the Fibonacci sequence. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">fib = ones (1, 10);
i = 3;
while (i &lt;= 10)
  fib (i) = fib (i-1) + fib (i-2);
  i++;
endwhile</pre> <p>Here the body of the loop contains two statements. </p> <p>The loop works like this: first, the value of <code>i</code> is set to 3. Then, the <code>while</code> tests whether <code>i</code> is less than or equal to 10. This is the case when <code>i</code> equals 3, so the value of the <code>i</code>-th element of <code>fib</code> is set to the sum of the previous two values in the sequence. Then the <code>i++</code> increments the value of <code>i</code> and the loop repeats. The loop terminates when <code>i</code> reaches 11. </p> <p>A newline is not required between the condition and the body; but using one makes the program clearer unless the body is very simple. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
