<div class="subsection" id="Creating-Permutation-Matrices">   <h1 class="subsection">21.1.2 Creating Permutation Matrices</h1> <p>For creating permutation matrices, Octave does not introduce a new function, but rather overrides an existing syntax: permutation matrices can be conveniently created by indexing an identity matrix by permutation vectors. That is, if <var>q</var> is a permutation vector of length <var>n</var>, the expression </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">P = eye (n) (:, q);</pre> <p>will create a permutation matrix - a special matrix object. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">eye (n) (q, :)</pre> <p>will also work (and create a row permutation matrix), as well as </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">eye (n) (q1, q2).</pre> <p>For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">eye (4) ([1,3,2,4],:)

In Octave, <code>eye (n)</code> returns a diagonal matrix, because a matrix can only have one class. You can convert this diagonal matrix to a permutation matrix by indexing it by an identity permutation, as shown below. This is a special property of the identity matrix; indexing other diagonal matrices generally produces a full matrix. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">eye (3)
