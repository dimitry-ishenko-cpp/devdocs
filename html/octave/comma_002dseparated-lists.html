<div class="section" id="Comma_002dSeparated-Lists">   <h1 class="section">6.4 Comma-Separated Lists</h1>   <p>Comma-separated lists <a id="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a> are the basic argument type to all Octave functions - both for input and return arguments. In the example </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">max (a, b)</pre> <p>‘<samp><var>a</var>, <var>b</var></samp>’ is a comma-separated list. Comma-separated lists can appear on both the right and left hand side of an assignment. For example </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">x = [1 0 1 0 0 1 1; 0 0 0 0 0 0 7];
[i, j] = find (x, 2, "last");</pre> <p>Here, ‘<samp><var>x</var>, 2, "last"</samp>’ is a comma-separated list constituting the input arguments of <code>find</code>. <code>find</code> returns a comma separated list of output arguments which is assigned element by element to the comma-separated list ‘<samp><var>i</var>, <var>j</var></samp>’. </p> <p>Another example of where comma-separated lists are used is in the creation of a new array with <code>[]</code> (see <a href="matrices.html">Matrices</a>) or the creation of a cell array with <code>{}</code> (see <a href="basic-usage-of-cell-arrays.html">Basic Usage of Cell Arrays</a>). In the expressions </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
c = {4, 5, 6, 7};</pre> <p>both ‘<samp>1, 2, 3, 4</samp>’ and ‘<samp>4, 5, 6, 7</samp>’ are comma-separated lists. </p> <p>Comma-separated lists cannot be directly manipulated by the user. However, both structure arrays and cell arrays can be converted into comma-separated lists, and thus used in place of explicitly written comma-separated lists. This feature is useful in many ways, as will be shown in the following subsections. </p> <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="comma_002dseparated-lists-generated-from-cell-arrays.html" accesskey="1">Comma-Separated Lists Generated from Cell Arrays</a></li> <li><a href="comma_002dseparated-lists-generated-from-structure-arrays.html" accesskey="2">Comma-Separated Lists Generated from Structure Arrays</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="footnote">  <h4 class="footnotes-heading">Footnotes</h4> <h5 id="">(2)</h5> <p>Comma-separated lists are also sometimes informally referred to as <em>cs-lists</em>.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
