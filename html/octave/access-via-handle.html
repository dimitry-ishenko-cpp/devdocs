For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">f = @plus;
f (2, 2)
⇒  4</pre> <p>is equivalent to calling <code class="code">plus (2, 2)</code> directly. Beyond abstraction for general programming, function handles find use in callback methods for figures and graphics by adding listeners to properties or assigning pre-existing actions, such as in the following example: </p>  <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function mydeletefcn (h, ~, msg)
  printf (msg);
endfunction
sombrero;
set (gcf, "deletefcn", {@mydeletefcn, "Bye!\n"});
close;</pre> <p>The above will print <code class="code">"Bye!"</code> to the terminal upon the closing (deleting) of the figure. There are many graphics property actions for which a callback function may be assigned, including, <code class="code">buttondownfcn</code>, <code class="code">windowscrollwheelfcn</code>, <code class="code">createfcn</code>, <code class="code">deletefcn</code>, <code class="code">keypressfcn</code>, etc. </p> <p>Note that the ‘<samp class="samp">@</samp>’ character also plays a role in defining class functions, i.e., methods, but not as a syntactical element. Rather it begins a directory name containing methods for a class that shares the directory name sans the ‘<samp class="samp">@</samp>’ character.
