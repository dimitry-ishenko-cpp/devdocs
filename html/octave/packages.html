<div class="chapter" id="Packages">   <h1 class="chapter">37 Packages</h1> <p>Since Octave is Free Software users are encouraged to share their programs with others. To aid this sharing Octave supports the installation of extra packages. The ‘Octave Forge’ project is a community-maintained set of packages that can be downloaded and installed in Octave. At the time of writing the ‘Octave Forge’ project can be found online at <a href="https://octave.sourceforge.io">https://octave.sourceforge.io</a>, but since the Internet is an ever-changing place this may not be true at the time of reading. Therefore it is recommended to see <a href="https://octave.org">the Octave website</a>for an updated reference. </p>  <ul class="section-toc"> <li><a href="installing-and-removing-packages.html" accesskey="1">Installing and Removing Packages</a></li> <li><a href="using-packages.html" accesskey="2">Using Packages</a></li> <li><a href="administrating-packages.html" accesskey="3">Administrating Packages</a></li> <li><a href="creating-packages.html" accesskey="4">Creating Packages</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
