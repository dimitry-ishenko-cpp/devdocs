<div class="subsection" id="Other-Output-Conversions">   <h1 class="subsection">14.2.10 Other Output Conversions</h1> <p>This section describes miscellaneous conversions for <code>printf</code>. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%c</samp>’ conversion prints a single character. The ‘<samp>-</samp>’ flag can be used to specify left-justification in the field, but no other flags are defined, and no precision or type modifier can be given. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">printf ("%c%c%c%c%c", "h", "e", "l", "l", "o");</pre> <p>prints ‘<samp>hello</samp>’. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%s</samp>’ conversion prints a string. The corresponding argument must be a string. A precision can be specified to indicate the maximum number of characters to write; otherwise characters in the string up to but not including the terminating null character are written to the output stream. The ‘<samp>-</samp>’ flag can be used to specify left-justification in the field, but no other flags or type modifiers are defined for this conversion. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">printf ("%3s%-6s", "no", "where");</pre> <p>prints ‘<samp> nowhere </samp>’ (note the leading and trailing spaces). </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
