<div class="subsection" id="Numeric-Input-Conversions">   <h1 class="subsection">14.2.14 Numeric Input Conversions</h1> <p>This section describes the <code>scanf</code> conversions for reading numeric values. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%d</samp>’ conversion matches an optionally signed integer in decimal radix. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%i</samp>’ conversion matches an optionally signed integer in any of the formats that the C language defines for specifying an integer constant. </p> <p>For example, any of the strings ‘<samp>10</samp>’, ‘<samp>0xa</samp>’, or ‘<samp>012</samp>’ could be read in as integers under the ‘<samp>%i</samp>’ conversion. Each of these specifies a number with decimal value <code>10</code>. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%o</samp>’, ‘<samp>%u</samp>’, and ‘<samp>%x</samp>’ conversions match unsigned integers in octal, decimal, and hexadecimal radices, respectively. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%X</samp>’ conversion is identical to the ‘<samp>%x</samp>’ conversion. They both permit either uppercase or lowercase letters to be used as digits. </p> <p>By default, integers are read as 32-bit quantities. With the ‘<samp>h</samp>’ modifier, 16-bit integers are used, and with the ‘<samp>l</samp>’ modifier, 64-bit integers are used. </p> <p>The ‘<samp>%e</samp>’, ‘<samp>%f</samp>’, ‘<samp>%g</samp>’, ‘<samp>%E</samp>’, and ‘<samp>%G</samp>’ conversions match optionally signed floating-point numbers. All five conversion specifications behave identically, and will read in numerical values of any floating point display style. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
