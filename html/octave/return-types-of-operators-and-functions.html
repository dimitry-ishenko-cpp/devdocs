The two are closely related in that the computation time on a sparse matrix operator or function is roughly linear with the number of nonzero elements. </p> <p>Therefore, there is a certain density of nonzero elements of a matrix where it no longer makes sense to store it as a sparse matrix, but rather as a full matrix. For this reason operators and functions that have a high probability of returning a full matrix will always return one. For example adding a scalar constant to a sparse matrix will almost always make it a full matrix, and so the example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">speye (3) + 0
⇒   1  0  0
  0  1  0
  0  0  1</pre> <p>returns a full matrix as can be seen. </p> <p>As all of the mixed operators and functions between full and sparse matrices exist, in general this does not cause any problems. However, one area where it does cause a problem is where a sparse matrix is promoted to a full matrix, where subsequent operations would resparsify the matrix. Such cases are rare, but can be artificially created, for example <code class="code">(fliplr (speye (3)) + speye (3)) - speye (3)</code> gives a full matrix when it should give a sparse one. In general, where such cases occur, they impose only a small memory penalty. </p> <p>There is however one known case where this behavior of Octave’s sparse matrices will cause a problem. That is in the handling of the <em class="dfn">diag</em> function. Whether <em class="dfn">diag</em> returns a sparse or full matrix depending on the type of its input arguments. So </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = diag (sparse ([1,2,3]), -1);</pre> <p>should return a sparse matrix. To ensure this actually happens, the <em class="dfn">sparse</em> function, and other functions based on it like <em class="dfn">speye</em>, always returns a sparse matrix, even if the memory used will be larger than its full representation. </p> </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Next: <a href="mathematical-considerations.html">Mathematical Considerations</a>, Previous: <a href="sparse-functions.html">Sparse Functions</a>, Up: <a href="operators-and-functions.html">Basic Operators and Functions on Sparse Matrices</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="concept-index.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
