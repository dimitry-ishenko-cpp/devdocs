<div class="subsection" id="Anonymous-Functions">   <h1 class="subsection">11.12.2 Anonymous Functions</h1> <p>Anonymous functions are defined using the syntax </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">@(argument-list) expression</pre> <p>Any variables that are not found in the argument list are inherited from the enclosing scope. Anonymous functions are useful for creating simple unnamed functions from expressions or for wrapping calls to other functions to adapt them for use by functions like <code>quad</code>. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">f = @(x) x.^2;
quad (f, 0, 10)
    ⇒ 333.33</pre> <p>creates a simple unnamed function from the expression <code>x.^2</code> and passes it to <code>quad</code>, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">quad (@(x) sin (x), 0, pi)
    ⇒ 2</pre> <p>wraps another function, and </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = 1;
b = 2;
quad (@(x) betainc (x, a, b), 0, 0.4)
    ⇒ 0.13867</pre> <p>adapts a function with several parameters to the form required by <code>quad</code>. In this example, the values of <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> that are passed to <code>betainc</code> are inherited from the current environment. </p> <p>Note that for performance reasons it is better to use handles to existing Octave functions, rather than to define anonymous functions which wrap an existing function. The integration of <code>sin (x)</code> is 5X faster if the code is written as </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">quad (@sin, 0, pi)</pre> <p>rather than using the anonymous function <code>@(x) sin (x)</code>. There are many operators which have functional equivalents that may be better choices than an anonymous function. Instead of writing </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">f = @(x, y) x + y</pre> <p>this should be coded as </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">f = @plus</pre> <p>See <a href="operator-overloading.html">Operator Overloading</a>, for a list of operators which also have a functional form. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
