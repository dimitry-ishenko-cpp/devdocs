<div class="subsection" id="Passing-Arguments-to-Executable-Scripts">   <h1 class="subsection">2.6.1 Passing Arguments to Executable Scripts</h1> <p>Note that when Octave is started from an executable script, the built-in function <code>argv</code> returns a cell array containing the command line arguments passed to the executable Octave script, not the arguments passed to the Octave interpreter on the ‘<samp>#!</samp>’ line of the script. For example, the following program will reproduce the command line that was used to execute the script, not ‘<samp>-qf</samp>’. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">#! /bin/octave -qf
printf ("%s", program_name ());
arg_list = argv ();
for i = 1:nargin
  printf (" %s", arg_list{i});
endfor
printf ("\n");</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
