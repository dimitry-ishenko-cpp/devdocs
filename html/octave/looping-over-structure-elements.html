<div class="subsection" id="Looping-Over-Structure-Elements">   <h1 class="subsection">10.5.1 Looping Over Structure Elements</h1>   <p>A special form of the <code>for</code> statement allows you to loop over all the elements of a structure: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">for [ val, key ] = expression
  body
endfor</pre> <p>In this form of the <code>for</code> statement, the value of <var>expression</var> must be a structure. If it is, <var>key</var> and <var>val</var> are set to the name of the element and the corresponding value in turn, until there are no more elements. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">x.a = 1
x.b = [1, 2; 3, 4]
x.c = "string"
for [val, key] = x
  key
  val
endfor

     -| key = a
     -| val = 1
     -| key = b
     -| val =
     -|
     -|   1  2
     -|   3  4
     -|
     -| key = c
     -| val = string</pre> <p>The elements are not accessed in any particular order. If you need to cycle through the list in a particular way, you will have to use the function <code>fieldnames</code> and sort the list yourself. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
