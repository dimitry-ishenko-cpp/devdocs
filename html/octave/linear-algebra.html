Reference material for many of these functions may be found in Golub and Van Loan, <cite class="cite">Matrix Computations, 2nd Ed.</cite>, Johns Hopkins, 1989, and in the <cite class="cite"><small class="sc">LAPACK</small> Users’ Guide</cite>, SIAM, 1992. The <cite class="cite"><small class="sc">LAPACK</small> Users’ Guide</cite> is available at: <cite class="cite">http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lug/</cite> </p> <p>A common text for engineering courses is G. Strang, <cite class="cite">Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 4th Edition</cite>. It has become a widespread reference for linear algebra. An alternative is P. Lax <cite class="cite">Linear Algebra and Its Applications</cite>, and also is a good choice. It claims to be suitable for high school students with substantial mathematical interests as well as first-year undergraduates. </p> <ul class="mini-toc"> <li><a href="techniques-used-for-linear-algebra.html" accesskey="1">Techniques Used for Linear Algebra</a></li> <li><a href="basic-matrix-functions.html" accesskey="2">Basic Matrix Functions</a></li> <li><a href="matrix-factorizations.html" accesskey="3">Matrix Factorizations</a></li> <li><a href="functions-of-a-matrix.html" accesskey="4">Functions of a Matrix</a></li> <li><a href="specialized-solvers.html" accesskey="5">Specialized Solvers</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
