The expression <code class="code">diag (v)</code>, with <var class="var">v</var> a vector, will create a square diagonal matrix with elements on the main diagonal given by the elements of <var class="var">v</var>, and size equal to the length of <var class="var">v</var>. <code class="code">diag (v, m, n)</code> can be used to construct a rectangular diagonal matrix. The result of these expressions will be a special diagonal matrix object, rather than a general matrix object. </p> <p>Diagonal matrix with unit elements can be created using <em class="dfn">eye</em>. Some other built-in functions can also return diagonal matrices. Examples include <em class="dfn">balance</em> or <em class="dfn">inv</em>. </p> <p>Example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">diag (1:4)
