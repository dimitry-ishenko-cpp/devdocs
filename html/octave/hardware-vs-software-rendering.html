The choice between hardware or software rendering affects the OpenGL graphics toolkits (<code class="code">"qt"</code> and <code class="code">"fltk"</code>) only. Software rendering can be used to avoid rendering and printing issues due to imperfect OpenGL driver implementations for diverse graphic cards from different vendors (notably integrated Intel graphics). The downside is that software rendering may be considerably slower than hardware-accelerated rendering (and it might not work correctly on 32-bit platforms or WoW64). To permanently switch between hardware-accelerated rendering with your graphics card drivers and software rendering, use the "OpenGL Switcher" application from the Start menu while Octave is closed. Alternatively, rename the following file while Octave is closed: </p> <p><samp class="file"><var class="var">octave-home</var>\bin\opengl32.dll</samp> <br>where <var class="var">octave-home</var> is the directory returned by <a class="ref" href="system-information.html#XREFOCTAVE_005fHOME"><code class="code">OCTAVE_HOME</code></a>, i.e., the directory in which Octave is installed (the default is <samp class="file">C:\Program Files\GNU Octave\Octave\Octave-<var class="var">version</var>\mingw64</samp>). Change the file extension to <samp class="file">.bak</samp> for hardware rendering or to <samp class="file">.dll</samp> for software rendering. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
