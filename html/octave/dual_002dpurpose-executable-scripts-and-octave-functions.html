But when a function is called from the interpreter any arguments <em class="emph">are</em> passed to the function and these override the default. </p> <p>Additionally, the file must end with the extension <samp class="file">.m</samp> so that the interpreter will recognize it as an Octave function. Finally, the output from <code class="code">argv</code> is a cell array of strings. It may be necessary to convert this to a numeric value with <code class="code">str2double</code> or <code class="code">str2num</code> before processing. </p> <p>As a complete example, consider the following code located in the file <samp class="file">mysin.m</samp>. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">#! /bin/octave -qf
function retval = mysin (x = str2double (argv(){end}))
  retval = sin (x)
endfunction</pre> <p>This can be called from the shell with </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">mysin.m 1.5</pre> <p>or from Octave with </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">mysin (1.5)</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
