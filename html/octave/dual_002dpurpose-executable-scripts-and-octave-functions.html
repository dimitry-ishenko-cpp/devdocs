<div class="subsection" id="Dual_002dPurpose-Executable-Scripts-and-Octave-Functions">   <h1 class="subsection">2.6.2 Dual-Purpose Executable Scripts and Octave Functions</h1> <p>To write m-files that can act as executable programs when called from the shell or as normal functions when called from within Octave, use default input arguments initialized with the <code>argv</code> function. </p> <p>If a function is called from the shell Octave will not pass any input parameters to the function and therefore the default argument is used. But when a function is called from the interpreter any arguments <em>are</em> passed to the function and these override the default. </p> <p>Additionally, the file must end with the extension <samp>.m</samp> so that the interpreter will recognize it as an Octave function. Finally, the output from <code>argv</code> is a cell array of strings. It may be necessary to convert this to a numeric value with <code>str2double</code> or <code>str2num</code> before processing. </p> <p>As a complete example, consider the following code located in the file <samp>mysin.m</samp>. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">#! /bin/octave -qf
function retval = mysin (x = str2double (argv(){end}))
  retval = sin (x)
endfunction</pre> <p>This can be called from the shell with </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">mysin.m 1.5</pre> <p>or from Octave with </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">mysin (1.5)</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
