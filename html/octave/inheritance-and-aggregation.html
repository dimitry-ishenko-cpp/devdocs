<div class="section" id="Inheritance-and-Aggregation">   <h1 class="section">34.5 Inheritance and Aggregation</h1> <p>Using classes to build new classes is supported by Octave through the use of both inheritance and aggregation. </p> <p>Class inheritance is provided by Octave using the <code>class</code> function in the class constructor. As in the case of the polynomial class, the Octave programmer will create a structure that contains the data fields required by the class, and then call the <code>class</code> function to indicate that an object is to be created from the structure. Creating a child of an existing object is done by creating an object of the parent class and providing that object as the third argument of the class function. </p> <p>This is most easily demonstrated by example. Suppose the programmer needs a FIR filter, i.e., a filter with a numerator polynomial but a denominator of 1. In traditional Octave programming this would be performed as follows. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; x = [some data vector];
&gt;&gt; n = [some coefficient vector];
&gt;&gt; y = filter (n, 1, x);</pre> <p>The equivalent behavior can be implemented as a class <code>@FIRfilter</code>. The constructor for this class is the file <samp>FIRfilter.m</samp> in the class directory <samp>@FIRfilter</samp>. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">## -*- texinfo -*-
## @deftypefn  {} {} FIRfilter ()
## @deftypefnx {} {} FIRfilter (@var{p})
## Create a FIR filter with polynomial @var{p} as coefficient vector.
## @end deftypefn

function f = FIRfilter (p)

  if (nargin == 0)
    p = @polynomial ([1]);
  elseif (! isa (p, "polynomial"))
    error ("@FIRfilter: P must be a polynomial object");
  endif

  f.polynomial = [];
  f = class (f, "FIRfilter", p);

endfunction</pre> <p>As before, the leading comments provide documentation for the class constructor. This constructor is very similar to the polynomial class constructor, except that a polynomial object is passed as the third argument to the <code>class</code> function, telling Octave that the <code>FIRfilter</code> class will be derived from the polynomial class. The FIR filter class itself does not have any data fields, but it must provide a struct to the <code>class</code> function. Given that the <code>@polynomial</code> constructor will add an element named <var>polynomial</var> to the object struct, the <code>@FIRfilter</code> just initializes a struct with a dummy field <var>polynomial</var> which will later be overwritten. </p> <p>Note that the sample code always provides for the case in which no arguments are supplied. This is important because Octave will call a constructor with no arguments when loading objects from saved files in order to determine the inheritance structure. </p> <p>A class may be a child of more than one class (see <a href="built_002din-data-types.html#XREFclass">class</a>), and inheritance may be nested. There is no limitation to the number of parents or the level of nesting other than memory or other physical issues. </p> <p>For the <code>FIRfilter</code> class, more control about the object display is desired. Therefore, the <code>display</code> method rather than the <code>disp</code> method is overloaded (see <a href="class-methods.html">Class Methods</a>). A simple example might be </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function display (f)
  printf ("%s.polynomial", inputname (1));
  disp (f.polynomial);
endfunction</pre> <p>Note that the <code>FIRfilter</code>’s display method relies on the <code>disp</code> method from the <code>polynomial</code> class to actually display the filter coefficients. Furthermore, note that in the <code>display</code> method it makes sense to start the method with the line <code><code>printf ("%s =", inputname (1))</code></code> to be consistent with the rest of Octave which prints the variable name to be displayed followed by the value. In general it is not recommended to overload the <code>display</code> function. </p> <dl class="def"> <dt id="index-display">
<span class="category">: </span><span> <strong>display</strong> <em>(<var>obj</var>)</em><a href="#index-display" class="copiable-anchor"> ¶</a></span>
</dt> <dd>
<p>Display the contents of the object <var>obj</var> prepended by its name. </p> <p>The Octave interpreter calls the <code>display</code> function whenever it needs to present a class on-screen. Typically, this would be a statement which does not end in a semicolon to suppress output. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">myclass (…)</pre> <p>Or: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">myobj = myclass (…)</pre> <p>In general, user-defined classes should overload the <code>disp</code> method to avoid the default output: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">myobj = myclass (…)
  ⇒ myobj =

  &lt;class myclass&gt;</pre> <p>When overloading the <code>display</code> method instead, one has to take care of properly displaying the object’s name. This can be done by using the <code>inputname</code> function. </p> <p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href="terminal-output.html#XREFdisp">disp</a>, <a href="built_002din-data-types.html#XREFclass">class</a>, <a href="defining-indexing-and-indexed-assignment.html#XREFsubsref">subsref</a>, <a href="defining-indexing-and-indexed-assignment.html#XREFsubsasgn">subsasgn</a>. </p>
</dd>
</dl> <p>Once a constructor and display method exist, it is possible to create an instance of the class. It is also possible to check the class type and examine the underlying structure. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">octave:1&gt; f = FIRfilter (polynomial ([1 1 1]/3))
f.polynomial = 0.33333 + 0.33333 * X + 0.33333 * X ^ 2
octave:2&gt; class (f)
ans = FIRfilter
octave:3&gt; isa (f, "FIRfilter")
ans =  1
octave:4&gt; isa (f, "polynomial")
ans =  1
octave:5&gt; struct (f)
ans =

  scalar structure containing the fields:

polynomial = 0.33333 + 0.33333 * X + 0.33333 * X ^ 2</pre> <p>The only thing remaining to make this class usable is a method for processing data. But before that, it is usually desirable to also have a way of changing the data stored in a class. Since the fields in the underlying struct are private by default, it is necessary to provide a mechanism to access the fields. The <code>subsref</code> method may be used for both tasks. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function r = subsref (f, x)

  switch (x.type)

    case "()"
      n = f.polynomial;
      r = filter (n.poly, 1, x.subs{1});

    case "."
      fld = x.subs;
      if (! strcmp (fld, "polynomial"))
        error ('@FIRfilter/subsref: invalid property "%s"', fld);
      endif
      r = f.polynomial;

    otherwise
      error ("@FIRfilter/subsref: invalid subscript type for FIR filter");

  endswitch

endfunction</pre> <p>The <code>"()"</code> case allows us to filter data using the polynomial provided to the constructor. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">octave:2&gt; f = FIRfilter (polynomial ([1 1 1]/3));
octave:3&gt; x = ones (5,1);
octave:4&gt; y = f(x)
y =

   0.33333
   0.66667
   1.00000
   1.00000
   1.00000</pre> <p>The <code>"."</code> case allows us to view the contents of the polynomial field. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">octave:1&gt; f = FIRfilter (polynomial ([1 1 1]/3));
octave:2&gt; f.polynomial
ans = 0.33333 + 0.33333 * X + 0.33333 * X ^ 2</pre> <p>In order to change the contents of the object a <code>subsasgn</code> method is needed. For example, the following code makes the polynomial field publicly writable </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">function fout = subsasgn (f, index, val)

  switch (index.type)
    case "."
      fld = index.subs;
      if (! strcmp (fld, "polynomial"))
        error ('@FIRfilter/subsasgn: invalid property "%s"', fld);
      endif
      fout = f;
      fout.polynomial = val;

    otherwise
      error ("@FIRfilter/subsasgn: Invalid index type")
  endswitch

endfunction</pre> <p>so that </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">octave:1&gt; f = FIRfilter ();
octave:2&gt; f.polynomial = polynomial ([1 2 3])
f.polynomial = 1 + 2 * X + 3 * X ^ 2</pre> <p>Defining the FIRfilter class as a child of the polynomial class implies that a FIRfilter object may be used any place that a polynomial object may be used. This is not a normal use of a filter. It may be a more sensible design approach to use aggregation rather than inheritance. In this case, the polynomial is simply a field in the class structure. A class constructor for the aggregation case might be </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">## -*- texinfo -*-
## @deftypefn  {} {} FIRfilter ()
## @deftypefnx {} {} FIRfilter (@var{p})
## Create a FIR filter with polynomial @var{p} as coefficient vector.
## @end deftypefn

function f = FIRfilter (p)

  if (nargin == 0)
    f.polynomial = @polynomial ([1]);
  else
    if (! isa (p, "polynomial"))
      error ("@FIRfilter: P must be a polynomial object");
    endif

    f.polynomial = p;
  endif

  f = class (f, "FIRfilter");

endfunction</pre> <p>For this example only the constructor needs changing, and all other class methods stay the same. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
