<div class="section" id="Example-Code">   <h1 class="section">21.4 Examples of Usage</h1> <p>The following can be used to solve a linear system <code>A*x = b</code> using the pivoted LU factorization: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[L, U, P] = lu (A); ## now L*U = P*A
  x = U \ (L \ P) * b;</pre> <p>This is one way to normalize columns of a matrix <var>X</var> to unit norm: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">s = norm (X, "columns");
  X /= diag (s);</pre> <p>The same can also be accomplished with broadcasting (see <a href="broadcasting.html">Broadcasting</a>): </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">s = norm (X, "columns");
  X ./= s;</pre> <p>The following expression is a way to efficiently calculate the sign of a permutation, given by a permutation vector <var>p</var>. It will also work in earlier versions of Octave, but slowly. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">det (eye (length (p))(p, :))</pre> <p>Finally, here’s how to solve a linear system <code>A*x = b</code> with Tikhonov regularization (ridge regression) using SVD (a skeleton only): </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">m = rows (A); n = columns (A);
  [U, S, V] = svd (A);
  ## determine the regularization factor alpha
  ## alpha = …
  ## transform to orthogonal basis
  b = U'*b;
  ## Use the standard formula, replacing A with S.
  ## S is diagonal, so the following will be very fast and accurate.
  x = (S'*S + alpha^2 * eye (n)) \ (S' * b);
  ## transform to solution basis
  x = V*x;</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
