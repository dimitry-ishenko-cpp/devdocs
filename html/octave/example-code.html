  [U, S, V] = svd (A);
  ## determine the regularization factor alpha
  ## alpha = ...
  ## transform to orthogonal basis
  b = U'*b;
  ## Use the standard formula, replacing A with S.
  ## S is diagonal, so the following will be very fast and accurate.
  x = (S'*S + alpha^2 * eye (n)) \ (S' * b);
  ## transform to solution basis
  x = V*x;</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
