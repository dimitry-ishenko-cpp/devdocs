<div class="section" id="Examples">   <h1 class="section">19.7 Examples</h1> <p>The following are examples of vectorization questions asked by actual users of Octave and their solutions. </p> <ul> <li> For a vector <code>A</code>, the following loop <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">n = length (A) - 1;
B = zeros (n, 2);
for i = 1:n
  ## this will be two columns, the first is the difference and
  ## the second the mean of the two elements used for the diff.
  B(i,:) = [A(i+1)-A(i), (A(i+1) + A(i))/2];
endfor</pre> <p>can be turned into the following one-liner: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">B = [diff(A)(:), 0.5*(A(1:end-1)+A(2:end))(:)]</pre> <p>Note the usage of colon indexing to flatten an intermediate result into a column vector. This is a common vectorization trick. </p> </li>
