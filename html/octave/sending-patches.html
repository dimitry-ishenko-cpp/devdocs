When you send your changes, please follow these guidelines to avoid causing extra work for us in studying the patches. </p> <p>If you don’t follow these guidelines, your information might still be useful, but using it will take extra work. Maintaining Octave is a lot of work in the best of circumstances, and we can’t keep up unless you do your best to help. </p> <ul class="itemize mark-bullet"> <li>Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or what improvement they bring about. For a bug fix, just include a copy of the bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug. </li>
<li>Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you have fixed. We need to convince ourselves that the change is right before installing it. Even if it is right, we might have trouble judging it if we don’t have a way to reproduce the problem. </li>
<li>Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people reading the source in the future understand why this change was needed. </li>
<li>Don’t mix together changes made for different reasons. Send them <em class="emph">individually</em>. <p>If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not want to install them both. We might want to install just one. </p> </li>
<li>Use ‘<samp class="samp">diff -c</samp>’ to make your diffs. Diffs without context are hard for us to install reliably. More than that, they make it hard for us to study the diffs to decide whether we want to install them. Unified diff format is better than contextless diffs, but not as easy to read as ‘<samp class="samp">-c</samp>’ format. <p>If you have GNU diff, use ‘<samp class="samp">diff -cp</samp>’, which shows the name of the function that each change occurs in. </p> </li>
<li>Write the change log entries for your changes. <p>Read the <samp class="file">ChangeLog</samp> file to see what sorts of information to put in, and to learn the style that we use. The purpose of the change log is to show people where to find what was changed. So you need to be specific about what functions you changed; in large functions, it’s often helpful to indicate where within the function the change was made. </p> <p>On the other hand, once you have shown people where to find the change, you need not explain its purpose. Thus, if you add a new function, all you need to say about it is that it is new. If you feel that the purpose needs explaining, it probably does—but the explanation will be much more useful if you put it in comments in the code. </p> <p>If you would like your name to appear in the header line for who made the change, send us the header line. </p>
