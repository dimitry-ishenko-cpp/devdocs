<li> Private function A function defined within a private directory of the directory which contains the current function. </li>
<li> Class constructor A function that constructs a user class as defined in chapter <a class="ref" href="object-oriented-programming.html">Object Oriented Programming</a>. </li>

<li> A Function on the Path A function that can be found on the users load-path. There can also be Oct-file, mex-file or m-file versions of this function and the precedence between these versions are in that order. </li>
<li> Built-in function A function that is a part of core Octave such as <code class="code">numel</code>, <code class="code">size</code>, etc. </li>
