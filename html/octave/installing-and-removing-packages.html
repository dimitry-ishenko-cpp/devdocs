It is possible to install several packages at once by writing several package file names after the <code class="code">pkg install</code> command. If a different version of the package is already installed it will be removed prior to installing the new package. This makes it easy to upgrade and downgrade the version of a package, but makes it impossible to have several versions of the same package installed at once. </p> <p>To see which packages are installed type </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg list
-| Package Name  | Version | Installation directory
-| --------------+---------+-----------------------
-|        image *|   1.0.0 | /home/jwe/octave/image-1.0.0</pre> <p>In this case, version 1.0.0 of the <code class="code">image</code> package is installed. The <code class="code">'*'</code> character next to the package name shows that the image package is loaded and ready for use. </p> <p>It is possible to remove a package from the system using the <code class="code">pkg uninstall</code> command like this </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg uninstall image</pre> <p>If the package is removed successfully nothing will be printed in the prompt, but if a warning or error occurred it will be reported. It should be noted that the package file used for installation is not needed for removal, and that only the package name as reported by <code class="code">pkg list</code> should be used when removing a package. It is possible to remove several packages at once by writing several package names after the <code class="code">pkg uninstall</code> command. </p> <p>To minimize the amount of code duplication between packages, it is possible that one package depends on another one. If a package depends on another, it will check if that package is installed during installation. If it is not, an error will be reported and the package will not be installed. This behavior can be disabled by passing the <samp class="option">-nodeps</samp> flag to the <code class="code">pkg install</code> command </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg install -nodeps my_package_with_dependencies.tar.gz</pre> <p>Since the installed package expects its dependencies to be installed it may not function correctly. Because of this it is not recommended to disable dependency checking. </p>  <dl class="first-deftypefn"> <dt class="deftypefn" id="index-pkg-1">

<p>Manage or query packages (groups of add-on functions) for Octave. </p> <p>Packages can be installed globally (i.e., for all users of the system) or locally (i.e., for the current user only). </p> <p>Global packages are installed by default in a system-wide location. This is usually a subdirectory of the folder where Octave itself is installed. Therefore, Octave needs write access to this folder to install global packages, which is usually only available when Octave is run with administrative privileges, such as when run as root (or superuser) on Unix-like systems, or run with elevated privileges ("Run as administrator") on Windows. </p> <p>In contrast, local packages are installed by default in the user’s home directory (or user profile on Windows) and are only available to that specific user. Usually, they can be installed without administrative privileges. </p> <p>When Octave is running with administrative privileges, <code class="code">pkg</code> will install packages to the global package location by default. Otherwise, packages will be installed to the local location by default. The user can override this default installation location with optional arguments (<samp class="option">-local</samp> or <samp class="option">-global</samp>) as described below. The currently used default package installation location can be queried with <code class="code">pkg prefix</code>. </p> <p>For global and local packages, there are separate databases holding the information about the installed packages. If some package is installed globally as well as locally, the local installation takes precedence over ("shadows") the global one. Which (global or local) package installation is used can also be manipulated by using prefixes and/or using the ‘<samp class="samp">local_list</samp>’ input argument. Using these mechanisms, several different releases of the same package can be installed side by side as well (but cannot be loaded simultaneously). </p> <p>Packages might depend on external software and/or other packages. To be able to install such packages, these dependencies should be installed beforehand. A package that depends on other package(s) can still be installed using the <samp class="option">-nodeps</samp> flag. The effects of unsatisfied dependencies on external software—like libraries—depends on the individual package. </p> <p>Packages must be loaded before they can be used. When loading a package, Octave performs the following tasks: </p>
<ol class="enumerate"> <li> If the package depends on other packages (and <code class="code">pkg load</code> is called without the <samp class="option">-nodeps</samp> option), the package is not loaded immediately. Instead, those dependencies are loaded first (recursively if needed). </li>
<li> When all dependencies are satisfied, the package’s subdirectories are added to the search path. </li>
</ol> <p>This load order leads to functions that are provided by dependencies being potentially shadowed by functions of the same name that are provided by top-level packages. </p> <p>Each time, a package is added to the search path, initialization script(s) for the package are automatically executed if they are provided by the package. </p> <p>Depending on the value of <var class="var">command</var> and on the number of requested return arguments, <code class="code">pkg</code> can be used to perform several tasks. Possible values for <var class="var">command</var> are: </p> <dl class="table"> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">install</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Install named packages. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg install image-1.0.0.tar.gz</pre> <p>installs the package found in the file <samp class="file">image-1.0.0.tar.gz</samp>. The file containing the package can be a URL, e.g., </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg install 'http://somewebsite.org/image-1.0.0.tar.gz'</pre> <p>installs the package found in the given URL. This requires an internet connection and the cURL library. </p> <p><em class="emph">Security risk</em>: no verification of the package is performed before the installation. It has the same security issues as manually downloading the package from the given URL and installing it. </p> <p><em class="emph">No support</em>: the GNU Octave community is not responsible for packages installed from foreign sites. For support or for reporting bugs you need to contact the maintainers of the installed package directly (see the <samp class="file">DESCRIPTION</samp> file of the package) </p> <p>The <var class="var">option</var> variable can contain options that affect the manner in which a package is installed. These options can be one or more of </p> <dl class="table"> <dt><code class="code">-nodeps</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The package manager will disable dependency checking. With this option it is possible to install a package even when it depends on another package which is not installed on the system. <strong class="strong">Use this option with care.</strong> </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">-local</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A local installation (package available only to current user) is forced, even if Octave is being run with administrative privileges. </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">-global</code></dt> <dd>
<p>A global installation (package available to all users) is forced, even if Octave is not being run with administrative privileges. The user must have write access to the global package store. </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">-forge</code></dt> <dd>
<p>Install a package directly from the Octave Forge repository. This requires an internet connection and the cURL library. </p> <p><em class="emph">Security risk</em>: no verification of the package is performed before the installation. There are no signatures for packages, or checksums to confirm the correct file was downloaded. It has the same security issues as manually downloading the package from the Octave Forge repository and installing it. </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">-verbose</code></dt> <dd><p>The package manager will print the output of all commands as they are performed. </p></dd> </dl> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">update</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Check installed Octave Forge packages against repository and update any outdated items. Updated packages are installed either globally or locally depending on whether Octave is running with elevated privileges. This requires an internet connection and the cURL library. </p> <p>Options for the install command and the names of individual packages to be checked for updates may be specified as a list following the update command. If the <samp class="option">-local</samp> or <samp class="option">-global</samp> option is specified, <code class="code">pkg update</code> limits the update check to the local or global installed packages, and installs updates in that same context. For example, </p> <p>Update all packages: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg update</pre> <p>Update all local packages: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg update -local</pre> <p>Update certain packages, ignore dependencies, max verbosity: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg update -verbose -nodeps image signal geometry</pre> <p>Updates for multiple packages are sorted alphabetically and not checked for dependencies affected by installation order. If dependency order related <code class="code">pkg update</code> failure occurs, use <code class="code">pkg update -nodeps</code> to ignore dependencies, or <code class="code">pkg install -forge &lt;package_name&gt;</code> to update individual packages manually. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">uninstall</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Uninstall named packages. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg uninstall image</pre> <p>removes the <code class="code">image</code> package from the system. If another installed package depends on the <code class="code">image</code> package an error will be issued. The package can be uninstalled anyway by using the <samp class="option">-nodeps</samp> option. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">load</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Add named packages to the path. After loading a package it is possible to use the functions provided by the package. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg load image</pre> <p>adds the <code class="code">image</code> package to the path. </p> <p>Note: When loading a package, <code class="code">pkg</code> will automatically try to load any unloaded dependencies as well, unless the <samp class="option">-nodeps</samp> flag has been specified. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg load signal</pre> <p>adds the <code class="code">signal</code> package and also tries to load its dependency: the <code class="code">control</code> package. Be aware that the functionality of package(s) loaded will probably be impacted by use of the <samp class="option">-nodeps</samp> flag. Even if necessary dependencies are loaded later, the functionality of top-level packages can still be affected because the optimal loading order may not have been followed. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">unload</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Remove named packages from the path. After unloading a package it is no longer possible to use the functions provided by the package. Trying to unload a package that other loaded packages still depend on will result in an error; no packages will be unloaded in this case. A package can be forcibly removed with the <samp class="option">-nodeps</samp> flag, but be aware that the functionality of dependent packages will likely be affected. As when loading packages, reloading dependencies after having unloaded them with the <samp class="option">-nodeps</samp> flag may not restore all functionality of the dependent packages as the required loading order may be incorrect. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">list</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Show the list of currently installed packages. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg list</pre> <p>will produce a short report with the package name, version, and installation directory for each installed package. Supply a package name to limit reporting to a particular package. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg list image</pre> <p>If a single return argument is requested then <code class="code">pkg</code> returns a cell array where each element is a structure with information on a single package. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">installed_packages = pkg ("list")</pre> <p>If two output arguments are requested <code class="code">pkg</code> splits the list of installed packages into those which were installed by the current user, and those which were installed by the system administrator. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[user_packages, system_packages] = pkg ("list")</pre> <p>The <code class="code">"-forge"</code> option lists packages available at the Octave Forge repository. This requires an internet connection and the cURL library. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">oct_forge_pkgs = pkg ("list", "-forge")</pre> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">describe</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Show a short description of installed packages. With the option <code class="code">"-verbose"</code> also list functions provided by the package. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg describe -verbose</pre> <p>will describe all installed packages and the functions they provide. Display can be limited to a set of packages: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">## describe control and signal packages
pkg describe control signal</pre> <p>If one output is requested a cell of structure containing the description and list of functions of each package is returned as output rather than printed on screen: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">desc = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")</pre> <p>If any of the requested packages is not installed, <code class="code">pkg</code> returns an error, unless a second output is requested: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">[desc, flag] = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")</pre> <p><var class="var">flag</var> will take one of the values <code class="code">"Not installed"</code>, <code class="code">"Loaded"</code>, or <code class="code">"Not loaded"</code> for each of the named packages. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">prefix</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Set the installation prefix directory. For example, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages</pre> <p>sets the installation prefix to <samp class="file">~/my_octave_packages</samp>. Packages will be installed in this directory. </p> <p>It is possible to get the current installation prefix by requesting an output argument. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pfx = pkg ("prefix")</pre> <p>The location in which to install the architecture dependent files can be independently specified with an addition argument. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages ~/my_arch_dep_pkgs</pre> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">local_list</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Set the file in which to look for information on locally installed packages. Locally installed packages are those that are available only to the current user. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg local_list ~/.octave_packages</pre> <p>It is possible to get the current value of local_list with the following </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg local_list</pre> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">global_list</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Set the file in which to look for information on globally installed packages. Globally installed packages are those that are available to all users. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg global_list /usr/share/octave/octave_packages</pre> <p>It is possible to get the current value of global_list with the following </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg global_list</pre> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">build</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Build a binary form of a package or packages. The binary file produced will itself be an Octave package that can be installed normally with <code class="code">pkg</code>. The form of the command to build a binary package is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg build builddir image-1.0.0.tar.gz ...</pre> <p>where <code class="code">builddir</code> is the name of a directory where the temporary installation will be produced and the binary packages will be found. The options <samp class="option">-verbose</samp> and <samp class="option">-nodeps</samp> are respected, while all other options are ignored. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">rebuild</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Rebuild the package database from the installed directories. This can be used in cases where the package database has been corrupted. </p> </dd> <dt>‘<samp class="samp">test</samp>’</dt> <dd>
<p>Perform the built-in self tests contained in all functions provided by the named packages. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">pkg test image</pre> </dd> </dl> <p><strong class="strong">See also:</strong> <a class="ref" href="system-information.html#XREFver">ver</a>, <a class="ref" href="getting-help.html#XREFnews">news</a>. </p>
