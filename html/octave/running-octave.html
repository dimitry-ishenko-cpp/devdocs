You can also typically find Octave in the "Start Menu" or equivalent of your computer. You can also type <code class="code">octave</code> in a command shell; as long as you have Octave in your path, it will start. </p> <p>If you start Octave with the GUI, the central window is the Octave’s own command-line interface (also called a REPL by other programming languages for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop). In this window Octave displays an initial message and then a prompt like <code class="code">&gt;&gt; </code> or <code class="code">octave:1&gt; </code> indicating it is ready to accept input. If you have chosen the traditional command-line interface then the command prompt appears in the same window that was running a command shell. In either case, you can immediately begin typing Octave commands. </p> <p>If you get into trouble, you can usually interrupt Octave by typing <kbd class="kbd">Control-C</kbd>. Doing this will normally return you to Octave’s prompt. </p>   <p>To exit Octave, type <kbd class="kbd">quit</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd">exit</kbd> at the Octave prompt. </p> <p>On systems that support job control, you can suspend Octave by sending it a <code class="code">SIGTSTP</code> signal, usually by typing <kbd class="kbd">Ctrl-z</kbd>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
