The commands for doing this vary by system. Similarly, the names of pre-compiled packages vary by system and do not always match exactly the names listed in <a class="ref" href="build-tools.html">Build Tools</a> and <a class="ref" href="external-packages.html">External Packages</a>. </p> <p>You will usually need the development version of an external dependency so that you get the libraries and header files for building software, not just for running already compiled programs. These packages typically have names that end with the suffix <code class="code">-dev</code> or <code class="code">-devel</code>. </p> <p>On systems with <code class="code">apt-get</code> (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.), you may be able to install most of the tools and external packages using a command similar to </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">apt-get build-dep octave</pre> <p>The specific package name may be <code class="code">octave3.2</code> or <code class="code">octave3.4</code>. The set of required tools and external dependencies does not change frequently, so it is not important that the version match exactly, but you should use the most recent one available. </p> <p>On systems with <code class="code">yum</code> (Fedora, Red Hat, etc.), you may be able to install most of the tools and external packages using a command similar to </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">yum-builddep octave</pre> <p>The <code class="code">yum-builddep</code> utility is part of the <code class="code">yum-utils</code> package. </p> <p>For either type of system, the package name may include a version number. The set of required tools and external dependencies does not change frequently, so it is not important that the version exactly match the version you are installing, but you should use the most recent one available. </p> </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Next: <a href="build-tools.html">Build Tools</a>, Up: <a href="build-dependencies.html">Build Dependencies</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="concept-index.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
