<div class="subsection" id="Input-Conversion-Syntax">   <h1 class="subsection">14.2.12 Input Conversion Syntax</h1> <p>A <code>scanf</code> template string is a string that contains ordinary multibyte characters interspersed with conversion specifications that start with ‘<samp>%</samp>’. </p> <p>Any whitespace character in the template causes any number of whitespace characters in the input stream to be read and discarded. The whitespace characters that are matched need not be exactly the same whitespace characters that appear in the template string. For example, write ‘<samp> , </samp>’ in the template to recognize a comma with optional whitespace before and after. </p> <p>Other characters in the template string that are not part of conversion specifications must match characters in the input stream exactly; if this is not the case, a matching failure occurs. </p> <p>The conversion specifications in a <code>scanf</code> template string have the general form: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">% flags width type conversion</pre> <p>In more detail, an input conversion specification consists of an initial ‘<samp>%</samp>’ character followed in sequence by: </p> <ul> <li> An optional <em>flag character</em> ‘<samp>*</samp>’, which says to ignore the text read for this specification. When <code>scanf</code> finds a conversion specification that uses this flag, it reads input as directed by the rest of the conversion specification, but it discards this input, does not return any value, and does not increment the count of successful assignments.  </li>
<li> An optional decimal integer that specifies the <em>maximum field width</em>. Reading of characters from the input stream stops either when this maximum is reached or when a non-matching character is found, whichever happens first. Most conversions discard initial whitespace characters, and these discarded characters don’t count towards the maximum field width. Conversions that do not discard initial whitespace are explicitly documented.  </li>
<li> An optional type modifier character. This character is ignored by Octave’s <code>scanf</code> function, but is recognized to provide compatibility with the C language <code>scanf</code>. </li>
<li> A character that specifies the conversion to be applied. </li>
</ul> <p>The exact options that are permitted and how they are interpreted vary between the different conversion specifiers. See the descriptions of the individual conversions in <a href="table-of-input-conversions.html">Table of Input Conversions</a> for information about the particular options that they allow. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
