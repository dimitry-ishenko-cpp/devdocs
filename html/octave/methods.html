An exception to this rule is described at the end of this subsection. Those <code class="code">methods</code> blocks can have additional attributes specifying the access rights or whether the methods are static, i.e., methods that can be called without creating an object of that class. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">classdef some_class

endclassdef</pre> <p>The constructor of the class is declared in the <code class="code">methods</code> block and must have the same name as the class and exactly one output argument which is an object of its class. </p> <p>It is also possible to overload built-in or inherited methods, like the <code class="code">disp</code> function in the example above to tell Octave how objects of <code class="code">some_class</code> should be displayed (see <a class="pxref" href="class-methods.html">Class Methods</a>). </p> <p>In general, the first argument in a method definition is always the object that it is called from. Class methods can either be called by passing the object as the first argument to that method or by calling the object followed by a dot ("<code class="code">.</code>") and the method’s name with subsequent arguments: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; obj = some_class ();
New instance created.
&gt;&gt; disp (obj);   # both are
&gt;&gt; obj.disp ();  # equal</pre> <p>In <code class="code">some_class</code>, the method <code class="code">func</code> is defined within a <code class="code">methods</code> block setting the <code class="code">Access</code> attribute to <var class="var">mode</var>, which is one of: </p> <dl class="table"> <dt><code class="code">public</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The methods can be accessed from everywhere. </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">private</code></dt> <dd>
<p>The methods can only be accessed from other class methods. Subclasses of that class cannot access them. </p> </dd> <dt><code class="code">protected</code></dt> <dd><p>The methods can only be accessed from other class methods and from subclasses of that class. </p></dd> </dl> <p>The default access for methods is <code class="code">public</code>. </p> <p>Finally, the method <code class="code">circumference</code> is defined in a static <code class="code">methods</code> block and can be used without creating an object of <code class="code">some_class</code>. This is useful for methods, that do not depend on any class properties. The class name and the name of the static method, separated by a dot ("<code class="code">.</code>"), call this static method. In contrast to non-static methods, the object is not passed as first argument even if called using an object of <code class="code">some_class</code>. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">&gt;&gt; some_class.circumference (3)
⇒ ans =  18.850
&gt;&gt; obj = some_class ();
New instance created.
&gt;&gt; obj.circumference (3)
⇒ ans =  18.850</pre> <p>Additionally, class methods can be defined as functions in a folder of the same name as the class prepended with the ‘<samp class="samp">@</samp>’ symbol (see <a class="pxref" href="creating-a-class.html">Creating a Class</a>). The main <code class="code">classdef</code> file has to be stored in this class folder as well. </p> </div>  <div class="nav-panel"> <p> Next: <a href="inheritance.html">Inheritance</a>, Previous: <a href="properties.html">Properties</a>, Up: <a href="classdef-classes.html"><code class="code">classdef</code> Classes</a> [<a href="index.html#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="concept-index.html" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
