See <a class="xref" href="trouble.html">Known Causes of Trouble</a>. If it isn’t known, then you should report the problem. </p> <p>Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem, or it may not. In any case, the principal function of a bug report is to help the entire community by making the next version of Octave work better.
