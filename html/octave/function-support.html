Passed to other functions, these matrices will in general trigger an implicit conversion. (Of course, user-defined dynamically linked functions may also work with diagonal or permutation matrices). </p> <ul class="mini-toc"> <li><a href="diagonal-matrix-functions.html" accesskey="1">Diagonal Matrix Functions</a></li> <li><a href="permutation-matrix-functions.html" accesskey="2">Permutation Matrix Functions</a></li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
