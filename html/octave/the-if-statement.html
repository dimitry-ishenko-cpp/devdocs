<div class="section" id="The-if-Statement">   <h1 class="section">10.1 The if Statement</h1>     <p>The <code>if</code> statement is Octave’s decision-making statement. There are three basic forms of an <code>if</code> statement. In its simplest form, it looks like this: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">if (condition)
  then-body
endif</pre> <p><var>condition</var> is an expression that controls what the rest of the statement will do. The <var>then-body</var> is executed only if <var>condition</var> is true. </p> <p>The condition in an <code>if</code> statement is considered true if its value is nonzero, and false if its value is zero. If the value of the conditional expression in an <code>if</code> statement is a vector or a matrix, it is considered true only if it is non-empty and <em>all</em> of the elements are nonzero. The conceptually equivalent code when <var>condition</var> is a matrix is shown below. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">if (matrix) ≡ if (all (matrix(:)))</pre> <p>The second form of an if statement looks like this: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">if (condition)
  then-body
else
  else-body
endif</pre> <p>If <var>condition</var> is true, <var>then-body</var> is executed; otherwise, <var>else-body</var> is executed. </p> <p>Here is an example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">if (rem (x, 2) == 0)
  printf ("x is even\n");
else
  printf ("x is odd\n");
endif</pre> <p>In this example, if the expression <code>rem (x, 2) == 0</code> is true (that is, the value of <code>x</code> is divisible by 2), then the first <code>printf</code> statement is evaluated, otherwise the second <code>printf</code> statement is evaluated. </p> <p>The third and most general form of the <code>if</code> statement allows multiple decisions to be combined in a single statement. It looks like this: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">if (condition)
  then-body
elseif (condition)
  elseif-body
else
  else-body
endif</pre> <p>Any number of <code>elseif</code> clauses may appear. Each condition is tested in turn, and if one is found to be true, its corresponding <var>body</var> is executed. If none of the conditions are true and the <code>else</code> clause is present, its body is executed. Only one <code>else</code> clause may appear, and it must be the last part of the statement. </p> <p>In the following example, if the first condition is true (that is, the value of <code>x</code> is divisible by 2), then the first <code>printf</code> statement is executed. If it is false, then the second condition is tested, and if it is true (that is, the value of <code>x</code> is divisible by 3), then the second <code>printf</code> statement is executed. Otherwise, the third <code>printf</code> statement is performed. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">if (rem (x, 2) == 0)
  printf ("x is even\n");
elseif (rem (x, 3) == 0)
  printf ("x is odd and divisible by 3\n");
else
  printf ("x is odd\n");
endif</pre> <p>Note that the <code>elseif</code> keyword must not be spelled <code>else if</code>, as is allowed in Fortran. If it is, the space between the <code>else</code> and <code>if</code> will tell Octave to treat this as a new <code>if</code> statement within another <code>if</code> statement’s <code>else</code> clause. For example, if you write </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">if (c1)
  body-1
else if (c2)
  body-2
endif</pre> <p>Octave will expect additional input to complete the first <code>if</code> statement. If you are using Octave interactively, it will continue to prompt you for additional input. If Octave is reading this input from a file, it may complain about missing or mismatched <code>end</code> statements, or, if you have not used the more specific <code>end</code> statements (<code>endif</code>, <code>endfor</code>, etc.), it may simply produce incorrect results, without producing any warning messages. </p> <p>It is much easier to see the error if we rewrite the statements above like this, </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">if (c1)
  body-1
else
  if (c2)
    body-2
  endif</pre> <p>using the indentation to show how Octave groups the statements. See <a href="functions-and-scripts.html">Functions and Scripts</a>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
