Octave currently does not eliminate common subexpressions. Also, certain internal computation results are cached for variables. For instance, if a matrix variable is used multiple times as an index, checking the indices (and internal conversion to integers) is only done once. </li>
<li>Be aware of lazy copies (copy-on-write).    When a copy of an object is created, the data is not immediately copied, but rather shared. The actual copying is postponed until the copied data needs to be modified. For example: <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
b = a; # no copying done here
b(1) = 1; # copying done here</pre> <p>Lazy copying applies to whole Octave objects such as matrices, cells, struct, and also individual cell or struct elements (not array elements). </p> <p>Additionally, index expressions also use lazy copying when Octave can determine that the indexed portion is contiguous in memory. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
b = a(:,10:100);  # no copying done here
b = a(10:100,:);  # copying done here</pre> <p>This applies to arrays (matrices), cell arrays, and structs indexed using ‘<samp class="samp">()</samp>’. Index expressions generating comma-separated lists can also benefit from shallow copying in some cases. In particular, when <var class="var">a</var> is a struct array, expressions like <code class="code">{a.x}, {a(:,2).x}</code> will use lazy copying, so that data can be shared between a struct array and a cell array. </p> <p>Most indexing expressions do not live longer than their parent objects. In rare cases, however, a lazily copied slice outlasts its parent, in which case it becomes orphaned, still occupying unnecessarily more memory than needed. To provide a remedy working in most real cases, Octave checks for orphaned lazy slices at certain situations, when a value is stored into a "permanent" location, such as a named variable or cell or struct element, and possibly economizes them. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
b = a(:,10:100);  # lazy slice
a = []; # the original "a" array is still allocated
c{1} = b; # b is reallocated at this point</pre> </li>
<li>Avoid deep recursion. Function calls to m-file functions carry a relatively significant overhead, so rewriting a recursion as a loop often helps. Also, note that the maximum level of recursion is limited. </li>
<li>Avoid resizing matrices unnecessarily. When building a single result matrix from a series of calculations, set the size of the result matrix first, then insert values into it. Write <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">result = zeros (big_n, big_m)
for i = over:and_over
  ridx = ...
  cidx = ...
  result(ridx, cidx) = new_value ();
endfor</pre> <p>instead of </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">result = [];
for i = ever:and_ever
  result = [ result, new_value() ];
endfor</pre> <p>Sometimes the number of items can not be computed in advance, and stack-like operations are needed. When elements are being repeatedly inserted or removed from the end of an array, Octave detects it as stack usage and attempts to use a smarter memory management strategy by pre-allocating the array in bigger chunks. This strategy is also applied to cell and struct arrays. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">a = [];
while (condition)
  ...
  a(end+1) = value; # "push" operation
  ...
  a(end) = []; # "pop" operation
  ...
endwhile</pre> </li>
<li>Avoid calling <code class="code">eval</code> or <code class="code">feval</code> excessively. Parsing input or looking up the name of a function in the symbol table are relatively expensive operations. <p>If you are using <code class="code">eval</code> merely as an exception handling mechanism, and not because you need to execute some arbitrary text, use the <code class="code">try</code> statement instead. See <a class="xref" href="the-try-statement.html">The try Statement</a>. </p> </li>
<li>Use <code class="code">ignore_function_time_stamp</code> when appropriate. If you are calling lots of functions, and none of them will need to change during your run, set the variable <code class="code">ignore_function_time_stamp</code> to <code class="code">"all"</code>. This will stop Octave from checking the time stamp of a function file to see if it has been updated while the program is being run. </li>
