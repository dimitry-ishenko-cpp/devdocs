It is typically used for such problems as solving linear and nonlinear equations, numerical linear algebra, statistical analysis, and for performing other numerical experiments. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language for automated data processing. </p> <p>The current version of Octave executes in a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI hosts an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which includes a code editor with syntax highlighting, built-in debugger, documentation browser, as well as the interpreter for the language itself. A command-line interface for Octave is also available. </p> <p>GNU Octave is freely redistributable software.
