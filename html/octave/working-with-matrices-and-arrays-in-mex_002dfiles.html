<div class="subsection" id="Working-with-Matrices-and-Arrays-in-Mex_002dFiles">   <h1 class="subsection">A.2.2 Working with Matrices and Arrays in Mex-Files</h1> <p>The basic mex type of all variables is <code>mxArray</code>. Any object, such as a matrix, cell array, or structure, is stored in this basic type. <code>mxArray</code> serves essentially the same purpose as the <code>octave_value</code> class in oct-files in that it acts as a container for all the more specialized types. </p> <p>The <code>mxArray</code> structure contains at a minimum, the name of the variable it represents, its dimensions, its type, and whether the variable is real or complex. It can also contain a number of additional fields depending on the type of the <code>mxArray</code>. There are a number of functions to create <code>mxArray</code> structures, including <code>mxCreateDoubleMatrix</code>, <code>mxCreateCellArray</code>, <code>mxCreateSparse</code>, and the generic <code>mxCreateNumericArray</code>. </p> <p>The basic function to access the data in an array is <code>mxGetPr</code>. Because the mex interface assumes that real and imaginary parts of a complex array are stored separately, there is an equivalent function <code>mxGetPi</code> that gets the imaginary part. Both of these functions are only for use with double precision matrices. The generic functions <code>mxGetData</code> and <code>mxGetImagData</code> perform the same operation for all matrix types. For example: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">mxArray *m;
mwSize *dims;
UINT32_T *pr;

dims = (mwSize *) mxMalloc (2 * sizeof (mwSize));
dims[0] = 2; dims[1] = 2;
m = mxCreateNumericArray (2, dims, mxUINT32_CLASS, mxREAL);
pr = (UINT32_T *) mxGetData (m);</pre> <p>There are also the functions <code>mxSetPr</code>, etc., that perform the inverse, and set the data of an array to use the block of memory pointed to by the argument of <code>mxSetPr</code>. </p> <p>Note the type <code>mwSize</code> used above, and also <code>mwIndex</code>, are defined as the native precision of the indexing in Octave on the platform on which the mex-file is built. This allows both 32- and 64-bit platforms to support mex-files. <code>mwSize</code> is used to define array dimensions and the maximum number or elements, while <code>mwIndex</code> is used to define indexing into arrays. </p> <p>An example that demonstrates how to work with arbitrary real or complex double precision arrays is given by the file <samp>mypow2.c</samp> shown below. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">#include "mex.h"

void
mexFunction (int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[],
             int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[])
{
  mwSize n;
  mwIndex i;
  double *vri, *vro;

  if (nrhs != 1 || ! mxIsDouble (prhs[0]))
    mexErrMsgTxt ("ARG1 must be a double matrix");

  n = mxGetNumberOfElements (prhs[0]);
  plhs[0] = mxCreateNumericArray (mxGetNumberOfDimensions (prhs[0]),
                                  mxGetDimensions (prhs[0]),
                                  mxGetClassID (prhs[0]),
                                  mxIsComplex (prhs[0]));
  vri = mxGetPr (prhs[0]);
  vro = mxGetPr (plhs[0]);

  if (mxIsComplex (prhs[0]))
    {
      double *vii, *vio;
      vii = mxGetPi (prhs[0]);
      vio = mxGetPi (plhs[0]);

      for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        {
          vro[i] = vri[i] * vri[i] - vii[i] * vii[i];
          vio[i] = 2 * vri[i] * vii[i];
        }
    }
  else
    {
      for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        vro[i] = vri[i] * vri[i];
    }
}</pre> <p>An example of its use is </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">b = randn (4,1) + 1i * randn (4,1);
all (b.^2 == mypow2 (b))
⇒ 1</pre> <p>The example above uses the functions <code>mxGetDimensions</code>, <code>mxGetNumberOfElements</code>, and <code>mxGetNumberOfDimensions</code> to work with the dimensions of multi-dimensional arrays. The functions <code>mxGetM</code>, and <code>mxGetN</code> are also available to find the number of rows and columns in a 2-D matrix (MxN matrix). </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
