As with the condition in an <code class="code">if</code> statement, the condition in a <code class="code">do-until</code> statement is considered true if its value is nonzero, and false if its value is zero. If the value of the conditional expression in a <code class="code">do-until</code> statement is a vector or a matrix, it is considered true only if it is non-empty and <em class="emph">all</em> of the elements are nonzero. </p> <p>Octave’s <code class="code">do-until</code> statement looks like this: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">do
  body
until (condition)</pre> <p>Here <var class="var">body</var> is a statement or list of statements that we call the <em class="dfn">body</em> of the loop, and <var class="var">condition</var> is an expression that controls how long the loop keeps running. </p> <p>This example creates a variable <code class="code">fib</code> that contains the first ten elements of the Fibonacci sequence. </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">fib = ones (1, 10);
i = 2;
do
  i++;
  fib (i) = fib (i-1) + fib (i-2);
until (i == 10)</pre> <p>A newline is not required between the <code class="code">do</code> keyword and the body; but using one makes the program clearer unless the body is very simple. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
