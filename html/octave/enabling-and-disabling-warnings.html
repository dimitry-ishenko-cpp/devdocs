<div class="subsection" id="Enabling-and-Disabling-Warnings">   <h1 class="subsection">12.2.2 Enabling and Disabling Warnings</h1> <p>The <code>warning</code> function also allows you to control which warnings are actually printed to the screen. If the <code>warning</code> function is called with a string argument that is either <code>"on"</code> or <code>"off"</code> all warnings will be enabled or disabled. </p> <p>It is also possible to enable and disable individual warnings through their string identifications. The following code will issue a warning </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">warning ("example:non-negative-variable",
         "'a' must be non-negative.  Setting 'a' to zero.");</pre> <p>while the following won’t issue a warning </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">warning ("off", "example:non-negative-variable");
warning ("example:non-negative-variable",
         "'a' must be non-negative.  Setting 'a' to zero.");</pre> </div><div class="_attribution">
