For <small class="sc">MATLAB</small> compatibility ‘<samp class="samp">%%%</samp>’ is treated the same way as ‘<samp class="samp">%%</samp>’. </p> <p>The lines following ‘<samp class="samp">##</samp>’ or ‘<samp class="samp">%%</samp>’ start with one of either ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ or ‘<samp class="samp">%</samp>’ followed by at least one space. These lines are interpreted as section. A section ends at the first line not starting with ‘<samp class="samp">#</samp>’ or ‘<samp class="samp">%</samp>’, or when the end of the document is reached. </p> <p>A section starting in the first line of the document, followed by another start of a section that might be empty, is interpreted as a document title and introduction text. </p> <p>See the example below for clarity: </p> <pre class="example" data-language="matlab">%% Headline title
