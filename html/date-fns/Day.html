      <h1>Day</h1>
      <p>Day type</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p><p>The day of the week type alias (<code>0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6</code>). Unlike the date
(the number of days since the beginningof the month), which starts with 1
and is dynamic (can go up to 28, 30, or 31), the day starts with 0 and static
(always ends at 6). Look at it as an index in an array where Sunday is
the first element, and Saturday is the last.</p>
