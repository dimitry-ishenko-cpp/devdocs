<h1>Issues Regarding DNS and Apache HTTP Server</h1>  <p>This page could be summarized with the statement: don't configure Apache HTTP Server in such a way that it relies on DNS resolution for parsing of the configuration files. If httpd requires DNS resolution to parse the configuration files then your server may be subject to reliability problems (ie. it might not start up), or denial and theft of service attacks (including virtual hosts able to steal hits from other virtual hosts).</p>     <h2 id="example">A Simple Example</h2> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config"># This is a misconfiguration example, do not use on your server
&lt;VirtualHost www.example.dom&gt;
  ServerAdmin webgirl@example.dom
  DocumentRoot "/www/example"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre> <p>In order for the server to function properly, it absolutely needs to have two pieces of information about each virtual host: the <code class="directive"><a href="mod/core.html#servername">ServerName</a></code> and at least one IP address that the server will bind and respond to. The above example does not include the IP address, so httpd must use DNS to find the address of <code>www.example.dom</code>. If for some reason DNS is not available at the time your server is parsing its config file, then this virtual host <strong>will not be configured</strong>. It won't be able to respond to any hits to this virtual host.</p> <p>Suppose that <code>www.example.dom</code> has address 192.0.2.1. Then consider this configuration snippet:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config"># This is a misconfiguration example, do not use on your server
&lt;VirtualHost 192.0.2.1&gt;
  ServerAdmin webgirl@example.dom
  DocumentRoot "/www/example"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre> <p>This time httpd needs to use reverse DNS to find the <code>ServerName</code> for this virtualhost. If that reverse lookup fails then it will partially disable the virtualhost. If the virtual host is name-based then it will effectively be totally disabled, but if it is IP-based then it will mostly work. However, if httpd should ever have to generate a full URL for the server which includes the server name (such as when a Redirect is issued), then it will fail to generate a valid URL.</p> <p>Here is a snippet that avoids both of these problems:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">&lt;VirtualHost 192.0.2.1&gt;
  ServerName www.example.dom
  ServerAdmin webgirl@example.dom
  DocumentRoot "/www/example"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>   <h2 id="denial">Denial of Service</h2> <p>Consider this configuration snippet:</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">&lt;VirtualHost www.example1.dom&gt;
  ServerAdmin webgirl@example1.dom
  DocumentRoot "/www/example1"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&lt;VirtualHost www.example2.dom&gt;
  ServerAdmin webguy@example2.dom
  DocumentRoot "/www/example2"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre> <p>Suppose that you've assigned 192.0.2.1 to <code>www.example1.dom</code> and 192.0.2.2 to <code>www.example2.dom</code>. Furthermore, suppose that <code>example1.dom</code> has control of their own DNS. With this config you have put <code>example1.dom</code> into a position where they can steal all traffic destined to <code>example2.dom</code>. To do so, all they have to do is set <code>www.example1.dom</code> to 192.0.2.2. Since they control their own DNS you can't stop them from pointing the <code>www.example1.dom</code> record wherever they wish.</p> <p>Requests coming in to 192.0.2.2 (including all those where users typed in URLs of the form <code>http://www.example2.dom/whatever</code>) will all be served by the <code>example1.dom</code> virtual host. To better understand why this happens requires a more in-depth discussion of how httpd matches up incoming requests with the virtual host that will serve it. A rough document describing this <a href="vhosts/details.html">is available</a>.</p>   <h2 id="main">The "main server" Address</h2> <p><a href="vhosts/name-based.html">Name-based virtual host support</a> requires httpd to know the IP address(es) of the host that <code class="program"><a href="programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> is running on. To get this address it uses either the global <code class="directive"><a href="mod/core.html#servername">ServerName</a></code> (if present) or calls the C function <code>gethostname</code> (which should return the same as typing "hostname" at the command prompt). Then it performs a DNS lookup on this address. At present there is no way to avoid this lookup.</p> <p>If you fear that this lookup might fail because your DNS server is down then you can insert the hostname in <code>/etc/hosts</code> (where you probably already have it so that the machine can boot properly). Then ensure that your machine is configured to use <code>/etc/hosts</code> in the event that DNS fails. Depending on what OS you are using this might be accomplished by editing <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, or maybe <code>/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>.</p> <p>If your server doesn't have to perform DNS for any other reason then you might be able to get away with running httpd with the <code>HOSTRESORDER</code> environment variable set to "local". This all depends on what OS and resolver libraries you are using. It also affects CGIs unless you use <code class="module"><a href="mod/mod_env.html">mod_env</a></code> to control the environment. It's best to consult the man pages or FAQs for your OS.</p>   <h2 id="tips">Tips to Avoid These Problems</h2> <ul> <li> use IP addresses in <code class="directive"><a href="mod/core.html#virtualhost">VirtualHost</a></code> </li> <li> use IP addresses in <code class="directive"><a href="mod/mpm_common.html#listen">Listen</a></code> </li> <li> ensure all virtual hosts have an explicit <code class="directive"><a href="mod/core.html#servername">ServerName</a></code> </li> <li>create a <code>&lt;VirtualHost _default_:*&gt;</code> server that has no pages to serve</li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
