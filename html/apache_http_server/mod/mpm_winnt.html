</table> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>This Multi-Processing Module (MPM) is the default for the Windows NT operating systems. It uses a single control process which launches a single child process which in turn creates threads to handle requests</p> <p>Capacity is configured using the <code class="directive"><a href="mpm_common.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</a></code> directive, which sets the maximum number of concurrent client connections.</p> <p>By default, this MPM uses advanced Windows APIs for accepting new client connections. In some configurations, third-party products may interfere with this implementation, with the following messages written to the web server log:</p> <div class="example"><pre>Child: Encountered too many AcceptEx faults accepting client connections.
winnt_mpm: falling back to 'AcceptFilter none'.</pre></div> <p>The MPM falls back to a safer implementation, but some client requests were not processed correctly. In order to avoid this error, use <code class="directive"><a href="core.html#acceptfilter">AcceptFilter</a></code> with accept filter <code>none</code>.</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">AcceptFilter http none
AcceptFilter https none</pre> <p><em>In Apache httpd 2.0 and 2.2, <code class="directive">Win32DisableAcceptEx</code> was used for this purpose.</em></p> <p>The WinNT MPM differs from the Unix MPMs such as worker and event in several areas:</p> <ul> <li>When a child process is exiting due to shutdown, restart, or <code class="directive"><a href="mpm_common.html#maxconnectionsperchild">MaxConnectionsPerChild</a></code>, active requests in the exiting process have <code class="directive"><a href="core.html#timeout">TimeOut</a></code> seconds to finish before processing is aborted. Alternate types of restart and shutdown are not implemented.</li> <li>New child processes read the configuration files instead of inheriting the configuration from the parent. The behavior will be the same as on Unix if the child process is created at startup or restart, but if a child process is created because the prior one crashed or reached <code class="directive"><a href="mpm_common.html#maxconnectionsperchild">MaxConnectionsPerChild</a></code>, any pending changes to the configuration will become active in the child at that point, and the parent and child will be using a different configuration. If planned configuration changes have been partially implemented and the current configuration cannot be parsed, the replacement child process cannot start up and the server will halt. Because of this behavior, configuration files should not be changed until the time of a server restart.</li> <li>The <code>monitor</code> and <code>fatal_exception</code> hooks are not currently implemented.</li> <li>
<code class="directive">AcceptFilter</code> is implemented in the MPM and has a different type of control over handling of new connections. (Refer to the <code class="directive"><a href="core.html#acceptfilter">AcceptFilter</a></code> documentation for details.)</li> </ul><div class="_attribution">
