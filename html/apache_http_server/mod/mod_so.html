</table> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>On selected operating systems this module can be used to load modules into Apache HTTP Server at runtime via the <a href="../dso.html">Dynamic Shared Object</a> (DSO) mechanism, rather than requiring a recompilation.</p> <p>On Unix, the loaded code typically comes from shared object files (usually with <code>.so</code> extension), on Windows this may either be the <code>.so</code> or <code>.dll</code> extension.</p> <div class="warning">
<p><strong>Warning</strong></p> <p>Modules built for one major version of the Apache HTTP Server will generally not work on another. (e.g. 1.3 vs. 2.0, or 2.0 vs. 2.2) There are usually API changes between one major version and another that require that modules be modified to work with the new version.</p> </div>     <h2 id="windows">Creating Loadable Modules for Windows</h2> <div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong></p> <p>On Windows, where loadable files typically have a file extension of <code>.dll</code>, Apache httpd modules are called <code>mod_whatever.so</code>, just as they are on other platforms. However, you may encounter third-party modules, such as PHP for example, that continue to use the <code>.dll</code> convention.</p> <p>While <code>mod_so</code> still loads modules with <code>ApacheModuleFoo.dll</code> names, the new naming convention is preferred; if you are converting your loadable module for 2.0, please fix the name to this 2.0 convention.</p>
</div> <p>The Apache httpd module API is unchanged between the Unix and Windows versions. Many modules will run on Windows with no or little change from Unix, although others rely on aspects of the Unix architecture which are not present in Windows, and will not work.</p> <p>When a module does work, it can be added to the server in one of two ways. As with Unix, it can be compiled into the server. Because Apache httpd for Windows does not have the <code>Configure</code> program of Apache httpd for Unix, the module's source file must be added to the ApacheCore project file, and its symbols must be added to the <code>os\win32\modules.c</code> file.</p> <p>The second way is to compile the module as a DLL, a shared library that can be loaded into the server at runtime, using the <code class="directive">LoadModule</code> directive. These module DLLs can be distributed and run on any Apache httpd for Windows installation, without recompilation of the server.</p> <p>To create a module DLL, a small change is necessary to the module's source file: The module record must be exported from the DLL (which will be created later; see below). To do this, add the <code>AP_MODULE_DECLARE_DATA</code> (defined in the Apache httpd header files) to your module's module record definition. For example, if your module has:</p> <div class="example"><pre>module foo_module;</pre></div> <p>Replace the above with:</p> <div class="example"><pre>module AP_MODULE_DECLARE_DATA foo_module;</pre></div> <p>Note that this will only be activated on Windows, so the module can continue to be used, unchanged, with Unix if needed. Also, if you are familiar with <code>.DEF</code> files, you can export the module record with that method instead.</p> <p>Now, create a DLL containing your module. You will need to link this against the libhttpd.lib export library that is created when the libhttpd.dll shared library is compiled. You may also have to change the compiler settings to ensure that the Apache httpd header files are correctly located. You can find this library in your server root's modules directory. It is best to grab an existing module .dsp file from the tree to assure the build environment is configured correctly, or alternately compare the compiler and link options to your .dsp.</p> <p>This should create a DLL version of your module. Now simply place it in the <code>modules</code> directory of your server root, and use the <code class="directive">LoadModule</code> directive to load it.</p>   <div class="directive-section">
