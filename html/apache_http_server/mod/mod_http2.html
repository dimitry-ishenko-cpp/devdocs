</table> <h3>Summary</h3> <p>This module provides HTTP/2 (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540">RFC 7540</a>) support for the Apache HTTP Server.</p> <p>This module relies on <a href="http://nghttp2.org/">libnghttp2</a> to provide the core http/2 engine.</p> <p>You must enable HTTP/2 via <code class="directive"><a href="core.html#protocols">Protocols</a></code> in order to use the functionality described in this document. The HTTP/2 protocol <a href="https://http2.github.io/faq/#does-http2-require-encryption">does not require</a> the use of encryption so two schemes are available: <code>h2</code> (HTTP/2 over TLS) and <code>h2c</code> (HTTP/2 over TCP).</p> <p>Two useful configuration schemes are:</p> <div class="note">

Allows HTTP/2 cleartext negotiation (h2c) upgrading from an initial HTTP/1.1 connection or via HTTP/2 preamble checking (Direct mode, see <code class="directive"><a href="#h2direct">H2Direct</a></code>).</p> </div> <p>Refer to the official <a href="https://http2.github.io/faq">HTTP/2 FAQ</a> for any doubt about the protocol.</p>     <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2> <h3><a name="dimensioning" id="dimensioning">HTTP/2 Dimensioning</a></h3> <p> Enabling HTTP/2 on your Apache Server has impact on the resource consumption and if you have a busy site, you may need to consider carefully the implications. </p> <p> The first noticeable thing after enabling HTTP/2 is that your server processes will start additional threads. The reason for this is that HTTP/2 gives all requests that it receives to its own <em>Worker</em> threads for processing, collects the results and streams them out to the client. </p> <p> In the current implementation, these workers use a separate thread pool from the MPM workers that you might be familiar with. This is just how things are right now and not intended to be like this forever. (It might be forever for the 2.4.x release line, though.) So, HTTP/2 workers, or shorter H2Workers, will not show up in <code class="module"><a href="mod_status.html">mod_status</a></code>. They are also not counted against directives such as <code class="directive"><a href="mpm_common.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</a></code>. However they take <code class="directive"><a href="mpm_common.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</a></code> as default if you have not configured something else via <code class="directive"><a href="#h2minworkers">H2MinWorkers</a></code> and <code class="directive"><a href="#h2maxworkers">H2MaxWorkers</a></code>. </p> <p> Another thing to watch out for is is memory consumption. Since HTTP/2 keeps more state on the server to manage all the open request, priorities for and dependencies between them, it will always need more memory than HTTP/1.1 processing. There are three directives which steer the memory footprint of a HTTP/2 connection: <code class="directive"><a href="#h2maxsessionstreams">H2MaxSessionStreams</a></code>, <code class="directive"><a href="#h2windowsize">H2WindowSize</a></code> and <code class="directive"><a href="#h2streammaxmemsize">H2StreamMaxMemSize</a></code>. </p> <p> <code class="directive"><a href="#h2maxsessionstreams">H2MaxSessionStreams</a></code> limits the number of parallel requests that a client can make on a HTTP/2 connection. It depends on your site how many you should allow. The default is 100 which is plenty and unless you run into memory problems, I would keep it this way. Most requests that browsers send are GETs without a body, so they use up only a little bit of memory until the actual processing starts. </p> <p> <code class="directive"><a href="#h2windowsize">H2WindowSize</a></code> controls how much the client is allowed to send as body of a request, before it waits for the server to encourage more. Or, the other way around, it is the amount of request body data the server needs to be able to buffer. This is per request. </p> <p> And last, but not least, <code class="directive"><a href="#h2streammaxmemsize">H2StreamMaxMemSize</a></code> controls how much response data shall be buffered. The request sits in a H2Worker thread and is producing data, the HTTP/2 connection tries to send this to the client. If the client does not read fast enough, the connection will buffer this amount of data and then suspend the H2Worker. </p> <h3><a name="misdirected" id="misdirected">Multiple Hosts and Misdirected Requests</a></h3> <p> Many sites use the same TLS certificate for multiple virtual hosts. The certificate either has a wildcard name, such as '*.example.org' or carries several alternate names. Browsers using HTTP/2 will recognize that and reuse an already opened connection for such hosts. </p> <p> While this is great for performance, it comes at a price: such vhosts need more care in their configuration. The problem is that you will have multiple requests for multiple hosts on the same TLS connection. And that makes renegotiation impossible, in face the HTTP/2 standard forbids it. </p> <p> So, if you have several virtual hosts using the same certificate and want to use HTTP/2 for them, you need to make sure that all vhosts have exactly the same SSL configuration. You need the same protocol, ciphers and settings for client verification. </p> <p> If you mix things, Apache httpd will detect it and return a special response code, 421 Misdirected Request, to the client. </p> <h3><a name="envvars" id="envvars">Environment Variables</a></h3> <p> This module can be configured to provide HTTP/2 related information as additional environment variables to the SSI and CGI namespace, as well as in custom log configurations (see <code>%{VAR_NAME}e</code>). </p> <table class="bordered"> <tr> <th><a name="table3">Variable Name:</a></th> <th>Value Type:</th> <th>Description:</th> </tr> <tr>

This should be used inside a <code class="directive"><a href="core.html#virtualhost">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</a></code> section to enable direct HTTP/2 communication for that virtual host. </p> <p> Direct communication means that if the first bytes received by the server on a connection match the HTTP/2 preamble, the HTTP/2 protocol is switched to immediately without further negotiation. This mode is defined in RFC 7540 for the cleartext (h2c) case. Its use on TLS connections not mandated by the standard. </p> <p> When a server/vhost does not have h2 or h2c enabled via <code class="directive"><a href="core.html#protocols">Protocols</a></code>, the connection is never inspected for a HTTP/2 preamble. <code class="directive">H2Direct</code> does not matter then. This is important for connections that use protocols where an initial read might hang indefinitely, such as NNTP. </p> <p> For clients that have out-of-band knowledge about a server supporting h2c, direct HTTP/2 saves the client from having to perform an HTTP/1.1 upgrade, resulting in better performance and avoiding the Upgrade restrictions on request bodies. </p> <p> This makes direct h2c attractive for server to server communication as well, when the connection can be trusted or is secured by other means. </p> <div class="example">

This is helpful if those resources are connected in some way and the client can be expected to ask for it anyway. The pushing then saves the time it takes the client to ask for the resources itself. On the other hand, pushing resources the client never needs or already has is a waste of bandwidth. </p> <p> Server pushes are detected by inspecting the <code>Link</code> headers of responses (see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988 for the specification). When a link thus specified has the <code>rel=preload</code> attribute, it is treated as a resource to be pushed. </p> <p> Link headers in responses are either set by the application or can be configured via <code class="directive">H2PushResource</code> or using <code class="module"><a href="mod_headers.html">mod_headers</a></code> as: </p> <div class="example">

&lt;/Location&gt;</pre> </div> <p> As the example shows, there can be several link headers added to a response, resulting in several pushes being triggered. There are no checks in the module to avoid pushing the same resource twice or more to one client. Use with care. </p> <p> HTTP/2 server pushes are enabled by default. On a server or virtual host, you may enable/disable this feature for any connection to the host. In addition, you may disable PUSH for a set of resources in a Directory/Location.

</tr> </table> <p> This directive defines the priority handling of pushed responses based on the content-type of the response. This is usually defined per server config, but may also appear in a virtual host. </p> <p> HTTP/2 server pushes are always related to a client request. Each such request/response pairs, or <em>streams</em> have a dependency and a weight, together defining the <em>priority</em> of a stream. </p> <p> When a stream <em>depends</em> on another, say X depends on Y, then Y gets all bandwidth before X gets any. Note that this does not mean that Y will block X. If Y has no data to send, all bandwidth allocated to Y can be used by X. </p> <p> When a stream has more than one dependent, say X1 and X2 both depend on Y, the <em>weight</em> determines the bandwidth allocation. If X1 and X2 have the same weight, they both get half of the available bandwidth. If the weight of X1 is twice as large as that for X2, X1 gets twice the bandwidth of X2. </p> <p> Ultimately, every stream depends on the <em>root</em> stream which gets all the bandwidth available, but never sends anything. So all its bandwidth is distributed by weight among its children. Which either have data to send or distribute the bandwidth to their own children. And so on. If none of the children have data to send, that bandwidth get distributed somewhere else according to the same rules. </p> <p> The purpose of this priority system is to always make use of available bandwidth while allowing precedence and weight to be given to specific streams. Since, normally, all streams are initiated by the client, it is also the one that sets these priorities. </p> <p> Only when such a stream results in a PUSH, gets the server to decide what the <em>initial</em> priority of such a pushed stream is. In the examples below, X is the client stream. It depends on Y and the server decides to PUSH streams P1 and P2 onto X. </p> <p> The default priority rule is: </p> <div class="example">
<h3>Default Priority Rule</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">H2PushPriority * After 16</pre> </div> <p> which reads as 'Send a pushed stream of any content-type depending on the client stream with weight 16'. And so P1 and P2 will be send after X and, as they have equal weight, share bandwidth equally among themselves. </p> <div class="example">
<h3>Interleaved Priority Rule</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">H2PushPriority text/css Interleaved 256</pre> </div> <p> which reads as 'Send any CSS resource on the same dependency and weight as the client stream'. If P1 has content-type 'text/css', it will depend on Y (as does X) and its effective weight will be calculated as <code>P1ew = Xw * (P1w / 256)</code>. With P1w being 256, this will make the effective weight the same as the weight of X. If both X and P1 have data to send, bandwidth will be allocated to both equally. </p> <p> With Pw specified as 512, a pushed, interleaved stream would get double the weight of X. With 128 only half as much. Note that effective weights are always capped at 256. </p> <div class="example">
<h3>Before Priority Rule</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-config">H2PushPriority application/json Before</pre> </div> <p> This says that any pushed stream of content type 'application/json' should be send out <em>before</em> X. This makes P1 dependent on Y and X dependent on P1. So, X will be stalled as long as P1 has data to send. The effective weight is inherited from the client stream.

This is of course true for all packets. TLS however needs the whole record in order to decrypt it.
