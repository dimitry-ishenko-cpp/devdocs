<h1>suexec - Switch user before executing external programs</h1>  <p><code>suexec</code> is used by the Apache HTTP Server to switch to another user before executing CGI programs. In order to achieve this, it must run as <code>root</code>. Since the HTTP daemon normally doesn't run as <code>root</code>, the <code>suexec</code> executable needs the setuid bit set and must be owned by <code>root</code>. It should never be writable for any other person than <code>root</code>.</p> <p>For further information about the concepts and the security model of suexec please refer to the suexec documentation (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/suexec.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/suexec.html</a>).</p>     <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2> <pre>suexec -V</pre>   <h2 id="options">Options</h2> <dl> <dt><code>-V</code></dt> <dd>If you are <code>root</code>, this option displays the compile options of <code>suexec</code>. For security reasons all configuration options are changeable only at compile time.</dd> </dl><div class="_attribution">
