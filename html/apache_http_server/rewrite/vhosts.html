<h1>Dynamic mass virtual hosts with mod_rewrite</h1>  <p>This document supplements the <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a></code> <a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">reference documentation</a>. It describes how you can use <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a></code> to create dynamically configured virtual hosts.</p> <div class="warning">mod_rewrite is not the best way to configure virtual hosts. You should first consider the <a href="../vhosts/mass.html">alternatives</a> before resorting to mod_rewrite. See also the "<a href="avoid.html#vhosts">how to avoid mod_rewrite</a> document.</div>     <h2 id="per-hostname">Virtual Hosts For Arbitrary Hostnames</h2> <dl> <dt>Description:</dt> <dd> <p>We want to automatically create a virtual host for every hostname which resolves in our domain, without having to create new VirtualHost sections.</p> <p>In this recipe, we assume that we'll be using the hostname <code>www.SITE.example.com</code> for each user, and serve their content out of <code>/home/SITE/www</code>.</p> </dd> <dt>Solution:</dt> <dd> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config">RewriteEngine on

RewriteMap    lowercase int:tolower

RewriteCond   "${lowercase:%{<strong>HTTP_HOST</strong>}}"   "^www\.<strong>([^.]+)</strong>\.example\.com$"
RewriteRule   "^(.*)" "/home/<strong>%1</strong>/www$1"</pre> </dd> <dt>Discussion</dt> <dd> <div class="warning">You will need to take care of the DNS resolution - Apache does not handle name resolution. You'll need either to create CNAME records for each hostname, or a DNS wildcard record. Creating DNS records is beyond the scope of this document.</div> <p>The internal <code>tolower</code> RewriteMap directive is used to ensure that the hostnames being used are all lowercase, so that there is no ambiguity in the directory structure which must be created.</p> <p>Parentheses used in a <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewritecond">RewriteCond</a></code> are captured into the backreferences <code>%1</code>, <code>%2</code>, etc, while parentheses used in <code class="directive"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule">RewriteRule</a></code> are captured into the backreferences <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, etc.</p> <p> As with many techniques discussed in this document, mod_rewrite really isn't the best way to accomplish this task. You should, instead, consider using <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_vhost_alias.html">mod_vhost_alias</a></code> instead, as it will much more gracefully handle anything beyond serving static files, such as any dynamic content, and Alias resolution. </p> </dd> </dl>   <h2 id="simple.rewrite">Dynamic Virtual Hosts Using <code class="module"><a href="../mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a></code>
</h2> <p>This extract from <code>httpd.conf</code> does the same thing as <a href="#per-hostname">the first example</a>. The first half is very similar to the corresponding part above, except for some changes, required for backward compatibility and to make the <code>mod_rewrite</code> part work properly; the second half configures <code>mod_rewrite</code> to do the actual work.</p> <p>Because <code>mod_rewrite</code> runs before other URI translation modules (e.g., <code>mod_alias</code>), <code>mod_rewrite</code> must be told to explicitly ignore any URLs that would have been handled by those modules. And, because these rules would otherwise bypass any <code>ScriptAlias</code> directives, we must have <code>mod_rewrite</code> explicitly enact those mappings.</p> <pre class="prettyprint lang-config"># get the server name from the Host: header

This provides more flexibility, but requires more complicated configuration.</p> <p>The <code>vhost.map</code> file should look something like this:</p> <div class="example"><pre>customer-1.example.com /www/customers/1
