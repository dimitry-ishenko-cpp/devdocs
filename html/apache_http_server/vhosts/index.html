<h1>Apache Virtual Host documentation</h1>  <p>The term <cite>Virtual Host</cite> refers to the practice of running more than one web site (such as <code>company1.example.com</code> and <code>company2.example.com</code>) on a single machine. Virtual hosts can be "<a href="ip-based.html">IP-based</a>", meaning that you have a different IP address for every web site, or "<a href="name-based.html">name-based</a>", meaning that you have multiple names running on each IP address. The fact that they are running on the same physical server is not apparent to the end user.</p> <p>Apache was one of the first servers to support IP-based virtual hosts right out of the box. Versions 1.1 and later of Apache support both IP-based and name-based virtual hosts (vhosts). The latter variant of virtual hosts is sometimes also called <em>host-based</em> or <em>non-IP virtual hosts</em>.</p> <p>Below is a list of documentation pages which explain all details of virtual host support in Apache HTTP Server:</p>     <h2 id="support">Virtual Host Support</h2> <ul> <li>
<a href="name-based.html">Name-based Virtual Hosts</a> (More than one web site per IP address)</li> <li>
<a href="ip-based.html">IP-based Virtual Hosts</a> (An IP address for each web site)</li> <li><a href="examples.html">Virtual Host examples for common setups</a></li> <li>

<h3>Unix example</h3>
<pre>apachectl -S</pre>
</div> <div class="example">
<h3>Windows example</h3>
<pre>httpd.exe -S</pre>
</div> <p>This command will dump out a description of how Apache parsed the configuration file. Careful examination of the IP addresses and server names may help uncover configuration mistakes. (See the docs for the <code class="program"><a href="../programs/httpd.html">httpd</a></code> program for other command line options)</p><div class="_attribution">
