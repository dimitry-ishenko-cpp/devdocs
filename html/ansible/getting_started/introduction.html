<section id="introduction-to-ansible"> <h1 id="id1">Introduction to Ansible</h1> <p>Ansible provides open-source automation that reduces complexity and runs everywhere. Using Ansible lets you automate virtually any task. Here are some common use cases for Ansible:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Eliminate repetition and simplify workflows</li> <li>Manage and maintain system configuration</li> <li>Continuously deploy complex software</li> <li>Perform zero-downtime rolling updates</li> </ul> <p>Ansible uses simple, human-readable scripts called playbooks to automate your tasks. You declare the desired state of a local or remote system in your playbook. Ansible ensures that the system remains in that state.</p> <p>As automation technology, Ansible is designed around the following principles:</p> <dl class="simple"> <dt>Agent-less architecture</dt>
<dd>
<p>Low maintenance overhead by avoiding the installation of additional software across IT infrastructure.</p> </dd> <dt>Simplicity</dt>
<dd>
<p>Automation playbooks use straightforward YAML syntax for code that reads like documentation. Ansible is also decentralized, using SSH with existing OS credentials to access to remote machines.</p> </dd> <dt>Scalability and flexibility</dt>
<dd>
<p>Easily and quickly scale the systems you automate through a modular design that supports a large range of operating systems, cloud platforms, and network devices.</p> </dd> <dt>Idempotence and predictability</dt>
<dd>
<p>When the system is in the state your playbook describes Ansible does not change anything, even if the playbook runs multiple times.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>Ready to start using Ansible? <a class="reference internal" href="get_started_ansible.html#get-started-ansible"><span class="std std-ref">Get up and running in a few easy steps</span></a>.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
