<h1 id="id1">Implicit ‘localhost’</h1> <p id="implicit-localhost">When you try to reference a <code>localhost</code> and you don’t have it defined in inventory, Ansible will create an implicit one for you.:</p> <pre data-language="YAML+Jinja">- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: check that i have log file for all hosts on my local machine
      stat: path=/var/log/hosts/{{inventory_hostname}}.log
      delegate_to: localhost
</pre> <p>In a case like this (or <code>local_action</code>) when Ansible needs to contact a ‘localhost’ but you did not supply one, we create one for you. This host is defined with specific connection variables equivalent to this in an inventory:</p> <pre data-language="YAML+Jinja">...

hosts:
  localhost:
   vars:
     ansible_connection: local
     ansible_python_interpreter: "{{ansible_playbook_python}}"
</pre> <p>This ensures that the proper connection and Python are used to execute your tasks locally. You can override the built-in implicit version by creating a <code>localhost</code> host entry in your inventory. At that point, all implicit behaviors are ignored; the <code>localhost</code> in inventory is treated just like any other host. Group and host vars will apply, including connection vars, which includes the <code>ansible_python_interpreter</code> setting. This will also affect <code>delegate_to: localhost</code> and <code>local_action</code>, the latter being an alias to the former.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>This host is not targetable via any group, however it will use vars from <code>host_vars</code> and from the ‘all’ group.</li> <li>Implicit localhost does not appear in the <code>hostvars</code> magic variable unless demanded, such as by <code>"{{ hostvars['localhost'] }}"</code>.</li> <li>The <code>inventory_file</code> and <code>inventory_dir</code> magic variables are not available for the implicit localhost as they are dependent on <strong>each inventory host</strong>.</li> <li>This implicit host also gets triggered by using <code>127.0.0.1</code> or <code>::1</code> as they are the IPv4 and IPv6 representations of ‘localhost’.</li> <li>Even though there are many ways to create it, there will only ever be ONE implicit localhost, using the name first used to create it.</li> <li>Having <code>connection: local</code> does NOT trigger an implicit localhost, you are just changing the connection for the <code>inventory_hostname</code>.</li> </ul> </div><div class="_attribution">
