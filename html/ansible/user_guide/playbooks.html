<h1 id="id1">Working with playbooks</h1> <p id="working-with-playbooks">Playbooks record and execute Ansible’s configuration, deployment, and orchestration functions. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT process.</p> <p>If Ansible modules are the tools in your workshop, playbooks are your instruction manuals, and your inventory of hosts are your raw material.</p> <p>At a basic level, playbooks can be used to manage configurations of and deployments to remote machines. At a more advanced level, they can sequence multi-tier rollouts involving rolling updates, and can delegate actions to other hosts, interacting with monitoring servers and load balancers along the way.</p> <p>Playbooks are designed to be human-readable and are developed in a basic text language. There are multiple ways to organize playbooks and the files they include, and we’ll offer up some suggestions on that and making the most out of Ansible.</p> <p>You should look at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples">Example Playbooks</a> while reading along with the playbook documentation. These illustrate best practices as well as how to put many of the various concepts together.</p>  <ul> <li class="toctree-l1">
