You may need to track hosts from multiple sources: cloud providers, LDAP, <a class="reference external" href="https://cobbler.github.io">Cobbler</a>, and/or enterprise CMDB systems.</p> <p>Ansible integrates all of these options through a dynamic external inventory system. Ansible supports two ways to connect with external inventory: <a class="reference internal" href="../plugins/inventory.html#inventory-plugins"><span class="std std-ref">Inventory Plugins</span></a> and <code>inventory scripts</code>.</p> <p>Inventory plugins take advantage of the most recent updates to the Ansible core code. We recommend plugins over scripts for dynamic inventory. You can <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_inventory.html#developing-inventory"><span class="std std-ref">write your own plugin</span></a> to connect to additional dynamic inventory sources.</p> <p>You can still use inventory scripts if you choose. When we implemented inventory plugins, we ensured backwards compatibility through the script inventory plugin. The examples below illustrate how to use inventory scripts.</p> <p>If you prefer a GUI for handling dynamic inventory, the inventory database on AWX or <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/tower.html#ansible-platform"><span class="std std-ref">Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</span></a> syncs with all your dynamic inventory sources, provides web and REST access to the results, and offers a graphical inventory editor. With a database record of all of your hosts, you can correlate past event history and see which hosts have had failures on their last playbook runs.</p>  <h2 id="cobbler-example">Inventory script example: Cobbler</h2> <p id="inventory-script-example-cobbler">Ansible integrates seamlessly with <a class="reference external" href="https://cobbler.github.io">Cobbler</a>, a Linux installation server originally written by Michael DeHaan and now led by James Cammarata, who works for Ansible.</p> <p>While primarily used to kickoff OS installations and manage DHCP and DNS, Cobbler has a generic layer that can represent data for multiple configuration management systems (even at the same time) and serve as a ‘lightweight CMDB’.</p> <p>To tie your Ansible inventory to Cobbler, copy <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible-community/contrib-scripts/main/inventory/cobbler.py">this script</a> to <code>/etc/ansible</code> and <code>chmod +x</code> the file. Run <code>cobblerd</code> any time you use Ansible and use the <code>-i</code> command line option (for example, <code>-i /etc/ansible/cobbler.py</code>) to communicate with Cobbler using Cobbler’s XMLRPC API.</p> <p>Add a <code>cobbler.ini</code> file in <code>/etc/ansible</code> so Ansible knows where the Cobbler server is and some cache improvements can be used. For example:</p> <pre data-language="text">[cobbler]

# Set Cobbler's hostname or IP address
host = http://127.0.0.1/cobbler_api

# API calls to Cobbler can be slow. For this reason, we cache the results of an API
# call. Set this to the path you want cache files to be written to. Two files
# will be written to this directory:
#   - ansible-cobbler.cache
#   - ansible-cobbler.index

cache_path = /tmp

# The number of seconds a cache file is considered valid. After this many
# seconds, a new API call will be made, and the cache file will be updated.

cache_max_age = 900
</pre> <p>First test the script by running <code>/etc/ansible/cobbler.py</code> directly. You should see some JSON data output, but it may not have anything in it just yet.</p> <p>Let’s explore what this does. In Cobbler, assume a scenario somewhat like the following:</p> <pre data-language="bash">cobbler profile add --name=webserver --distro=CentOS6-x86_64
cobbler profile edit --name=webserver --mgmt-classes="webserver" --ksmeta="a=2 b=3"
cobbler system edit --name=foo --dns-name="foo.example.com" --mgmt-classes="atlanta" --ksmeta="c=4"
cobbler system edit --name=bar --dns-name="bar.example.com" --mgmt-classes="atlanta" --ksmeta="c=5"
</pre> <p>In the example above, the system ‘foo.example.com’ is addressable by ansible directly, but is also addressable when using the group names ‘webserver’ or ‘atlanta’. Since Ansible uses SSH, it contacts system foo over ‘foo.example.com’, only, never just ‘foo’. Similarly, if you tried “ansible foo”, it would not find the system… but “ansible ‘foo*’” would do, because the system DNS name starts with ‘foo’.</p> <p>The script provides more than host and group info. In addition, as a bonus, when the ‘setup’ module is run (which happens automatically when using playbooks), the variables ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ will all be auto-populated in the templates:</p> <pre data-language="text"># file: /srv/motd.j2
Welcome, I am templated with a value of a={{ a }}, b={{ b }}, and c={{ c }}
</pre> <p>Which could be executed just like this:</p> <pre data-language="bash">ansible webserver -m setup
ansible webserver -m template -a "src=/tmp/motd.j2 dest=/etc/motd"
</pre> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The name ‘webserver’ came from Cobbler, as did the variables for the config file. You can still pass in your own variables like normal in Ansible, but variables from the external inventory script will override any that have the same name.</p> </div> <p>So, with the template above (<code>motd.j2</code>), this results in the following data being written to <code>/etc/motd</code> for system ‘foo’:</p> <pre data-language="text">Welcome, I am templated with a value of a=2, b=3, and c=4
</pre> <p>And on system ‘bar’ (bar.example.com):</p> <pre data-language="text">Welcome, I am templated with a value of a=2, b=3, and c=5
</pre> <p>And technically, though there is no major good reason to do it, this also works:</p> <pre data-language="bash">ansible webserver -m ansible.builtin.shell -a "echo {{ a }}"
</pre> <p>So, in other words, you can use those variables in arguments/actions as well.</p>   <h2 id="openstack-example">Inventory script example: OpenStack</h2> <p id="inventory-script-example-openstack">If you use an OpenStack-based cloud, instead of manually maintaining your own inventory file, you can use the <code>openstack_inventory.py</code> dynamic inventory to pull information about your compute instances directly from OpenStack.</p> <p>You can download the latest version of the OpenStack inventory script <a class="reference external" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/ansible-collections-openstack/master/scripts/inventory/openstack_inventory.py">here</a>.</p> <p>You can use the inventory script explicitly (by passing the <code>-i openstack_inventory.py</code> argument to Ansible) or implicitly (by placing the script at <code>/etc/ansible/hosts</code>).</p>  <h3 id="explicit-use-of-openstack-inventory-script">Explicit use of OpenStack inventory script</h3> <p>Download the latest version of the OpenStack dynamic inventory script and make it executable:</p> <pre data-language="YAML+Jinja">wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openstack/ansible-collections-openstack/master/scripts/inventory/openstack_inventory.py

When doing so, it is possible to mix both dynamic and statically managed inventory sources in the same ansible run. Instant hybrid cloud!</p> <p>In an inventory directory, executable files are treated as dynamic inventory sources and most other files as static sources. Files which end with any of the following are ignored:</p> <pre data-language="text">~, .orig, .bak, .ini, .cfg, .retry, .pyc, .pyo
</pre> <p>You can replace this list with your own selection by configuring an <code>inventory_ignore_extensions</code> list in <code>ansible.cfg</code>, or setting the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_appendices/config.html#envvar-ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_IGNORE" id="index-0"><code>ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_IGNORE</code></a> environment variable. The value in either case must be a comma-separated list of patterns, as shown above.</p> <p>Any <code>group_vars</code> and <code>host_vars</code> subdirectories in an inventory directory are interpreted as expected, making inventory directories a powerful way to organize different sets of configurations.

If you want to define a static group of dynamic child groups, define the dynamic groups as empty in the static inventory file. For example:</p> <pre data-language="text">[tag_Name_staging_foo]

[tag_Name_staging_bar]

[staging:children]
tag_Name_staging_foo
