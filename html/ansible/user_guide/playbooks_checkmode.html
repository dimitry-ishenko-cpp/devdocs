<section id="validating-tasks-check-mode-and-diff-mode"> <h1 id="check-mode-dry">Validating tasks: check mode and diff mode</h1> <p>Ansible provides two modes of execution that validate tasks: check mode and diff mode. These modes can be used separately or together. They are useful when you are creating or editing a playbook or role and you want to know what it will do. In check mode, Ansible runs without making any changes on remote systems. Modules that support check mode report the changes they would have made. Modules that do not support check mode report nothing and do nothing. In diff mode, Ansible provides before-and-after comparisons. Modules that support diff mode display detailed information. You can combine check mode and diff mode for detailed validation of your playbook or role.</p>  <ul class="simple"> <li>

It will not generate output for tasks that use <a class="reference internal" href="playbooks_conditionals.html#conditionals-registered-vars"><span class="std std-ref">conditionals based on registered variables</span></a> (results of prior tasks). However, it is great for validating configuration management playbooks that run on one node at a time. To run a playbook in check mode:</p> <pre data-language="console">ansible-playbook foo.yml --check

  - name: This task will always make changes to the system
    ansible.builtin.command: /something/to/run --even-in-check-mode
    check_mode: false

  - name: This task will never make changes to the system
    ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
      line: "important config"
      dest: /path/to/myconfig.conf
      state: present
    check_mode: true
    register: changes_to_important_config
</pre> <p>Running single tasks with <code>check_mode: true</code> can be useful for testing Ansible modules, either to test the module itself or to test the conditions under which a module would make changes. You can register variables (see <a class="reference internal" href="playbooks_conditionals.html#playbooks-conditionals"><span class="std std-ref">Conditionals</span></a>) on these tasks for even more detail on the potential changes.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Prior to version 2.2 only the equivalent of <code>check_mode: false</code> existed. The notation for that was <code>always_run: true</code>.</p> </div> </section> <section id="skipping-tasks-or-ignoring-errors-in-check-mode"> <h3>Skipping tasks or ignoring errors in check mode</h3> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 2.1.</span></p> </div> <p>If you want to skip a task or ignore errors on a task when you run Ansible in check mode, you can use a boolean magic variable <code>ansible_check_mode</code>, which is set to <code>True</code> when Ansible runs in check mode. For example:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">tasks:

  - name: This task will be skipped in check mode
    ansible.builtin.git:
      repo: ssh://git@github.com/mylogin/hello.git
      dest: /home/mylogin/hello
    when: not ansible_check_mode

  - name: This task will ignore errors in check mode
    ansible.builtin.git:
      repo: ssh://git@github.com/mylogin/hello.git
      dest: /home/mylogin/hello
    ignore_errors: "{{ ansible_check_mode }}"
</pre> </section> </section> <section id="using-diff-mode"> <h2 id="diff-mode">Using diff mode</h2> <p>The <code>--diff</code> option for ansible-playbook can be used alone or with <code>--check</code>. When you run in diff mode, any module that supports diff mode reports the changes made or, if used with <code>--check</code>, the changes that would have been made. Diff mode is most common in modules that manipulate files (for example, the template module) but other modules might also show ‘before and after’ information (for example, the user module).</p> <p>Diff mode produces a large amount of output, so it is best used when checking a single host at a time. For example:</p> <pre data-language="console">ansible-playbook foo.yml --check --diff --limit foo.example.com
</pre> <div class="versionadded"> <p><span class="versionmodified added">New in version 2.4.</span></p> </div> <section id="enforcing-or-preventing-diff-mode-on-tasks"> <h3>Enforcing or preventing diff mode on tasks</h3> <p>Because the <code>--diff</code> option can reveal sensitive information, you can disable it for a task by specifying <code>diff: false</code>. For example:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">tasks:
  - name: This task will not report a diff when the file changes
    ansible.builtin.template:
      src: secret.conf.j2
      dest: /etc/secret.conf
      owner: root
      group: root
