<h1 id="connections">Connection methods and details</h1> <p id="connection-methods-and-details">This section shows you how to expand and refine the connection methods Ansible uses for your inventory.</p>  <h2 id="controlpersist-and-paramiko">ControlPersist and paramiko</h2> <p>By default, Ansible uses native OpenSSH, because it supports ControlPersist (a performance feature), Kerberos, and options in <code>~/.ssh/config</code> such as Jump Host setup. If your control machine uses an older version of OpenSSH that does not support ControlPersist, Ansible will fallback to a Python implementation of OpenSSH called ‘paramiko’.</p>   <h2 id="connection-set-user">Setting a remote user</h2> <p id="setting-a-remote-user">By default, Ansible connects to all remote devices with the user name you are using on the control node. If that user name does not exist on a remote device, you can set a different user name for the connection. If you just need to do some tasks as a different user, look at <a class="reference internal" href="become.html#become"><span class="std std-ref">Understanding privilege escalation: become</span></a>. You can set the connection user in a playbook:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">---
- name: update webservers
  hosts: webservers
  remote_user: admin

  tasks:
  - name: thing to do first in this playbook
  . . .
</pre> <p>as a host variable in inventory:</p> <pre data-language="text">other1.example.com     ansible_connection=ssh        ansible_user=myuser
other2.example.com     ansible_connection=ssh        ansible_user=myotheruser
</pre> <p>or as a group variable in inventory:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">cloud:
  hosts:
    cloud1: my_backup.cloud.com
    cloud2: my_backup2.cloud.com
  vars:
    ansible_user: admin
</pre>   <h2 id="setting-up-ssh-keys">Setting up SSH keys</h2> <p>By default, Ansible assumes you are using SSH keys to connect to remote machines. SSH keys are encouraged, but you can use password authentication if needed with the <code>--ask-pass</code> option. If you need to provide a password for <a class="reference internal" href="become.html#become"><span class="std std-ref">privilege escalation</span></a> (sudo, pbrun, and so on), use <code>--ask-become-pass</code>.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Ansible does not expose a channel to allow communication between the user and the ssh process to accept a password manually to decrypt an ssh key when using the ssh connection plugin (which is the default). The use of <code>ssh-agent</code> is highly recommended.</p> </div> <p>To set up SSH agent to avoid retyping passwords, you can do:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ ssh-agent bash
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre> <p>Depending on your setup, you may wish to use Ansible’s <code>--private-key</code> command line option to specify a pem file instead. You can also add the private key file:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ ssh-agent bash
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/keypair.pem
</pre> <p>Another way to add private key files without using ssh-agent is using <code>ansible_ssh_private_key_file</code> in an inventory file as explained here: <a class="reference internal" href="intro_inventory.html#intro-inventory"><span class="std std-ref">How to build your inventory</span></a>.</p>   <h2 id="running-against-localhost">Running against localhost</h2> <p>You can run commands against the control node by using “localhost” or “127.0.0.1” for the server name:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ ansible localhost -m ping -e 'ansible_python_interpreter="/usr/bin/env python"'
</pre> <p>You can specify localhost explicitly by adding this to your inventory file:</p> <pre data-language="bash">localhost ansible_connection=local ansible_python_interpreter="/usr/bin/env python"
</pre>   <h2 id="host-key-checking-on">Managing host key checking</h2> <p id="managing-host-key-checking">Ansible enables host key checking by default. Checking host keys guards against server spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks, but it does require some maintenance.</p> <p>If a host is reinstalled and has a different key in ‘known_hosts’, this will result in an error message until corrected. If a new host is not in ‘known_hosts’ your control node may prompt for confirmation of the key, which results in an interactive experience if using Ansible, from say, cron. You might not want this.</p> <p>If you understand the implications and wish to disable this behavior, you can do so by editing <code>/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg</code> or <code>~/.ansible.cfg</code>:</p> <pre data-language="text">[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
</pre> <p>Alternatively this can be set by the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference_appendices/config.html#envvar-ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING" id="index-0"><code>ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING</code></a> environment variable:</p> <pre data-language="bash">$ export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
</pre> <p>Also note that host key checking in paramiko mode is reasonably slow, therefore switching to ‘ssh’ is also recommended when using this feature.</p>   <h2 id="other-connection-methods">Other connection methods</h2> <p>Ansible can use a variety of connection methods beyond SSH. You can select any connection plugin, including managing things locally and managing chroot, lxc, and jail containers. A mode called ‘ansible-pull’ can also invert the system and have systems ‘phone home’ via scheduled git checkouts to pull configuration directives from a central repository.</p><div class="_attribution">
