<section id="windows-frequently-asked-questions"> <h1 id="windows-faq">Windows Frequently Asked Questions</h1> <p>Here are some commonly asked questions in regard to Ansible and Windows and their answers.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>This document covers questions about managing Microsoft Windows servers with Ansible. For questions about Ansible Core, please see the <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#ansible-faq"><span class="std std-ref">general FAQ page</span></a>.</p> </div> <section id="does-ansible-work-with-windows-xp-or-server-2003"> <h2>Does Ansible work with Windows XP or Server 2003?</h2> <p>Ansible does not work with Windows XP or Server 2003 hosts. Ansible does work with these Windows operating system versions:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Windows Server 2016</li> <li>Windows Server 2019</li> <li>Windows Server 2022</li> <li>Windows 10</li> <li>Windows 11</li> </ul> <p>Support for Windows Server 2008, 2008 R2, and Windows 7 ended in the 2.10 release. Support for Windows Server 2012, 2012 R2, Windows 8, and 8.1 ended in the 2.16 release.</p> <p>Ansible also has minimum PowerShell version requirements - please see <a class="reference internal" href="windows_setup.html#windows-setup"><span class="std std-ref">Setting up a Windows Host</span></a> for the latest information.</p> </section> <section id="can-i-manage-windows-nano-server-with-ansible"> <h2>Can I manage Windows Nano Server with Ansible?</h2> <p>Ansible does not currently work with Windows Nano Server, since it does not have access to the full .NET Framework that is used by the majority of the modules and internal components.</p> </section> <section id="can-ansible-run-on-windows"> <h2 id="windows-faq-ansible">Can Ansible run on Windows?</h2> <p>No, Ansible can only manage Windows hosts. Ansible cannot run on a Windows host natively, though it can run under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The Windows Subsystem for Linux is not supported by Ansible and should not be used for production systems.</p> </div> <p>To install Ansible on WSL, the following commands can be run in the bash terminal:</p> <pre data-language="shell">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip git libffi-dev libssl-dev -y
pip install --user ansible pywinrm
</pre> <p>To run Ansible from source instead of a release on the WSL, simply uninstall the pip installed version and then clone the git repo.</p> <pre data-language="shell">pip uninstall ansible -y
git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
source ansible/hacking/env-setup

# To enable Ansible on login, run the following
echo ". ~/ansible/hacking/env-setup -q' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
</pre> <p>If you encounter timeout errors when running Ansible on the WSL, this may be due to an issue with <code>sleep</code> not returning correctly. The following workaround may resolve the issue:</p> <pre data-language="shell">mv /usr/bin/sleep /usr/bin/sleep.orig
ln -s /bin/true /usr/bin/sleep
</pre> <p>Another option is to use WSL 2 if running Windows 10 later than build 2004.</p> <pre data-language="shell">wsl --set-default-version 2
</pre> </section> <section id="can-i-use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate-to-windows-hosts"> <h2>Can I use SSH keys to authenticate to Windows hosts?</h2> <p>You cannot use SSH keys with the WinRM or PSRP connection plugins. These connection plugins use X509 certificates for authentication instead of the SSH key pairs that SSH uses.</p> <p>The way X509 certificates are generated and mapped to a user is different from the SSH implementation; consult the <a class="reference internal" href="windows_winrm.html#windows-winrm"><span class="std std-ref">Windows Remote Management</span></a> documentation for more information.</p> <p>Ansible 2.8 has added an experimental option to use the SSH connection plugin, which uses SSH keys for authentication, for Windows servers. See <a class="reference internal" href="#windows-faq-ssh"><span class="std std-ref">this question</span></a> for more information.</p> </section> <section id="why-can-i-run-a-command-locally-that-does-not-work-under-ansible"> <h2 id="windows-faq-winrm">Why can I run a command locally that does not work under Ansible?</h2> <p>Ansible executes commands through WinRM. These processes are different from running a command locally in these ways:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Unless using an authentication option like CredSSP or Kerberos with credential delegation, the WinRM process cannot delegate the user’s credentials to a network resource, causing <code>Access is
Denied</code> errors.</li> <li>All processes run under WinRM are in a non-interactive session. Applications that require an interactive session will not work.</li> <li>When running through WinRM, Windows restricts access to internal Windows APIs like the Windows Update API and DPAPI, which some installers and programs rely on.</li> </ul> <p>Some ways to bypass these restrictions are to:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Use <code>become</code>, which runs a command as it would when run locally. This will bypass most WinRM restrictions, as Windows is unaware the process is running under WinRM when <code>become</code> is used. See the <a class="reference internal" href="../playbook_guide/playbooks_privilege_escalation.html#become"><span class="std std-ref">Understanding privilege escalation: become</span></a> documentation for more information.</li> <li>Use a scheduled task, which can be created with <code>win_scheduled_task</code>. Like <code>become</code>, it will bypass all WinRM restrictions, but it can only be used to run commands, not modules.</li> <li>Use <code>win_psexec</code> to run a command on the host. PSExec does not use WinRM and so will bypass any of the restrictions.</li> <li>To access network resources without any of these workarounds, you can use CredSSP or Kerberos with credential delegation enabled.</li> </ul> <p>See <a class="reference internal" href="../playbook_guide/playbooks_privilege_escalation.html#become"><span class="std std-ref">Understanding privilege escalation: become</span></a> more info on how to use become. The limitations section at <a class="reference internal" href="windows_winrm.html#windows-winrm"><span class="std std-ref">Windows Remote Management</span></a> has more details about WinRM limitations.</p> </section> <section id="this-program-won-t-install-on-windows-with-ansible"> <h2>This program won’t install on Windows with Ansible</h2> <p>See <a class="reference internal" href="#windows-faq-winrm"><span class="std std-ref">this question</span></a> for more information about WinRM limitations.</p> </section> <section id="what-windows-modules-are-available"> <h2>What Windows modules are available?</h2> <p>Most of the Ansible modules in Ansible Core are written for a combination of Linux/Unix machines and arbitrary web services. These modules are written in Python and most of them do not work on Windows.</p> <p>Because of this, there are dedicated Windows modules that are written in PowerShell and are meant to be run on Windows hosts. A list of these modules can be found <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_windows_modules.html#windows-modules" title="(in Ansible v2.9)"><span class="xref std std-ref">here</span></a>.</p> <p>In addition, the following Ansible Core modules/action-plugins work with Windows:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>add_host</li> <li>assert</li> <li>async_status</li> <li>debug</li> <li>fail</li> <li>fetch</li> <li>group_by</li> <li>include</li> <li>include_role</li> <li>include_vars</li> <li>meta</li> <li>pause</li> <li>raw</li> <li>script</li> <li>set_fact</li> <li>set_stats</li> <li>setup</li> <li>slurp</li> <li>template (also: win_template)</li> <li>wait_for_connection</li> </ul> <p>Ansible Windows modules exist in the <a class="reference internal" href="../collections/ansible/windows/index.html#plugins-in-ansible-windows"><span class="std std-ref">Ansible.Windows</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="../collections/community/windows/index.html#plugins-in-community-windows"><span class="std std-ref">Community.Windows</span></a>, and <a class="reference internal" href="../collections/chocolatey/chocolatey/index.html#plugins-in-chocolatey-chocolatey"><span class="std std-ref">Chocolatey.Chocolatey</span></a> collections.</p> </section> <section id="can-i-run-python-modules-on-windows-hosts"> <h2>Can I run Python modules on Windows hosts?</h2> <p>No, the WinRM connection protocol is set to use PowerShell modules, so Python modules will not work. A way to bypass this issue is to use <code>delegate_to: localhost</code> to run a Python module on the Ansible control node. This is useful if during a playbook, an external service needs to be contacted and there is no equivalent Windows module available.</p> </section> <section id="can-i-connect-to-windows-hosts-over-ssh"> <h2 id="windows-faq-ssh">Can I connect to Windows hosts over SSH?</h2> <p>Ansible 2.8 has added an experimental option to use the SSH connection plugin to manage Windows hosts. To connect to Windows hosts over SSH, you must install and configure the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH">Win32-OpenSSH</a> fork that is in development with Microsoft on the Windows host(s). While most of the basics should work with SSH, <code>Win32-OpenSSH</code> is rapidly changing, with new features added and bugs fixed in every release. It is highly recommend you <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH">install</a> the latest release of <code>Win32-OpenSSH</code> from the GitHub Releases page when using it with Ansible on Windows hosts.</p> <p>To use SSH as the connection to a Windows host, set the following variables in the inventory:</p> <pre data-language="shell">ansible_connection=ssh

# Set either cmd or powershell not both
ansible_shell_type=cmd
# ansible_shell_type=powershell
</pre> <p>The value for <code>ansible_shell_type</code> should either be <code>cmd</code> or <code>powershell</code>. Use <code>cmd</code> if the <code>DefaultShell</code> has not been configured on the SSH service and <code>powershell</code> if that has been set as the <code>DefaultShell</code>.</p> </section> <section id="why-is-connecting-to-a-windows-host-through-ssh-failing"> <h2>Why is connecting to a Windows host through SSH failing?</h2> <p>Unless you are using <code>Win32-OpenSSH</code> as described above, you must connect to Windows hosts using <a class="reference internal" href="windows_winrm.html#windows-winrm"><span class="std std-ref">Windows Remote Management</span></a>. If your Ansible output indicates that SSH was used, either you did not set the connection vars properly or the host is not inheriting them correctly.</p> <p>Make sure <code>ansible_connection: winrm</code> is set in the inventory for the Windows host(s).</p> </section> <section id="why-are-my-credentials-being-rejected"> <h2>Why are my credentials being rejected?</h2> <p>This can be due to a myriad of reasons unrelated to incorrect credentials.</p> <p>See HTTP 401/Credentials Rejected at <a class="reference internal" href="windows_setup.html#windows-setup"><span class="std std-ref">Setting up a Windows Host</span></a> for a more detailed guide of this could mean.</p> </section> <section id="why-am-i-getting-an-error-ssl-certificate-verify-failed"> <h2>Why am I getting an error SSL CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED?</h2> <p>When the Ansible control node is running on Python 2.7.9+ or an older version of Python that has backported SSLContext (like Python 2.7.5 on RHEL 7), the control node will attempt to validate the certificate WinRM is using for an HTTPS connection. If the certificate cannot be validated (such as in the case of a self-signed cert), it will fail the verification process.</p> <p>To ignore certificate validation, add <code>ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore</code> to inventory for the Windows host.</p> <div class="admonition seealso"> <p class="admonition-title">See also</p> <dl class="simple"> <dt><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/user_guide/windows.html#windows" title="(in Ansible v2.9)"><span>Windows Guides</span></a></dt>
