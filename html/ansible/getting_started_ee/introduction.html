<section id="introduction-to-execution-environments"> <h1 id="introduction-execution-environment">Introduction to Execution Environments</h1> <p>Ansible Execution Environments aim to resolve complexity issues and provide all the benefits you can get from containerization.</p> <section id="reducing-complexity"> <h2>Reducing complexity</h2> <p>There are three main areas where EEs can reduce complexity:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>software dependencies</li> <li>portability</li> <li>content separation</li> </ul> <section id="dependencies"> <h3>Dependencies</h3> <p>Software applications typically have dependencies, and Ansible is no exception. These dependencies can include software libraries, configuration files or other services, to name a few.</p> <p>Traditionally, administrators install application dependencies on top of an operating system using packaging management tools such as RPM or Python-pip. The major drawback of such an approach is that an application might require versions of dependencies different from those provided by default. For Ansible, a typical installation consists of <code>ansible-core</code> and a set of Ansible collections. Many of them have dependencies for the plugins, modules, roles and playbooks they provide.</p> <p>The Ansible collections can depend on the following pieces of software and their versions:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li><code>ansible-core</code></li> <li>Python</li> <li>Python packages</li> <li>System packages</li> <li>Other Ansible collections</li> </ul> <p>The dependencies have to be installed and sometimes can conflict with each other.</p> <p>One way to <strong>partially</strong> resolve the dependency issue is to use Python virtual environments on Ansible control nodes. However, applied to Ansible, virtual environments have drawbacks and natural limitations.</p> </section> <section id="portability"> <h3>Portability</h3> <p>An Ansible user writes content for Ansible locally and wants to leverage the container technology to make their automation runtimes portable, shareable and easily deployable to testing and production environments.</p> </section> <section id="content-separation"> <h3>Content separation</h3> <p>In situations when there is an Ansible control node or a tool such as Ansible AWX/Controller used by several users, they might want separate their content to avoid configuration and dependency conflicts.</p> </section> </section> <section id="ansible-tooling-for-ees"> <h2>Ansible tooling for EEs</h2> <p>Projects in the Ansible ecosystem also provide several tools that you can use with EEs, such as:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://ansible-builder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Ansible Builder</a></li> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://ansible-navigator.readthedocs.io/">Ansible Navigator</a></li> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/awx/en/latest/userguide/execution_environments.html#use-an-execution-environment-in-jobs">Ansible AWX</a></li> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://ansible-runner.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Ansible Runner</a></li> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.ansible">VS Code Ansible</a></li> <li><a class="reference external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers">Dev Containers extensions</a></li> </ul> <p>Ready to get started with EEs?
