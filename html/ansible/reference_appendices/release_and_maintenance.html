See <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/roadmap/ansible_roadmap_index.html#ansible-roadmaps"><span class="std std-ref">Ansible Roadmap</span></a> for upcoming release details. Between major versions, we release a new minor version of the Ansible community package every four weeks. Minor releases include new backwards-compatible features, modules and plugins, as well as bug fixes.</p> <p>Starting with version 2.10, the Ansible community team guarantees maintenance for only one major community package release at a time. For example, when Ansible 4.0.0 gets released, the team will stop making new 3.x releases. Community members may maintain older versions if desired.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Each Ansible EOL version may issue one final maintenance release at or shortly after the first release of the next version.

Major releases of the Ansible community package can contain breaking changes in the modules and other plugins within the included Collections and in core features.</p> <p>The Ansible community package follows semantic versioning rules. Minor releases of the Ansible community package accept only backwards-compatible changes in included Collections, that is, not Collections major releases. Collections must also use semantic versioning, so the Collection version numbers reflect this rule. For example, if Ansible 3.0.0 releases with community.general 2.0.0, then all minor releases of Ansible 3.x (such as Ansible 3.1.0 or Ansible 3.5.0) must include a 2.x release of community.general (such as 2.8.0 or 2.9.5) and not 3.x.x or later major releases.</p> <p>Work in Collections is tracked within the individual Collection repositories.</p> <p>You can refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="../porting_guides/porting_guides.html#porting-guides"><span class="std std-ref">Ansible package porting guides</span></a> for tips on updating your playbooks to run on newer versions of Ansible.

To do this we have a deprecation cycle. First we mark a feature as ‘deprecated’. This is normally accompanied with warnings to the user as to why we deprecated it, what alternatives they should switch to and when (which version) we are scheduled to remove the feature permanently.</p> <section id="ansible-community-package-deprecation-cycle"> <h3>Ansible community package deprecation cycle</h3> <p>Since Ansible is a package of individual collections, the deprecation cycle depends on the collection maintainers. We recommend the collection maintainers deprecate a feature in one Ansible major version and do not remove that feature for one year, or at least until the next major Ansible version. For example, deprecate the feature in 3.1.0 and do not remove the feature until 5.0.0 or 4.0.0 at the earliest. Collections should use semantic versioning, such that the major collection version cannot be changed within an Ansible major version. Therefore, the removal should not happen before the next major Ansible community package release. This is up to each collection maintainer and cannot be guaranteed.</p> </section> <section id="ansible-core-deprecation-cycle"> <h3>ansible-core deprecation cycle</h3> <p>The deprecation cycle in <code>ansible-core</code> is normally across 4 feature releases (2.x. where the x marks a feature release). The feature is normally removed in the 4th release after we announce the deprecation. For example, something deprecated in 2.10 will be removed in 2.13. The tracking is tied to the number of releases, not the release numbering itself. Although this is the standard, there are times where a deprecation cycle for a feature or behavior may have a longer or shorter deprecation cycle based on use or urgency of removal. Unintended or undocumented functionality may be removed without a deprecation cycle. In this context, unintended functionality refers specifically to emergent features that occur outside the release roadmap.</p> <div class="admonition seealso"> <p class="admonition-title">See also</p> <dl class="simple"> <dt><a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/committer_guidelines.html#community-committer-guidelines"><span class="std std-ref">Committers Guidelines</span></a></dt>
