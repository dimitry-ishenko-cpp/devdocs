<section id="blocks"> <h1 id="playbooks-blocks">Blocks</h1> <p>Blocks create logical groups of tasks. Blocks also offer ways to handle task errors, similar to exception handling in many programming languages.</p>  <ul class="simple"> <li><a class="reference internal" href="#grouping-tasks-with-blocks" id="id7">Grouping tasks with blocks</a></li> <li><a class="reference internal" href="#handling-errors-with-blocks" id="id8">Handling errors with blocks</a></li> </ul>  <section id="grouping-tasks-with-blocks"> <h2>Grouping tasks with blocks</h2> <p>All tasks in a block inherit directives applied at the block level. Most of what you can apply to a single task (with the exception of loops) can be applied at the block level, so blocks make it much easier to set data or directives common to the tasks. The directive does not affect the block itself, it is only inherited by the tasks enclosed by a block. For example, a <code>when</code> statement is applied to the tasks within a block, not to the block itself.</p> <div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="id1"> <div class="code-block-caption"><span class="caption-text">Block example with named tasks inside the block</span></div> <pre data-language="YAML"> tasks:
   - name: Install, configure, and start Apache
     when: ansible_facts['distribution'] == 'CentOS'

</pre> </div> <p>In the example above, the ‘when’ condition will be evaluated before Ansible runs each of the three tasks in the block. All three tasks also inherit the privilege escalation directives, running as the root user. Finally, <code>ignore_errors: true</code> ensures that Ansible continues to execute the playbook even if some of the tasks fail.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>All tasks in a block, including the ones included through <code>include_role</code>, inherit directives applied at the block level.</p> </div> <p>Names for blocks have been available since Ansible 2.3. We recommend using names in all tasks, within blocks or elsewhere, for better visibility into the tasks being executed when you run the playbook.</p> </section> <section id="handling-errors-with-blocks"> <h2 id="block-error-handling">Handling errors with blocks</h2> <p>You can control how Ansible responds to task errors using blocks with <code>rescue</code> and <code>always</code> sections.</p> <p>Rescue blocks specify tasks to run when an earlier task in a block fails. This approach is similar to exception handling in many programming languages. Ansible only runs rescue blocks after a task returns a ‘failed’ state. Bad task definitions and unreachable hosts will not trigger the rescue block.</p> <div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="id2"> <div class="code-block-caption" id="block-rescue"><span class="caption-text">Block error handling example</span></div> <pre data-language="YAML"> tasks:
