<h1>Deferred Request Callbacks</h1> <p>One of the design principles of Flask is that response objects are created and passed down a chain of potential callbacks that can modify them or replace them. When the request handling starts, there is no response object yet. It is created as necessary either by a view function or by some other component in the system.</p> <p>What happens if you want to modify the response at a point where the response does not exist yet? A common example for that would be a <a class="reference internal" href="../../api/index.html#flask.Flask.before_request" title="flask.Flask.before_request"><code>before_request()</code></a> callback that wants to set a cookie on the response object.</p> <p>One way is to avoid the situation. Very often that is possible. For instance you can try to move that logic into a <a class="reference internal" href="../../api/index.html#flask.Flask.after_request" title="flask.Flask.after_request"><code>after_request()</code></a> callback instead. However, sometimes moving code there makes it more complicated or awkward to reason about.</p> <p>As an alternative, you can use <a class="reference internal" href="../../api/index.html#flask.after_this_request" title="flask.after_this_request"><code>after_this_request()</code></a> to register callbacks that will execute after only the current request. This way you can defer code execution from anywhere in the application, based on the current request.</p> <p>At any time during a request, we can register a function to be called at the end of the request. For example you can remember the current language of the user in a cookie in a <a class="reference internal" href="../../api/index.html#flask.Flask.before_request" title="flask.Flask.before_request"><code>before_request()</code></a> callback:</p> <pre data-language="python">from flask import request, after_this_request

@app.before_request
def detect_user_language():
    language = request.cookies.get('user_lang')

    if language is None:
        language = guess_language_from_request()

        # when the response exists, set a cookie with the language
        @after_this_request
        def remember_language(response):
            response.set_cookie('user_lang', language)
            return response

    g.language = language
