<h1>Caching</h1> <p>When your application runs slow, throw some caches in. Well, at least itâ€™s the easiest way to speed up things. What does a cache do? Say you have a function that takes some time to complete but the results would still be good enough if they were 5 minutes old. So then the idea is that you actually put the result of that calculation into a cache for some time.</p> <p>Flask itself does not provide caching for you, but <a class="reference external" href="https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Flask-Caching</a>, an extension for Flask does. Flask-Caching supports various backends, and it is even possible to develop your own caching backend.</p><div class="_attribution">
