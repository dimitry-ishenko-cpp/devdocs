<h1>Working with Passwords 
</h1>
<p>Most developers know that passwords cannot be stored in plain text, but many developers believe it's still safe to hash passwords using <code>md5</code> or <code>sha1</code>. There was a time when using the aforementioned hashing algorithms was sufficient, but modern hardware makes it possible to reverse such hashes and even stronger ones very quickly using brute force attacks.</p> <p>In order to provide increased security for user passwords, even in the worst case scenario (your application is breached), you need to use a hashing algorithm that is resilient against brute force attacks. The best current choice is <code>bcrypt</code>. In PHP, you can create a <code>bcrypt</code> hash using the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php">crypt function</a>. Yii provides two helper functions which make using <code>crypt</code> to securely generate and verify hashes easier.</p> <p>When a user provides a password for the first time (e.g., upon registration), the password needs to be hashed:</p> <pre data-language="php">$hash = Yii::$app-&gt;getSecurity()-&gt;generatePasswordHash($password);
</pre> <p>The hash can then be associated with the corresponding model attribute, so it can be stored in the database for later use.</p> <p>When a user attempts to log in, the submitted password must be verified against the previously hashed and stored password:</p> <pre data-language="php">if (Yii::$app-&gt;getSecurity()-&gt;validatePassword($password, $hash)) {
    // all good, logging user in
} else {
    // wrong password
}
</pre> <div class="_attribution">
