<h1 class="title">Overview</h1>  <p>We designed DuckDB to be easy to deploy and operate. We believe that most users do not need to consult the pages of the operations manual. However, there are certain setups – e.g., when DuckDB is running in mission-critical infrastructure – where we would like to offer advice on how to configure DuckDB. The operations manual contains advice for these cases and also offers convenient configuration snippets such as Gitignore files.</p> <p>For advice on getting the best performance from DuckDB, see also the <a href="../guides/performance/overview.html">Performance Guide</a>.</p> <div> <h2 id="pages-in-this-section">Pages in This Section</h2> </div><div class="_attribution">
