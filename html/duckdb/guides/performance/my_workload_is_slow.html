<h1 class="title">My Workload Is Slow</h1>  <p>If you find that your workload in DuckDB is slow, we recommend performing the following checks. More detailed instructions are linked for each point.</p> <ol> <li>Do you have enough memory? DuckDB works best if you have <a href="environment.html#cpu-and-memory.html">5-10 GB memory per CPU core</a>.</li> <li>Are you using a fast disk? Network-attached disks (such as cloud block storage) cause write-intenstive and<a href="how_to_tune_workloads.html#spilling-to-disk.html">larger than memory</a> workloads to slow down. For running such workloads in cloud environments, it is recommended to use instance-attached storage (NVMe SSDs).</li> <li>Are you using indexes or constraints (primary key, unique, etc.)? If possible, try <a href="schema.html#indexing.html">disabling them</a>, which boosts load and update performance.</li> <li>Are you using the correct types? For example, <a href="schema.html#types.html">use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TIMESTAMP</code> to encode datetime values</a>.</li> <li>Are you reading from Parquet files? If so, do they have <a href="file_formats.html#the-effect-of-row-group-sizes.html">row group sizes between 100k and 1M</a> and file sizes between 100 MB to 10 GB?</li> <li>Does the query plan look right? Study it with <a href="how_to_tune_workloads.html#profiling.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXPLAIN</code></a>.</li> <li>Is the workload running <a href="how_to_tune_workloads.html#parallelism.html">in parallel</a>? Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">htop</code> or the operating system's task manager to observe this.</li> <li>Is DuckDB using too many threads? Try <a href="how_to_tune_workloads.html#parallelism-multi-core-processing.html">limiting the amount of threads</a>.</li> </ol> <p>Are you aware of other common issues?
