<h1 class="title">Multiple Connections</h1>  <p>For tests whose purpose is to verify that the transactional management or versioning of data works correctly, it is generally necessary to use multiple connections. For example, if we want to verify that the creation of tables is correctly transactional, we might want to start a transaction and create a table in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">con1</code>, then fire a query in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">con2</code> that checks that the table is not accessible yet until committed.</p> <p>We can use multiple connections in the sqllogictests using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connection labels</code>. The connection label can be optionally appended to any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">statement</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">query</code>. All queries with the same connection label will be executed in the same connection. A test that would verify the above property would look as follows:</p> <pre class="language-sql highlighter-rouge" data-language="sql">statement ok con1
BEGIN TRANSACTION

statement ok con1
CREATE TABLE integers (i INTEGER);

statement error con2
SELECT * FROM integers;</pre> <h2 id="concurrent-connections"> <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#concurrent-connections">Concurrent Connections</a> </h2> <p>Using connection modifiers on the statement and queries will result in testing of multiple connections, but all the queries will still be run <em>sequentially</em> on a single thread. If we want to run code from multiple connections <em>concurrently</em> over multiple threads, we can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">concurrentloop</code> construct. The queries in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">concurrentloop</code> will be run concurrently on separate threads at the same time.</p> <pre class="language-sql highlighter-rouge" data-language="sql">concurrentloop i 0 10

statement ok
CREATE TEMP TABLE t2 AS (SELECT 1);

statement ok
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (42);

statement ok
DELETE FROM t2

endloop</pre> <p>One caveat with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">concurrentloop</code> is that results are often unpredictable - as multiple clients can hammer the database at the same time we might end up with (expected) transaction conflicts. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">statement maybe</code> can be used to deal with these situations. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">statement maybe</code> essentially accepts both a success, and a failure with a specific error message.</p> <pre class="language-sql highlighter-rouge" data-language="sql">concurrentloop i 1 10

statement maybe
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE t2 AS (SELECT -54124033386577348004002656426531535114 FROM t2 LIMIT 70%);
