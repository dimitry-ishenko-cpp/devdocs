<h1 class="entry-title">pagebeforechange</h1> <div class="entry-content"> <article id="pagebeforechange1" class="entry event"><h2 class="section-title"> <span>pagebeforechange event</span><span class="version-details">version added: 1.0, deprecated: 1.4.3</span> </h2> <div class="entry-wrapper"> <p class="desc"><strong>Description: </strong>Triggered twice during the page change cyle: First prior to any page loading or transition and next after page loading completes successfully, but before the browser history has been modified by the navigation process.</p> <ul class="signatures"><li class="signature"><h4 class="name">jQuery( ".selector" ).on( "pagebeforechange", function( event ) { ... } )</h4></li></ul> <div class="longdesc" id="entry-longdesc"> <p>When received with <code>data.toPage</code> set to a string, the event indicates that navigation is about to commence. The value stored in <code>data.toPage</code> is the URL of the page that will be loaded.</p> <p>When received with <code>data.toPage</code> set to a jQuery object, the event indicates that the destination page has been loaded and navigation will continue.</p> <p>If the page change cycle was initiated programmatically, and, instead of a URL a jQuery object containing a page was given, then the event will be triggered both times with <code>data.toPage</code> set to the jQuery object containing the destination page.</p> <p>The pagebeforechange event is triggered either by explicit navigation on the part of the user (e.g. by clicking on a link or by running code that results in a call to the pagecontainer <code>change()</code> method), or by implicit navigation caused by the user clicking the browser's "Back" or "Forward" buttons.</p> <p>Explicit navigation results in both pagebeforechange events being triggered before a new entry is added to the browser's navigation history.</p> <p>Implicit navigation results in both pagebeforechange events being triggered after the browser's navigation history has been updated.</p> <p>In addition to the <code>event</code> parameter, handlers of this event will receive a second parameter, <code>data</code>. The second parameter is an object containing the following properties:</p> <ul> <li> <code>toPage</code> (object or string) <ul> <li>This property represents the page the caller wishes to make active. It can be either a jQuery collection object containing the page DOM element, or an absolute/relative url to an internal or external page. The value exactly matches the 1st arg to the changePage() call that triggered the event.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <code>options</code> (object) <ul> <li>This object contains the configuration options to be used for the current <code>changePage()</code> call.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>It should be noted that callbacks can modify both the <code>toPage</code> and <code>options</code> properties to alter the behavior of the current <code>changePage()</code> call. So for example, the <code>toPage</code> can be mapped to a different url from within a callback to do a sort of redirect.</p> <div class="warning"> <strong>Note:</strong> The triggering of this event is deprecated as of jQuery Mobile 1.4.3. It will no longer be triggered in 1.6.0. <p>The replacement for <code>pagebeforechange</code> is the <code><a href="pagecontainer.html">pagecontainer</a></code> widget's <code>pagecontainerbeforechange</code> event. In jQuery Mobile &gt;= 1.4.3, the two events are identical except for their name and the fact that <code>pagecontainerbeforechange</code> is triggered on the pagecontainer, whereas <code>pagebeforechange</code> is triggered on the page.</p> </div> </div> </div></article> </div><div class="_attribution">
