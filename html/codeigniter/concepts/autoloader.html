<h1 id="autoloading-files">Autoloading Files</h1> <p>Every application consists of a large number of classes in many different locations. The framework provides classes for core functionality. Your application will have a number of libraries, models, and other entities to make it work. You might have third-party classes that your project is using. Keeping track of where every single file is, and hard-coding that location into your files in a series of <code>requires()</code> is a massive headache and very error-prone. That’s where autoloaders come in.</p> <p>CodeIgniter provides a very flexible autoloader that can be used with very little configuration. It can locate individual non-namespaced classes, namespaced classes that adhere to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/">PSR4</a> autoloading directory structures, and will even attempt to locate classes in common directories (like Controllers, Models, etc).</p> <p>For performance improvement, the core CodeIgniter components have been added to the classmap.</p> <p>The autoloader works great by itself, but can also work with other autoloaders, like <a class="reference external" href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>, or even your own custom autoloaders, if needed. Because they’re all registered through <a class="reference external" href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.spl-autoload-register.php">spl_autoload_register</a>, they work in sequence and don’t get in each other’s way.</p> <p>The autoloader is always active, being registered with <code>spl_autoload_register()</code> at the beginning of the framework’s execution.</p>  <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2> <p>Initial configuration is done in <strong>/app/Config/Autoload.php</strong>. This file contains two primary arrays: one for the classmap, and one for PSR4-compatible namespaces.</p>   <h2 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h2> <p>The recommended method for organizing your classes is to create one or more namespaces for your application’s files. This is most important for any business-logic related classes, entity classes, etc. The <code>psr4</code> array in the configuration file allows you to map the namespace to the directory those classes can be found in:</p> <pre data-language="php">$psr4 = [
    'App'         =&gt; APPPATH,
    'CodeIgniter' =&gt; SYSTEMPATH,
];
</pre> <p>The key of each row is the namespace itself. This does not need a trailing slash. If you use double-quotes to define the array, be sure to escape the backward slash. That means that it would be <code>My\\App</code>, not <code>My\App</code>. The value is the location to the directory the classes can be found in. They should have a trailing slash.</p> <p>By default, the application folder is namespace to the <code>App</code> namespace. While you are not forced to namespace the controllers, libraries, or models in the application directory, if you do, they will be found under the <code>App</code> namespace. You may change this namespace by editing the <strong>/app/Config/Constants.php</strong> file and setting the new namespace value under the <code>APP_NAMESPACE</code> setting:</p> <pre data-language="php">define('APP_NAMESPACE', 'App');
</pre> <p>You will need to modify any existing files that are referencing the current namespace.</p> <div class="admonition important"> <p class="first admonition-title">Important</p> <p class="last">Config files are namespaced in the <code>Config</code> namespace, not in <code>App\Config</code> as you might expect. This allows the core system files to always be able to locate them, even when the application namespace has changed.</p> </div>   <h2 id="classmap">Classmap</h2> <p>The classmap is used extensively by CodeIgniter to eke the last ounces of performance out of the system by not hitting the file-system with extra <code>is_file()</code> calls. You can use the classmap to link to third-party libraries that are not namespaced:</p> <pre data-language="php">$classmap = [
    'Markdown' =&gt; APPPATH . 'third_party/markdown.php'
];
</pre> <p>The key of each row is the name of the class that you want to locate. The value is the path to locate it at.</p>   <h2 id="composer-support">Composer Support</h2> <p>Composer support is automatically initialized by default. By default, it looks for Composer’s autoload file at <code>ROOTPATH . 'vendor/autoload.php'</code>. If you need to change the location of that file for any reason, you can modify the value defined in <code>Config\Constants.php</code>.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">If the same namespace is defined in both CodeIgniter and Composer, CodeIgniter’s autoloader will be the first one to get a chance to locate the file.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
