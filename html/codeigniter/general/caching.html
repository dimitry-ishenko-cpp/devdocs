<h1 id="web-page-caching">Web Page Caching</h1> <p>CodeIgniter lets you cache your pages in order to achieve maximum performance.</p> <p>Although CodeIgniter is quite fast, the amount of dynamic information you display in your pages will correlate directly to the server resources, memory, and processing cycles utilized, which affect your page load speeds. By caching your pages, since they are saved in their fully rendered state, you can achieve performance much closer to that of static web pages.</p>  <h2 id="how-does-caching-work">How Does Caching Work?</h2> <p>Caching can be enabled on a per-page basis, and you can set the length of time that a page should remain cached before being refreshed. When a page is loaded for the first time, the file will be cached using the currently configured cache engine. On subsequent page loads, the cache file will be retrieved and sent to the requesting userâ€™s browser. If it has expired, it will be deleted and refreshed before being sent to the browser.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">The Benchmark tag is not cached so you can still view your page load speed when caching is enabled.</p> </div>   <h2 id="enabling-caching">Enabling Caching</h2> <p>To enable caching, put the following tag in any of your controller methods:</p> <pre data-language="php">$this-&gt;cachePage($n);
</pre> <p>Where <code>$n</code> is the number of <strong>seconds</strong> you wish the page to remain cached between refreshes.</p> <p>The above tag can go anywhere within a method. It is not affected by the order that it appears, so place it wherever it seems most logical to you. Once the tag is in place, your pages will begin being cached.</p> <div class="admonition important"> <p class="first admonition-title">Important</p> <p class="last">If you change configuration options that might affect your output, you have to manually delete your cache files.</p> </div> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">Before the cache files can be written you must set the cache engine up by editing <strong>app/Config/Cache.php</strong>.</p> </div>   <h2 id="deleting-caches">Deleting Caches</h2> <p>If you no longer wish to cache a file you can remove the caching tag and it will no longer be refreshed when it expires.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">Removing the tag will not delete the cache immediately. It will have to expire normally.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
