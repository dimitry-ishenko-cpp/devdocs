<h1 id="managing-your-applications">Managing your Applications</h1> <p>By default, it is assumed that you only intend to use CodeIgniter to manage one application, which you will build in your <strong>application</strong> directory. It is possible, however, to have multiple sets of applications that share a single CodeIgniter installation, or even to rename or relocate your application directory.</p>  <h2 id="renaming-or-relocating-the-application-directory">Renaming or Relocating the Application Directory</h2> <p>If you would like to rename your application directory or even move it to a different location on your server, other than your project root, open your main <strong>app/Config/Paths.php</strong> and set a <em>full server path</em> in the <code>$appDirectory</code> variable (at about line 45):</p> <pre data-language="php">public $appDirectory = '/path/to/your/application';
</pre> <p>You will need to modify two additional files in your project root, so that they can find the <code>Paths</code> configuration file:</p> <ul> <li>
<p class="first"><code>/spark</code> runs command line apps; the path is specified on or about line 36:</p> <pre data-language="php">$pathsConfig = 'app/Config/Paths.php';
// ^^^ Change this line if you move your application folder
</pre> </li> <li>
<p class="first"><code>/public/index.php</code> is the front controller for your webapp; the config path is specified on or about line 20:</p> <pre data-language="php">$pathsConfig = FCPATH . '../app/Config/Paths.php';
// ^^^ Change this if you move your application folder
</pre> </li> </ul>   <h2 id="running-multiple-applications-with-one-codeigniter-installation">Running Multiple Applications with one CodeIgniter Installation</h2> <p>If you would like to share a common CodeIgniter framework installation, to manage several different applications, simply put all of the directories located inside your application directory into their own (sub)-directory.</p> <p>For example, let’s say you want to create two applications, named “foo” and “bar”. You could structure your application project directories like this:</p> <pre data-language="text">/foo
    /app
    /public
    /tests
    /writable
/bar
    /app
    /public
    /tests
    /writable
/codeigniter
    /system
    /docs
</pre> <p>This would have two apps, “foo” and “bar”, both having standard application directories and a <code>public</code> folder, and sharing a common codeigniter framework.</p> <p>The <code>index.php</code> inside each application would refer to its own configuration, <code>../app/Config/Paths.php</code>, and the <code>$systemDirectory</code> variable inside each of those would be set to refer to the shared common “system” folder.</p> <p>If either of the applications had a command-line component, then you would also modify <code>spark</code> inside each application’s project folder, as directed above.</p><div class="_attribution">
