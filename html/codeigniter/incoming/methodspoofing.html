<h1 id="http-method-spoofing">HTTP Method Spoofing</h1> <p>When working with HTML forms you can only use GET or POST HTTP verbs. In most cases, this is just fine. However, to support REST-ful routing you need to support other, more correct, verbs, like DELETE or PUT. Since the browsers don’t support this, CodeIgniter provides you with a way to spoof the method that is being used. This allows you to make a POST request, but tell the application that it should be treated as a different request type.</p> <p>To spoof the method, a hidden input is added to the form with the name of <code>_method</code>. It’s value is the HTTP verb that you want the request to be:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;form action="" method="post"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PUT" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre> <p>This form is converted into a PUT request and is a true PUT request as far as the routing and the IncomingRequest class are concerned.</p> <p>The form that you are using must be a POST request. GET requests cannot be spoofed.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">Be sure to check your web server’s configuration as some servers do not support all HTTP verbs with the default configuration, and must have additional packages enabled to work.</p> </div><div class="_attribution">
