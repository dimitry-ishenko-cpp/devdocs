Layouts support sections of content that can be inserted from any view being rendered. You could create different layouts to support one-column, two-column, blog archive pages, and more. Layouts are never directly rendered. Instead, you render a view, which specifies the layout that it wants to extend.</p>  <h2 id="creating-a-layout">Creating A Layout</h2> <p>Layouts are views like any other. The only difference is their intended usage. Layouts are the only view files that would make use of the <code>renderSection()</code> method. This method acts as a placeholder for content.</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My Layout&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;?= $this-&gt;renderSection('content') ?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre> <p>The renderSection() method only has one argument - the name of the section. That way any child views know what to name the content section.</p>   <h2 id="using-layouts-in-views">Using Layouts in Views</h2> <p>Whenever a view wants to be inserted into a layout, it must use the <code>extend()</code> method at the top of the file:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?= $this-&gt;extend('default') ?&gt;
</pre> <p>The extend method takes the name of any view file that you wish to use. Since they are standard views, they will be located just like a view. By default, it will look in the application’s View directory, but will also scan other PSR-4 defined namespaces. You can include a namespace to locate the view in particular namespace View directory:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?= $this-&gt;extend('Blog\Views\default') ?&gt;
</pre> <p>All content within a view that extends a layout must be included within <code>section($name)</code> and <code>endSection()</code> method calls. Any content between these calls will be inserted into the layout wherever the <code>renderSection($name)</code> call that matches the section name exists.:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?= $this-&gt;extend('default') ?&gt;

&lt;?= $this-&gt;section('content') ?&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;?= $this-&gt;endSection() ?&gt;
</pre> <p>The <code>endSection()</code> does not need the section name. It automatically knows which one to close.</p> <p>Sections can contain nested sections:</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?= $this-&gt;extend('default') ?&gt;

&lt;?= $this-&gt;section('content') ?&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;?= $this-&gt;section('javascript') ?&gt;
       let a = 'a';
    &lt;?= $this-&gt;endSection() ?&gt;
&lt;?= $this-&gt;endSection() ?&gt;
</pre>   <h2 id="rendering-the-view">Rendering the View</h2> <p>Rendering the view and it’s layout is done exactly as any other view would be displayed within a controller:</p> <pre data-language="php">public function index()
{
    echo view('some_view');
}
</pre> <p>The renderer is smart enough to detect whether the view should be rendered on its own, or if it needs a layout.</p>   <h2 id="including-view-partials">Including View Partials</h2> <p>View partials are view files that do not extend any layout. They typically include content that can be reused from view to view. When using view layouts you must use <code>$this-&gt;include()</code> to include any view partials.</p> <pre data-language="php">&lt;?= $this-&gt;extend('default') ?&gt;

&lt;?= $this-&gt;section('content') ?&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;?= $this-&gt;include('sidebar') ?&gt;
&lt;?= $this-&gt;endSection() ?&gt;
</pre> <p>When calling the include() method, you can pass it all of the same options that can when rendering a normal view, including cache directives, etc.</p><div class="_attribution">
