<h1 id="credits">Credits</h1> <p>CodeIgniter was originally developed by <a class="reference external" href="https://ellislab.com/">EllisLab</a>. The framework was written for performance in the real world, with many of the original class libraries, helpers, and sub-systems borrowed from the code-base of <a class="reference external" href="https://expressionengine.com">ExpressionEngine</a>. It was, for years, developed and maintained by EllisLab, the ExpressionEngine Development Team and a group of community members called the Reactor Team.</p> <p>In 2014, CodeIgniter was acquired by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bcit.ca/">British Columbia Institute of Technology</a> and was then officially announced as a community-maintained project.</p> <p>In 2019, the CodeIgniter Foundation was formed to provide a perpetual managing group separate from any other entity to help ensure the frameworkâ€™s future.</p><div class="_attribution">
