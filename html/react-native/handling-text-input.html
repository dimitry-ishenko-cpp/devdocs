<h1>Handling Text Input</h1>
<p><a href="textinput.html#content"><code>TextInput</code></a> is a <a href="intro-react-native-components.html">Core Component</a> that allows the user to enter text. It has an <code>onChangeText</code> prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an <code>onSubmitEditing</code> prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï üçï".</p>
<p>In this example, we store <code>text</code> in the state, because it changes over time.</p>
<p>There are a lot more things you might want to do with a text input. For example, you could validate the text inside while the user types. For more detailed examples, see the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components" rel="noopener noreferrer">React docs on controlled components</a>, or the <a href="textinput.html">reference docs for TextInput</a>.</p>
<p>Text input is one of the ways the user interacts with the app. Next, let's look at another type of input and <a href="handling-touches.html">learn how to handle touches</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
