<h1>Props</h1>
<p>Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. These created parameters are called <code>props</code>, short for properties.</p>
<p>For example, one basic React Native component is the <code>Image</code>. When you create an image, you can use a prop named <code>source</code> to control what image it shows.</p>
<p>Notice the braces surrounding <code>{pic}</code> - these embed the variable <code>pic</code> into JSX. You can put any JavaScript expression inside braces in JSX.</p>
<p>Your own components can also use <code>props</code>. This lets you make a single component that is used in many different places in your app, with slightly different properties in each place by referring to <code>props</code> in your <code>render</code> function. Here's an example:</p>
<p>Using <code>name</code> as a prop lets us customize the <code>Greeting</code> component, so we can reuse that component for each of our greetings. This example also uses the <code>Greeting</code> component in JSX, similar to the <a href="intro-react-native-components.html">Core Components</a>. The power to do this is what makes React so cool - if you find yourself wishing that you had a different set of UI primitives to work with, you can invent new ones.</p>
<p>The other new thing going on here is the <a href="view.html"><code>View</code></a> component. A <a href="view.html"><code>View</code></a> is useful as a container for other components, to help control style and layout.</p>
<p>With <code>props</code> and the basic <a href="text.html"><code>Text</code></a>, <a href="image.html"><code>Image</code></a>, and <a href="view.html"><code>View</code></a> components, you can build a wide variety of static screens. To learn how to make your app change over time, you need to <a href="state.html">learn about State</a>.</p><div class="_attribution">
