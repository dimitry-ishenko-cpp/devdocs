If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts only until the end of the browser session (or equivalent). The maximum allowed value for TTL is one day.

The total capacity_scaler for all backends must be non-zero. A setting of 0 means the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available Capacity. Valid range is [0.0,1.0].</dd> <dt><code>description</code></dt> <dd>An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.</dd> <dt><code>failover</code></dt> <dd>This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More than one failover backend can be configured for a given RegionBackendService.</dd> <dt><code>group</code></dt> <dd>The fully-qualified URL of an Instance Group or Network Endpoint Group resource. In case of instance group this defines the list of instances that serve traffic. Member virtual machine instances from each instance group must live in the same zone as the instance group itself. No two backends in a backend service are allowed to use same Instance Group resource. For Network Endpoint Groups this defines list of endpoints. All endpoints of Network Endpoint Group must be hosted on instances located in the same zone as the Network Endpoint Group. Backend services cannot mix Instance Group and Network Endpoint Group backends. When the <code>load_balancing_scheme</code> is INTERNAL, only instance groups are supported. Note that you must specify an Instance Group or Network Endpoint Group resource using the fully-qualified URL, rather than a partial URL.</dd> <dt><code>max_connections</code></dt> <dd>The max number of simultaneous connections for the group. Can be used with either CONNECTION or UTILIZATION balancing modes. Cannot be set for INTERNAL backend services. For CONNECTION mode, either maxConnections or one of maxConnectionsPerInstance or maxConnectionsPerEndpoint, as appropriate for group type, must be set.</dd> <dt><code>max_connections_per_instance</code></dt> <dd>The max number of simultaneous connections that a single backend instance can handle.

Must be from 0 to 999,999,999 inclusive.</dd> </dl> </dd> <dt><code>max_requests_per_connection</code></dt> <dd>Maximum requests for a single backend connection. This parameter is respected by both the HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 implementations. If not specified, there is no limit. Setting this parameter to 1 will effectively disable keep alive.</dd> <dt><code>max_connections</code></dt> <dd>The maximum number of connections to the backend cluster.

This field specifies parameters that control consistent hashing. This field only applies when all of the following are true: <code>load_balancing_scheme</code> is set to INTERNAL_MANAGED, <code>protocol</code> is set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and <code>locality_lb_policy</code> is set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH</dd> <dt><code>http_cookie</code></dt> <dd>Hash is based on HTTP Cookie. This field describes a HTTP cookie that will be used as the hash key for the consistent hash load balancer. If the cookie is not present, it will be generated. This field is applicable if the sessionAffinity is set to HTTP_COOKIE. <dl> <dt><code>ttl</code></dt> <dd>Lifetime of the cookie. <dl> <dt><code>seconds</code></dt> <dd>Span of time at a resolution of a second.

Setting this to true has the following effect: connections to the old active pool are not drained. Connections to the new active pool use the timeout of 10 min (currently fixed). Setting to false has the following effect: both old and new connections will have a drain timeout of 10 min. This can be set to true only if the protocol is TCP. The default is false.</dd> <dt><code>drop_traffic_if_unhealthy</code></dt> <dd>This option is used only when no healthy VMs are detected in the primary and backup instance groups. When set to true, traffic is dropped. When set to false, new connections are sent across all VMs in the primary group. The default is false.</dd> <dt><code>failover_ratio</code></dt> <dd>The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. If the ratio of the healthy VMs in the primary backend is at or below this number, traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the failover backend. In case where ‘failoverRatio’ is not set or all the VMs in the backup backend are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the primary backend in the “force” mode, where traffic will be spread to the healthy VMs with the best effort, or to all VMs when no VM is healthy. This field is only used with l4 load balancing.</dd> </dl> </dd> <dt><code>fingerprint</code></dt> <dd>Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object.

The algorithm has the property that the addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests.</dd> <dt>RANDOM</dt> <dd>The load balancer selects a random healthy host.</dd> <dt>ORIGINAL_DESTINATION</dt> <dd>Backend host is selected based on the client connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection was redirected to the load balancer.</dd> <dt>MAGLEV</dt> <dd>used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection times.

This field is applicable only when the <code>load_balancing_scheme</code> is set to INTERNAL_MANAGED and the <code>protocol</code> is set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2. <dl> <dt><code>base_ejection_time</code></dt> <dd>The base time that a host is ejected for. The real time is equal to the base time multiplied by the number of times the host has been ejected.

Defaults to 100.</dd> <dt><code>success_rate_stdev_factor</code></dt> <dd>This factor is used to determine the ejection threshold for success rate outlier ejection. The ejection threshold is the difference between the mean success rate, and the product of this factor and the standard deviation of the mean success rate: mean - (stdev * success_rate_stdev_factor).

Defaults to 1900.</dd> </dl> </dd> <dt><code>port_name</code></dt> <dd>A named port on a backend instance group representing the port for communication to the backend VMs in that group. Required when the loadBalancingScheme is EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED and the backends are instance groups. The named port must be defined on each backend instance group.
