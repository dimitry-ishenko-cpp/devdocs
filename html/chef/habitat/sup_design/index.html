These topics are for advanced users. It is not necessary to learn these concepts in order to use Chef Habitat.</p> <p>The Chef Habitat Supervisor is similar in some ways to well-known process supervisors like <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a>, <a href="http://smarden.org/runit/">runit</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Management_Facility">smf</a>. It accepts and passes POSIX signals to its child processes, restarts child processes if and when they fail, ensures that children processes terminate cleanly, and so on.</p> <p>Because the basic functionality of process supervision is well-known, this document does not discuss those details. Instead, this document focuses strictly on the internals of the feature that makes the Chef Habitat Supervisor special: the fact that each Supervisor is connected to others in a peer-to-peer network which we refer to as a <em>ring</em>. This allows Supervisors to share configuration data with one another and adapt to changing conditions in the ring by modifying their own configuration.</p> <h2 id="important-terms">Important Terms</h2> <dl> <dt>Members</dt> <dd>The Butterfly keeps track of “members”; each Chef Habitat Supervisor is a single member.</dd> <dt>Peer</dt> <dd>All the members a given member is connected to are its “peers”.

Instead, this document focuses strictly on the internals of the feature that makes the Chef Habitat Supervisor special: the fact that each Supervisor is connected to others in a peer-to-peer network which we refer to as a <em>ring</em>. This allows Supervisors to share configuration data with one another and adapt to changing conditions in the ring by modifying their own configuration.</p> <h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2> <p>Supervisors are configured to form a network by using the <code>--peer</code> argument and pointing them at peers that already exist. In a real-life deployment scenario, Supervisors in a network may also have a shared encryption key, so that inter-Supervisor traffic is encrypted. (See the <a href="../keys/index.html">security</a> documentation for more details.)</p> <p>Supervisor rings can be very large, comprising thousands of supervisors. The Supervisor communication protocol is low-bandwidth and designed to not interfere with your application’s actual production traffic.</p> <p>Rings are divided into <em>service groups</em>, each of which has a name. All Supervisors within a service group share the same configuration and topology.</p> <h3 id="butterfly">Butterfly</h3> <p>Chef Habitat uses a gossip protocol named “Butterfly”. This protocol provides failure detection, service discovery, and leader election to the Chef Habitat Supervisor.</p> <p>Butterfly is an eventually consistent system - it says, with a very high degree of probability, that a given piece of information will be received by every member of the network. It makes no guarantees as to when that state will arrive; in practice, the answer is usually “quite quickly”.</p> <h3 id="transport-protocols">Transport Protocols</h3> <p>Supervisors communicate with each other using UDP and TCP, both using port 9638.</p> <h3 id="information-security">Information Security</h3> <p>Butterfly encrypts traffic on the wire using Curve25519 and a symmetric key. If a ring is configured to use transport level encryption, only members with a matching key are allowed to communicate.</p> <p>Service Configuration and Files can both be encrypted with public keys.</p> <h3 id="membership-and-failure-detection">Membership and Failure Detection</h3> <p>Butterfly servers keep track of what members are present in a ring, and are constantly checking each other for failure.</p> <h4 id="health-states">Health States</h4> <p>Ring members have one of four health states:</p> <dl> <dt>Alive</dt> <dd>This member is responding to health checks.</dd> <dt>Suspect</dt> <dd>This member has stopped responding to our health check, and will be marked confirmed if we do not receive proof it is still alive soon.</dd> <dt>Confirmed</dt> <dd>This member has been un-responsive long enough that we can cease attempting to check its health.</dd> <dt>Departed</dt> <dd>This member has been intentionally kicked out of the ring for behavior unbecoming of a Supervisor, and is prevented from rejoining. This is accomplished with <code>hab</code> CLI commands.</dd> </dl> <h4 id="failure-detection">Failure Detection</h4> <p>The essential flow for detecting a failure is:</p> <ol> <li>Randomize the list of all known members who are not Confirmed or Departed.</li> <li>Every 3.1 seconds, pop a member off the list, and send it a “PING” message.</li> <li>If we receive an “ACK” message before 1 second elapses, the member remains Alive.</li> <li>If we do not receive an “ACK” in 1 second, choose 5 peers (the “PINGREQ targets”), and send them a “PINGREQ(member)” message for the member who failed the PING.</li> <li>If any of our PINGREQ targets receive an ACK, they forward it to us, and the member remains Alive.</li> <li>If we do not receive an ACK via PINGREQ with 2.1 seconds, we mark the member as Suspect, and set an expiration timer of 9.3 seconds.</li> <li>If we do not receive an Alive status for the member within the 9.3 second suspicion expiration window, the member is marked as Confirmed.</li> <li>Move on to the next member, until the list is exhausted; start the process again.</li> </ol> <p>When a Supervisor sends the PING, ACK and PINGREQ messages, it includes information about the 5 most recent members. This enables membership to be gossiped through the failure protocol itself.</p> <p>This process provides several nice attributes:</p> <ul> <li>It is resilient to partial network partitions.</li> <li>Due to the expiration of suspected members, confirmation of death spreads quickly.</li> <li>The amount of network traffic generated by a given node is constant, regardless of network size.</li> <li>The protocol uses single UDP packets which fit within 512 bytes.</li> </ul> <h3 id="gossip">Gossip</h3> <p>Butterfly uses ZeroMQ to disseminate rumors throughout the network. Its flow:</p> <ul> <li>Randomize the list of all known members who are not Confirmed dead.</li> <li>Every second, take 5 members from the list.</li> <li>Send each member every rumor that has a Heat lower than 3; update the heat for each rumor sent.</li> <li>When the list is exhausted, start the loop again.</li> </ul> <p>Whats good about this system:</p> <ul> <li>ZeroMQ provides a scalable PULL socket, that processes incoming messages from multiple peers as a single fair-queue.</li> <li>It has no back-chatter - messages are PUSH-ed to members, but require no receipt acknowledgement.</li> <li>Messages are sent over TCP, giving them some durability guarantees.</li> <li>In common use, the gossip protocol becomes inactive; if there are no rumors to send to a given member, nothing is sent.</li> </ul> <h2 id="butterfly-and-swim">Butterfly and SWIM</h2> <p>The Butterfly protocol is a variant of <a href="https://prakhar.me/articles/swim">SWIM</a> for membership and failure detection (over UDP), and a ZeroMQ based variant of <a href="https://www.cs.unibo.it/bison/publications/ap2pc03.pdf">Newscast</a> for gossip. Butterfly differs from SWIM in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>Rather than sending messages to update member state, we send the entire member.</li> <li>We support encryption on the wire.</li> <li>Payloads are protocol buffers.</li> <li>We support “persistent” members - these are members who will continue to have the failure detection protocol run against them, even if they are confirmed dead. This enables the system to heal from long-lived total partitions.</li> <li>Members who are confirmed dead, but who later receive a membership rumor about themselves being suspected or confirmed, respond by spreading an Alive rumor with a higher incarnation. This allows members who return from a partition to re-join the ring gracefully.</li> </ul> <h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3> <ul> <li>
